			<div class="markdown"><p>I would not say energy storage is the biggest problem. Sure, if you're going to have to drive between points far away <em>with no refueling stations in between</em>, it will be a problem, but I have a motorcycle, and it has a shorter range than all Teslas (okay, Teslas are expensive, but due to a lot more than just being EVs. They are luxury cars) and I can still go anywhere with it.</p>
<p>You are, of course, correct in that gasoline does store more energy in a smaller volume (and a lower mass) than current batteries, but, as I said, I do not believe that is the biggest problem.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is recharging times. Most normal motorcycles have a range of about 300 km or less. This isn't a problem because it takes less than a minute to refuel (excluding time for payment etc). Same with conventional cars of course. But it takes hours to charge an EV. Tesla's superchargers are supposed to be fast, but it still takes at least half an hour or something. This is the real problem. I could very well manage with the range a Tesla has, if I could recharge it in a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>And neither am I saying that the range isn't a problem for anyone. It is most definitely a problem for some people, but I think a vast majority could manage with the range of a Tesla if they could be recharged in a couple of minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do agree with you and I usually make this point myself.  It is even something I have put some thought into.  The best solution for this that I have come up with is a standardized battery and a standardized process for removal/replacement that can all be done in under 5 minutes.  For larger vehicles they may require multiple batteries or a larger standardized battery.</p>
<p>This would have a couple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be similar to a traditional fill up (in time)</li>
<li>Replacing failing batteries would be handled by a company and not the individuals.</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, I'm a biker and an EV driver just for context. My bike will do around 300km and frankly after just 150km I'm very ready for a break so while I could fill it up in a few mins and be on my way again, I typically can't ride the thing for more than a few hours before I have to get off and stretch my legs. I'm sure there are more comfortable bikes but really it makes sense to take a significant break. This is exactly when an EV would be charging. My current EV has a crazy small battery by modern standards so can only cover 140km on a single charge but with our roads that can still take nearly two hours to do. If the battery was say twice as big the charging time wouldn't be terrible and I could drive for more than three hours comfortably before needing a break. Also, a full charge even on a fast charger can take a long time because the charging rate slows as the battery gets close to full so it is more efficient to charge to 80% and then get back out on the road. My car will do 100km at 100kph on 80% (average speed is usually less though so range is better than that) and it takes 20 mins to get to that so hopping along routes populated with fast chargers can be done and I've done 475km runs in our car. Again, a bigger battery would help but the recharging isn't a massive issue and it is good to stop for a bio-break, stretch and to grab a coffee.</p>
<p>The latest EVs are affordable and with Nissan now hitting 40kWh which is nearly double the size of my current battery the issue of range and recharging is largely gone for the vast majority of use cases. If a car (or bike) can travel for 3 hours+ and then needs 20 mins to recharge to do it again we're there except for people who absolutely must be able to fill up in a few mins. Heck, EVs have already been perfect cars for the last five years, people just need to get over the range thing and realise that they generally don't drive long distance and there are solutions (such as renting if range is needed) that work out much cheaper than insisting on owning a car that can do 500km+ on a single charge when you rarely actually need that. The thing with EVs is to buy the battery you need, not the one you want. Do that and they're very cheap to fuel, extremely reliable and great fun to drive. We plug ours in overnight when the battery gets low and it is ready to go again the following day so charging time is essentially zero anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.  Ignoring government rebates in the US, batteries right now are...perhaps good enough for local vehicles.  I think they will take off in Europe before the US for the same reason Smart Cars did as well.</p>
<p>Gasoline is just an amazingly balanced fuel with an entrenched history.  Something needs to be clearly better (or at least clearly better for a very significant niche market) before it loses a huge market share.</p>
<p>Edit: And by balanced I don't mean good for the environment.  It is not.  It's just practical for a personal vehicle, because we can't run nuclear/solar/wind on our car in a practical manner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fossils fuels in the last century reached their extreme prices because of their inherent utility: they pack a great deal of potential energy into an extremely efficient package. If we can but sidestep the 100-million-year production process, we can corner this market once again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add: those enormous ship engines that are 3 stories tall, run on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazut" target="_blank">mazut</a>. It's just a notch more liquid than asphalt. And in fact, to get it flow properly you have to actually heat it (I don't remember exactly, but it's in 80-120Â°C range), otherwise one can walk on it (although you won't be able to clean shoes from this stuff - ever). Then, it has to be routed by a series of centrifuges to get rid of everything that could jam injectors and get just exact blend for required properties, and only then they get pumped into the engine.</p>
<p>Many uninformed folks also claim that ships burn more fuel every second than x number of cars, and sea transport is absolute evil. Yeah, right. They burn great deal of fuel, sure, but when you have 60000+ HP engine, that is precisely tuned, constantly maintained, has filters for every point where exhaust travels, which have logged work time, works on constant load, with precise air/fuel mixture, uses clean, cooled and high-pressure air (turbo on ships is the size of small car, btw), it will have very high efficiency - much higher than any car could achieve.</p>
<p>Main differentiator on ecological load is mainly sulphur content in fuel - different countries/regions have different requirements here (if I remember correctly Europe and US have stricter norms here, while China is more lax here, allowing worse quality fuel).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electric cars could be &quot;refuelled&quot; in less time than gasoline powered ones if we took a cue from battery powered forklifts used in warehouses: swap the battery array.  Pull out the uncharged ones and load in a fully charged set.</p></div>		</li>
