			<div class="markdown"><p>Funnily enough, in 2006 NASA did a full investigation into the possibilities of using space lasers. Not for melting icecaps, but for sublimating bits of asteroids and comets so that the resultant 'jet' could be used to steer the object away from a collision course for Earth. Will need to track down the reference for that.</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry, it was 2007. Summary of the paper was to <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/171331main_NEO_report_march07.pdf" target="_blank">blow it up with nuclear weapons</a> (many different <em>ways</em> to blow it up with nuclear bombs, but that's the gist of it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that could be a Bond movie. Elon Musk-type figure builds a space laser under the guise of planetary protection but actually is redirecting asteroids into a collision course with Earth for some reason or another. Or a mining company that uses the gravitation from their mining robots to steer the asteroids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phobos is in a relatively tight(and fast) orbit(6000km), is made of some 10 trillion tonnes of rock that could be repurposed into whatever directed energy weapon you fancy.</p>
<p>Lets calculate a basic version of the Phobian orbital laser platform, as phobos have a semi-equatorial orbit we won't get a very good laser angle but on the other hand the atmospheric dispersion on mars isn't very heavy due to the thin atmosphere we can simply slice into the polar cap from the side. Or just use the laser to heat pole-sized colonies near the equatorial area(which arguably is better usage of a gigantic fractional terawatt class orbital lens or megalaser)</p>
<p>Numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Phobos have a radius of 11km. Lets simplify this to a not very complicated 11km radius circle of solar panels, facing the martian sun of 504W/m^2 around the clock(not really but for whatever shadow losses we get we could also compensate by expanding the solar panel area by building scaffolding on the ultra-low gravity environment of phobos)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This gives us 191 Gigawatt of solar energy as a raw number. PV and laser conversion losses would eat pretty heavily into this but lets assume future tech; or we could use some optic heliostat/prism setup and use normally reflected light instead of lasers, whichever have good enough focal capacity and low enough losses to make it viable.</p>
</li>
<li>Wikipedia suggests &quot; The south polar permanent cap is much smaller than the one in the north. It is 400 km in diameter, as compared to the 1100 km diameter of the northern cap.&quot;</li>
<li>Lets be lazy and assume perfectly circular poles, diameters as follows: south = 400km, north 1100km. </li>
<li>South polar illumination becomes 190W/m^2, this is close to the equatorial average and we could assume it melts in no time.</li>
<li>
<p>North pole illumination becomes 50mW/m^2. It's not going to melt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we make a colony 100km in diameter and can focus well enough we can push 6000W/m^2 towards it when Phobos is in the sky. This is comparable to the solar constant on Mercury; more than enough for a human settlement.</p>
</li>
<li>We could of course fluff up Phobos into a hollow shell of solar collectors and thus greatly expand the collection surface, this is relatively easy from a structural integrity point of view due to its low gravity; a concrete pillar 10 kilometers high isn't going to be a problem like on earth.</li>
</ul>
<p>tl;dr: Giant orbital lasers are enough for colony efforts, colossal orbital lasers are required for terraforming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>one wacky but kind of plausible idea;
<strong>park a relatively large asteroid at mars' Lagrange point</strong> (L1 point i think). drill a big hole through the center of the asteroid such that it looks like a donut. </p>
<p><strong>make sure its positioned</strong> such that the entirety of the sun's rays make it through the &quot;keyhole&quot; of the asteroid.</p>
<p><strong>stretch a big-ass UV shield over the center of the asteroid</strong> to make up for mars' lack of UV blocking in the early days of terraforming.</p>
<p>fill the remainder of the asteroid with nuclear reactors and enough copper wiring (possibly mined from the drilled out section of asteroid) <strong>to turn it into a giant torroidal magnet</strong>. the asteroid's EM field must be powerful enough to create a magnetic &quot;umbrella&quot; for mars. </p>
<p>VIOLA; a nice big artificial magnetic field for a planet with a dead core</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had also been under the assumption that a magnetic field would be required to retain the atmosphere, however other comments in this thread have convinced me that this would be a very long-duration process; on the order of a million years. This is long enough that we can prepare another idea to deal with it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read other places the magnetic field isn't a requirement for maintaining an atmosphere except on rather large time scales. The low gravity of mars is a bigger factor. The release of CO2 would create an atmosphere; I guess from there you would try to convert some CO2 to O2 but I have not Idea how difficult that is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think retaining the atmosphere is what the question is about.  Earth's magnetic field filters out a lot of cosmic radiation.  Since Mars doesn't really have that, how could people live there (at least outside of domes, etc)?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if we had a plan to stimulate the atmosphere into becoming breathable, wouldn't the lack of a meaningful Martian magnetosphere mean it would just be ripped away by solar winds?</p>
<p>IIRC Thats the main reason we speculate the atmosphere is so thin and dry now.</p></div>		</li>
