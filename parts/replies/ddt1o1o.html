			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. It's not the length that's important but the total surface area of the airfoil. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh...they're both right, although the two quantities tend towards mutual exclusion. As with many, many things in aerospace, it tends to be a problem of optimization and balancing, rather than picking one quantity and maximizing it at the loss of everything else.</p>
<p>So in this case, assuming you have a wing or blade of FIXED surface area, longer and thinner profiles are more aerodynamically efficient. This is why gliders, for example, have such long and thin wings, whereas aircraft that aren't required to be so efficient, such as fighters, tend to have thicker, stubbier wings that focus on maneuverability. Airlines tend to fall somewhere between these two extremes.</p>
<p>Of course, on a propeller or a rotor, tip speed as you correctly pointed out, is also a constraint - for every rotor configuration, there is a given efficiency curve, and as tip speed approaches Mach 1, this tends to drop off. The key to remember about this problem is that you typically can determine the max rotor speed, which determines your max tip speed, which determines the max blade length. So with that quantity, you can then size the rotor and check if it produces enough lift for your aircraft weight. It's an iterative problem - there's no way that you can determine the correct answer first time you do the calculation through analysis alone, but you can take the answer you get and plug it back in the start of the design cycle, until you converge on an acceptable design solution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this reduces efficiency at speeds below that point, it simply lowers the maximum speed and performance before you run into serious performance/efficiency/safety problems. So they are still efficient, but with limited capabilities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Off the top of my head the closest thing the Japanese had was the Kayaba_Ka-1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayaba_Ka-1" target="_blank">wiki</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EFt7cLCRSY" target="_blank">video</a> which is an autogyro so most likely not. But the technology was still in its infancy and not wide spread so I don't think most people most people would know what they were.</p>
<p>A quick google search found this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rotorcraft_used_in_World_War_II" target="_blank">wiki list</a> that shows several countries had rotorcraft during WWII but again the use was very limited. </p></div>		</li>
