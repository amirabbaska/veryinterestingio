			<div class="markdown"><p>So would some small size text file take up several times as much space when written on a cd? And if that file is about as big as the CDâ€™s capacity, it is more susceptible to information loss from scratches?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I forgot to give the ratio. On CD the storage will have only 1 extra redundant byte for 3 byte of actual data (that's hard to explain the magic of how/why that works without explaining polynomials in finite fields). So it will indeed waste 25% of the CD storage capacity. But that is already accounted for in the total size of the CD (it is the total usable size). So even if it takes up all the total usable size, it will still be encoded with the error correcting code.</p>
<p>For text files it is possible to compress them then apply a second layer of redundant coding. They won't take less space (because the redundant coding will lose back the space gained by compressing) but they will be more resilient to errors.</p></div>		</li>
