			<div class="markdown"><p>Im one of those people who were wrongly imprisoned and eventually plead guilty (arson charges are tough, you can face years even as a minor). For over three months at 14, few days before christmas, I was thrown in juvie all because some arson investigator thought he knew exactly what happened by putting his ear to the ground like a fuckin navajo chief or whatever psuedo science they use... even though I called 911 AND managed to put it out myself before they even arrived. He came and interrogated me with a tape recorder while I was still in the hospital for smoke inhalation hooked up to an iv. He refused to believe what happened, insisting it was impossible based on the evidence etc and eventually coaxed me into saying some key phrases that would seal the deal. Im doing fine now but it really fucked up my highschool years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, yep. I get that everyone wants to make a name for themselves in their particular field, but this shouldn't be the case when it's someone else's life on the line. Wouldn't surprise me if this guy believed what he was saying, he probably wanted to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind of the slimy relationship between arson prosecutions and insurance companies.  If someone, ANYONE, is convicted of arson, the property insurance policy on the home doesn't have to pay out.  Not one cent.</p>
<p>So a powerful incentive for prosecution &quot;experts&quot; to look for and find arson in every case.  Can the defense always or even usually prove that the insurers meddled in the case under the table?  No, but the investigators who find arson 100% of the time in criminal trials also work in private practice for insurance companies, and they find arson 100% of the time there too.  So they know what side their bread is buttered on.  Mmm, butter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree this is important, there are some fire investigators who are very legitimate and professional. I have worked with some that specifically followed the correct guidelines and rules that they could not conclude what started the fire because that's how it often works (or should at least). Of course, the insurance company and police department then brought in someone else, but that's another story...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, lawyeredd - I have worked with some very professional arson investigtors, and it's from within that very profession that the new guidelines came, refuting the former mythological claptrap that passed for science. </p>
<p>But as you said, the insurers/prosecutors will just keep bringing in another analyst until they get the result they want and will pay for. </p></div>		</li>

<p>First thing that came to mind was how  Cameron Todd Willingham was tried and executed in Texas for allegedly intentionally setting fire to his home and killing his kids. Prosecutors alleged that he did not attempt to rescue his kids.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Willingham, who was twenty-three years old and powerfully built, ran to see her, then suddenly headed toward the babies’ room. Monaghan and another man restrained him. “We had to wrestle with him and then handcuff him, for his and our protection,” Monaghan later told police.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For more recent examples, look at the cases of Ed Graf, who got a new trial but ended up pleading guilty because it would mean no jail time. Or Rhonda Orr, who is still in prison. Both were convicted based on fire investigation techniques that are completely debunked now. In Orr's case, the original fire investigator even said he could not conclude it was arson so the police brought in a new fire investigator who would say it. </p>
<p>Edit: Just wanted to add Douglas Boyington to the list of names. I could not think of his name for the life of me earlier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sat in on the Graf case. Literally unbelievable. The only thing the prosecution could prove was that Graf was at his house, at the day and time the fire started. </p>
<p>He was retried cause of the bogus arson testimony, and in closing the glorious DA told the jury the reason he didn't bring in another fire expert was because he didn't need to, not that it was in fact horseshit.</p>
<p>I just cant even right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ed Graf's case has much more circumstantially incriminating evidence, in reading this case.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/08/ed_graf_arson_trial_texas_granted_him_a_new_trial_would_modern_forensic.html" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/08/ed_graf_arson_trial_texas_granted_him_a_new_trial_would_modern_forensic.html</a></p>
<p>ironically, his retrial came about because of how damning the articles reviewing Willingham's execution were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the &quot;Trial By Fire&quot; article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Willingham’s mother and father began to cry. “Don’t be sad, Momma,” Willingham said. “In fifty-five minutes, I’m a free man. I’m going home to see my kids.” Earlier, he had confessed to his parents that there was one thing about the day of the fire he had lied about. He said that he had never actually crawled into the children’s room. “I just didn’t want people to think I was a coward,” he said. Hurst told me, “People who have never been in a fire don’t understand why those who survive often can’t rescue the victims. They have no concept of what a fire is like.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember being deeply affected by this the first time that I read it years ago.  This poor guy.</p></div>		</li>
