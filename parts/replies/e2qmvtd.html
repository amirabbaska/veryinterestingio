			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks! I quite like sciencealert, since they usually post articles about quite recent research and publications. Sometimes the headlines are a bit clickbaity, but in general their articles are informative and not too sensational. and they always refer to the source articles. </p>
<p>(they are a thousand times better than other &quot;science news outlets&quot; like IFL science)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question because I can't make a primary reply with a question. Does OP mean to ask why the solar activity has an 11 year cycle (or even a cycle in general), or specifically why that corresponds to a change in polarity with each cycle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know each sunspot takes part of the magnetic field to the other pole, reducing the field. They also act as pipes bringing fresh material from the surface back into the core. Which increases fusion.</p>
<p>I would look at it like an oscillation. If you plot it, it looks like a sine wave. The same as the output of a rotating generator on earth.</p></div>		</li>
