<p>I'd say in Finland the average is around 180, and that's quite enjoyable. Give or take some five to ten degrees around the magical 180 and you're set, the perfect temp for a sauna.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI: You are wrong. 180-190F is about average for a sauna but it can go much warmer than that. Not sure why anyone would even go to a room that is only 140F, that's not even a sauna, I'd get cold.</p></div>		</li>
