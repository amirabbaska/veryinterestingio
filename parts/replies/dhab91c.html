			<div class="markdown"><p>I probably go through 8 - 12 cards per year, sometimes less, sometimes more. </p>
<p>As far as credit score, my score has increased since I started using rewards this way. If you look at how credit scores work, and how credit card use affects your score, and you use your cards correctly, you'll not have to worry about lowering your score. </p>
<p>Basically, you have pay your full balance every month, don't use more than about 20 percent of your available credit at any time, and don't apply for too many cards at once. The negatives associated with opening a lot of cards (the drop because of new accounts, average age of account, and new inquiries) is less than the positives of using your cards wisely (the rise because of paying your bills on time and not having a high credit utilization ratio.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I applied and was accepted for a MasterCard black card last month, I find that this card isn't offering the best reward due to the new one coming out with no annual fee and 2.5% cash back. Are you saying it doesn't hurt your credit if I say, cancel the MasterCard (495 annual fee) and apply for another?
That's the only reason I haven't switched. </p>
<p>I was currently using Amex preferred because I was loving the 6% cash back on groceries. I was making about 1k a year or so on it. But only getting 1% on most other purchases makes me inclined to change. Plus they cap it off on how much rewards you can get, which then I decided to get another Amex (under my husbands name) and cycle them every six months to get another grand a year. </p>
<p>What's your favorite card for best rewards (not airline miles)? I spend about 6-10k a month on credit cards and pay off every month. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, you are able to do this because you have a lot of open credit cards.  Does it hurt your score more if you only use 2 cards at a time?</p></div>		</li>
