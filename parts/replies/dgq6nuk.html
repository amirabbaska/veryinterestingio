			<div class="markdown"><p>I have wondered all my life what this is called. I thought i was crazy or something when it happened. Hasnt happened since i was a kid.  Im 42 now and finally have an answer. When i was a kid, this would happen occasionally and i would get really freaked out about it. I remember waking my mom up and telling her everything was weird and i felt like a giant or everything else was much bigger than it should be. It definitely wasnt a psychedelic or trippy experience for me. It was terrible. I wonder if it is something to do with brain development at a certain age. I too was around 9 or 10. I imagine it as trying out a new camera lens zooming in and out so brain development, in that sense, is like the brain getting an upgrade and being tested/tried out. Maybe that sounds crazy too. Maybe it can be explained simply by being in a relaxed state and transitioning between awake and asleep or mental exhaustion and sleep deprivation. Im not a brainologist. Just trying to make sense of it now that i have a term for it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fuck me the last time I took shrooms like half an 8th and I was gone. I didnt see friends for 5 mins and it felt like forever I was so speedy and high that I stared out of a windshield (passenger) and imagined myself going through the glass and coming out the other side on top but like a small organism.</p></div>		</li>
