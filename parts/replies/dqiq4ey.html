			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically the correct answer (and I'm also baffled by the large number of downvotes; EDIT: at the time I posted this, it sat at -20). The lack of a critical point between the solid and liquid phases was argued in Landau's famous work on phase transitions on the basis of symmetry. In particular, solids break multiple symmetries at once (rotational and translational), and if you can only tune a few macroscopic variables like temperature or pressure, you cannot smoothly interpolate between the two phases, nor can you even tune to a critical point where the correlation length can diverge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know why this is so down voted.... There is no symmetry breaking between liquid and gas, but there is between  solid and liquid/gas. </p></div>		</li>
