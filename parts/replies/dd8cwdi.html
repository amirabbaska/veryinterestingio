<p>You get the full year's worth of radiation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't it be a lot more? If I get hit by distant starlight, I don't care much. If I get hit by starlight that's blue-shifted into gamma-rays - that's not very healthy.</p>
<p>So the physiological effects should be a lot more than just the accumulation of the year's worth of radiation.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's a cool video by Carl Sagan which should answer many questions I got:

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if the CMB gets blueshifted and you actually end up absorbing far more than a year's worth of radiation. Does the astronaut see the CMB blue-shift? If not, how does he explain absorbing more radiation than his frame of reference allows?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be a super layman understanding, but wouldn't it also equate to sitting still in a car and getting rained on vs driving and sort of scooping extra rain as you move at greater and greater speeds. I would think you would pick up a lot more radiation because of speed traveled vs just sitting still in space letting the radiation come to you </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body can heal itself from small doses of radiation. Receiving a large dose of radiation in a short period of time is the worst way to get exposure. A large exposure over a long time can be negligible, same as a small dose over a short period.</p>
<p>Radiation can break the DNA in the nuclei of cells and cause cell death. A small number of cell deaths over a long period of time and your body heals and replaces those cells without issue (in theory. There's always a chance of mutation where that DNA recombined incorrectly and the cell lives. This is now cancer. Obviously the more cells undergoing this process the greater risk of that happening) </p>
<p>At different short term dose thresholds the body undergoes effects ranging from redness of the skin to organ failure. There's also lifetime dose thresholds where the percent chance of effects like cancer dramatically uptick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno, the light in front of you gets blueshifted, but the light behind you gets redshifted very much. If you're travelling at 0.99c, light in front gets halved in wavelength right? and light behind gets doubled. Which results in more radiation being ionising?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Increasing the wavelength will never make something ionizing. Radiation is ionizing when it has enough energy per photon to knock electrons off of an atom. Since the energy per photon is inversely dependent to the wavelength, only decreasing the wavelength can increase the energy of the photon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is absurdly unlikely that two photons will combine to ionize an electron (in anything resembling normal levels of light). Thus, it must be from a single short wavelength photon. So spreading them out like this to make more short wavelength photons will make the light more harmful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting to point out that this length contraction and time dilation not contradicting each other is the sole reason why we have magnetic field. Magnetic field and electric field are the exact the same thing but observed differently in each frame of references.  Yup, magnetism is the byproduct of special relativity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The would be dependent on where in space you would be traveling. In our solar system the radiation is alot higher compared to between stars. Distance from the milkyway center also would be needed to take into account and best would probably be to travel in the space between galaxies. </p>
<p>If you look at the Cosmic Background radiation blueshifting enough to fry a spaceship, this was already answered before, turns out to be quite fast, 0.99999999999061 c:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: seeing the other answers, I'm probably wrong because of weird speed-of-light relativity I know nothing about.    </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome" target="_blank">Wikipedia/Acute Radiation Poisoning</a> suggests that you need 6 Gy to die from radiation in 1 hour. According to a nice picture on that same page, you catch about 300 mSv (same unit as Gy) on a half-year trip to Mars.  </p>
<p>So if you go back and forth between Earth and Mars 10 times in 1 hour, you'd die. Now, Mars and Earth have a a varying distance from each other, for obvious reasons. But let's say you do this when they're really close to each other. This seems to happen roughly every 2 years, and comes down to about 60 million km.  </p>
<p>1.2 billion km in 3600 seconds is about 333,333 km/sec, which is 1.1c, or 1.1 times the speed of light.  </p>
<p>This seems impossible, but for dying in under a day you only need roughly 1 Gy, and that's 0.2c (roughly) if you still want to catch it in one hour, or 'only' 0.01c if you spend all day in space. So watch your speed.</p>
<p>(caveat: this is all napkin math, and I have no experience in any of these fields beside general higher education maths and physics.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's actually much more complicated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you catch about 300 mSv (same unit as Gy) on a half-year trip to Mars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number in mSv is about right, but since it's mostly proton and alpha radiation (weighting factors of 2 and 20, respectively), the number in Gy must be different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But let's say you do this when they're really close to each other. This seems to happen roughly every 2 years, and comes down to about 60 million km.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 300 mSv figure above was actually calculated over an elliptical path which is much longer.</p>
<p>And those 300 mSv are caused by particles hitting you as they move much faster than your spacecraft. In OP's scenario, you'd be moving faster than the particles (only a fraction of them are faster than .5c). You'd actually be hitting plasma from the interplanetary medium which in your reference frame would be fast enough to become very harmful radiation. Numbers would be radically different.</p>
<p>Still I agree with the main idea, if you move fast enough you'll get radiation poisoning after a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably worth mentioning that the lethality of gamma rays is dependent on the internal structures irradiated. The spinal cord and bowl, for example, don't handle high doses well. With that being said, modern stereotatic  body radiation therapy  (SBRT) will deliver 10 Gy to 95%+ of the planning target in 15 to 25 min. </p></div>		</li>
