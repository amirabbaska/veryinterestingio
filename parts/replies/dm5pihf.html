			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a really tough call, but I think it's safe to say, given the critters that do well around humans, we're in for a future with a lot of pigeon and rat evolutionary experiments and very little elephant, tiger, and river dolphin evolution...since they'll all likely be extinct in the wild very shortly. - Matt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s very difficult to predict where evolution might lead populations in the future. It isn’t directional, and new traits/shifts in evolutionary pressures aren’t always what you might expect (example: the meteorite impacts at the end of the Age of Dinosaurs).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain things are pretty predictable (eg, if you expose bacteria to an antibiotic, they'll probably become resistant, things that live in water and swim quickly are likely to be torpedo shaped) but the broader sense is too chaotic to predict...it's basically telling the future.</p>
