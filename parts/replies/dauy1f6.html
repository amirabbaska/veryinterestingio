<p>I studied food science for a while, and the lab grown meat has one big flaw to it:  It's just meat!  Quality of meat is determined by many factors.  I believe the meat they tend to replicate is beef.  Beef needs marbling (distribution of fat) and other tissues to really get the flavor we enjoy in a good steak.</p>
<p>I recall the first lab-grown burger was cooked with a <strong>huge</strong> amount of butter for this reason.</p></div>		</li>
