<p>This is more or less true of every scientific theory.  Science is great at telling us the <em>what</em> and <em>how.</em>  But <em>why</em> isn't really something that is answerable scientifically.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://youtu.be/MO0r930Sn_8" target="_blank">this famous video</a> of Richard Feynman who goes into why science can't answer <em>why</em> questions in a satisfying way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your edit does not really state it in the right way. With turbulence, we know all of the underlying physics and we know the effects it has on large scale. The problem is that the systems are so large that we have not yet found a good derivation of the formulas that we found empirically for large systems.</p>
<p>We know that bottom and we know the top, but there is a hole in the middle which we can’t fill due to the complexity of the movements.</p>
<p>With quantum mechanics on the contrary, we can exactly calculate and derive every single step in the entire chain of events. However, some of the very basic principals of the subject, which we empirically know have to be true, and some of the results of our models and formulas, which can also be experimentally proven to be true, are so extremely weird and unfathomable, that our human brains simply cannot understand them well.</p>
<p>We live in a macroscopic world, where we assume everything to be clear and deterministic. We don’t want to hear that some physical events are completely based on chance. We don’t want particles to exist at multiple locations at once, until we interact with them and their wave function collapses. We don’t want two particles to be intrinsically entangled to each other, where they are both in a 50/50 superstate until we measure one of them. We don’t want space and time to be divided in extremely small but discrete packets, but yet it does (I think).</p>
<p>Understanding quantum mechanics on the very basic level is almost impossible, as we just don’t know why some things work the way they work. However, using these principals to make hard and useful calculations is very much in our power. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a good explanation by Richard Feynman for how statistics are used in physics, I can't find it but he said that when there is a dimension of uncertainty on a small scale, but that overall there is a tendency for the average of interactions to come out in a particular pattern, then we might observe mostly only those macro-scale patterns, but that the really rare small scale cases do lead to obvious things, such as the decay of radioactive materials. </p>
<p>When you deal with uncertainties you have to include a statistical approach at some point. If the fundamental interactions could be predicted then we wouldn't need it, but it seems they genuinely are unable to be predicted individually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re missing the point. When you create a computer simulation, it’s not feasible to do everything completely and correctly. You have to make simplifications and take a lot of shortcuts so things run fast. The real world doesn’t do this. But then we notice evidence in the real world that seems like shortcuts. That’s when we wonder if it is real or a simulation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a software engineer. I agree with /u/FishDawgX.</p>
<p>There are absolutely aspects of software that are modeled after life, intentionally or otherwise. The limitations OP is describing, however, where a computer simulation might use lower resolution/certainty algorithms to render/model things that aren't the immediate focus is almost certainly not one of them.</p>
<p>That behavior is deliberately implemented as a result of our inability to simulate and model reality as closely as we would like, due to storage and processing limitations. Those limitations exist (to the extent they do) as a result of human constructs with no apparent basis in physical laws, like encoding data in binary or language.</p>
<p>It is perfectly reasonable to see computer-simulation-like behavior such as the results of the double slit experiment and find that surprising without dismissing it as something that must have been unconsciously built into our computer systems.</p></div>		</li>
