<p>The car wash in Breaking Bad, the hotel/bar in Ozarks, and any restaurant are all examples where it is normal to get a lot of anonymous payments in cash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laundromats too, since the flow of money is usually in hard cash (coins), and it's basically impossible to estimate how much or how little a laundromat should be making unless you can estimate how often the washers and dryers are being used.  </p>
<p>Keep the cash flow at reasonable levels and no one will bat an eye.  If you have more money to launder, open up another cash based business and keep that cash based business's cash flow at a reasonable level.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That how businesses that face the public work. I have worked at 2 manufacturers, a non-profit, a online magazine and 2 software engineering firms and none of them had a dime in the building.  People buy stuff with checks and cards, these would be bad money laundering fronts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Jason Bateman plays the same character he always plays, but it works pretty well. It's the sort of scary story you could imagine of what would happen to you if you pissed off a drug cartel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand how Bateman was laundering money in Ozark.</p>
<p>All he was doing was spending large sums of money on reno and construction projects.  Spending lots of money out is not laundering, it's just spending.</p>
<p>The only exception was the strip club -- which is a business that brings in a lot of cash, allowing him to insert some of his ill-gotten cash into the till.</p>
<p>So Bateman's scheme in Ozark didn't make much sense to me ... but I could be missing something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spending isn’t just spendings it’s in the details.  </p>
<p>Think of it this way:
One of the connections who’s though another connection (and so on), owns the construction business.</p>
<p>Spending drug money on a drug/cartel owned construction company, which the endless construction never finishes, the money is being send back to the original owner as legal legitimate business expenses.</p>
<p>Heroin money&gt; useless construction (drug owned company)&gt; cash flow heavily funneled back to owner through high materials costs that they’re buying cheap (from a legit outside business)&gt; “up-selling” those materials back to Marty for more  endless “construction”</p>
<p>It’s about hiding the drug paper trail by masking it with a “legitimate” paper trail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, you have to pay taxes on illegally gained income as well -- this is why Capone got caught. The IRS doesn't particularly care if it was legally obtained or not.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, if you get caught and put on trial for your illegal activities that were &quot;earning&quot; you this money, your legal expenses defending yourself would be considered a qualifying business expense and can be deducted from your income.</p></div>		</li>
