<p>This is true, but this is not what fixed focal length means. The focal length is the &quot;zoominess&quot; of the lens. &quot;Focal length&quot; refers to the distance from an equivalent simple lens to the plane of focus (the sensor or film).</p>
<p>GoPros are very wide angle (I believe ~20mm equivalent) meaning they capture a lot of the scene, but it would be tough to shoot a movie like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they're even more than 20mm equivalent. I might be wrong, but I feel it's just as wide or wider than my 16-35mm lens on a full-frame camera.</p>
<p>Trivial difference anyways cause the wide angle is wiide on GoPro.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that mean they're both true? Do GoPros have a fixed focus <em>and</em> a fixed focal length (ie, zoom)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Atually kind of the opposite. They are designed to show things sharp wherever they are, so there's no need to focus. If you compare the depth of field of GoPro and a typical camera used for films, the film cameras often use a  much narrower depth of fiel <a href="https://library.creativecow.net/articles/terry_todd/depth_of_field_converters/gnome-dof.JPG" target="_blank">like this</a>. That narrow depth of field creates intimate mood and draws attention to certain subject. That is impossible with GoPros because their sensor is so small, and the advantage of this is that during action, like skateboarding and such things are not out of focus. If one were to film action like GoPro but with a camera with the narrow depth of field above, either the autofocus would be focusing on all the wrong things, or you would have to manuallu focus it all the time, which is not going to happen if you are base jumping on the alps while your skis are on fire and the camera is on your helmet.</p>
<p>EDIT: the difference with the depth of field is somewhat illustrated in <a href="http://digitalphotographylive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Depth-of-field-478x237.jpg" target="_blank">this too</a>. The left image is more typical for film cameras, and that has a very narrow depth of field. The right image is more typical to digital cameras with small sensors, and the whole image is much sharper.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've done this with a GoPro. I mounted it in a tent. While I was mounting it my face was super sharp but once my head was out of the way, the things I was trying to capture on the other side of the tent were blurry. I changed every setting I could find but nothing could get that stuff to be in focus. </p>
<p>It also makes sense given the target market for the camera. It's mostly used by people to show their POV or themselves close to the lens. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't had that issue with GoPro. You can also see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kImNtFVKp0" target="_blank">this video</a> that the view is in focus everywhere.</p>

<p>It's heavily used by people doing extreme sports, like snowboarding, parachuting and such where the environment and landscape around has a big part, so the camera has to be able to show distant subjects in focus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The GoPro's lens is very wide angle (arguably &quot;fish eye&quot;) with &quot;barrel distortion.&quot;  Distortion isn't inherently bad - it's part of a complex set of tradeoffs that are made when designing a lens.  You can build a similarly wide angle lens that has little or no distortion - a straight line like the vertical corner of a building would always be a straight line in the image no matter where it is in the lens' field of view - but even with today's digital lens design and amazing manufacturing that still requires a much larger lens, among other tradeoffs, and &quot;big&quot; is antithetical to the GoPro's overall design.</p>
<p>But... while I'm fine with the GoPro's fisheye lens, I just wish it was &quot;simple&quot; distortion - much more easily corrected in post processing.  Overall, a lens that can be very well corrected simply in post is the #1 thing I would like in the GoPro 5 (but that isn't likely to happen due to the cost/size/complexity tradeoffs.)</p></div>		</li>
