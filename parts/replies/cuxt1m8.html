			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused as to how this answers the question.  OP is getting the same amount of sleep - 8 hours.  The amount of time in one of his REM cycles shouldn't change just because he changes the time he falls asleep.  The sleepyti.me website linked by /u/UnfinishedProjects uses a 90 minute REM cycle which, I believe, is standard.</p>
<p>According to OP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to bed at 11 and woke up at 7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If he fell asleep immediately, then five REM cycles would be 6:30, and waking up at 7 would be 1/3 into the next REM cycle.  But most people don't fall asleep immediately unless they are dog-tired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I ordinarily go to bed at around 12;30-1 am and wake up around 9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, if he falls asleep immediately then here he is waking up 2/3 of the way through a REM cycle.  It may be that /u/Lumberfox is on the right track with his factors 1 and 3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your sleep cycles don't start ticking away like a metronome the minute you fall asleep. Sleep quality is very much influenced by the circadian cycle, which are initiated by a melatonin surge and center on the core body temperature minimum. Most people have a core minimum around 4 am. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Confirmed. I wake up easier on 5 hours of sleep than 7 when using this app. All due to the time I fall asleep in conjunction with the time I wake up according to this dudes website.</p></div>		</li>
