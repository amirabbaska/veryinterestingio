			<div class="markdown"><p>Further, For the last 100+ years, first the British and then the Pakistani governments have refused to provide substantive rule of law in the area, preferring to engage in collective punishment instead. Per the <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n18/owen-bennett-jones/across-the-durand-line" target="_blank">LRB</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Durand Line had a specific purpose, and governed British policy towards the Pashtuns. This was not an imperial heartland but a buffer zone and British administrative arrangements reflected this. Some British-controlled Pashtun areas were declared ‘settled’; others, close to the line, were designated ‘tribal’. The tribal elders were given subsidies and status: in return, they were expected to keep the peace and, crucially, to ensure the roads stayed open. And so the military objective of protecting the edge of the empire was achieved with minimum resources. Just in case the bribes were insufficient, the elders were further persuaded to co-operate by the Frontier Crimes Regulation, imposed in 1901. It had two crucial elements: first, people could be held indefinitely without charge; second, it allowed collective punishment, meaning that whole communities could be sanctioned for the crimes of one member.</p>
<p>s some British administrators realised at the time, the system entrenched tribal structures. It might have been thought that the birth of Pakistan in 1947 would transform the situation, with the new state making efforts to drag the tribal areas towards more regular constitutional arrangements. In fact little changed. Collective punishments against the families and communities of suspected miscreants are still handed down. The Pakistani officials who implement the system are still called political agents, just like their British forebears. Their powers remain sweeping and arbitrary. ‘Around here,’ a Khyber political agent once told me, ‘I am Allah’s deputy.’ On the Afghan side of the border, too, the central government has never been strong enough to break down tribal affiliations. On both sides of the Durand Line the result has been economically and socially disastrous – on the Pakistani side female illiteracy stands at more than 70 per cent. </p>

<p>Edit: And, per the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/12/16/why-the-pakistani-talibans-war-on-children-keeps-on-going/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[S]ince the 2001 U.S.-backed war in Afghanistan, which ousted the Afghan Taliban government, the militants have been forced into retreat and guerrilla war. Their designs on taking power look checked, but their insurgency is resilient. Terror attacks, suicide bombings and destabilizing strikes such as this school massacre have become the Taliban's signature in both countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The militants know they won't be able to strike at the heart of the military. They don't have the capacity. So they are going for soft targets,&quot; Pakistani security analyst Talat Masood, referring to the Pakistani Taliban, said in an interview with the news agency Agence France-Presse</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some scholars have suggested that the Durand Line was never intended to be a boundary demarcating sovereignty, but rather a line of control beyond which either side agreed not to interfere unless there were an expedient need to do so. Memoranda from British officials at the time of the Durand Agreement incline towards this view. Scholars suggest that the frontier agreement was not of the form of an &quot;executed clause&quot;, which usually caters for sovereign boundary demarcation and which cannot be unilaterally repudiated. Rather, they conjecture that it is of the form of an &quot;executory clause&quot;, similar to those pertaining to trade agreements, which are ongoing and can be repudiated by either party at any time. This is, however, a matter of ongoing debate.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still curious how individual Taliban fighters can bring themselves to murder children. If I recall correctly, one of the reasons the Nazis started using gas chambers was because regular German soldiers couldn't handle murdering civilians/women/children in cold blood. While I'm sure some Taliban fighters have been personally affected by the war (they lost family members and friends) I'm sure some of the fighters are children (well, teenagers) themselves, and they're being asked to murder other civilians/women/children in cold blood, and they seemingly don't have a problem doing it.</p>
<p>Is the situation in that part of the world so bad that people are very willing to murder everyone they come across without even a hint of guilt, or feelings of immorality?</p>
<p>Edit: Just to clarrifiy the Nazi remark because people keep commenting on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the June 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union and Einsatzgruppe (mobile killing unit) mass shootings of civilians, the Nazis experimented with gas vans for mass killing. Gas vans were hermetically sealed trucks with engine exhaust diverted to the interior compartment. <strong>Use of gas vans began after Einsatzgruppe members complained of battle fatigue and mental anguish caused by shooting large numbers of women and children.</strong> Gassing also proved to be less costly.</p>

<p>More and stronger divisions make it easier to do this. He's not a man, he's a BLACK man.  She's not a devout believer, she's a ZEALOT!  He's an atheist, he has no morals!  I can't stand all of these mindless Christians!  Irish need not apply!  It'd be better if we just wiped all those useless, violent, stupid, sub-human Catholics/Americans/Communists/WHATEVER off the face of this planet!!</p>
<p>The ultimate solution is to eliminate those divisions, but too many people rely on them, using them as crutches just to get through their lives without thinking.  The more ignorance the person is forced to live in, whether through mental disability or damage, lack of access to education, or whatever limits them, the more they have to rely on these over-simple prejudices to prepare for the unknown or unexperienced.</p>
<p>Ages ago, when the world was a larger place, strangers could be harbingers of pestilence or disease.  Those with such habits tended to survive better, even if the real source of trouble was their neighbor's attempt at malfeasance blamed on the newcomer.  If the individual isn't an US, it's a THEM, and THEM isn't people.  Helping THEM before helping US might mean US doesn't have resources.  If you had to choose between the survival of US and the survival of THEM, most people would choose US without a doubt.</p>
<p>You can't erase all the lines between US and THEM, but the more lines you can erase, the more of US you'll find, and the more appealing it will be for THEM to erase their own lines.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A squad of soldiers is sent on a search and destroy mission against alien raiders to safeguard a vital source of profit for the North American Federation.</p>
<p>All soldiers of the team have drug injectors to protect them against an &quot;alien virus&quot;. After a drug injector malfunction, the soldiers slowly realize that the drug is actually designed to cause hallucinations of disgusting looking aliens. The &quot;aliens&quot; are actually humans as well, but from another federation. The team tries to make contact with the &quot;alien team&quot; to explain the situation and ask for peace. But their drug injectors work properly and they kill everyone from the team, believing that they are the aliens. The final scene shows all the soldiers dead on the floor.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You pretty much knocked that one out of the park. I think a lot of it boils down to pride and ego as well. Take nationalism for example. You live in an area and are told that this area is US and everywhere else is THEM. Anything THEY do to US is a slight, an offense that our national pride doesn't allow us to forgive or forget. When really, a country is a set of essentially arbitrary lines that don't exist when you look down at the ground. When you take pride and ego out of it, you start to see us all as humans that are in it together. In their case, its not nationalism, but the principle is the same. Their cultural pride requires them to exact revenge. You killed my children? My honor can't be reconciled until I kill some of yours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a natural, moral law to be repulsed by killing children.  It's a social construction.  What we see in these areas is actually much closer to the majority of historical humanity's view - that enemies are to be killed, and their children with them.   It was the dominant view in pre-Christian Europe, too.   See, for example, the legend of Wayland the Smith (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_the_Smith" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_the_Smith</a>), who takes revenge on a king who has hamstrung him (a common procedure used by villages against smiths in the Iron Age) by kidnapping his sons, killing them, making body parts into objects that he then gifts the king with, and raping and impregnating his daughter.  This was a widespread and popular story during the Iron Age, with Wayland the hero of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that most of the developed world has a specific tacit rule that tells us kids aren't responsible for the acts of their parents.  Without that cultural fact in place, people default to &quot;blood revenge&quot;.  Think how much more vulnerable someone is if they have kids you can attack.  </p>
<p>As to how they kill kids, imagine this: Think about being bullied as a kid.  Now imagine that instead of making you play &quot;stop hitting yourself&quot; that bully shot your mother in the face.  Then, after doing that, you have to live in a place that your bullys family controls.  The bully stops by your place every once in a while amd slaps you, your father, and your siblings around at leisure.  That bully also claims that your mother was a worthless whore and that he was right to kill her.  Then the bully goes on TV and gets the key to the city from the mayor for being a nice guy.  One day he stops by your place and tells you that your family is to be thrown out onto the street.  </p>
<p>Now you see his kid walking alone through the woods.  Youll never ever be able to get at the bully, but the kid is right there.</p>
<p>You need very specific reasons to not hurt that child.  If your ulture allows for it, you will do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey now, an actual answer with the specifics of why this attack happened. Of course it's second to a comment that just says &quot;Cause they're terrorists and they're evil.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks you for posting, I've actually never even  heard of the Pashtun at all before this.</p>
<p>Edit: A lot of people seem to be interpreting this to mean I don't think they're terrorists or I don't think they're evil, which isn't the case. I just think that's an unhelpful answer when the question was clearly asking about their actual rationale, which I promise you wasn't &quot;We're evil and terrorists so lets do this.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem. Here is a link on them:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_people" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_people</a></p>
<p>It's a very important component to the discussion on why the Taliban hold  so much influence over one ethnic group. When we ( The U.S) invaded Afghanistan Post-2001, we created a gov't in Kabul that was a mix of different people like Uzbeks, Tajiks, some Pashtuns as well. This aliented many Pashtuns who ( rightly) saw local corrupt commanders hurting them. The Taliban offered them sanctuary and $$. Since the Durrand Line is an artificial border that many in the area don't recognize, they could go back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan with ease. Since the 1980s and the war against the Soviets, madrassas were built all over the place...so now you have unemployed, disaffected, and displaced ( due to refugees in Pakistan) joining Islamic idealogical groups in Pakistan and in the lawless FATA region. You mix the Deobandi Islam, with Al-Qaeda inspired IED attacks after the war in Iraq ( Post-2003), and Pashtunwali tribal code..you get a very nasty element. </p></div>		</li>

The Interim Administration and the Transitional Administration were both headed by a Pashtun (Karzai) and were - respectively - 33% and 44% Pashtun (by my count).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that the Pashtuns were used both by the americans and by Pakis to wage proxy wars. The Americans used them against USSR in the same style as they had contra rebels...and quite successfully too. They were called the Mujahiddins then.  Watch the movie  Charlie wilson's war for a better idea. </p>
<p>When the Russians retreated from afganistan in the late 80s, the Pakis had a whole bunch of these Mujahiddins who would have become a social problem with no one to pay their salaries. And you can't just take a gurrilla fighter and turn him into a factory worker or a salad chef. Pakistan turned these guys over to their eastern front and had then wage a proxy war against India in kashmir.  What no one speaks of today is the over 100 thousand kashmiri pundits that were killed by the terrorists in the name of religion and ethnic cleansing. </p>
<p>The problem is now coming back home to bite Pakistan in the rear  As Hillary Clinton had once quipped &quot;you can keep snakes in your back yard and hope they will only bite your neighbor&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's the hardest part of the &quot;War on Terror&quot; is that the intense need to go &quot;They're terrorists and evil&quot; as a blanket cover for the motivation of the enemy.</p>
<p>Dehumanization is an easy thing to do when their methods are so barbaric, but while it has its uses on the battlefield, it's necessary to more closely examine their motives.</p>
<p>Without doing that, you're more or less doomed to be at a disadvantage as the enemy faced has no qualms about trying to suss out what motivates you.</p>
<p>I mean, there's a reason that Yitzhak Shamir's writings have been found in Taliban and ALQ camps.  They're working overtime figuring us out, and meanwhile we'll just say they're &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;animals&quot; which brings us no closer to our goal of defeating them.</p></div>		</li>
