			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lot that goes into play. Their bio mechanics are different ie large necks compared to body and force is distributed at no angle from the crown of the head down through the entire body with all four limbs planted. Verses, humans, that have relatively small necks compared to our body, and when we receive a blow it’s usually at around a 90 degree angle (essentially our heads will whip one way when met with the blow) when we are upright. With an animal like a woodpecker, their brain is actually oriented in their skull at a different angle than ours. </p>
<p>There are also biological differences. As you can see <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/technology-health-and-nutrition-quackery/neuroshield-can-woodpeckers-help-protect-your-brain" target="_blank">here</a> looking at our woodpecker friend again, we can see a lot of differences, like our skulls not being composed of the same material. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The easy answer would be that they're designed specifically for that task, whereas the only evolutionary pressure humans received in that area was the occasional getting punched in the face when dealing with arguments and competing for mates. Those who were smaller and more susceptible to concussion had fewer mates, so according to <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/167304/2010/05/13/research/it-was-brawn-over-beauty-human-mating-competition" target="_blank">this study,</a> males end up being on average 15 percent larger than females today. But I doubt there was enough fighting to the point of concussion throughout human history to really put pressure on our genetics so that we're immune to concussion. If we're talking about two half naked tribesmen fighting over Jessica, it will become clear who won the fight very shortly after it begins in many cases. The weaker one will tend to back down. IMO, the majority of &quot;competition&quot; for humans would come from intellect, power, etc. Fighting wouldn't play such a central role in competing for mates as it would for some animals we see today. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant more specifically what adaptations do they have to prevent them? Musk oxen (I think) have 4 inch thick skulls (maybe only in the front). While that would protect them from breaking their skulls,  it wouldn't prevent concussions. What about their physiology allows them to smash their heads together so hard without brain damage?</p></div>		</li>
