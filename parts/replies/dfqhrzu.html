			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially when we talk about $400-1000 pieces of equipment with plenty of simple problems. I keep a fair stock of microswitches myself, replaced more than I could ever hope to count. Oh...and inverters too. I think total repair time for bringing one down, swapping, reassembly, testing, and mounting is down to like 30-45min now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Making a weird sound and not heating is the problem description for a lot of microwaves that I fix. When a magnetron sparks and arcs it's a very different sound than food cooking and it's pretty clear to the observer something is out of the ordinary. If OP asked why the food pops I would be inclined to agree with you but based on my experience they're likely describing an intermittent magnetron malfunction.</p></div>		</li>
