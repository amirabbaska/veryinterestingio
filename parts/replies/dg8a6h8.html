			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such a valid point for me. I am not an addict. I use percocet for migraine treatment because out of the dozens of drugs I've used in my life, it's one I can take and generally get through my day at work and function reasonably well. Which with a migraine is a godsend.  No employer is going to offer me any support with migraines. Never have, never will.  So I have to do something. </p>
<p>The stigma sucks for those of us legitimately benefiting from these drugs.  I won't even think about switching pharmacies because pharmacist will give me dirty looks filling prescriptions even.  The pharmacy, and my doctor, know my history well.  So no way I'd switch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you function at work though? Whenever I take a narcotic pain killer I'm a zombie. I've had one before work a few times and when I was through the pain episode and working clear headed again I looked at the code I wrote like &quot;who the hell wrote this shit?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, opioids can impair you, but you should also consider how debilitating migraine can be. I was prescribed opioids when I first started suffering from chronic migraines. They definitely impaired some of my detail-oriented work but overall I was far more functional. I could answer the phone, write emails, discuss ideas, and generally perform at around 70% of my usual self. With I migraine I was like 20% and would just need to go home for the rest of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a high dose to a naive user. To chronic users, opiate usage is not hugely impairing.  When they were trying to ban alcohol, opiate abuse was widespread but didn't really cause the same social ills as alcoholism (or wasn't seen as doing so). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not OP but I can take two Vicodin / Percocet and still be just the same as usual. I'll have a little buzz and won't feel much pain, and generally be in a much better mood, but for the most part I function normally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, the important question is: which is more effective?  If four weeks off cures you faster, it could be better for the company in the long run.  (As well as for you, which is obviously the most important thing).</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are a lot of penny wise, pound foolish decisions being made by companies.</p>
<p>Decisions are often based on what's cheapest for the next quarter, not what's cheapest over the next decade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I worked construction, you'd essentially lose your job if you missed a few days. So, people who were clearly hurting would just pop a few pills, and, you know, go saw stuff, hammer roofing shingles, or carry some heavy ass wood, sheetrock or concrete. And, first thing after work, beer time. ...a few beers, followed by many more beers, and some more pills. It was ridiculous.    </p>
<p>TL;DR: US worker's rights and safety nets are top notch. /s</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably not. By the time addiction and accumulating chronic injuries start seriously impeding a person's ability to work, they could be working for someone else.</p>
<p>It probably is better for society as a whole. Having a large number of older people disabled by chronic pain and opiate addiction is not a good thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really?  Surely it depends on the job and the pain - physical work is different to desk work, and you wouldn't give someone four weeks off for minor back pain (I assume).  If your pain is actually serious, it's going to affect your general demeanour and the way you think, as well as your ability to move.</p>
<p>But I suppose it depends, and four weeks is quite a lot of time to lose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Herniated disk here. </p>
<p>Medicated and in medical leave for &quot;back pain&quot;: Ibuprofen, Paracetamol, then maybe something else, then Diclofenac, then Lyrica. Around two months, getting progressively worse. </p>
<p>Diagnosed, hospitalized, a couple weeks: tryptizol, tramadol. </p>
<p>Home, waiting to see if I get better or need surgery: a couple weeks. Same drugs. </p>
<p>Hospital again, definitely not getting better. Morphine, plus tryptizol, maybe Lyrica or such, plus who knows what (can't remember, really foggy brain). Scheduled for surgery. </p>
<p>Surgery. Another week in hospital, then home. Gradually start walking again. Get off pretty much every drug except for morphine. </p>
<p>Gradually weaned off morphine in the span of several weeks. Nurse checks me and my surgical wound at home, at first every day, then every two days, etc. </p>
<p>Eventually I can walk to the doctor's by myself, so the nurse stops coming home.</p>
<p>I work out for months until I regain muscle mass to have a normal life. </p>
<p>All said, I spent one year in medical leave. I had had chronic back pain my whole life, so both doctors and myself thought it would go away on its own, as it always had. That's why it took us so long 1) for me to go to the hospital and 2) for them to go for the surgery. If it happens again, we'll do it faster, before I lose so much muscle mass from being bedridden. </p>
<p>Still, they took care of me, carefully upped the prescriptions when needed, and carefully helped me wean off opiates. </p>
<p>And, of course, zero debt. Now I can contribute to society, pay taxes and help someone else who needs it. </p>
<p>This was in Spain. </p></div>		</li>
