			<div class="markdown"><p>It still baffles me that a judge can offer &quot;this thing&quot; without it being clearly mentioned as a viable punishment as per the law text (if that's the case) - but I guess providing it as an offer or option makes it a bit more &quot;better&quot; and understandable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to remember that for a lot of these sentences that seem cruel and unusual are offered up as an alternative to jail or a fine. Like standing on the street with a humiliating sign sounds cruel and unusual but most people would take that option over jail time or a hefty fine, and appealing it wouldn't be worth the trouble because of the alternatives and the cost of appealing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The federal sentencing guidelines are illegal when they take away a judges discretion. The current ones are non binding. </p>
<p>Judges in the United States are supposed to take an active interest in the resolution of the specific problem. Think if it like if your car breaks down, you want your mechanic to find the problem and fix it rather than going through a script which doesn't fix the issue. Judges aren't supposed to make unwarranted assumptions but actually look at the facts.</p>
<p>Since judges have different rules that apply in both criminal and civil trials you may see a difference there, but the main issue generally comes down to what is fair in the specific situation rather than what is expediant.</p></div>		</li>
