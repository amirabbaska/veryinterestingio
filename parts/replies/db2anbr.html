			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. If you have a speed sensor across all lanes at any point, the speed of all those cars currently over your sensor is your current. If your sensor is before the construction lanes, you'll see a lot of slow cars. If your sensor is after, you will see a few fast cars. Either way, add up the speeds and you get about the same number. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, current should be the amount of cars passing within a certain time interval. Has nothing to do with speed, or has it?</p></div>		</li>
