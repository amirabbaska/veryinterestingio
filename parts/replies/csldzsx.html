If you have a volume with a bazillion moving particles that are somewhat attracted to each other (by gravity), the whole cloud in general will likely have one axis of rotation that has slightly more momentum than any other.  Over billions of years of collisions and such, this will be the only axis of rotation left.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why does everything in the universe spin?</p>
<p>Why does the video talk about the fourth dimension?</p>
<p>What is the proper model for an atom's movement?</p>
<p>Sorry to be so ignorant but this is all outside of my daily purview.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm NO expert either, just very curious about these things and here's what I can tell from my understanding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does everything in the universe spin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically: the universe started spinning and continues to do so. Well, remember that part in the video where it said that the nebula of dust and what not had a general overall direction of spin? Turns out the universe is pretty much a gigantic nebula, with its parts spinning somewhere but having a general spin. <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/jul/25/was-the-universe-born-spinning" target="_blank">Here's a neat article about this</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does the video talk about the fourth dimension?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question reminded me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8" target="_blank">Richard Feynman talking about &quot;why&quot; questions</a>. I'm not really sure what you want to know, but my guess is that you want to know why is the fourth dimension relevant in the discussion of disc-forming matter. Well, as explained above, forming discs is an intrinsic property of 3 dimensions. 2 as well because, well, by definition it is already a disc. In more than 3 dimensions, any disc-forming would be impossible and the video tries to explain why and what would be there. It's just for comparative purposes, I believe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the proper model for an atom's movement?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one is a lovely question, and a bit hard to explain properly. The Bohr model we see in text-books and flags and what not has a few things right and a few wrong. First, it is true atoms have a nucleus formed by protons and neutrons. And yes, they have electrons. That's about it. The most common &quot;this is wrong&quot; statement you'll see is that electrons do not circle around the nucleus as depicted by Bohr. What's around the nucleus is commonly referred to as &quot;electron cloud&quot;. Basically, Bohr model uses classical mechanics to explain an electron movement around its nucleus, but this is the quantum world. You cannot know the position of an electron, only the probability of it. It goes a lot deeper than this, and quantum understanding of the atom is fascinating. <a href="https://vladimirkalitvianski.wordpress.com/2010/12/02/zoom-in-atom-or-unknown-physics-of-short-distances/" target="_blank">Here you can see a few pictures of how this might look like if we could see it</a>. Those are the shapes of electron clouds. I highly suggest you google &quot;quantum atom model&quot; to find out more.</p>
<p>The other thing I'd like to point out is scale. While not really Bohr's model flaw (since it's more of a constraint of the medium), the scale is all wrong. The scale from a atom's nucleus to it's nearest electron is... ridiculously big. Unimaginably big. It is hard to have a proper perspective on it, but <a href="http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html" target="_blank">this page helped me a bit</a>. Just scroll to the right. It is the solar system, but an electron is way farther to it's atom than pluto is from the sun (if we adjusted scales). The page itself claims it'd take 11 maps like that to show the distance between them. It's important to note that, on atoms, this space is not empty: it's where the &quot;electron cloud&quot; lives.</p>
<p>Hope I was clear enough!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seems like Bohr's model is not a classical model, as /u/Upssenk pointed out. It's the first model to use quantum mechanical behaviours for electrons.</li>
<li>When I mentioned that the scale in Bohr's model is wrong, I meant the pictures of Bohr's model are not to scale. Bohr's model math is pretty accurate indeed. Sorry for any confusion!</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick correction, even though Bohr's model is not completely correct it is in fact the first model to use discrete values for the angular momentum of the electrons, and as such is not a 'classical' model, rather it is the model that first use quantum mechanical behaviours for the electrons of the hidrogen-like atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. What got me thinking, stupid as it may sound stupid, but if we were to adjust the size of the solar system to the atomic scale, how big would the known universe be relatively. Or the milky way? </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure where you're getting this from or what you're trying to say about the Bohr model. In the Bohr model the innermost electron orbits at the Bohr radius, which is actually fairly close to the expectation value of the 1s electron's radial position in hydrogen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spinning I can answer. Everything started from dust, and when that dust collided, it was pretty much never head-on. One side of each speck got hit with more force than the other, which causes spin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably worth pointing out that even if the universe was magically created with things in stationary positions, gravity would still attract objects, causing either orbits or collisions, which would cause the spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like playing billiards. If you want to put some spin on a ball you aim the cue ball to the left or right of center. The farther off center you hit the ball, the faster it spins, and of course whether you hit the ball on the left or right determines which direction it spins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for answering that. So objects are spinning because of collisions... wouldn't they eventually lose their momentum? Or does gravity keep them constantly spinning? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine you have a ball just floating in space with no forces acting on it. Then along comes another ball and bumps it a bit. That is going to do two possible things. Cause the ball to move through space, and or cause it to rotate. No different from a cue ball on a pool table. </p>
<p>An object in motion tends to stay in motion so once that ball starts moving or spinning it will continue to do so until something else stops it. </p>
<p>Since objects in the universe have spent billions of years running into each other, most everything that can spin, does spin.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this example. Another thing to think about... It is pretty much impossible for two balls to strike each other and NOT spin. They would have to hit at the perfect head-on angle, down to the atom, for there to be no spin. The momentum of one of the balls would have to be pointing directly at the exact center of the core of the other ball (or vice versa, depending on your frame of reference) to not have any indirect force applied.</p>
<p>Not to mention even at this perfect angle, if one of the balls is spinning AT ALL it will apply a spin to the second ball.</p>
<p>Now imagine this has been happening with innumerable atoms and particles and elements and bodies of mass for 14 billion years.  That's one simple explanation for why everything is spinning :)</p></div>		</li>
