<p>Basically because Cops have to work long hours, such as nightshifts, and need to be able to respond at a moment's notice. As such there's not a lot of options for a quick bite to eat in the middle of the night. They also provide a place to sit down and take a quick break (or fill out paperwork in a place that's not the front seat of your patrol car) and you can take the doughnuts with you.</p>

<p>Worked 3rd shift at a New England Dunkin Donuts (is there really any other kind?) back in the day when you could still sit on a stool at a horseshoe-shaped counter and drink your coffee out of a stoneware mug.</p>
<p>Cops were not only our friends, they were protection.  We gave them free donuts, coffee, pretty much whatever they wanted within reason.  Because of their constant presence, we had very few crazies and no robberies to deal with.  Even your local junkie won't stick up a donut shop with a black and white in the parking lot!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar experience working at a Starbucks. We had a couple cops who would come in right around closing time, we'd let them stay in the store doing paperwork/chatting/etc until we were actually locking up. We'd had a few incidents with crazies in the parking lot and it was mostly women working there, so it was a good trade off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for 7-11 for a little bit and our policy we had was on-duty police officers(and paramedics and firefighters), Is they got free coffee, slurpees, or fountain drinks, so they'd be frequent guests and it really did wonders preventing crimes, and residents felt safer too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like a 7/11 out here. They have a small office in the back just for the cops. They get a warm place to do paperwork, some coffee, and the cashier gets the protection a parked cop car brings. I close my work at 10pm, so I can only imagine how sketchy being the only person in an entire building at 2AM can be. </p></div>		</li>

<p>My neighbor was a cop and I randomly yelled out the window one day when he was coming home, asking if he actually liked doughnuts. He laughed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this a question? Or a statement? It's worded like a question... But then you don't even let us know what his response was. You yelled at him and laughed is pretty much what you're saying...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Also many donut shops or convenience stores give folks in uniform (cops, military, EMT, etc.) free coffee or donuts. I work at a large chain convenience store and it's policy to do so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tim Hortons near where I live gives emergency personnel, military, and news staff (reporters/videographers) 25% off as long as you have your credentials or are in uniform. </p>
<p>That and a lot of people will pay for coffee or donuts for them in advance as a way of saying thanks for being part of the community.</p>
<p>It's a nice thing to receive at 3:30 in the morning, makes you feel appreciated.</p></div>		</li>
