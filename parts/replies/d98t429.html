<p>If you haven't and find the &quot;scuba crab&quot; remarkable, you'll probably find this interesting:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpheidae" target="_blank">It is distinctive for its remarkably disproportionate large claw, larger than half the shrimp's body. The claw can be on either arm of the body, and unlike most shrimp claws does not have typical pincers at the end. Rather, it has a pistol-like feature made of two parts. A joint allows the &quot;hammer&quot; part to move backward into a right-angled position. When released, it snaps into the other part of the claw, emitting an enormously powerful wave of bubbles capable of stunning larger fish and breaking small glass jars.</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That ain't nothing man, have you heard about the Mantis Shrimp?</p>
<p><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/mantis_shrimp" target="_blank">It has sixteen types of cone cells so it can see colors we couldn't even imagine (we only have 3, red, green, and blue), they are able to super cavitation punch with both 'hands' and actually need to be kept in extremely heavy duty tanks (like low caliber bulletproof glass) because their punch shatters normal glass.</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can actually do this yourself, but you only get one breath out of the bubble. You open your mouth like you're going to blow a bubble before going under, and in doing so you create a little pocket of air over your lips. You can suck it in to get an extra breath (carefully, so you don't breathe in water). It took me a little practice, but it's pretty cool to do when you're just swimming around. It's similar to the pocket of air created when you put a cup upside down into water. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, it gets even cooler: the &quot;bell-diving spider&quot; makes a web underwater, and then carries down air bubbles stuck to its hairy abdomen, shoving them off underneath so the web fills up with an air space. To make it easier, it swims up, but pulls itself back down on plant stems (to which it attaches the web canopy).</p>
<p>It then takes its prey up into the bubble nest to enjoy in dry, breathable air.</p>
