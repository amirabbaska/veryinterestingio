			<div class="markdown"><p>Determine whether the answer is a SUBJECT or an OBJECT.
A subject <strong>does something</strong> and is a &quot;who.&quot; For example, WHO ate the ice cream? HE did.
An object <strong>has something done to them</strong> and is a &quot;whom.&quot; For example, to WHOM are you speaking? I am speaking to HIM.
Obviously your answer will not always be male, but for the sake of phrasing the question, assume that it is and think about how the answer would be phrased.</p></div>		</li>
