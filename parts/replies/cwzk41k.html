			<div class="markdown"><p>Göring: Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.</p>
<p>Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.</p>
<p>Göring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's very dishonest to pin Islamic extremism down on &quot;Lack of Islamic knowledge&quot;. Folks like Al-Baghdadi are <em>extremely</em> well versed in their religion: he has a bloody PhD in it after all. The actions of Jihadis are definitely compatible with the Wahhabi vision of Islam.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/" target="_blank">Here's an article explaining my position:</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that the Islamic State is Islamic. Very Islamic. Yes, it has attracted psychopaths and adventure seekers, drawn largely from the disaffected populations of the Middle East and Europe. But the religion preached by its most ardent followers derives from coherent and even learned interpretations of Islam.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Al-Baghdadi uses simple objective points as a basis for his twisted narrative. The point &quot;lack of Islamic knowledge&quot; is in reference to Al-Baghdadi's targeted congregation. They are the ones who lack that knowledge and thus are easily drawn in by - as you mentioned it - his PhD in the field. The obvious fallacy here is that a PhD is the end all be all, while also ignoring the sociocultural anthropology of the people. To farmers and goat herders and orphaned teenage boys, someone having a PhD is equivalent to being prophetic (in the sense of Islam's most revered figure, Prophet Muhammad).</p>
<p>If you want an opposing, academic opinion to what that article suggests and what Al-Baghdadi would want you and other Muslims to believe, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Refuting-ISIS-Religious-Ideological-Foundations/dp/1908224126" target="_blank">you should check out this book</a>. Link is to Amazon, but you could probably find it online somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that really bothered me too. That kind of thinking is a blatant &quot;no true scotsman&quot; fallacy and the same tired propaganda we constantly hear from the regressive left. There's no such thing as &quot;islamic knowledge&quot;, that's precisely the problem. Like all major religions, everything is made up and the rules don't matter. Extremists are basing their beliefs off of a very plausible interpretation of the faith. You don't get to dismiss the connection between belief and actions by saying &quot;they're doing it wrong&quot;. Moderate religious people are not more moderate because they understand their religion better. They're moderate because they take their religion less seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is made up, but the rules <em>do</em> matter. If you have violent source material to work with (the &quot;rules&quot; based on the prophet's life), it's a lot easier to justify violence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup its something that people aren't willing to accept is, to whatever extent, a part is Islamic culture for a very long time.  </p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wbJEAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA299#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Thomas Jefferson was dealing with it in the 19th century with slave taking Barbary pirates!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disguising their feelings as best they could, they &quot;took the liberty to make some inquiries concerning the ground of the pretensions to make war upon nations who had done them no injury.&quot; The ambassador replied: It was written in their Koran, that all nations which had not acknowledged the Prophet were sinners, whom it was the right and duty of the faithful to plunder and enslave; and that every Mussulman who was slain in this warfare was sure to go to paradise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That isn't to say all muslims should be blamed, or that Islam is 'evil'; but it has to be acknowledged that the 'extremists' are actually well versed in Islam and their interpretations are certainly in keeping with the ethos of certain parts of the Quran.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look, your way talking about Muslims as if they are 1 race is wrong. </p>
<p>Turkey is a Muslim country. Did you hear any Turk doing suicide attacks or terrorist attacks? </p>
<p>Turks live in Germany and Bulgaria by millions. Do they commit terrorist attacks? </p>
<p>How come same religion Arabic family and a Turkish family goes to same place, one integrates but another one prefers different path although the religion is the same. </p>
<p>I want you to explain it to me. </p>
<p>As a Turkish person I'm super angry towards Arabs right now. And I can't understand really. Poor people? Uneducated?  Oppressed? Repressed? We have them too in our society and in West. I can understand if you say well West made them poor so that's why they act like that. But I don't understand instead of trying harder in life, working, being productive, Arabs choose the easiest fucking way all the time. </p>
<p>Read this carefully; if the main point is Islam, one of us don't understand Islam clearly otherwise both people would behave the same. </p>
<p>TL:DR; Arabs are the easiest group of people to manipulate as it seems from outside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure that you, as a Turkish person, know the answer to that question:</p>
<p>Atatürk</p>
<p>You benefit from a society that was heavily reformed and secularized into a truly modern Islamic state, although those reforms and the general secularization of Turkey do seem to be under ever increasing threat.</p>
<p>Arabic countries never had such an experience. They've been whipped from direction to direction, at the whims of religious authorities with varying motives (both good and terrible). There's a lot of money and power in Sunni extremism right now. Arab cultures have never been inoculated against religious extremism, while Turkey has.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's hope your country will remain that way. Iran was supposedly like that (comparatively) in the past. Something had changed to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have never heard of the Grey Wolves. Absolutely they are a Turk terrorist group. They exist throughout Europe, and are monitored as an extremist/hate group that glorifies the Turkish history and culture.</p>
<p>They frequently attack or kill Kurds. </p></div>		</li>
