			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I'm Dr. Renslow. We get this question a lot. Cividis does looks similar to some other colormaps that are available, such as viridis and parula. These are good options as well, and generally colorblind friendly and offer near-linear visual perception. Cividis differs in that it was mathematically optimized, to minimize difference in perception as much as possible. Parula was manually adjusted to make it look pleasing, and viridis does not quite have the same perception between colorblind and non-colorblind people. However, we are happy to see when any of these better designed colormaps are used in science! </p></div>		</li>
