			<div class="markdown"><p>You've lost weight because its such a pain in the ass to produce a simple amount of food.  Grinding your own flour?  that's gonna put a dent in your cookie production.</p>
<p>Plus i'm guessing you arent making your own chocolate sauce and bread intake will go down because grinding your own flour and then having to bake the bread too sounds like a nightmare.  Basically you 2 spend all your time making food.  Im glad you're healthy, but man...there's a reason the world has a mixed economy.  People who spend all their time producing food to eat for themselves tend not to have much time for anything else.  </p>
<p>That is why almost all scientific advancement in human history has happened since the industrial age.  automation and the tertiary economy have resulted in people spending more time doing the tasks they are best qualified to do.  Einstein probably would not have accomplished much if he was casing his own sausage instead pouring over relativity.  And since his work was likewise based on the work of other scientists who did the same, basically if everyone lived like you nothing would ever be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to save time but also live longer (on average) I recommend at least cutting out factory farmed animal products. It's pretty low effort focusing on making easy healthy one-pot meals like oatmeal with flax and nuts, and pulses with whole grains or seeds. If you make ahead of time and take advantage of technology like microwaves you can still have time to study physics or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Making small changes can make a big difference. I recently lost 20 lbs just by eating slightly less and no soda. </p>
<p>Its not physics for everyone. It may just be more time with kids. Or taking a pottery class. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the interesting answer, Can you tell me a little bit more about your lifestyle ? How do you find the time to produce your own food ? Heck I can't even find the time to cook for myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to my kitchen setup, I spend about 4-6 hours a week, in total, writing the next weeks menu, then prepping and cooking. I’ll prep things like cured meats, pickles, preserves, meat, bone and vegetable stocks on Sunday. In addition to, things that can go in the freezer. Like I’ll grind and potion hamburgers, then I’ll use my vacuum sealer and I’ll make packages of 4 patties and freeze them off, pulling them out as needed.</p>
<p>I spend 1 hour, twice a week, prepping mise en place - things like diced garlic and shallots, cooked rice and pasta, blanched veg like asparagus and broccoli.</p>
<p>Dinner then works like a restaurant, where any entrée on the menu can be cooked from start to finish in under 10 minutes, with no leftovers. One pan, one entrée </p>
<p>Not sure if you could pull this off in a home kitchen, unless you, like me, built a commercial kitchen at home.</p>
<p>When people come over and see our kitchen, the 1st thing they ask is if we cater. We don’t. It’s just for us :)</p></div>		</li>
