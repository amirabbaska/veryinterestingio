			<div class="markdown"><p>Got any pictures of this? My googling came up with nothing</p>
<p>Edit: I dug deeper.</p>
<p>I found this, but I'm unsure if it was a camera position or not <a href="http://charlesmann.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/TRINITY-Test-Site-photos/G0000AfbKU5UKOmg/I0000gBRsZbS6n_4/C0000iL8Rmnudh_0" target="_blank">http://charlesmann.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/TRINITY-Test-Site-photos/G0000AfbKU5UKOmg/I0000gBRsZbS6n_4/C0000iL8Rmnudh_0</a></p>
<p>I also found this also: <a href="https://m.yelp.com/biz_photos/white-sands-missile-range-trinity-site-white-sands-missle-range-post-area?select=L5RMeqN1WKnvb16FpWODOQ" target="_blank">https://m.yelp.com/biz_photos/white-sands-missile-range-trinity-site-white-sands-missle-range-post-area?select=L5RMeqN1WKnvb16FpWODOQ</a></p>
<p>I found an interesting archive image also, its very hard to decern what it is but it's labeled as a camera bunker! </p>

<p>This has really peaked my interest, I'll update if I find any other images that other users haven't already linked! </p>
<p>Double edit:</p>
<p>Piqued. TIL</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for a bit more context because It’s fascinating when you watch the Trinity test explosion and realise it’s 10,000 frames per second or nanoseconds after the blast:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapatronic_camera" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapatronic_camera</a></p>
<p>To overcome the speed limitation of a conventional camera's mechanical shutter, the rapatronic camera uses two polarizing filters and a Faraday cell (or in some variants a Kerr cell). The two filters are mounted with their polarization angles at 90° to each other, to block all incoming light. The Faraday cell sits between the filters and changes the polarization plane of light passing through it depending on the level of magnetic field applied, acting as a shutter when it is energized at the right time for a very short amount of time, allowing the film to be properly exposed.</p>
<p>Cameras were placed in bunkers only 800 yards (730 m) from the tower, protected by steel and lead glass, and mounted on sleds so they could be towed out by the lead-lined tank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh shit this is brilliant!! Makes so much sense to do it this way too. I never really thought about the problem of capturing nuclear test footage, but this is definitely a dope solution.   </p>
