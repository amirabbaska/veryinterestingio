<p>But assuming the sea level rises realistic levels, the atmospheric pressure at sea level would be very similar (slightly less). There would be the same quantity of gas slightly higher up on average exerting force on a slightly larger surface area.</p>
<p>In the case of your question, if the sea level rose to Everest heights but the mass of the earth remained constant (impossible in reality but this is hypothetical) then the pressure at sea level would be a little less than it was at our sea level but nowhere near as low as everest is now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air pressure is essentially the weight of all the air above you pressing down - If you imagine holding a stack of books in your hands, where the books represent the column of air, and your hands are the surface of the earth at sea level, then the force of their weight on your hands is the air pressure.  If you raise your hands up to mimic sea level rise, the books weigh the same*, they're just higher up.</p>
<p>*<em>Except</em>: The books don't weigh quite the same, for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The force of gravity will be weaker, depending on exactly why the seas rose - did more water or earth mass magically appear, causing gravity to increase as well?  Or did the earth just get bigger without increasing mass?  Assuming the latter, then the gravity will decrease as the square of the increased size, so (20,900,000' / 20,929,029') ^ 2  = 99.7%  (This probably isn't correct, because this applies only to the force of gravity at &quot;sea level&quot;.  At higher altitudes, the relative decrease will be smaller, but my integral calculus is a bit rusty).</li>
<li>The surface are of the planet will increase, so assuming the same volume of air, there will be less of it over each square inch to press down.  The surface area also increases with the square of the distance, so that's another decrease of 99.7% normal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take them together, and the air pressure decreases to at least 99.4% of normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As /u/etrnloptimist says, and also because the earth  would have more surface area, and so the atmosphere would be spread a little bit thinner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldnt air pressure decrease slightly since the ice was displacing more air than the water does when it melts? In other words, altitude increases because ice takes up more space than water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well counterintuitively the ice itself makes the Earth a slightly bigger ball, with the same amount of gas surrounding it, thus that constant gas it does have is spread thinner.  So actually the atmosphere gets denser when the ice melts and compacts into water in the ocean, and less dense when it freezes back into land-ice, as counterintuitive as that seems.</p>
<p>This is basically because Earth is a slightly bigger ball when it's ice-covered than when it's water-covered (due to ice being less dense and taking up more space).</p></div>		</li>
