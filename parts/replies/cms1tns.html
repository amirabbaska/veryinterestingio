Without linear algebra, we don't have homogeneous space.
Without homogeneous space we don't have any perspective projection, so, nothing that looks 3d.
Also transformation will be really painful without without matrices. Of course you still can use trigonometry but will be slow and full of edge cases.</p>
<p>edit: Perspective. I'm a graphic programmer, I didn't say I'm native English speaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2nd year CS student here. I already passed linear algebra last year, but I can't remember a thing. Hence your response makes me slightly anxious about picking it up again. When and how does that happen? </p>
<p>I'm not very interested in graphics and games; rather looking to get into data mining and maybe some machine learning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The linear algebra in computer graphics is pretty simple. The only thing you need to know is how to multiply matrices. There's nothing to be afraid of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As /u/halfshadows said you need only matrices transformation, projection point on plane, dot product for the basis.
But being graphics programmer (writing shaders) is all about studying optic. The problem is that solving illumination equation usually give you big and long non linear integral, and then you have to solve an integral over a hemisphere using linear algebra. Luckily the graphics industry is very prolific and made a lot of presentation about new techniques. I base all my work on techniques developed on other studies but of course you need to know maths to understand them. If you want an example of what I'm speaking check this paper. <a href="http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/papers/AOVHPG10/McGuire10AOV.pdf" target="_blank">http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/papers/AOVHPG10/McGuire10AOV.pdf</a> Something very similar to this technique is used in Assassin Creed 3.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I went to Full Sail, and we did something similar, except with Physics pairing with Linear Algebra.  </p>
<p>It was my third time learning Linear Algebra (high-school, random college class, then this), but this is the one time it actually clicked and I was like 'ohhhhh, the TENSOR MATRIX! Of course!'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also extremely important for work with any sort of tracking. This includes devices such as smartphones, gesture control interfaces, virtual reality headsets, etc. For computer-integrated surgery we often track the positions of tools and the patient all in their own coordinate systems and your accuracy needs to be pretty damn good, you don't want to miss a mass by millimetres during a biopsy. </p>
<p>It also plays a role in medical image registration (getting two images taken under different circumstances/times to match up as best as possible in order to make meaningful comparisons and do other useful stuff with). It also important for medical visualizations but that goes in hand with Graphics.</p>
<p>In my work I'd consider Linear Algebra to be the single most important course one could take in undergraduate years. I'd actually go beyond that and say it's probably one of the the single most important courses one could take in a computing program.</p></div>		</li>
