			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that the results of the Rat Park study have not been able to be reproduced despite several attempts. While Alexander's work is valuable to a holistic understanding of addiction, it is not sufficiently conclusive enough to give a definitive explanation. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you cite some of these failed reproductions? I was under the impression it had been reproduced successfully.</p>
<p>See:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19949320" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19949320</a></p>
<p>Edit: Looked it up myself. There have apparently only been failed attempted reproductions that I can find, and imo they were not particularly good. They seem to have tweaked a lot of variables to try to restrict the study not to <em>just</em> semi-isolation vs. group living conditions. </p>
<p>Even then, one found that, at least for heroine, rats that lived together WERE less prone to heroine use and addiction, or at least developed any addiction much more slowly, while cocaine use was high among both groups from the word go, which is an interesting addendum indicating that the rat park results might only apply to certain <em>classes</em> of drug.</p>
<p>The second study found reduced drug use for all the rats in the study, so I'm not sure how useful that one actually is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have one issue with the rat study: these social creatures were locked in tiny little cages without any social contact, and had a injection device surgically inserted into them. Take any normal human not predisposed to addiction and you will get the same result.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if they attempted to replicate this study without the social isolation and the surgical procedure? It might be difficult to forgo the surgical procedure, of course. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's kind of the point, though. That isolating social animals is harmful. We do lock people into tiny cages. Maybe not literal cages, but people in poverty, in unstable housing, with poor employment options, with existing mental or physical illness are not the ones who are going to be frolicking in the human-park.</p>
<p>Of course there are limits to any research based on mice/rat studies. That goes for all of the genetic studies posted here, too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The social isolation was the whole point of the study, so I'm not sure what you mean about replicating it without that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thank you so much for this comment. It's very insightful. It hits home because alcoholism runs in my family. I'm also struggling with mental illness, and easily succumb to bad habits that I never had before. Do you have any suggestions for coping strategies? I struggle a lot with how to unlearn how I see the world, think and behave, as well as cope with emotions I've basically been suppressing most of my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would suggest talking with a psychologist or counsellor about your situation and figuring out which sort of approach makes sense for you :) Cognitive-behavioural therapy is kind of the star of the show these days, though it generally looks forward, not a stuff that has happened in the past. If you do have a lot of difficult feelings come up, it's a good idea to have a support person around in case all of that stuff gets a bit overwhelming.</p></div>		</li>
