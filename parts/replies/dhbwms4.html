			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's small slightly elongated dots then it's just your white blood cells. They are there all the time but the  brain normally filters them out. They are very visible on a bright blue background, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_field_entoptic_phenomenon" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_field_entoptic_phenomenon</a></p>
<p>Edit: And if they are larger and have different shapes then it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater" target="_blank">floaters</a>, which is basically debris in the vitreous humor of the eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can the white blood cells be geometric and morphing in blue field phenomena?  The example is accurate to a certain degree when I look at the sky, but seems seperate from geometric morphing that forms as a layer over my field of vision.  The morphing occurs at a much higher rate than my heartbeat too, and becomes tunneled when I set a focal point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are two different phenomena here.</p>
<p>The static blobs that never move except just as your eye ball moves are called 'floaters' or <em>muscae volitantus</em>, they are little bits of junk like detached tissue or red blood cells that are suspended in the fluid that fills up your eyeball, and they cast blurry shadows on your retina. </p>
<p>There are also bright dots with dark tails darting around in squiggly lines in your vision when you stare at a bright blue sky. This is called the &quot;blue field entoptic phenomenon&quot;. It is caused by white blood cells squeezing through the capillaries that sit in front of your retina.</p>
<p>Normally your retina filters out the red color of the capillaries so 'red' is neutral, but when a white blood cell passes through the capillary, it created a little window in that 'red' and some extra light comes through which appears as a bright dot. behind the white blood cells there are some extra red blood cells that bunched up, appearing as dark tail that follows the bright dot. </p>
<p>here's a video that explains:
