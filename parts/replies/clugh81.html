			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know.  This (the link, not your post) strikes me as being clever but missing the point.  In order to be classified as a disorder there has to be some impairment in some domain.  That's right in the book.  You can't diagnose anyone with anything unless there's impairment.  And the DSM while not perfect does, many times use language like &quot;in excess of cultural norms&quot; to help a clinician account for the fact that some cultural norms may prohibit a particular diagnosis.  But back to the idea of impairment in a domain.</p>
<p>A hypomanic person may engage in risky spending or sexual behaviors.  Those behaviors may result in consequences that cause impairment (crushing debt, STDs etc).  Sure the hypomanic person feels great when they are hypomaic, but not so much when that subsides.  They may perceive impairment in the personal finance domain, or the health domain when they aren't hypomanic and thus seek treatment.</p>
<p>We could define an objective, DSM-like list of behaviors that we theoretically could all agree demonstrate &quot;Happy&quot; (this sounds very difficult but we could do it). We still couldn't diagnose it as a disorder. The central ingredient of impairment in some domain would be missing.  Nobody classifies happy as an impairment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The link is absoiutely satire and is not intended to be taken at face value. But I love it as an example of the limitation of our diagnostic system. Which is inherently value based. </p>
<p>And I would contest that happiness could absolutely be an impairment. For instance, people who rate themselves as completely happy (I.e. Ten out of ten) are more content and less likely to strive for further progress. In a society that values progress that becomes a hindrance and an impairment. I can't recall if Bentall used a similar example in his article or not.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you contest it I'm fine with that. The assertion that people who are happy don't strive doesn't sound factual to me.  I'm not trying to be combative.  It just doesn't smell right.  It seems like an assumption. </p>
<p>The &quot;society&quot; doesn't get to judge the impairment.  If someone is happy and not goal-oriented as you describe, they still perceive themselves as happy.  They don't perceive any impairment and thus they are not impaired.</p>
<p>Now, if this hypothetical happy-lazy person was judged by &quot;society&quot; to be bad, and then began to feel shame for not contributing which then deteriorated into depression, THAT could be termed an impairment.  </p>
<p>Funny enough, effective treatment for depression involves building up autonomy and internal locus of control.  Which basically mean the happy-lazy guy learns to not give a rip about what &quot;society&quot; thinks and goes on being happy-lazy.</p>
<p>And still unimpaired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say it's just a judgement.  Most of the time, if the person has what we call insight, they are the ones that define impairment.  If someone is sitting in my office, I didn't drag them there so I could wield my diagnosing powers to &quot;value judge&quot; them.  They're hurting in some way shape or form.  Their distress <em>is</em> the indicator for impairment.  They are in effect declaring that their life is impaired in some way.</p>
<p>I suppose it would be impairment in achieving normalcy.  There is a baseline that isn't either happy or sad.  It's just normal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to insert at least some value, there is nothing intrinsic. Personally, I think the most important value is maximizing happiness. Any pathology that reduces net happiness significantly (for the individual or people they are in contact with) can be considered a disorder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it isn't a value judgment really, because it's relative to the individual. A person is impaired if they have deteriorated in such a way that they are no longer able to function as well as they once could, or if they have been born with some sort of clear observable condition the presence of which can be objectively confirmed. It's quite easy to look at one person pre-depression and during depression, for example, and observe that they are impaired (relatively) in the domains of socialisation, wellbeing, sleep, etc.</p>
<p>It <em>would</em> be a value judgement if it were a general judgment relative to everyone, for example, classifying somebody as impaired socially, relative to the average person, for being moderately shy, which would be obviously incorrect, as they are not significantly impaired from their perspective, that's just how they are (of course if, say, an anxiety disorder made them even shyer, to a significant extent, then that <em>would</em> be impairment.</p>
<p>So yes, if impairment were judged relative to society as a whole then it would be a subjective value judgment, and not useful for diagnostics, but that just isn't how it's done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3_people" target="_blank">Pirahã</a> kind of don't. I mean, they certainly like to be happy, but it's very different from American happiness, and they also really really value being &quot;tough&quot; at the sake of happiness. For example, they often go hungry even though there's food enough for them to eat. Their culture is really neat, and I suggest picking up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Sleep-There-Are-Snakes-ebook/dp/B001FA0KLS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415287313&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not &quot;not valueing happiness&quot;. American culture (sorta) tells you to focus on winning and success in order to become happy and neglects to tell you that there are also other things that will make you happy. There is no culture that tells you to focus on becoming sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your response is true, but it's nonresponsive to the question posed. Just because Americans value &quot;winning and success&quot; (ambiguous terms in themselves) doesn't mean they don't also value happiness, or that happiness cannot be derived from winning and success.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Winning and success are seen as paths (or maybe <em>the</em> path) to happiness. This ins't an exclusively American POV, though, but rather the basic mindset of most 20th century western societies. German writer Heinrich Böll satirized it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekdote_zur_Senkung_der_Arbeitsmoral" target="_blank">a famous short story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story is set in an unnamed harbor on the west coast of Europe. A smartly-dressed enterprising tourist is taking photographs when he notices a shabbily dressed local fisherman taking a nap in his fishing boat. The tourist is disappointed with the fisherman's apparently lazy attitude towards his work, so he approaches the fisherman and asks him why he is lying around instead of catching fish. The fisherman explains that he went fishing in the morning, and the small catch would be sufficient for the next two days.</p>
<p>The tourist tells him that if he goes out to catch fish multiple times a day, he would be able to buy a motor in less than a year, a second boat in less than two years, and so on. The tourist further explains that one day, the fisherman could even build a small cold storage plant, later a pickling factory, fly around in a helicopter, build a fish restaurant, and export lobster directly to Paris without a middleman.</p>
<p>The nonchalant fisherman asks, &quot;Then what?&quot;</p>
<p>The tourist enthusiastically continues, &quot;Then, without a care in the world, you could sit here in the harbor, doze in the sun, and look at the glorious sea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I'm already doing that&quot;, says the fisherman.</p>
<p>The enlightened tourist walks away pensively, with no trace of pity for the fisherman, only a little envy.</p>
