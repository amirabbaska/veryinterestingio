			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add to this, here is an example of each file making a connection vs. a steam from one connection: <a href="http://www.http2demo.io/" target="_blank">http://www.http2demo.io/</a>. While this is a demo of http/1 vs. http/2 (how internet traffic is transferred), http/2 loads images/files similar to streaming video. </p>
<p>Most large sites have started using this new technology in that last year and has greatly improved image heavy pages, but only about 10% of all web sites have upgraded at this time.  </p>
<p>Note: Must be using a modern browser (~less then 1 year old) for this to work.</p></div>		</li>
