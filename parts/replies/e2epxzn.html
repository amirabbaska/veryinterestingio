			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I think the poster is highlighting old versus new technology. There are of course still a lot of places that have timber sleepers, and there are even places where you'd rather get new timber sleepers than replacing lengths of tracks with concrete sleepers, because the sudden shift in stiffness would have adverse effects on the trains and tracks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the rest of the world (outside USA) is going to concrete or steel sleepers (ties) because of cost + lack of decent hardwood available... The USA still has plenty of high quality timber left, though, so they're not switching over as quickly because there's really no need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um, no - if you don't allow for any expansion (&quot;relying on brute force&quot;), the track would &quot;bow out&quot;/deform with the heat in summer, causing a derailment. You don't even need to go to a desert for that. </p>
<p>What is used instead of the spaces between the long rail segments are expansion joints, like this:

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example for high speed railways the rail needs to be so smooth there can’t be any expansion joints, they literally weld all segments to each other solid and bolt them down real tight so it can’t bow, there is no expansion joints in modern high speed railways in Finland or China at least</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they don't have expansion joints, than what other system do they use to compensate for thermal expansion?</p>
<p>If they use <em>no system</em> to compensate, the rails would tear up whatever is holding them down or bend completely out of shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The link I have posted is specifically from the French LGV lines used by the high speed TGV trains (bottom picture there). </p>
<p>So so much for that. It is a joint that is specifically designed for high speed running. You can't weld and bolt the rail down and expect it to not expand at some point. The rail is pre-stretched so it minimizes the forces but you will still need to allow for expansion at the ends of the welded segments - e.g. where the track passes over a bridge. </p>
<p>This article explains how the French LGV track is being laid:

			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed the critical point that the continuous rail is preloaded in tension so that it doesn't go into compression (a requirement for buckling) on hot days.</p></div>		</li>
