It won't end the world when we run out of helium. It very likely won't have much of an effect at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't make much sense. Recycle? Capture used? The problem isn't that the helium is dirty, its that it escapes into the atmosphere and cannot be retrieved. When a balloon deflates, that helium is gone forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that we can't completely deplete Helium as a natural resource, since it's generated by natural radioactive decay in the crust and (more importantly) mantle/core. It is as limited as the earth is hot.</p>
<p>We're merely running out of super-easy to extract helium - where the process to capture helium is essentially salvaging it as a <em>waste by-product</em> of our other extraction processes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, commercial fusion power is only 20 years away. /s</p>
<p>EDIT:  Downvotes for making a &quot;fusion is only 20 years away joke&quot; and clearly marking it as sarcasm.  OK....</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's enough for you, your children, and possibly your grandchildren.  That's about how far most people think.  Beyond that many people assume that somebody will probably have a solution, so they reason there is no need to conserve resource today even though we know the supply is irreplaceable and limited.</p>
<p>After that time nobody cares. The thought seems to be that in several hundred years, especially several thousand years, if they don't have a replacement for the thing that is used for medical scans, supercomputers, and for proposed space travel drives, that's their fault, not ours for releasing billions of cubic feet into space every year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're currently working on solutions, and coming up with really good ones that are proving very useful in various fields. The difference between today and previous points in history is that we're now actively trying to find alternative solutions to our problems, rather than just letting industry run wild with whatever they like.</p></div>		</li>
