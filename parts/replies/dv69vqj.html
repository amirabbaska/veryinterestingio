<p>Often the follow up question to this sort of thread would be <em>&quot;but why would the body do that in the modern age&quot;</em> etc. And it's important to remember that what we consider the modern age (as in, &quot;society&quot;) is so new that it may as well have been invented yesterday, evolutionary speaking.</p>
<p>You are literally wandering around in a body that is primed for the bleeding-edge survival food-chain of 200,000 years ago. Sure, a few parts have been upgraded over that time. What with our years of abstract thinking. But mostly your body is armed with a set of biological drives for a primate of your type to survive in the wild.</p>
<p>Your next meal might be far off, therefore your body should store as much as it can via fat. Salt in food is hard to come by and essential for your body, therefore you should try to eat as much of it as you can when you find it.</p>
<p>And when it encounters a stressful situation, your body should suspend non-essential systems and flood your bloodstream with a cocktail of powerful hormones and stimulants in the hopes that your <em>survive</em>.</p>
<p>And as far as your body is concerned, it has <em>no</em> chill. There is no <em>a little bit of dying</em>. It's very binary! You either run fast enough to escape, or you get shredded into ribbons by a lion.</p>
<p>So while the stressful situation you may face is little more than a phone call, your body is equipping you with enough adrenaline to flee from a rhino.</p>
<p>Perhaps in time this will change. Perhaps, when concepts like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhjPd4uNFY" target="_blank">designer babies</a> start to become more commonplace, we'll be able to undo a lot of the weirder and out-of-place assets evolution has given us. But for now, we are saddled with a lot of leftovers from our genetic past. And a lot of those are hugely inappropriate for the world we now find ourselves in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's entirely different. Your using food as a coping mechanism to deal with strong emotions. You're probably not even really hungry, but you feel better after eating something tasty. </p></div>		</li>
