			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to not needed:
Mine is a perfectionism/fear of failing/punishment for failing. </p>
<p>For example, even if the only bad consequence is I fall short of my own expectations (shattering) and there is no parent or boss who gives external consequences, I sometimes drag my feet at 80% bc as long as I'm working/incomplete I haven't failed &quot;yet&quot;. If I finish and my work doesn't measure up, I over-identify and think &quot;I don't measure up.&quot; I take it too much to heart. All this is worse if there is another person who knows and issues consequences in addition.</p>
<p>Of course this is false. Incomplete is failure. I am working to improve my mindset. Doesn't mean the thoughts have stopped.</p>
<p>Tl;dr If I finish and my work doesn't measure up, I over-identify and think &quot;I don't measure up.&quot; I take it too much to heart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually don't want to finish so I don't have to move onto something else. Longer I can prolong this thing the farther out it is until I have to start something else. That's the weird reasoning in my head I'm trying to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more a fear of change than a fear of finishing. Closely related but a whole other problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kind of get this. When I'm at work if someone gives me something on Monday and tells me to have it done by Friday, if I get to 80% by Wednesday I always take my foot off the gas rather than just finishing it because my afraid that if I finish it on the Wednesday I'm going to get more work given to me by someone else whereas I can just take it easy for two days and still finish on time.</p></div>		</li>
