			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's one of the mechanisms at work. There are other hormonal triggers as well. The fetus itself releases hormones that prevent menstruation. That's how the fetus is typically expelled in a miscarriage. The fetus dies, stops producing hormones and normal menstruation resumes. </p>
