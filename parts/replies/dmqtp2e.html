			<div class="markdown"><p>To make this answer a bit more advanced - I'm a microbiologist.</p>
<p>The salt dissolves in solution (water) creating an osmotic gradient to the cells, in effect, water wants to leave the cells to balance the gradient. </p>
<p>Animal cells have a lot of resources to draw upon to combat this chemical equilibrium where as individual bacterial cells do not, and this will cause them to &quot;lyse&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think lysing, breaking open, happens in the opposite condition-- ultra pure water without salt. They could shrivel/dry which is a different condition however, this would still kill them or severely weaken them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of a thing I heard. Is it true that &quot;ultra pure water&quot; can kill you? I heard (not sure if it exists) of stuff like &quot;industrial grade water&quot; that's so pure it world suck all the minerals out of your body and you would shrivel up and die. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a microbiologist, but I remember stuff from my college bio classes. Lysing can still happen - if the outflow of water is rapid/intense enough, it can tear apart the cell. I believe this happens in cells without cell walls - cells with cell walls tend to shrivel, because the wall is more durable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that an opposite condition is needed for a cell to &quot;lyse&quot;. As for the &quot;ultra pure water&quot;, I think you mean a solution with relatively lower amounts of solute than the insides of the cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a hypertonic solution they would crenate. You would need hypotonicity to lyse the cells. </p></div>		</li>
