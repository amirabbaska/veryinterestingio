			<div class="markdown"><p>Also interesting;  Only mammals have capsaicin receptors.  Say you're a plant evolving, going your own way.  You doing you.</p>
<p>So an herbivorous beast comes along and grinds up yours seeds with their grindy, herbivorous teeth.  Well, that was a waste.</p>
<p>Now you accidentally start making a compound that lights those mammals up like their face is on fire.  Bet your sweet ass they won't be grinding up your seeds any more. But you still have to spread those seeds about...</p>
<p>Birds don't give a fuck, nor will they grind your seeds up.  <em>They feel NOTHING</em>. They'll happily eat the fruit and poop whole seeds everywhere.  </p>
<p>Best yet!  Humans come along and LIKE setting their faces on fire so they cultivate you and spread your seeds even better.  We're done here.</p>

<p>Edit: also good to know. My wife likes things less spicy and yells at me when I &quot;ruin&quot; my food with hot sauce because she likes to steal bites. I should buy a bottle and let it &quot;age&quot; a bit so I can still get the tasty with less hot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to maintain the spice, store it in a sealed container in a cold, dark place (like the refrigerator). but it really depends on the type of &quot;hot sauce&quot; you are storing. i dont know what kind you like, but some fancy brands go as far as including a thin layer of oil on top of the sauce to keep out the oxygen. </p>
<p>as for your wife, thats easy. just start slipping a bit into her food until she builds up a tolerance. </p>
<p>edit: thats a joke. don't dose food. seriously though, you could try mixing the spiciness with anything that will emulsify well with oil (so as to trap the capsaicin before it can reach your receptors). asian foods do this typically with yogurt (india) and coconut milk (thai). keep in mind, this will keep the capsaicin from being spicy on your tongue but it'll feel pretty much the same as it always does on the way out.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i believe it has a higher concentration of capsaicin, so &quot;more keys.&quot; and yes, your pain nerves are all sitting dormant, waiting to be unlocked, so they can fire at a moment's notice. but so are all your other nerves as well. </p></div>		</li>
