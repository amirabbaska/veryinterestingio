			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the noise cancelling section, they typically work best with low frequency droning sounds like the sound of a train or airplane engine. They don't block voices very well because they are higher frequency and aren't constantly looping like other background noise.</p>
<p>This means of you have noise cancelling headphones on you can hear someone talking to you fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why they were originally created iirc. </p>
<p>From their Wiki. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Bose, the company started noise-cancellation involvement after Dr. Amar Bose went on a 1978 flight to Europe, and &quot;was trying out new set of airline-supplied headphones and found that he couldn't really enjoy the sound with the roar of engines in the background&quot;.[3]</p>
<p>In 1986, Bose applied their noise-cancellation technology to develop headphones to protect the hearing of pilots participating in the first un-refueled non-stop around-the-world flight in the Rutan Voyager.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These last years I am crossing the atlantic at least once a month. Last month I finally bought BOSE headphone (Because once I decided to go for expensive headphone I went for the high end). Made 2 return trip with them one to north Ameria, one to south America. The battery hold long enough for both. </p>
<p>I can finally hear the film without putting the volume at the maximum, and it's frightening to suddenly remove the headphone and hear the noise of the engine. Even better, I can sleep </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easier to block (via physical barrier), not to cancel.</p>
<p>If you're off by 100µs on a 100Hz sound, that's a 1% phase offset, which will have minimal effect.  If you're off by 100µs on a 2kHz sound, that's 20%, and will cancel so poorly that it will actually be worse than nothing.</p>
<p>E: For a more precise answer, 17% phase error is around where you start making it worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! It is essentially reversing the polarity vs the original waveform. There's a cool trick you can do: if you have a sound recording of a sine wave and duplicate it in an audio editor, then reverse the phase on one of the two tracks, you will still see signal in your software but will not hear anything because of the cancelation. </p>
<p>I'd have to test it again to see if that is the exact process, but it is a pretty fascinating phenomenon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't you want a reflected signal, not a shifted one? I understand with sinusoidal waves that a shift is essentially a reflection but that is only because they are symmetric, a given sound signal wouldn't necessarily be symmetric right?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, you would want a reflection of some arbitrary signal.</p>
<p>In principle, you could break up any signal into a sum of sinusoids, using a fourier transform. I doubt that's practical (although a lot of signal processing works this way) for something like headphones which don't have much processing power or time to process, currently</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A simplified Fourier transform is very likely what they actually do.</p>
<p>I was doing FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) in the '90s on an 8 bit CPU operating at 3.5 MHz. Microcontrollers these days are far smaller, use far less energy, and are faster than that - you can totally stick a couple of those in your headphones.</p></div>		</li>
