<p>There's first of a caveat that energy conservation probably does not apply on a cosmological scale. </p>

<p>To expand, this is due to Noether's theorem:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem</a></p>
<p>Specifically, it turns out that every conservation law exists because of a symmetry in the universe.  Conservation of energy is bound up with time-independence, that physics behaves the same at all times.  The expansion/acceleration of the universe actually makes this untrue over truly gigantic distance and time scales, so energy is actually not conserved cosmologically - the energy of blue light that is redshifted down as the universe expands doesn't go into any potential energy, it's just gone.  Over small distance and time scales where the expansion of the universe does not have an effect, conservation of energy is close enough to exactly true.  There are other circumstances surrounding things happening to space that can hypothetically create energy in a similar way.</p></div>		</li>
