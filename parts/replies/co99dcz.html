<p>Where in life is this sort of difference even remotely important?</p>
<p>&quot;Bring me the Fox n Hound!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The what???&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know- the thing you clip to the wire that generates a signal and then probe you use to find the other end..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh- a toner and probe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right&quot;</p>
<p>Seriously- how is it important that you use one name or the other? I've never understood tests like that. Exams should test your comprehension of the theory- not whether you can recall a specific name. You can Google for a name- you can't Google comprehension.</p>
<p>Sorry- this is one of those things that just bugs me.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I'm not sure what his test was FOR, but I hardly think that knowing the correct name for your tools is an unimportant part of field knowledge. I mean, more in that the lack of awareness of the name could easily indicate a shallow or incomplete mastery of the field. If my electrician just called it his Black and Decker, and didn't actually know that it was called a drill, I'd be terrified. </p>
<p>A toner is a basic part of a cable maintenance toolkit. Know what it's called. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I have yet to hear someone call it a fox n hound in a job setting. You actually might get a &quot;A what?&quot; if someone never used this brand of toner before (as my boss did).  (Before this test the teacher kept referring to a toner as an fox n hound. After some discussion, he realised that he confused the hell out of all the students and gave us all points.)</p>
<p>No need to be sorry. I have flashback rage whenever I hear fox n hound. It wasn't the only thing the students had problems with this teacher. It was also the last (or 2nd to last) semester he instructed. They are having issues getting (almost anyone, let alone qualified) teachers at my Com. College. for the I.T program. For what I was told, they require a bachelor's degree to teach, they won't accept certs or on the job experience in replacement. If you have a bachelors you will make a lot more money elsewhere (than teaching). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: apparently, it really is called a Philips. The military always had them listed as cross-tip, so I adopted that name.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just like a Robertson screw driver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Philips and cross-tip are slightly different. A philips has extra ramps inside it so that it rides up instead of rounding off the screw. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the test is technically correct, nobody in IT around here calls it a toner probe, it's referred to as a Fox n Hound.  Just like people call a certain packing material bubble wrap, even though that's a trademarked brand-name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm guessing it's not quite as ubiquitous as bubble wrap.  somehow i've managed to work for over 15 years in a field where we use 'toners' and this is the first time i've ever heard them referred to as a 'fox and hound'. </p></div>		</li>
