			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe more comparable to making a sandwich:</p>
<p>You can butcher and roast the meats, strain the curds from whey and age the cheese, plant and harvest the vegetables, mill the grains and prepare the dough for baking bread.</p>
<p>Or you can just buy all the stuff from your grocer and assemble it in a few minutes. (<em>Or</em> you can just go to a convenience store and get one pre-made.)</p>
<p>Instead of simulating the flow of photons from light sources to camera for each and every pixel, a game can just look up which polygon or sprite affects which pixel, do a little bit of math with texture files, and maybe also get the result for neighboring pixels.</p></div>		</li>
