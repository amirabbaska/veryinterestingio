			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind caffeine also constricts the blood vessels which increases blood pressure. If you're a normal healthy human a little caffeine could provide some benefits during exercise which outweigh the negatives. If you're overweight, already have high blood pressure, or suffer from cardiac issues you'd be rolling the dice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there peer reviewed studies on this? I ask because I haven't seen any and I take roughly 500-600mg caffeine a day with a resting heart rate of 54-56. Haven't seen a notable increase to my blood pressure either, at 130/80. Been drinking this much caffeine for about a decade now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't recommend that unless you already exercise very regularly. Thats a huge strain on un-trained heart.</p>
<p>And if I'm not mistaken, caffeine, nicotine, any other stimulant, and acetylcholine (the chemical released from feeling stress) are all vasoconstrictors (constrict blood flow) which leads to less blood being oxygenated in the lungs, ie makes it harder to breathe. But if you already train, that wont be problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that cortisol, the main stress hormone, also constricts the blood vessels and increases blood pressure, so this would also strain your heart if you're stressed out while exercising. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a 32 yo male in good shape. I am active but I don't do any heavy aerobic exercise on a regular basis just light stuff. I walk a few miles every few days, jog sporadically (trying to increase that) and I am on my feet all day at work.
I have had tachycardia for as long as I can remember. My resting pulse is always around 100. My BP is normal. Just that high pulse.
Is there anything I should worry about? Doctor always says my heart sounds normal and I've had an EKG a few years ago that was normal.
I know regular cardio would maybe decrease my average pulse rate but I'm not a fat lazy slug who sits all day and eats junk. I think I'm pretty active and I'm pretty thin.
Should I be doing more or do some people just have a higher than normal pulse rate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/kjpmi Get an echo/heart ultrasound done and then get a blood test for thyroid gland hormones as well as eventually an ultrasound for the thyroid itself. Then youll know for sure what is the cause. High pulse longterm isnt good neither for your heart nor for your arteries. Could weaken both and cause even an aneurysm in few years time. Chances are its nothing or nothing serious, but its better to be certain. If its from the gland youll get some meds which should fix it. If its the heart/aorta itll depend on what the echo reveals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The exact risk depends on the cause. Tachycardia that emanates from outside of the heart (sinus tachycardia) is low risk. It's occurring in response to normal signals - although those signals may have abnormal origins (other medical or psychological problems). It's important to at least discuss it with a physician because long-term (over the course of decades) there can be structural changes occur as a result of unusual heart rate and they may want to put you on medication to reduce the chances of that.</p>
<p>The arrhythmias that create the greatest risk for sudden cardiac death are &quot;reentrant arrhythmias&quot; where the heart rate is elevated due to incorrect signaling within the heart. These are typically the result of the electrical system in the heart not working properly. Sometimes it results from genetics, other times from damage to the heart. In either event, it is possible for an arrhythmia to emerge where the heart does not effectively pump blood. The chances of this are very low, but it is possible. Again, see your doctor.  </p></div>		</li>
