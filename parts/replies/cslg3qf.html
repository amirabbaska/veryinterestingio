			<div class="markdown"><p>Even having that video, I think a better way to think of it is just to consider all that spinning.</p>
<p>Picture a ball, and things coming toward it from all directions.</p>
<p>And think of in the movies those &quot;slingshot&quot; trajectories in space.</p>
<p>You have tons of particles all wanting to slingshot around something, but they collide.</p>
<p>When they collide, their paths average out.</p>
<p>Eventually all that averages into a plane.</p>
<p>And that ball in the center, well that was just an imaginary point where the average center of gravity was for you to picture, because everything before was just dust and gas until it condensed down and started colliding a lot. Because it's not just one objects gravity affecting another. Every one of those particles has a tiny bit of gravity that are attracting one another to an average direction of force.</p>
<p>The video explains it better by virtue of being a video, but when limited to words, I think that's the ELI5 in my perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I think I am starting to understand this. My question is: are the planes always going to be different? Is the orientation of the plane just based on all of the particles net momentum? I don't know if that makes sense so I'll try to use an example.</p>
<p>Lets say our solar system is on a plane that is horizontal to the sun, are Saturn's rings also on that horizontal plane? Or can they be on a different plane based on the interactions of the particles surrounding Saturn? And a follow up, if they are different orientations, will they even out eventually? So that they are all on the same plane?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rings form around the same axis that their central body rotates around. E.g. If the Earth had rings, they would go around the equator. They wouldn't go from north to south.</p>
<p>Planets tend to orbit their star in same direction the sun rotates. Planets also tend to rotate in that same direction as their star, so the disks of the planets roughly align with the disk of the whole solar system. Each body tends to match the rotation of whatever larger body it is orbiting, so everything from Saturn's rings up to to the galaxy itself tend toward being on one plane and rotating in the same direction.</p>
<p>Venus and Uranus are currently the major exceptions in our solar system: Uranus rotates &quot;sideways&quot; (so its rings are &quot;sideways&quot; compared to the rest of the solar system), and Venus rotates backwards.</p>

<p>Edit: The part of your question about eventually evening out is beyond my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation is missing the essential piece that explains why the paths average out to a rotating disk instead of averaging out to a static cloud (or any other arrangement). If you just had small balls approaching a large ball from all directions, the average linear and rotational momentums would be zero in all directions.</p></div>		</li>
