			<div class="markdown"><p>A running process generally doesn't know what the OS is doing.  The OS gives the process the resources that the process asks for, assuming the resources are available. The running process doesn't really know what's going on outside of its chunk of memory, just what the OS tells it. If you kill a process, the OS just deallocates everything that was allocated to the process. What the process was doing doesn't matter, since it's the OS that controls all the resources of the computer. </p>
<p>This does cause problems sometimes, because the process doesn't have a chance to save anything or close what it was working on, it's just gone. That's why killing tasks like this should be the last option if they're not responding.</p></div>		</li>
