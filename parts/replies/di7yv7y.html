			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much how the factories work in China too.  Say they get an order for 1,000 units they probably make 1,100 in case some do not pass QC.  The overage they make it pretty much exactly the same thing with some flaws, these get sold at the local markets so essentially you're buying the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The extra 100, someone will probably take those extra 100 and sell them locally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is extremely common in india too. The difference here is that all the clothes are branded, for some reason if a few pieces are rejected, the whole batch (I don't know the batch sizes) gets rejected which mostly does contain good clothes too. The good clothes from the rejected batches are then sold for a fraction of the price in local stores in the city, these stores are now commonly known as factory surplus stores. You end up buying armani or timberland clothes for almost 1/10th the price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often they do it on purpose. They sign a contract with some brand to make that brand, and get all the official things they need to make it up to brand quality. They then go on to produce way more than they were contracted to make, with the intention of selling the extra (rejects plus whatever else they could make). Obviously this type of thing is a contract violation, but it makes them money if they don't get caught.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Usually not, these seamstress shops are not bound to a maximum production, only to a minimum, and what they sell &quot;elsewhere&quot; doesn't show the big name's brand label, so it's not even considered counterfeit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mi dispiace :(</p>
<p>I lived in Ostia,Roma. Not beautiful like Puglia but I am fond of it nonetheless. Luckily for me where I live now there are many Italians so I can still speak the language and buy most food that I want, except fish and fresh vegetables. Venderei la mia anima per un bel piatto di cicoria passata in padella con mozzarella di bufala  e pane scuro.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aw, man.  That <em>sucks</em>.</p>
<p>If there's any way you can change that, do.  Go home and feed your soul with the experience.  Fill your senses and mind and spirit with Italy and then take that back to the Czech Republic with you.  Sounds like it hasn't had a good meal in a while.  Even a couple days would fix a lot, if you can swing it.</p>
<p>I wish you a <em>buon viaggio</em> home, some day VERY soon.</p></div>		</li>
