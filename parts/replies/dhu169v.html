			<div class="markdown"><p>In the slightly-longer term I don't think your scenario is apocalyptic enough.</p>
<p>The problem: Albedo &amp; the freezing point of water.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <a href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/processes/albedo.html" target="_blank">albedo of ice is 0.5, compared to 0.06 from water</a>. This is a measure of how much sunlight is reflected off the surface, between 0 (absorbs all) and 1 (reflects all). The reason this is a problem, is that salty ocean water freezes at a lower temperature than fresh water (about 2 C lower). Take a look at everything that is <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MYD28M" target="_blank">darkish blue on here, but not white</a>. Most of that is going to freeze, and start reflecting light back to space. It looks like it could be ~ 10% of earths surface, which would increase the surface albedo from about 0.3 to 0.35. </p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget" target="_blank">23 W/m^2</a> average currently reflected by the surface, this would increase to 27, a loss of -4 W/m^2 average over the planet. By contrast, the net global warming energy change caused by humans is <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/" target="_blank">estiamted to be +1W/m^2</a>. This would be completely negating global warming, and pushing us well into a cooling and glaciation period.</p>
<p>And I'm not sure it stops there. Cooling things off substantially would cause more ocean to freeze, causing more cooling, in a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>In this situation, we could be looking at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth" target="_blank">snowball earth</a>.</p>
<p>I will say however, that climate systems are very complicated and I have ignored a lot of factors here. One of the biggest would be that reducing temperatures should lead to less evaporation, and hence less cloud formation. Clouds can reflect a lot of sunlight, so reducing cloud coverage could counteract the runaway effect. I don't really know enough to predict how exactly that would pan out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The extra ice is mostly confined to the poles, which receive a lower amount of insolation than the global average due to the high angle of incidence. This will tend to shrink the size of the effect, and the amount of energy reflected by the Earth's surface shouldn't grow as fast as a simple look at the average would suggest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct; I had not considered that. <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth103/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.earth103/files/module03/fig8sol.png" target="_blank">The annual average for the poles is about 190</a> compared to the global average of <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page2.php" target="_blank">340</a>. However, everything above 70 degrees or so ois already mostly frozen, so we should be looking at around 210 W/m^2 vs global 340. </p>
<p>This would reduce the net forcing to 60% of what I stated, but still give a significant cooling effect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this mean that cloud seeding could be a viable solution to combat the melting of the polar ice caps as well as rising ocean temperatures? </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are different types of clouds. <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Clouds/" target="_blank">Low clouds reflect sunlight, high clouds absorb it</a>. You'd have to make sure you know exactly how to target the correct clouds.</p>
<p>Water vapor outside of clouds also is a greenhouse gas and traps heat. </p>
<p>Climate is complicated and there is a lot that could go wrong with geoengineering schemes. I personally do not think they are a good idea at this point. It is easier to pass the bar of &quot;at least do no harm&quot; by stopping polluting than by doing some geoengineering scheme that we do not fully undrstand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with the deep convection mostly shut down during hot climates with primarily salinity-driven ocean convection, you still get around half of the current oceanic heat transfer due to wind-driven surface circulation.  If you shut down everything, by, say, splitting the ocean into bits with land squares between them, it would be much colder towards the poles and much warmer near the equator.</p>
<p>If this condition had always existed, you'd probably have a problem with the Earth drying out and becoming a desert.  The boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere goes up rapidly with temperature of the water over warm water, which lets more water sneak up past that boundary and up into thermosphere, where some of it is split and some of the hydrogen lost to space.  During warm episodes, the Earth has been close to warm enough for this to be a big problem over the course of billions of years.</p>
<p>With higher latitudes staying cold, I'd think you'd have reduced weathering and increased CO2 as well, which would make the problem worse, but weathering would increase at low latitudes, so the sign of the effect isn't obvious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make a good point about the transition to fresh water oceans, basically some domesday stuff resulting from anything that has evolved to live in a salt water environment.  Did a little googling about fish and it looks like they would actually drown to death from too much H2O.</p>
<p>Now assuming it were on a smaller scale, say the Mediterranean Sea or somewhere, could a freshwater system generate enough &quot;replacement&quot; life?</p>
<p>I'm newer to Reddit, what's up with those shadowbanned users?  Why my post?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some freshwater species might move into the sea, but it's still a pretty alien environment to them. Also between the massive amounts of dead stuff and slow return of nutrients to the ocean you'd probably get some weird boom-bust cycles of algae or other microbes, which could deoxygenate regions of the oceans and produce toxins and methane. You might even see some long-term effects on the atmospheric composition, now that a good deal of the oxygen-producing plankton is dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes reddit bans people, but doesn't tell them they are banned. This is called a &quot;shadowban&quot;. They can still post, comment, and vote as normal, but none of their actions actually register to the real site. So spammers keep on spamming, not knowing that no one is seeing their spam, rather than just making new accounts and starting over. </p>
<p>As far as why your post, it's nothing personal, it happens on most posts. If you see a post that claims to have 17 comments, and then when you visit the comments section and only see 10, then there have been 7 spam comments by shadowbanned users. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ocean fish are usually hypotonic, being less saline (salty) than their environment, and so must drink sea water to keep their salt level high enough.
