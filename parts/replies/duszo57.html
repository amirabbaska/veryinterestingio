			<div class="markdown"><p>To pile on here... the first patent for technology that lead to FAX was  British patent 9745 on May 27, 1843 &quot;Electric Printing Telegraph&quot; by Scottish inventor Alexander Bain. </p>
<p>The first photo transmitted by a &quot;proto-fax machine&quot; was a photo of President Calvin Coolidge sent from New York to London on November 29, 1924 </p>
<p>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax" target="_blank">Source for both the above.</a>)</p>
<p>They use a &quot;proto-fax machine&quot; in the movie 1968 Steve McQueen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullitt" target="_blank">Bullitt</a>  to transmit a picture. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQGAaCSFlJI" target="_blank">Here's the scene.</a> Doing a bit of searching it looks like it would've taken 6-10 minutes per page in the real world. </p>
<p>Most people seem to assume FAX machines were invented till the 80s but the technology existed for decades. It was just so expensive that most people would never encounter it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;However, the team at Jodrell Bank picked up the signal and someone recognised it as the signal for a fax machine. These were quite rare at the time, but eventually someone managed to borrow the right equipment (...) from the offices of the Daily Express newspaper.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the sake of clarity, it's worth noting that Voyager digitized the images directly out of the Vidicon. They were never stored or transmitted as analog. There were a handful of earlier planetary missions (Mariners 6 and 7, for instance) that did transmit analog images, but it was highly susceptible to interference and degradation, so the digital transition occurred as soon as it became practical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also noteworthy that the transmitter is way too weak to be received on earth, at least from this distance the signal strength was way below background radiation. So what they did was basically send the picture bit by bit and repeating one bit thousands of times before transmitting the next one. Then they averaged all their measurements to get a tiny peak above background.</p>
<p>So basically there is this calculator flying around screaming ONE, ONE, ONE, ONE, ONE, ONE, ONE or ZERO, ZERO, ZERO, ZERO, ZERO for weeks just to get a single picture back to earth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since we're going full-on space-nerd in here: ACHCKTUALLY, this is not how erasure code (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenated_error_correction_code" target="_blank">RS</a>) work on Voyager - FEC code was one of the primary reasons to go digital.</p>
<p>You have to realize at those distances the signal is INSANELY noisy (-175dBm, +8dBm at <strong>1Hz</strong>). FEC parameters are tuned exactly according to noise level so that you transmit redundant bits close to shannon limit and not much more. There's very little guesswork involved as you can't afford to blast link with garbage when theres important instrument feed data to fetch, too.</p>
<p>(indeed if you were analog, where all you could do is overlay multiple shots on analog grain film, same way low tech astronomers did filter their shots with HDR back then).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do a lot of things in 70 KB, especially as what it required on such spacecraft does not required millions of lines of code.</p>
<p>If you remember the early 90s 'demo scene' on computers there was a category called '4K demos' where your whole executable had to be no more than 4KB (usually coded in assembler)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Want to know something amazing?  People still program with that limitation.  Microcontrollers often have 4k of Program memory, and 256 bytes (that's not a typo) of ram.</p>
<p>Why?  Because the ones with more memory cost ten cents more, and that times several million is quite a bit of money. It's cheaper to pay someone stupid amounts of money to work with that limitation, than to spend ten cents more per unit.</p></div>		</li>
