			<div class="markdown"><p>When you throw a ball up in the air, and it stops for one brief shining moment, motionless in the air and bereft of kinetic energy, where did that energy go?  We describe that lost energy as 'potential energy', and it's a property of gravy fields. After that brief momentof motionlessness, with nothing supporting it the ball comes back down, regaining that energy as it does so. </p>
<p>So it goes with light, except that light is faster than the escape velocity of most gravity fields, so it doesn't usually come back down - that potential energy is just lost. If you put a mirror up in the sky, then the light would come back down, and it would blueshift again as it regained the potential energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conservation of energy is due to time symmetry, the idea that an interaction works the same if you reverse the direction of time. This only holds exactly true in flat spacetime. When you add gravity, which allows time to pass at different rates in different places, time symmetry no longer holds and so neither does conservation of energy.</p>
<p>This is why photons can lose energy coming out of a gravity well (or gain energy falling into it), as well as why it's ok for inflation/dark energy to seemingly create energy from nothing. It's also possible to exploit this property of curved spacetime to <a href="http://web.mit.edu/wisdom/www/swimming.pdf" target="_blank">get momentum out of nowhere</a>, which is kinda neat. (Edit: better link, not paywalled!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Article behind a paywall. Is this actually useful in any way, or is it like &quot;the math totally works, but we would need negative energy to make it happen, and as far as we know that's still impossible.&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure! Light emitting gas on the surface of the sun tends to move toward and away from the surface caused by random gas motions and also due to magnetic fields pulling on the gas. When light is emitted from the gas as the gas moves toward us, we can measure the velocity of the light and compare it to the rest velocity of light. If gas is moving toward us, then the velocity of the light would appear to move slower than rest velocity and the light will be blueshift and redshift if the gas was moving away from us. </p>
<p>For our sun, the blue and redshifted light caused by the gas motions on the surface is much greater than the gravitational redshift experienced by a photon moving out of the sunâ€™s gravity well, making it very difficult to detect. </p></div>		</li>

<p>not really for the sun since gas motions near the surface of the sun cause a Doppler shift in the frequency of departing light that is larger than the gravitational redshift. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I recall, the magnitudes of the Doppler shifts induced by convective blueshift and gravitational redshift are of the same order of magnitude for typical stars (a few hundred m/s in apparent radial velocity).</p>
<p>However, the combined effect of the two is usually calibrated out (e.g. by fitting a offset between the two stars in a double lined spectroscopic binaries) or simply ignored (e.g. planet radial velocities can happily be expressed in relative terms).</p></div>		</li>
