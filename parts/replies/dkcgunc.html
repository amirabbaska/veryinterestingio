<p>Not only do you have the reward associated with the drug itself, and its effects on dopamine, but you also have a myriad of &quot;cues&quot; that act as part of the reinforcement of the memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if the addict has the substance they are addicted to (post-chemical withdrawal) <em>just once</em> (like me having one cigarette after three months of zero nicotine); do they experience something different to someone who has never tried that substance before? Is it a case that the brain kind of 'recognises' that which it was previously addicted to and all those reward pathways are still there waiting? Or is it because the drug in itself acts like a &quot;cue&quot;? Kinda like &quot;smoking reminds me of smoking&quot;.</p>
<p>As an example, I know that in me smoking one cigarette seems to reignite more intense cravings over the next few days. But is it because I <em>remember</em> smoking or is it is the nicotine itself? If I hit my head and got amnesia an hour after I smoked, would I still have more intense cravings the next few days and not know why? Or are these all questions we don't know the answer to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that all those extra receptors are not gone, they are just downregulated. When you reintroduce nicotine (or whatever substance they receive) then they can be reactivated much more quickly than a nicotine-naive person can develop new receptors. So, yes, a 'former' addict will bounce back to the height of their tolerance levels very quickly.</p>
<p>No, it generally doesn't mean that ONE cigarette or ONE shot of heroin will instantly make you fully addicted again. It takes days or weeks of continual dosages to get back to previous tolerance whereas someone who was never addicted would likely take months before they would even feel withdrawals upon cessation.</p>
<p>The reason you felt cravings immediately is more likely attributed to the mental side of addiction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Aaah....I see.....I wasn't aware that there were <em>extra</em> receptors for an addict. Which leads me to a couple of further questions if you don't mind: </p>
<p>1) Do we know if the extra receptors and addict has ever disappear or is that it for life?</p>
<p>2) Do those extra receptors mean that the former smoker actually gets more pleasure from the cigarette than the newbie?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically the answer. Gene expression changes and there is some &quot;memory&quot; in cells and they can more quickly up regulate nicotine receptors for a recently clean addict that relapsed vs one that's been clean for years or never has tried the drug.</p>
<p>So you go back to square 1. You were X months into recovery, now you're back at 2 weeks... On a cellular level.</p>
<p>It sucks. That's why smoking is insidious. I quit for 6 years and started again a couple of years ago.. I dread the day when I will have to battle with the addiction again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there is a phenomenon called sensitization that increases over time after abstinence that can make the response to the drug more potent.  But that sensitization does subside with time.  As to your last question well the ability to disentangle the direct effects of the drug - e.g. nicotine - from the embedded memories is not as easy as one would think.  There is reactivation of the whole circuitry.  For instance, there is some evidence that nicotine can upregulate a form of the dopamine receptor (D2 form) that then enhances reward.  What is not known is how long this elevated response of the dopamine D2 receptor persists for.  There are many other changes in brain networks induced by nicotine.   This is a very interesting article that reviews studies in humans, unfortunately it is somewhat technical:</p>

<p>Most ex-smokers I know claim the urge to smoke when drinking is often much stronger than when they are not drinking, likely because the alcohol lowers inhibitions and allows stronger expression of the nicotine-cue associated network.  Smoking is also for some a physically pleasurable activity that will also consolidate the addictive network.</p>
<p>It is an interesting question about the effects of amnesia, there is evidence that stroke damage to the insula, a brain region known to be important in addictive circuitry, caused patients to &quot;forget&quot; their cigarette habits </p>

<p>like methamphetamine, having over 90% relapse rates.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relapse rates for drug addiction are very high and meth has a higher relapse rate than other drugs. However, saying over 90% is just wrong. There has been 1 study that showed an 88% relapse rate for meth addicts and they were not able to reproduce that study. Please don't cherry pick data and then exaggerate your cherry-picked data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not cherry picking data.  These studies are very difficult because it is hard to keep track of the meth addicts over a long period of time -  as a consequence one can say that there are not many good studies of treatment with long-term follow-ups.  Further, even when one desires to treat meth-addicts who themselves seek treatment the attrition rates are very high (this study found an 86% attrition after 24 weeks: Subst Abus. 2010 Apr;31(2):98-107. doi: 10.1080/08897071003641578.)</p>
<p>Numerous studies of short-term follow-ups (i.e. &lt;1year) can show fairly high abstinence rates, approaching 60-70% (e.g. Addiction. 2004 Jun;99(6):708-17.), but these studies don't address the long term relapse rate that is more important than what happens in the first year.  </p>
<p>One long term study showed that the abstinence rate peaks at about 3 months. The study found between 75-87% relapse at some point within 5 years (depending upon how relapse was defined), notwithstanding the fact that there may have been multiple periods of abstinence within those 5 years:
Drug Alcohol Depend. 2014 Jun 1;139:18-25. doi: 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.02.702. Epub 2014 Mar 12.</p>
<p>The good news of that study was that there was a long-term treatment group (a fraction of the original group) that was able to reduce relapse at a higher rate.  </p>
<p>This study showed that three different protocols all had between about 82-92% relapse rates over 3 years (depending upon the treatment protocol), although good reductions were obtained for three months of treatment.
Addiction. 2012 Nov;107(11):1998-2008. doi: 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2012.03933.x. Epub 2012 Jul 12.</p>
<p>Does the exact number matter whether it is 80% or 90%?  Not really, since the hardest part is getting meth addicts to commit to follow long term therapy.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a reformed person, I will tell you that the triggers are because there isn't anything higher. So you need to create a higher feeling as that's what humans do, we all re-enact the highest level of being we have achieved. Stock brokers feel good when they are making money on numbers, and they need to do this - try not seeing the girl that means the most to you in the world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting point, and one that is probably hard to quantify and to turn into more effective treatments.  A lot of 12 step programs are successful because they help people avoid triggers (like people in AA won't go to bars), but it is likely more difficult to replicate the same high feeling they had with safer things - at least for addicts.  </p></div>		</li>
