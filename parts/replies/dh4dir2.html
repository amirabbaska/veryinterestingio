			<div class="markdown"><p>of course there is, but parts per million, a far less static environment, and a replenishment of &quot;new air&quot; is continuous. When a car drives out of a construction site into your lane, and kicks up a cloud of dust, undoubtedly that air is less &quot;fresh&quot; then the air in your house, but in five minutes that air will be &quot;fresh&quot; again. I'm not sure the same would be true if we replicated the experiment in your living room. So yeah, for the most part.. The air outside is &quot;fresher&quot;</p></div>		</li>
