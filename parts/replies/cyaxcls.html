			<div class="markdown"><p>This is by far the best answer in the thread so far. It clearly articulates the specific differences, without being excessively technical. It also avoids the elitist attitude of many &quot;pros&quot;.</p>
<p>But, most importantly it rightfully acknowledges that cheap cameras such as GoPro 4K and even some smartphones(heresy I know) are now producing video of exceptional quality and, in the right circumstances, their videos appear as good or better than a lot of stuff I see shot on REDs.</p>
<p>We've all seen exceptional video from iPhones and crap from Reds. That's not usually the case, but it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shooting a documentary about barbecue cultures in a dozen countries around the world. Using the Sony a7s with an Atomos Shogun, an external recorder that lets me shoot 4K.</p>
<p>I needed something with great low light (shooting it without lights as both a practical and creative descision), I wanted a full frame (not just super 35) sensor so that I have a shallow depth of field on mid/wide angle lenses, and we're shooting 4K because I wanted to have subjects be very small in frame with their large world around them. I have a sound recordist with me so it doesn't matter that DSLRs do poor sound.</p>
<p>Only things I don't like is I have to rig it up with the Shogun, which is fine for most shots but when you want to knock off a quick shot it can be cumbersome (sort of overrides the smallness of the DSLR) - so the new a7sII would be perfect for that - but I don't want to change systems mid shoot. I'd also kill for an inbuilt ND filter like the FS7 - but no full frame sensor camera currently has that.
And being based in Australia Sony's support is woeful - they class the a7s as a consumer camera so when we had a problem with the camera it took 6 weeks to repair with awful call centre support. Luckily it's a cheap camera relatively so we own two now - which is great considering we're filming in some pretty weird places around the world. We can also source them around the world fairly easy should disaster strike. Atomos Shogun on the other hand have been amazingly good to deal with when we had to swap one over.</p>
<p>So yeah, a few drawbacks, but getting stunning images so all worth it!</p></div>		</li>
