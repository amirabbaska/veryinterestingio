			<div class="markdown"><p>The real question, nature as a philosophical term is highly ambiguous and I'm not sure even we as humans can agree on what we mean by it... It's a fairly abstract concept. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure you could, but the only point for having the words 'natural' and 'artificial' is for one to mean made by man and one to mean not made by man.</p>
<p>Just words we've come up with at the end of the day.  And making that distinction itself in the first place is of course by it's own definition artificial.</p>
<p>Although we have quite a noticeable effect on our environment currently so it seems like a big deal, the natural/artificial dichotomy is pretty minor thing in the big scheme of things.</p>
<p>We could have words for every sub-set of made-by/not-made by whatever group of creatures really.   Most of this air we are breathing is planktificial/whatever etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it's always weird to me that a nest by a bird would be natural, but a house by a human wouldn't be. We are all just smart monkeys, even stuff like phones is a part of (next) nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, at what point did we become unnatural? I think this unnatural saying is a fairly new thing which we made up because we don't really understand how things work around us. For example, do you understand how pipings work? They are just pipes, with physical qualities, and we can use them to carry water depending on those qualities and the forces acting on them. However, this is not obvious to some people, and they just think it's too complicated and &quot;unnatural&quot;. (Let's say that it's an umbrella term for man-made stuff) Sorry, I'm soon to be an engineer, so somebody can think of better examples, if they don't understand this.</p>
<p>Also, it could be a moral thing because we swayed away from old, Christian morals. So we do things that were taboo before or couldn't even be imaginable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Natural literally means not made by human hands or industry.</p>
<p>It's not an ambiguous term to indicate something that was made rather than grown, it's a very specific term made to discern the results of human activity from the rest of the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, we use these terms in a non-overlapping way because it is useful. However, the thought that using these terms may be an indication that humans like to distinguish themselves from &quot;lower&quot; forms of nature is interesting. Almost like the story of Adam and Eve has had a profound impact on how we view ourselves as distinguished from other life forms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is fine when using the words colloquially, but there is a basis for discussing the concepts and mindsets it can induce.</p>
<p>Language informs and directs thought, for some natural=good unnatural=bad, yet this is clearly a gross oversimplification of reality, saying that everything we do is part of nature is a way to address that.</p>
<p>Words have context for a reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because humans rearranging things found in nature to make more useful things is the same concept as building a nest, just massively, massively scaled up in sophistication.</p></div>		</li>
