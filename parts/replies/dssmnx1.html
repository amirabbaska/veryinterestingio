			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not accurate to say that PWM dimming of LEDs is used exclusively in cheap applications. It's used in nearly all applications, including the best-in-the-world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEjG8XLzuvs" target="_blank">theatrical LED luminaire</a>.</p>
<p>It is much more economical to dim this way based on the physics of semiconductor devices like LEDs. However, some implementations are (much) better than others!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think it does happen less when using PWM due to the differences in the voltage-luminance curves for each differently colored LED in the setup, unless the LED controller factors that in when using voltage control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time to plug in my shameless recommendation. Usually, dimmers and all LED lights speak different languages, so you would often get what OP said and more, but this is because LEDs are just super efficient (light emitting diodes) you can even make them your own. One of the better deals you can get is from a company called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;asin=&amp;isAmazonFulfilled=1&amp;isCBA=&amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;orderID=&amp;seller=AIUTRPJQF9XV3&amp;tab=&amp;vasStoreID=" target="_blank">bioluz</a>, they even offer no cost replacements and a warranty guarantee. You would be saving four bucks on all bulbs monthly too, so I'm super surprised people still use Halogen bulbs, LED lights literally can live 30x longer but they are VERY nimble so just watch out it can sometimes be a hit and a miss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, it depends on the tint that you’re shifting. For instance, most lighting designers are used to having a heavy amber shift in conventional lights - As the fixture gets dimmer, it shifts away from white and more towards amber. And now in the last few years, lighting designers have had to totally change the way they handle certain things like gels, which are used to color the lights. </p>
<p>Many lighting designers are so used to the way conventional look, that suddenly jumping to LED’s looks <em>incredibly</em> harsh and stark in contrast. This is largely because they’re used to having lights shift towards warmer colors as they dim, whereas LED’s will just stay white. So a lighting designer’s first instinct is to go “oh geez that’s too harsh, dim it down a little.” But then it doesn’t get any less harsh, because all of the white they’re expecting to shift is still there. This is a big part of why many companies have started pairing amber and white LED’s together in a single fixture. They’re able to be controlled independently. If a designer wants something to be less harsh, it’s a matter of bringing the white level down and the amber level up to compensate. Or, alternatively, simply using RGB LED’s, so you don’t need to use gels to begin with.</p>
<p>The big issue thus far has been the fact that amber LED’s aren’t anywhere near as bright as an equivalent white LED. For the same reason that blue LED’s tend to be brighter than equivalent red LED’s - It takes more power to produce certain wavelengths. So when dealing with those high power wavelengths, you’ll get less light with the same amount of power going in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I chuckled, but yes that's correct. Pulse width/density/amplitude/frequency modulation are just concepts, which happen to lend themselves well to &quot;nice&quot; solutions in the physical world for LED applications. There's nothing to say that their use in an application has to be low quality or poorly implemented.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, there are also tradeoffs like color shift that manifest when current is varied to an LED instead of modulating with a fixed current. This could be undesirable to lesser or greater degrees depending on the end product need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question, they might.</p>
<p>Determining what frequencies of flicker people are sensitive to is a very tedious and subjective process so I can't find the same charts for dogs as humans but it seems that they can clearly identify a flickering light at 70-80 Hz based off <a href="http://redwood.berkeley.edu/bruno/animal-eyes/dog-vision-miller-murphy.pdf" target="_blank">this Berkley paper</a> which means things that look smooth to you may flicker to them</p>
<p>I'll dig into this more in the morning, it'll be a fun discussion at work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. For similar reasons, the incidence of dogs and animals watching TV has gone way up since various flat panel technolgies have come into use. The old CRTs were distractingly flickery for a lot of dogs and they couldn't make sense of it.  Newer TV's are much better in this regard and so more animals can watch it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>almost all high-quality LEDs are PWM'd, ignore the guy above</p>
<p>the reason they flicker when you look quickly is because it doesn't matter and regulation doesn't specify otherwise... 60hz is fine for DRLs and HBs</p>
<p>no-flicker frequency is reserved for things that need to look pretty or appear steady, like airport runway lights or emergency vehicle lighting... it doesn't necessarily cost a lot more, it just requires more power per lumen so its a waste in limited power systems like a 12.8v car battery</p></div>		</li>
