			<div class="markdown"><p>The third issue with a military coup is the fact a system is not corrupted in a day. </p>
<p>Hypothetically, were Trump to declare himself dictator during his presidency and if that actually worked (managing to pass necessary legislation in Congress and Senate) that would mean the system was already ready for it in the first place. To what state would the military then be able to restore it to? </p>
<p>It's the same principle as the one physicians cite for back problems. Many people think a single activity is the reason for their back problems (and that is <em>sometimes</em> true) but back problems come creeping; they (generally) come as a result of lifestyle. The last straw is often one significant event, but the problem has been building up to a tipping point.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I would highlight that it's not just that the system allowed it to happen, but the <em>people</em> in that system, and the population of the US, allowed it to happen. It's one thing for the military to wave a magic wand and change the rules to reset the system, but they cannot reset a complacent and ignorant population, nor can they reset a corrupt, selfish and spineless political class.</p>
<p>These changes can take at least a generation to reverse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People like screaming dictator a lot, but let's say in a purely hypothetical scenario that Trump said &quot;Hey, we should get rid of term limits on Presidents.&quot; Thereby allowing him, Obama, Bush, Clinton, and Bush again to run for office a third time.</p>
<p>Well, him saying it means shit. So what if 2/3s of our state governments voted for it?</p>
<p>Well, that's how the 22nd Amendment passed, and we can pass amendments that remove amendments. Nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Sometimes changing our rule of law is literally, rule of law. We allow our government to be amended, and we allow those amendments to be amended.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If this government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capability of this technology. (...)</p>
<p>I don't want to see this country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A President declaring a dictatorship in that contrived situation, where Congress and Supreme Court are under his thumb, would still be civilian rule. To whom would a military coup return power back to? The Congress that gave the dictator the powers he wanted? The Supreme Court that refused to strike down the Congress' laws as unconstitutional? Set up a new election with... who as candidates, exactly? Congresscritters or other elected politicians who allowed the dictatorship to rise? Some noteworthy military officers that were instrumental in the coup?</p>
<p>And who's to say this new president elected after the military ensures an honest election won't just turn around and have the other institutions declare him a dictator, now that the previous dictator proved that it can be done? Would that mean the military has to carry out another coup?</p>
<p>If it ever comes to a point where the military needs to uphold &quot;constitutional order&quot; via coup, then constitutional order has failed. In fact, the military carrying out a coup would be unconstitutional and in breach of their oath to uphold the constitution. They can, and must, refuse to obey a president claiming unconstitutional degrees of power, but it is not within the military's constitutional mandate to depose the President or any other civilian branch of government. Only Congress and the Supreme Court have that authority, and if those to institutions fail to do so, then the US constitution itself has failed. And it would not be the first democratic constitution to fail in history, despite it being over a century since its' last failure (the Civil War).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Had Mace Windu killed Palpatine in that moment, where would power fall? The Jedi? Han and Owen in the original trilogy already prove that the majority of the galaxy viewed them with suspicion, either as a hokey religion or hopeless crusaders. Would a Galactic Republic ruled by the Jedi be any better than a Galactic Empire ruled by the Sith?</p>
<p>If anything, a failure of the government on that level, that the military is forced to step in and depose the dictator, means that it is impossible to fix, and will continue spiraling out of control for years. And that's bad enough when it's &quot;over there&quot; in Europe or Africa or Asia, in a country the size of one of the US's metropolitan areas, but when it's the United States? Let me remind you that we have the firepower to obliterate all life on the planet several times over.</p>
<p>We owe it to the world not to have a failure of government on that level.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This. The founders write about it quite a bit in their various letters/exchanges. The basic idea they kind of settled on was that a standing army was essentially no more than a mercenary force for the king.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colonial history professor here.  Harvard professor Bernard Bailyn won the Pulitzer for his &quot;Ideological Origins of the American Revolution&quot; back in the 1960s.  It's an amazing book that looks at how mid 18th century colonists viewed their political world, and there's a couple chapters about how they looked to history for proof of how things around them in the present were going south.  Worth the read if you're a history or AmRev buff, although it's a tough read.  It's tough not because it's bad, but because every paragraph is just so important.  It's the kind of thing you read a chapter of, and just think about it for a week until you get to the next chapter.</p>
<p>edit: It's an important enough monograph to warrant its own Wikipedia page:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it wasn't so much skepticism of standing armies. They knew damn well how powerful a standing army could be. They just recognized that a standing army tends to be beholden to the people putting food in their mouths and paying their way. In order for a government to be of the people, by the people, and for the people, the people were going to have to also be responsible to defend it if/when called upon. </p>
<p>Also, people tend to be a bit more involved and concerned about politics when their own butt is personally on the line. It's easy to &quot;send the troops&quot; when it's someone else going. When that involves sending yourself, most people are a bit more reserved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This (especially the &quot;hence&quot;) is something in which I'm interested.  Can you point to sources that might discuss this?</p>
<p>It's a topic that comes up and is quickly quashed in gun regulation discussions, cause since DC vs Heller it's often held that the &quot;well-regulated militia&quot; clause is irrelevant or meaningless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The courts have since reinterpreted constitutional law, which is part of their job -- after all, circumstances change. The &quot;well-regulated militia&quot; clause doesn't really apply any more since the US no longer has a need for a militia; but it was clearly relevant to the people who drafted the Bill of Rights, or they wouldn't have included it.</p>
<p>The exact meaning of the clause is in some dispute (particularly over what is exactly meant by &quot;militia&quot; and &quot;state&quot;), but it is known that the Founding Fathers were keen to avoid having a standing army. Take, for example, James Madison's address to the Constitutional Convention in 1787:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>America was making a conscious effort to break from what was seen as the tyranny of European monarchies, and to the Founding Fathers a standing army was a terrifying prospect. But a military force is needed to defend against attack (the US had just fought a war to gain independence), so if you don't have a standing army, you need a militia. And if you have a militia, you need it to be armed.</p>
<p>That was, of course, in the days when soldiers fought with muskets. Things are a bit different now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That speaks well to the concern.</p>
<p>The US no longer needs a militia for dealing with significant threats to the republic.  It has a standing army (and other standing military forces).  If the framers/founders wrote the constitution on the assumption (or the very strong hopes) that there would be no standing army, then how do we read their intentions that now there is one, and we've had such for a long time?</p>
<p>I think pre-US history, the English common law that informed US law, keys into the right to arms for civilians informing the ability (edit: for the state) to have equipped levies available, rather than matters of personal defense, hunting or sport.</p>
<p>Eh, I didn't want to get 2nd-amendment mired.  Am very interested though in the thoughts of Revolution-period thinkers who informed the Constitution about standing armies and the 2nd amendment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken, didn't DC v Heller establish that the &quot;well regulated militia&quot; referred to the standing military and various reserve elements (well regulated by laws, regulations and customs) while the unregulated militia was literally every person of military age who owned and could fire a gun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But <em>if</em> the founders were actively trying to avoid having a standing military (which I interpreted from the quote I indicated, and is also my personal opinion from my own understanding of revolutionary-period history), then obviously the interpretation of the 2nd amendment is that the barring of infringement on the right to bear arms is in service to ensuring the adequate armament of a military force of irregulars (&quot;minutemen&quot; or emergency levies from the civilian population).</p>
<p>I interpret the founders as saying &quot;because we're not going to have a standing army, we need this 2nd amendment to ensure we have a readily available force in case the British come back or to protect the body politic&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
