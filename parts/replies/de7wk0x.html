			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a particularly niche area of expertise and is certainly something I don't think I have ever heard of before. Is there a large call for textile conservation experts? Do you have to specialise in a particular type of textile?  Once you are finished and get a job, what would your actual job title be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their ecosystem is in collapse, so it's not surprising that some people are studying on how to prevent total textile extinction from happening. My cousin works at a zoo and she said that they have been trying to start a textile exhibit but that they are very hard to care for. They are very social so you need to get them in pairs. Not only that, but the zoo would need to have a seamstress on retainer in case they get into a fight or an accident happens. It really depends on how aggressive that particular breed can be. </p>
<p>And to answer your question, OP is likely specializing in the study of a specific breed of textile, such as towels or parachutes. It's very important that we keep textiles around for the foreseeable future. A loss of even a few important breeds could be devastating to human society, researchers have been warning. As your post illustrates, this field goes unnoticed by most people yet the importance of it cannot be understated. Spread the word. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a niche area of general art conservation. Not many schools offer a program in just textiles. There is a fairly open job market because there are a lot of jobs in museums available and in private work. You can specialize in a particular area of textiles or a time period but conservation techniques apply to all textiles.</p></div>		</li>
