			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 criteria used when assessing whether a drug should be banned</p>
<p>1) The potential for enhanced performance<br />
2)  The potential for being detrimental to health<br />
3)  Violation of the spirit of sport</p>
<p>Its worth noting that this drug was banned because it started showing up in new more sensitive tests i.e. a lot of athletes tests had this present (17% of Russian athletes tests).  It was only available in Eastern Europe as it is not approved for use in the EU or USA.  This prompted an investigation as to why it was turning up in so many samples and led to it being added to the banned list as of Jan 1st. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does 'injured' tissues include muscle tissue that's been damaged naturally through exercise? </p>
<p>Because then it would be an aid to athletes even when used only during training: both powerlifters and marathon runners normally have to rest for a long period to let their muscles heal up before using them again; if this process was somehow accelerated by the drug, I bet lots of athletes would use it. (And probably suffer all kinds of negative consequences later on but never mind that)</p></div>		</li>
