			<div class="markdown"><p>There was also American Airlines 587 which crashed into a neighborhood in Queens two months after 9/11 -- Nov 12th 2001. US had just started bombing Afghanistan for a few weeks and there was a lot of speculation that al Qaeda was behind it and there would be another wave of attacks and no airplane was safe etc.</p>
<p>In fact there were al Qaeda claims of responsibility, including one as late as 2002 where a detainee claimed it was brought down by a &quot;shoe bomb.&quot;</p>
<p>It turned out to just be human error.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the in-flight separation of the vertical stabilizer as a result of the loads beyond ultimate design that were created by the first officerâ€™s unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs. Contributing to these rudder pedal inputs were characteristics of the Airbus A300-600 rudder system design and elements of the American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh, yes - I remember that one well. It was utterly horrifying, and the video footage of the panic in peoples' eyes and voices in that neighborhood in the aftermath of the crash is quite intense. An event which taught us a lot about wake turbulence and rudder training for pilots, and would have been a major tragedy by itself, appeared all the worse for the context in which it occurred.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it was really a horrible event and they had the video footage on 24/7. For quite a while it was as if the other shoe had dropped after 9/11 and speculation was running on how many more planes were coming down. Then a month later there was Richard Reid attempting to bring down another plane, just a few days after bin Laden had escaped at Tora Bora. That was a really tense time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also the case that bombings aren't necessarily acts of terrorism, even if they cause terror. For example, if a car explodes, it might be that someone wanted to kill the specific person who owned the car. This is &quot;simple&quot; murder, not terrorism.</p>
<p>When the attack is not intended merely as a means of killing individuals, but as a way to seek some larger response through intimidation, that's generally seen as terrorism.</p>
<p>It becomes blurry when an otherwise &quot;terrorist&quot; organization engages in more targeted killing (e.g. if IS were to try to kill the President of the US). These are acts of terrorism in the sense that terrorists are the ones carrying out the attack, but that's not the same thing as terrorism in the more precise sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the time I posted my comment above, 8 hours after the original question was posted, the distinction between terroristic attacks and non-terroristic attacks had been well-covered by others in the thread, including myself in response to another poster. This one wasn't posted to be a &quot;complete reply&quot; to the OP, as I figured it would be buried, and I honestly just wanted to provide the OP with a couple examples of situations where a major response was initiated, but turned out not to be needed.</p>
<p>Naturally, as typically happens here on Reddit, my response about the distinction between terroristic and non-terroristic bombing vanished in obscurity, and this reply with examples of non-bomb events launched itself up the ranks. C'est la vie!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that is because the distinction is more or less negligible to most of the rest of us. A bomb is always a message, and that message is, 'You fucked with the wrong guy. Everyone else: don't fuck with me.&quot; Or, &quot;I have the power, and there's nothing you can do about it. RIP your sense of security.&quot; The semantic duel seems pointless when the response and end result are precisely the same.</p>
<p>With explosions, there are 'attacks' and 'accidents'. The 'terrorism' tag is just rhetoric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A guy in my hometown committed suicide by opening the gas line in the basement and breathing the fumes. Eventually the house blew up. It shattered windows up to a block away and totaled the facing walls of his neighbors houses. His shingles were in my dads yard over a mile away. Luckily no one was hurt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my first thought. </p>
<p>But the question is 'why do people say they will treat <em>bombs</em> (not explosions)......' Which implies that a bomb has been discovered. </p></div>		</li>
