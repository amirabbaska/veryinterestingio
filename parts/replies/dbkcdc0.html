			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the universe is a blanket, and the black hole is a ball, as the ball moves, it affects the blanket. The idea behind this is that as the black holes are interacting with the &quot;blanket&quot; we are able to read these shifts. Then we just take that info and translate it to a more easily understood medium. The waves of gravity would be similar to the waves of sound, so that is easily transferable. Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose that makes sense, converting the data into a different medium. However, isn't it possible that's not what a black hole sounds like if given the chance to merge in an atmosphere?</p>
<p>I've never understood the blanket example. Is it showing how a planar piece of space gets warped into a &quot;droop&quot;? I get that the gravity is so intense it warps space, but the blanket example, I'm unsure of where that &quot;droop&quot; is going. If it's dimension we can't see, doesn't that make you wonder what the hell else we cant immediately see?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there is sound in space, just not in vacuum. what you're listening to is not real sound of two black holes merging, but rather an attempt to make the gravitational waves audible by transposing the waveform to audible frequencies. they could've also transposed it into visible color wavelengths, so you could &quot;see&quot; the wave. you still wouldn't &quot;see&quot; the merger though. it's more of a marketing gag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like we convert sound waves to light waves and back to sound to transmit sounds across large distances (radio). Now that we can detect gravity waves, we can convert those to sound too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article to go along with this &quot;sound&quot; explains that it isn't the actual sound it makes. Its the gravitational waves being transferred into audio audible within the human spectrum of hearing. It would be like if you transferred music into a color spectrum.</p></div>		</li>
