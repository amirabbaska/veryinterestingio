			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another aspect to it. Some light bulbs don't immediately go dark when the power is cut. Incandescent bulbs emit light by being very hot; when power is removed they cool down but will continue to emit light for a brief moment. LED bulbs have capacitors in their power supply circuitry that (if not properly dealt with) allow the bulbs to glow a bit after power is removed until the capacitors discharge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes -- incandescent bulbs don't look like they flicker even though the power going in is AC. You do get annoying flicker with the older tube-type florescent bulbs which turn off faster.  And IIRC, LEDs used in houses also have a phosphor coating that holds the light for a little bit in addition to the capacitor in the power supply.</p></div>		</li>
