			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer overall, but there is an important point to add:</p>
<p>Clinical trials for a human drug takes a long time, typically a successful new drug goes over 4 different pre-commercialization <em>human</em> trial phases (and that's without counting the animal trials before that).</p>
<p>Many drugs fail in those trials, (maybe the effects shown on animal trials are not as potent in humans, or new unforeseen adverse effect arise, or simply the drug is not any better of other commercially available products).</p>
<p>Several years later, some of the tested drugs will enter the market.</p>
<p>Some will even be as &quot;miraculous&quot; as the click-bait &quot;news&quot; articles claim (HIV and cancer therapy are areas that have shown massive improvement in the past 30 years).</p>
<hr />
<p>About the $5 epi-pen, it's important to note that the manufacturing cost of the ones currently avaiable on the market is already in that range, possibly lower thanks to economy of scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's insane. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/YFVn6" target="_blank">This is what we have to pay for a pack of 2 epipens in Australia.</a></p>
<p>Someone who isn't an Australian citizen or permanent resident would have to pay the full (private) price. PBS (the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) is what citizens or permanent residents with Medicare cards (so, everyone) pays; the concession price is if you are a low-income earner, have a disability that prevents you from fulltime work or are a single parent, and the safety net price is for everyone who has already paid $2,400 that year for out-of-pocket medical and pharmaceutical expenses. So they pay nothing, because the government has declared paying more than $2,400 is unfair and no one should have to. </p>
<p>73 000 Australians need epipen prescriptions. I don't, but I am so glad the government subsidises this. Making people pay so much for <em>necessary</em> medication should be criminal. Why is it so much there? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't a single system for negotiating drug prices in America. Also we end paying more for you to pay less. A great new drug comes to market, the company reviews all the costs incurred and realizes that it needs to sell the new drug for $250/unit. The Australian PBS comes along and negotiates the drug to be sold in Australia for $200; the drug company can't afford to say no  but still needs to average $250/unit. The best way for them is to then sell the drug in America for $300/unit bringing the average to $250+/unit. </p>
<p>This is a very simplified example (like only having America and Australia) but it illustrates why Americans end up subsidizing drugs for other countries. A lot of people complain that a needed drug costs so much but don't realize the effort and costs behind the price they pay.  And yes the drug companies can be greedy about it(Epipens, were at a stable price point but the company realized it had a monopoly so it jacked the price up nearly every dollar went solely to profit) doesn't mean they can just hand them out either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I was working on some clinical trial management systems and trials take time, sometimes more than 10 years time. So if you hear about some wonder drug now, even if it passes the trials, it might come to the market in 10 years (+/- a few).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, don't forget that an epipen that costs $5 in materials probably costs at least $30 before it's made, tested, shipped and in the hands of the end user...</p>
<p>People often forget that there are a bunch of organisatorial costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that:</p>
<p>-The pen has to be made in an approved facility, those aren't cheap</p>
<p>-The cost of running the trial should be amortized over the total number of pens sold</p>
<p>-Future trial failures have to be funded by pen sales</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's truth to that, and the plain fact that a company that can make a $5 epicenter is going to sell it for as close to the $30 one as they can. I don't buy epipens but I think the breakthrough here was that it cost $25 less to produce than the $30 pen, so the variable costs after production would apply to both models.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except, of course, that the one on the market has already paid off a lot of the testing/QA costs, and could lower their price if a competitor appeared, which makes it less attractive for a competitor to appear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the laws have changed doctors can prescribe legal drugs for any disease. This is called &quot;off-label&quot; usage.  Pharma companies sales teams are NOT allowed to promote this usage though.  Though many times they have gotten in trouble for promoting off-label usage. </p>
<p>But if a Dr sees a report that drug A designed for heart disease had a side effect that helps men achieve an erection they can write a script for someone suffering from impotence.  </p>
<p>If it's a generic it may be fairly cheap. Maybe they don't do this anymore due to the treat of malpractice suits?  </p>
<p>I really doubt there are any &quot;illegal and effective&quot; medicines.  What you are asking for is for an untested drug of dubious efficacy. Or if it was tested and not approved.  It may have been ineffective and no better then placebo, or it had a bad side effect.  So it was abandoned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or it wasn't profitable enough to justify the expense of trials to prove thing to the satisfaction of the FDA. Remember the companies have a pretty good idea of the outcome of a trial before they do it and they will enroll the number of patients necessary to reach the magic p=0.05. They aren't dummies throwing their money away on cures they won't reap serious $$ on. Pharmaceuticals aren't the most (or at least one of the most) profitable industries for nothing.</p></div>		</li>
