			<div class="markdown"><p>It's theoretically possible, but unlikely. If a asteroid buzzes the atmosphere just right, it could slow down enough to start orbiting Earth.</p>
<p>Problem is, the bottom of its orbit (the periapsis) would be at the altitude where it slowed down...which, if you'll recall, is in the atmosphere. On the next orbit, the atmosphere would slow it down some more, and this would keep happening until the asteroid fell to Earth as a meteor.</p>
<p>tl'dr
Either it misses the Earth entirely, or it eventually gets slowed down by the atmosphere and falls to the ground. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only scenario I can think of where an object orbiting the sun could become captured by the earth, would be if it glanced the atmosphere enough to slow down and enter earth orbit, and then used a gravity assist from the moon to raise its perigee. The chances of this happening are miniscule.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's a gif that demonstrates the idea. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/b6e3S0a.gif" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/b6e3S0a.gif</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK the same thing happens to man-made satellites.</p>
<p>My question is why doesn't this happen to the moon too? Or maybe it does and the moon is in fact slowly crashing down to Earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moon is actually stealing energy from the earth and very gradually leaving our orbit at a rate of 3.8 cm per year. IIRC this is happening because when the moon creates tides, the continents rotating into them slow down the earth, and due to conservation of angular momentum the moon must speed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could picture something passing just close enough to lithobrake, but then get pulled out just enough by the moon to enter a mostly stable orbit. Granted this would be a very small window between the objects travel vector, the moon's position and the relative spot to both of those of the earth, but still possible.</p></div>		</li>
