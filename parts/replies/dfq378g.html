			<div class="markdown"><p>Heavy water is usually only used in lower enrichment CANDU reactors. Heavy water compensates for the lower enrichment by having a higher cross section of neutron absorption. In the States, it's cheaper to enrich the fuel. In Canada, it's cheaper to produce heavy water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not &quot;used&quot; here.  It's a byproduct of the fission reaction in the core via radiolysis of water ( amongst other things). It is still formed though and is unavoidable when using water as a coolant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tritium is dissolved into the water. It is an isotope of hydrogen (H3) so it is unfilterable and forms water molecules just like deuterium (H2), which forms &quot;normal&quot; water. Tritium can come out of solution just like any other gas, but in a pressurized water reactor like where I work, it stays in solution.</p>
<p>The water we used is deionized water with low dissolved oxygen. Dissolved oxygen contributes to corrosion of the fuel cladding so we maintain oxygen at levels &lt;5 ppb at power. This is a limit set for all PWRs. </p></div>		</li>
