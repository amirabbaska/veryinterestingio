<p>So in a way, by thinking you're surviving well, you're surviving badly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this answer, this is the explanation I've been given by psychologists for years. When something is threatening, our brain fixates on it to resolve the danger in order to keep us safe. When something is nice - well, that's lovely, but whether we have the nice thing or not we'll still survive, so it's less important in evolutionary terms. The brain is specifically designed to remember and give extra attention to that which upsets is (to prevent us from being in danger again), so the brain basically organises itself around threat.</p>
<p>The example I've been given is that you could have a lovely day except that one person is rude to you - say the guy who served your coffee in the afternoon. Most people when they get home after that day would say to their partner &quot;oh, I've had such a good day! But you know, there was this <em>one guy</em>....&quot; Even if they know they've had a good day overall, that one event where someone was rude to them is going to take equal value in their mind to the 100 events that day that were nice because that's what the brain is designed to do.</p>
<p>Sort of related: Probably the most prevalent theory of anxiety/depression is that although we all have 'negative' brains, most people are brought up learning to mitigate that effect. So a person with good emotional regulation naturally validates their own emotions (it's understandable I feel this way); empathises with the other (they didn't mean it like that); doesn't put too much blame on themselves (I'm only human, everyone makes mistakes); encourages themselves for the future (setbacks are hard, but you <em>can</em> do this, let's give it another go tomorrow) etc. They respond to their brain's negativity with <em>kindness</em> (and strength/encouragement) which elicits a soothing response and helps you calm down. They also trust that these are the ways other people will respond to distress so they are happier to share their troubles. If you've been brought up this way then you almost definitely do it without thinking as an adult, you don't even notice how you are self-soothing. In people with anxiety/depression, distress as a child was not always responded to with kindness and/or encouragement (some people were coddled but not encouraged to feel strong; others were told to be strong but rarely shown empathy and understanding etc.) So this particular theory states that a main reason people with anxiety/depression find it harder to come down from negative emotions is because they 'fuel' them by being invalidating, self-critical, discouraging of themselves etc. and they also less likely to seek social support (as they assume others will be invalidating, critical, discouraging as well). (This theory also leaves room for genetic predisposition - just to dot the is and cross the ts - because it is theorised that some children are born 'more neurotic' than others and are at higher risk of developing problems if they are not taught early how to manage that neurosis through the above ways.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: It has been pointed out to me this was worded a little strongly. The theory I'm describing in the above para is the theory that I have been told by various treatment teams is the one that gives a basis to most modern talking treatments - so it should not be seen as the be all and end all. AFAIK, no one has yet found a &quot;cause for depression/anxiety&quot;. Hope that clears things up.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive always liked the example of good versus bad drivers. Nobody acknowledges or recognizes good drivers they see on their journey even though you may pass literally hundreds of them. However, a single bad driver has the tendency to ruin peoples entire days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like that example. A stranger mishandling a 2 ton metal projectile moving at a high rate of speed could very easily limit one's survival, so the brain sees that as something important to dwell on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh... I'm not sure the analogy fits. The reason there's little reason to acknowledge 'good drivers' is that they are, by their nature, unobtrusive. Good driving - just like good acting - should be unnoticeable. A better analogy would be positive events that actually <em>should be</em> noticeable but get overshadowed by the negative ones. So, for example, instances of kindness being less memorable than instances of rudeness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much exactly what my own experience with depression has felt like. I always thought there was something wrong with me, that I was weak and that it was my fault I was like that, that I couldn't do anything right and I was destined to feel that way for the rest of my life. And yet with other people in my life who had depression or even just problems in life similar to my own, I'd do nothing but build them up and be encouraging and supportive, assuring them that it wasn't their fault and that they could resolve things and get better. I'd take on everyone else's problems but wouldn't ever share mine, for fear of being a burden.</p>
<p>Took me years to finally say hey, if I'm not tearing down other people for feeling exactly the same way as me, then why should I be tearing myself down? Why do I think asking for help is such a bad thing when I admire other people who have the courage to reach out? It's a very difficult to get out of that mindset but it is possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a fun psych trick to foster objectivity. Imagine whatever negative situation you're in now belongs to a friend. What advice do you give them? Oftentimes people give different advise to others than they do themselves in the same situation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>worked in a small company (4 people including myself) 2 years ago and our boss (also CEO) has depression issues, and asked us for help for being &quot;positive&quot; and such. The company fails in every front possible as the boss just falls back into depression every time when he is required to do anything. I had to pick up every mess he failed to do and try to fix them until I had enough, and in turn I has been suffering depression myself since then and haven't been able to find a job on the same industry even until now, feels bad man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this theory also works on a more macro/sociopsychological scale as well. Major news media, for example, is more prone to report &quot;negative&quot; news stories because the ratings will be higher: More people will tune in and tend to remember the story. Whereas the counterpart, purely &quot;positive news&quot; sources, seem to struggle to be a part of the mainstream, and positive news is forgotten in lieu of negativity. And then we wonder why so many people are diagnosed with depression! (I'm being facetious here, there are obviously many more factors at play)</p>
<p>So then, do you think it's possible to use the same &quot;treatment&quot; with validation on this scale? Something along the lines of &quot;X people died today, but it's okay because (positive thing) happened&quot;? Or do you think we are destined to only focus on the negative on this scale, hoping for every individual to learn this method of self-validation? Or, maybe, it works differently psychologically because it's &quot;someone else&quot;, and doesn't affect the viewer directly? Hmm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My personal opinion is that this is human nature, though (although maybe news outlets should be cautioned to act responsibly when it comes to, for instance, stirring up outrage).</p></div>		</li>
