			<div class="markdown"><p>Studies showing it reduces power are rarely connected to static stretching during a warm up. They generally have a static stretching of 60-90 seconds followed immediately by a high rpe lift or isometric contraction. The results of which are &quot;no shit&quot; but the statement derived from that that &quot;static stretching is bad&quot; is an overblown misinterpretation. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although static stretching before exercises like running have been shown to decrease running economy and make mile paces increase in time which is bad. Because economical running uses the stretch shortening cycle for every foot strike it is very important to not stretch and in that instance it can increase injury rate.</p>
<p>It's just easier to not have people static stretch before exercise. Do a dynamic warmup and call it good.</p>
<p>I do concede that the stretch debate can be slightly overblown. I always tell people to just stretch after if they want to stretch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guys guys..can we take a moment to appreciate the importance of stretching after a sleep?</p>
<p>We sleep in a single position for the majority of the night. A morning stretch helps us to loosen and realign our muscles, as well as getting our blood flowing, since our heart rate is at its lowest right before we wake up. It's like a wake-up call to our brain. It limbers us up and, along with yawning, has been proven to relieve stress and tension. This magical mixture of loose muscles, increased blood flow, and good feelings helps us jump-start our day. </p>
<p>If you have a pet, you've likely noticed their full-body stretch after a nap. They'll arch their backs, stretch out their front legs and let out a big yawn. It's pretty cute.. but it also serves an important biological function.</p>
<p>This instinctual action does wonders for rebooting our bodies. Well..that's a sunny takeaway!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A high-school PE said there's two different kinds: warm-up stretches and &quot;elasticity training&quot;.
When you push the muscle-tendon elasticity limits they temporarily lose power and relax afterwards, so thins kind of exercise is better done last, a couple hours before going to bed even. This can be quite excruciating.</p>
<p>Now warm-up stretches stimulate blood flow and should de done prior to exertion. Here the range of motion should not exceed that of the intended exercise. Like if your gonna do a bench press, you could stretch by doing a few (20-30) reps without any weight added to the barbell.</p>
<p>tl;dr <strong>Elasticity training</strong> is BAD prior workout, as the muscles relax and lose power. <strong>Warming-up</strong> is essential to get those juices flowing and it should include some brief stretching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a person who rarely stretches and reduced movement ranges, I have experimented with this and can say anecdotally stretching a muscle reduces my power output in that muscle for a period. On the flip side I get increased range of motion.</p>
<p>It could be different for muscles with good tone.</p>
<p>I am unable to confirm myself. Too lazy to tone up my muscles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons why you don't care about the benefits of <em>not</em> stretching:  </p>
<ul>
<li>ballet is different than power lifting in that you don't need that last 0.1% power to hit 507 lbs instead of 506.5 lbs.  </li>
<li>ballet is different than running in that you don't rely on the body's stretch 'restoration' movements to achieve maximum efficiency.  If you run a 4 minute mile vs a 3:58 mile, you don't really care.    </li>
</ul>
<p>Reason why you <em>do</em> care about the benefits of stretching:  </p>
<ul>
<li>ballet puts you into moves and positions that require full mobility.  Any warmup routine you do (dynamic or not) should cover the full range of motion that your performance will, and for ballet, that looks an awful lot like what most people call 'stretching'   </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High school cross country and track coach here. From personal experience (both as a runner and as a coach), dynamic stretching is the best way to get yourself ready for a run (A skip, B skip, shuffles, crossovers, karaoke, lunges, etc), but if you still feel tightness after a dynamic warmup, static stretching can be a good compliment because your muscles are now warmed up some. Stretching cold muscles (i.e., muscles that have not been &quot;woken up&quot; yet) is typically a bad idea, partly because a lot of people tend to overdo it (trying to immediately touch your toes rather than gradually reach closer and closer throughout the stretch). Done correctly, static stretching is fine. The problem is that the majority of people DON'T perform static stretching correctly.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ran Cross Country and Track for 7 years through middle and highschool. I can confidently say, for me personally, that I felt significantly better during a race without static stretching than with it. Warming up definitely helped, but I had to be careful not to overdo it or else I just felt tired right from the start of the race.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ideal situation is to warm your muscles up first, with something like a mile easy jog, stretch, then continue the run.</p>
<p>If you need to do something beforehand, look up dynamic stretches or exercises that activate the sore muscles you are wanting to stretch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Static stretching before running has been shown to decrease running efficiency due to the lose of something called the stretch shortening cycle. I would assume that due to the decreased tendon stiffness injuries could be more prevalent, but I'm on mobile and can't back that statement up for sure. </p>
<p>Stretching before running is not beneficial and cramps have nothing to do with stretching before you run. It has to do with hydration status and electrolyte balance. Drink more water and eat a kiwi or something salty before you run.</p></div>		</li>
