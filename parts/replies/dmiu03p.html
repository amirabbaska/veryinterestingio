			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, you would think that, if any cell has a given probability of becoming cancerous, the larger the animal is, the more likely it would be to get cancer. However, this is empirically false. It's called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060950/" target="_blank">Peto's Paradox</a>. No one is quite sure why that happens, but some interesting hypotheses I've seen is that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/47/2/317/719209/Why-don-t-all-whales-have-cancer-A-novel" target="_blank">whale tumors grow their own tumors</a> and die; and that <a href="http://www.medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877(16)31024-6/fulltext" target="_blank">cancer is an adaptation that selects against energy dissipation</a>, i.e. it's not a disease per se but more like the sickle cell mutation: disadvantageous in general but protective in areas with malaria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually there's some work going on right now into this (I am finishing my PhD in tissue engineering and cancer biology this year) and it's exciting. For examples, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/how-elephants-avoid-cancer-1.18534" target="_blank">elephants have many copies of p53</a>, also known as the guardian of the genome (humans have 1 copy of it). It seems that larger animals may indeed have redundant tumor suppressor genes and more guards against oncogene activation. </p>
<p>Of course, the killer whale example is also possible-that tumors in larger animals just operate differently. It's still very interesting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are your thoughts about the new cancer killing injection gel announced by Duke University that only costs $5. (Is that one the same one as the one involving nanotubes I read on here about a day prior? Must be, correct?)</p>
<p>Can someone with cancer right now contact Duke and ask to be a test subject and get their cancer cured? Is this the breakthrough we've all been waiting for? What does the actual science of it say?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it's weirder than that. It's treating an animal like a thermodynamical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_engine" target="_blank">heat engine</a>, and considering cancer as a check on the efficiency of this heat engine.</p>
<p>I'll try to write a very simplified summary based on my understanding. Let's say we have an animal consuming 100 calories a day. It spends 40 on useful work and wastes 60 as heat (i.e. above and beyond what it needs for thermoregulation). If food is not the limiting factor then a mutation can arise that makes this animal less efficient; say it still spends 40 calories on useful work but needs to consume 120 total. As the paper goes, cancer would put this mutation at a disadvantage in very few generations, killing such &quot;dissipative&quot; parents or grandparents earlier, as opposed to scenarions that would involve competing for resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, elephants actually do have larger brain cells than humans. Suzana Herculano-Houzel showed that while most mammals increase the size of their brains partially by increasing the size of their neurons, the great apes are unique in that we increase the size of our brains by packing in more and more small neurons. At a glance, elephants have more neurons than we do, but almost all of them are in the cerebellum. We actually have more neurons in our small cerebral cortex than elephants have in their large ones, so our neurons are much smaller.</p></div>		</li>
