			<div class="markdown"><p>When guns are mounted away from the plane center, you have to aim them at a point in front of the plane some distance away so the fire converges on an aim point. Outside that aimed distance, the crosshairs would be inaccurate. Fighter pilots would often set one set of guns at something like 100 yards then another set of the guns at 150 yards if they had multiple sets of wing mounted guns. </p>
<p>Also at the time of WWI, planes were still quite flimsy and wing mounts probably wouldn't be sturdy. Nor would the gun be serviceable in the air if there was a malfunction. In addition to that, take the issue from the first paragraph and compound it with how some planes in WWI flew which was by flexing the wings. So you'd have guns spraying all over the place as you flexed the wings to roll. </p></div>		</li>
