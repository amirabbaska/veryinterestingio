			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I depleted all my cortisol. I now sleep randomly wherever and whenever I can. Sometimes I sleep at 8 pm and get up at 5:30 am, then the next day I go to sleep at 3 am and get up at 9 am, or I go to sleep at 1 PM and wake up at 7 am the next day. I can never get enough sleep, and always feel like a bag of death when I wake up. I curse my alarm clock every morning and causes me so much anxiety everyday. Funny thing is, though, once I get out of bed and get going, I start feeling pretty good about life and very euphoric. It's just that first phase of getting out of bed that's the hardest. Despite knowing I will feel better once I get going, I always choose sleep. There's no reasoning with my sleeping-self. Sleeping-self is a lazy piece of shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much me, except for the euphoric part. I feel pretty shitty most of the day, and it's hard for me to do more than one thing per day: if I work, that's probably all I'll do that day, just wake, work, bed. I'm trying to go to school, but balancing even one class has become really hard with my job, and homework HAS to be relegated to my weekends.</p>
<p>Also, if I sit down and I'm not concentrating on anything, I WILL fall asleep. I listen to podcasts in the car because otherwise I knock out at red lights. It's getting to be annoying, tbh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the euphoric part is a hit or miss sometimes. Do you take any meds?</p>
<p>Shit, we are basically the same. work, school, sleep and repeat. I also can't do homework during the weekday and almost always doesn't get worked on until the weekend.</p>
<p>I've been improving by changing a few habits throughout my day. Sometimes it helps to go outside for a brief walk or to even for some fresh air. Staying inside too much drains me and sucks the soul out of me, even though I consider myself introverted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only set an alarm when I absolutely have to not oversleep. My work allows me to arrive sort of whenever as long as I put in the hours. It's kinda neat. Most days work out just fine, sometimes I sleep in an extra hour or two and even if it it's really involuntary I try to go with the flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure it's the same mechanic.  So when you set the alarm you are already <em>consciously</em> thinking you need to get up at that time.  Then your subconscious nucleo- whatever OP said just knows to stress itself out around that time.  It doesn't happen all the time but you remember when it does because it's quite amazing.</p></div>		</li>
