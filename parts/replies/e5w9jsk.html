<p>whereas the Pacific <strong>US West Coast</strong> don't have these conditions of hot dry air clashing with moist cool air.</p>

<p>That's an important modifier, so bolding it. The Pacific Ocean has them regularly where the temperatures and humidity match the necessary conditions.</p>
<p>Temperatures are correct in Mexico, and they're hit regularly from the Pacific. Hawaii is hit frequently.  </p>
<p>Japan and China have the same storm seasons. They are commonly called typhoons or cyclones over there so many people assume they're different storms. Northern Philippines are being hit hard this very moment, with the storm expeced to hit southern China (including Hong Kong) and north Vietnam on Sunday. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/12/asia/super-typhoon-mangkhut-ompong-wxc-intl/index.html" target="_blank">The storm is huge, in the Atlantic it would be called a category 5 hurricane</a></p>
<p>Northern Japan just had two storms hit and another one developing to hit in about a week, but because they're heading north into the cold the moisture goes away. The wind remains, however. One windy (but cool and dry) cyclone is heading up to the Bering Sea, the second is starting up toward the Sea of Okhotsk. Both are rapidly fading away because the temperature and pressure differences aren't present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep -  This is the best answer.   </p>
<p>In South Morocco,  there is a city thats always windy in Essaouira and heard before thats where the storms start at first.   Your explanation is more accurate and its the answer I was looking for.   Question,  what exactly happens when hot dry air and cool most air clash near Cape Verde?   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the explanation, I'm not sure. If I can make an assumption, I'd say that it's a similar interaction as tornado formations in tornado alley. </p></div>		</li>
