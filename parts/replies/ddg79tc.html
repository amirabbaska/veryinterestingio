			<div class="markdown"><p>One distinction between the US highway system and the interstate system is that the primary north-south US routes terminate in 1 (e.g., 1, 11, 21, 31, ..., 91, 101).  The three-digit US routes generally connect to their parent route (e.g., US 50 intersects to US 150 in Vincennes, Indiana).  </p>
<p>Many US routes were truncated upon the creation of the Eisenhower Interstate system.  US 80 was transcontinental between Tybee Island, Georgia and San Diego; the western part was later truncated to Dallas with the construction of I-20, I-10 and I-8.  </p>
<p>Most interstates have an accompanying US route that was most likely the precursor.  I-81, I-40, I-75 and I-59 have US-11;  I-77 has US-21 and so on.  In the western US, the trend was more towards decomissioning the routes.  California used to have many more US routes than it currently does.</p></div>		</li>
