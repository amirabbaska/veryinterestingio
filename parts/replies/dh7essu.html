			<div class="markdown"><p>If you eat too much of a certain kind of food, or a bad combination of foods, it can throw it off. For example, drinking 1 glass of orange juice, and then immediately drinking a glass of milk will make you feel nauseous. If you repeat it 2 or 3 times, you likely will throw up. Orange juice is very acidic and milk is very basic. Putting one against the other doesn't cancel out the acidity or base-ness, but rather creates a disruption will usually leads to gas, bloating, and curdling milk which can increase the acidity. </p>
<p>Likewise, drinking too much of just a base can make you sick as well. From experience, I've learned that eating an entire tub of ice cream by yourself in one day, plus multiple glasses of chocolate milk during that day will make you feel like a dead brick the next morning and sometimes, make you throw up, to get rid of all dat base.</p>
<p>Edit: Milk is actually much more neutral than basic, how ever a mixtures or over abundances of high alkalinity (base) and/or low alkalinity (acid) in the body will cause disruption which will make the stomach want to purge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This whole comment sounds like speculation. I mean, you don't know that milk is slightly acidic, why should we believe the rest of it? It all hinges on this notion of a &quot;disruption&quot; which you have not really defined at all. I think you're just overeating. There's no special chemistry going on, you're just not supposed to eat a whole tub of ice cream and multiple glasses of chocolate milk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pH is a logorithmic scale based on the concentration of hydronium ions found in water. a pH of 7, as in normal tap water had 10Ã—10-7 hydronium ions in it.  an acid such sulfuric or hypochloric react with water in such a way are to produce MORE hydronium so the pH goes down.
a few ways you can make a pH go back up. 1 you can remove material, in this case viomet it back up. 2 you can dilute the solution eg drink more water. 3 you can drink something a little basic, bases remove hydronium which in turn raises the pH</p></div>		</li>
