			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little shocked that the most up voted reply claims confusion, when the truth is as you describe it. Coupled with the fall in oil prices at that point and the claims that Kuwait was engaged in slant drilling operations, Iraq made a clear case. The drum beat wen on throughout 89 and 90; when TV news covered it, the message was clear that the U.S. wasn't going to get involved. Until we did.</p>
<p>I was a young republican then. I devoured U.S. news and World Reports, and thought Bush was a good president. I could, and did, dismiss Iran-Contra. Then, when the war started to unfold, you could see the chess pieces, the relationship between cheap oil, between the strangeness of selling weapons to Iran (a declared enemy of our country), and the realization we had also sold weapons to Iraq. </p>
<p>I voted for Clinton in 1992, even though I didn't like him. </p></div>		</li>
