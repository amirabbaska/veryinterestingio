			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this explanation is incorrect for RAM.  RAM has a limited depth and width that can be addressed in a system.  We cannot currently just keep adding chips to create a higher capacity RAM module.  If that were possible manufactures would be building 1 TB modules and sticking them in server systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean... you could have a shit-ton of RAM if you didnâ€™t care about its latency/bandwidth.  They make PCIe RAM drives; a memory controller could be built to make one of those look like (very  very very high latency) RAM to a CPU.</p>
<p>But yes, the physical density of high-speed DRAM is also just not as good as flash memory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>3) I think this is done for ergonomic reasons as well. You could make the physical stick smaller but should you? It becomes easier to lose and harder to unplug/plug. So it will cost more and ultimately not actually be better, potentially worse actually, from a usability point of view</p>

<p>In some cases this is also due to specified form factors for non-USB devices. For example there's no reason to make a microSD card smaller than you have to since  you still have to conform to the microSD shape. Though a lot of companies make the smallest form factor and just sell those with adapters for the larger sizes fitted (sometimes permanently) on. </p></div>		</li>
