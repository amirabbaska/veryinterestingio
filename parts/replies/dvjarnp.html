			<div class="markdown"><p>I picked bell peppers/capsicums for a few months. The farmers absolutely did not want us to pick any red peppers that had green on them. We were supposed to pick red and brown “chocolate” peppers though. A pepper picked with green on it will never be red they said. Yellow peppers are different though. They said if a green pepper had even one spot of yellow on it then it would still turn yellow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because when spots appear the cells or genes in the pepper have switched from growing to dying. Grows to be big and yummy so something will eat it and shit out the seeds. Thus reproducing and spreading the species if that fails and times running out it changes colors to attract attention then finally drys out and falls to the ground. Seeds come up next spring. </p></div>		</li>
