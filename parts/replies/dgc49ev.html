			<div class="markdown"><p>But is anything known about the nature of the 2 independent thought processes that arise to perform, e.g. shoe binding. Suppose you are in a rush, then you may do the job faster, but for someone with a split brain, each side doesn't know just how &quot;fast&quot; fast will be for the other, so it has to focus on continually adapting to the other. For us, feedback for our actions is of course vital as well, e.g. if my hand movement is off to knot the lace it is readjusted; but for the split brain, does each half perennially focus on &quot;observing&quot; the action of the other half in order to maintain overall coordination?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much of the coordination and amplitude of movement is actually controlled in the cerebellum and basal ganglia, the pathways of which are not necessarily affected by lesions in the corpus callosum. Frontal lobe decides on a movement, cerebellum plans it and monitors feedback from the body, basal ganglia fine tunes it, and they project to both sides of the motor cortex which executes the action. So shoe tying and walking can remain synchronized through these other key regions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So since learned coordinated actions, like tying shoes, are unaffected by split-brain, does that mean they are unable to learn a new coordinated action like juggling?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The split brain results have recently been revisited and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28122878" target="_blank">it's a little more complicated than we thought.</a></p>
<p>In a nutshell, split brain patients are kind of like blindsight patients: they report being unable to perceive certain stimuli, but if you force them to guess they somehow tend to get it right anyway. It's quite possible that they don't really have &quot;two independent minds&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so they can develop the ability to have a different, intentional thought process occurring in each half of their now separated hemispheres at the same time? I know we can all walk and chew gum, but neither require active thinking to do. What you seem to be explaining is something very different. Right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you feel that they would not be able to?</p>
<p>The left hand has auditory input with which to time it's actions, and visual input with which to read the sheet music. Same goes for the right hand. Each hand is able to do what it would in a typical brain, which is carry out specific motor plans to a specific time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They still can do basic motor tasks involving coordination, not complex (for a while, anyways).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;not for a while&quot; part of Holiday's post, made me wonder if it was something that would be more difficult. It's a fairly complicated task.</p></div>		</li>
