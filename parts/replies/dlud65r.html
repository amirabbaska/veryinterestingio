			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the reason, you want to learn to &quot;understand&quot; the language. A lot of the time, people resort to simply translating words.</p>
<p>Example: I am native Finn. I know a lot of people who think like Apple = Omena.</p>
<p>How I, and many other people often fluent in many different languages, associate the thing with the word. So apple for me is that red/green fruit. Not a word in Finnish vocabulary.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon this after I started studying Spanish. I learnt English through playing Runescape (And believe me, 90% of English I knew by 6th grade was from RS).</p>
<p>After trying to learn Spanish, I found I was trying to &quot;translate words&quot; instead of understanding and consuming the meaning.</p>
<p>Kinda weird to explain but once you understand it it will help IMMENSELY.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started thinking this way when I started to learn a third language as an adult. At first translating word by word back to English was fine... but tedious. Being able to link the meaning of the word to the object without going through another language was by far more helpful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good description of what it is like to be able to somewhat understand/read a language but not be able to speak it yourself. I myself can usually get the meaning out of a song or phrase in French or Spanish or understand a short conversation or paragraph but have a hard time coming up with vocab on my own or remembering the correct word order etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s funny, I’m the complete opposite. I can almost always get my meaning across in Spanish because I can talk around words I don’t know, but I have a lot of trouble understanding it because if someone uses one of those words I don’t know I’m stuck. I can sometimes figure it out based on context, but if I can’t I’m lost. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for that. I never understood until now. I made A's in Spanish in school and can completely understand what someone is trying to say to me. I get so frustrated that I'm not able to communicate back with them. Now I know why at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how I am. We have a large amount of employees that are native Spanish speakers. I can understand what they are saying due to four years of Spanish in high school, but sound like a 3 year old when I reply in Spanish. They are the same with English, so they speak Spanish to me and I reply in English. Has worked for the last 5 years. </p></div>		</li>
