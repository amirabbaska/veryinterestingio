			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything described here is correct, but is a secondary cascade effect. Nicotine bonds with acetylcholine receptors, opening calcium channels in the nucleus accumbens and nearby structures. Part of the function of these pathways serve as a governor on the pleasure/reward circuit. An activated NA and hippocampus, etc. results in pleasure being <em>more easily achieved</em>. This is a slight tweak on what you said in that serotonin and dopamine are <em>more easily</em> released, not just that they are directly released by Nicotine.</p>
<p>The insidious aspect of nicotine addiction is that the number of acetylcholine receptors increases with the addition of nicotine so that the addict is forced to consume nicotine just so that they can achieve normal amounts of pleasure from everyday activities. When people try to quit smoking, the first few weeks are the hardest. This is because it takes some time for the receptor count to return to near pre-addiction levels, and during that time, life is quite literally not as good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nicotine is not as destructive and it's withdrawal effects are primarily cognitive, not physical. The tolerance drops very quickly  and is somewhat baseline level after 3-4 weeks, but when one smokes again after this break, the reward pathway has memory of this substance and tolerance will rise extremely quickly to the previous levels again, much faster than someone who just started smoking and has gradually increasing tolerance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You appear to be grossly misinformed. Although I'll grant you that the initial surge of DA is infuentual in decision making, it's nowhere near the amount you receive for doing the task (and little if any serotonin is released). Not to mention that it is unarguably DA that gives individuals the feeling of pleasure, not this mixture or serotonin and DA that you've fantastically tried to pass off. If what you are saying were true then DA antagonists alone would not be able to counteract the rewarding behaviors of drugs such as meth and cocaine. Add this to the fact that you seem to think serotonin shuts off DANs, and I'll have to read this book of yours to find out how you came to these conclusions. </p>
<p>Edit:
I keep finding the wildest claims being made in this response. Can I ask where you've learned all of this? There's seriously so much info you have given contrary to my own that I'm doubting myself. If I'm wrong I'll edit to let you know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got the same impression. I've read tons about reward seeking, maybe 1 paragraph mentioned serotonin. Many addictive drugs increase serotonin but many don't and it doesn't mean that serotonin is endogenously involved in addiction mechanisms to any serious extent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Largely, the pleasure is NOT from serotonin but from dopamine (DA), as your post so rightly states. Also, GABA modulates the DA as well, and we know this because a serious GABA gene/allele down regulates the GABA creating the hyper DA state of Schizophrenia/  or mania as in bipolar disorder. Both can be caused by Exactly the same paranoid schizophrenia gene, above. Complex system indeed.</p>
<p>Serotonin DOES also down regulate DA in a very major way. As migraines show, and the circadian rhythms show.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough DA is a very old neurochemical in mammals and as such has a huge number of receptor sites, each showing the complex system nature of the neurochemicals.  Multiple receptor sites means complex system, which is how we deal with biological complex systems.</p>
<p>We can use DA as the measuring standard against which we compare and contrast other neurochemicals.  This creates a better model by comparison than what we have now. Interestingly enough there are Nicotinic receptors in the brain, where there is NO nicotine at all!! This receptor acts in part like DA, thus creating a more aroused state, plus cutting back pain, another DA quality. DA is the nicotinic major receptor activator, as may be the other catecholamines, norepi and Epinephrine both directly derived from DA.</p>
<p>The brain is largely balanced among all those neurochemicals, so it's not the absolute levels of DA, 5HT, or GABA which determine the brain states, but the activity levels as modulated by the others.</p>
<p>have written an article about the Balanced Brain, that goes into this, and apply it to the circadian rhythm, the psychosis/mania duality, migraines, depression, and pain &amp; some of their interrelationships.</p>
<p>What some don't realize is that the epibatidine class of nicotinic receptors REALLY block pain, upwards of 50-200 times that of DA or Morphine, the latter the standard pain killer, which mimics the DA effects of blocking pain. The extent to which they do, shows the extent to which DA blocks pain.</p>
<p>So the ABT-595, Tebenacline, does have pain blocking effects, which display that part of it's DA activity, but does NOT have the addictive potential at all.</p>
<p>It's the Balance among the major neurochemicals which largely create the massively complex system outcomes we see in brain.</p>
<p>Considering these from a complex systems standpoint, we can more easily and effectively treat depression, migraine, psychosis/mania (overactive DA) and even the circadian rhythm or often, called sleep disorders more completely.</p>

<p>This creates the beginnings of a framework for understanding the neurochemical, complex system mix in our brains, including why nicotine acts as it does, as it mimics DA, as a plant originating quasi neurochemical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is nuts. Do other drugs like MDMA or cocaine work the same way? Creating an artificial flood or doapmine coupled with an artificial flood of serotonin? Also, what happens if you get a flood of <em>just</em> serotonin (this is what I thought these drugs did but maybe I'm wrong)? Do you just get all energized and wired without the 'pleasure'? Is serotonin only enjoyable if paralleled by dopamine?</p>
<p>Interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MDMA is probably the most serotonergic drug there is, it induces extreme amount of serotonin, you've probably seen them in clubs with pupils dilated so much it's uncomfortable to look at.</p>
<p>However dopamine and noradrenaline is what creates the 'wired' and energetic feeling of mdma and dopamine interacts with the pleasure center. The serotonin rush is just a cherry on the top, it gives the feeling of being content and loving everyone. Without the serotonin, it would be not that different from methamphetamine, a typical stimulant.</p>
<p>Cocaine snorted and ESPECIALLY IV'ed gives intense amount of dopamine and noradrenaline. IV coke is so fucking intense that your ears ring from the rush and you don't hear anything around you, but it feels so so good. Although it quickly is cleared and DA/NE levels take a huge dip, creating the intense cravings to keep up the ear-ringing euphoria.</p>
<p>Drugs like cocaine and amphetamine not only induce release of these neurotransmitters, but also blocks their reuptake, so the endogenous (&quot;natural&quot;) dopamine is not reuptaken/destroyed by MAO or neutralized in other ways, it stays there for longer than it would naturally. The combination results in tweeking</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, what happens if you get a flood of just serotonin</p>

<p>You would probably get serotonin syndrome, vomit all other the place, get panic attack and go to hospital. It's not pleasurable at all</p></div>		</li>
