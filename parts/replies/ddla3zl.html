			<div class="markdown"><p>The somewhat uninteresting, but probably most realistic answer is that this black hole would exist for about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.3+mg+black+hole+lifetime" target="_blank">10^-26 seconds</a>. In that time it would release ~<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.3+mg+*+c%5E2" target="_blank">10^10 joules</a> of energy, which apparently is almost exactly the amount of energy you'd get by exploding a ton of TNT.</p>
<p>So the result would be spectacular, but you wouldn't be around to see it.</p></div>		</li>
