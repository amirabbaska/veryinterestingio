			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an English teacher that bragged about never saying &quot;uh or umm&quot; and how we should all, you know, learn the same.</p>
<p>Of course, you know, he had his own, you know, filler words that he spoke in place of, you know, &quot;uhs and ums&quot;.</p>
<p>Bugged me, but he was the teacher, I wasn't going to burst his bubble and call him out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it is technically a bit more professional to use actual words instead of uhm or similar sounds. </p>
<p>And if you can choose from a repertoire it will be less noticeable to others that you are searching for words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandfather often said &quot;see?&quot; while he was telling stories, but I usually took it as &quot;know what I mean?&quot;  It wasn't that he was searching for words, it was more along the lines of &quot;are you paying attention?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly. &quot;Know what I mean?&quot; is the contemporary equivalent. It's a filler to focus peoples' attention and prevent other people from butting in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad often uses &quot;like I said&quot; as a filler, despite the fact that what he said almost never referred to anything he said previously. I spent some time really, truly, listening to people and now I can't help but notice all their little tics and oddities of speech. I've started to wonder what my own repeated phrases are that I don't even notice myself doing.</p></div>		</li>
