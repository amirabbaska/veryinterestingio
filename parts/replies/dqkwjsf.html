			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoo, oh boy. He did no one any favors dragging undergrad/grad level math into the eli5 without an explanation. But here's my attempt.</p>
<p>First, let's define some terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Topology: Roughly, the general structure of something, with a focus on how many pieces it has (connectedness), how tightly it's connected (what do I have to remove to make it not connected), how many &quot;holes&quot; it has, etc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manifold: A particular type of structure. Specifically, it's a type of structure that, if viewed at any given place, behaves like Euclidean Space. So any area on a 2D manifold acts like a piece of paper, any area on a 3D manifold acts like you're used to when moving around, etc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local measurements: What it sounds like. Gather experimental evidence of reality. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curvature: What it sounds like. How sharply, and to what degree, something is curved. Think a piece of paper laid flat, vs a piece of paper you're in the process of folding in half. Each are pieces of paper, but one has different curvature than the other. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boundary: Any &quot;edges&quot; or points you can't pass. </p>
</li>
<li>Trivial Topology: Topologies are a mathematical concept with a formal definition. There's a generally-understood idea of what &quot;trivial&quot; means formally, but if you understand &quot;trivial&quot; as &quot;everyone agrees this is boring&quot; you'll have the idea. So a trivial topology is just one that doesn't really have anything interesting to tell. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not meaningless at all to study the topology of the universe as a 3d manifold. We can actually do local measurements of it'd curvature etc. Of course it's an 3d manifold without boundary, but as such it definitely has a topology which might be not trivial and it's not meaningless to try and see which one it is </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So all he's saying is that it's still worth attempting to understand the underlying structure of the universe, because it's likely still interesting, and not having any edges doesn't change that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way I’ve seen this explained has to do with expansion again. </p>
<p>The fabric of the universe is expanding. In doing so, it’s pushing everything away from everything else with some amount of force. This is associated with a negative curvature in spacetime. </p>
<p>Gravity is trying to do the opposite, it’s trying to pull everything together. Gravity is associated with a positive curvature in spacetime. </p>
<p>The universe can have three possible total “curvatures,” open, closed, and flat. The term curvature has to do with how space-time curves, and you can look up videos of people using fabric sheets to explain gravity. It’s roughly the same thing. </p>
<p>If the universe is positively curved, then gravity is stronger than the repelling spacetime force and the universe will eventually collapse on itself. This is called a closed universe, because there is a definite closure when everything comes crashing back together. </p>
<p>If the universe is negatively curved, then the expansion is stronger and things will accelerate away from each other faster and faster, eventually resulting in a cold heat death. This is an open universe. </p>
<p>Scientists think we actually live in a flat universe, which means that the universe will expand slower and slower to infinity, but never explode outward and never turn around. Imagine if you hit a pool ball on an infinitely long table. The friction is super low, so the ball will roll for a really long time. All the while it’s moving slower and slower, and in the case of the universe it will never actually stop. It just keeps expanding slower and slower (yeah, it’s weird).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best analogy I have heard is the balloon analogy. Take a balloon and draw dots all over it.
Now blow up the balloon.<br />
As the balloon stretches, every dot gets farther away from every other dot. No two dots are closer to each other than they were before. It doesn't matter what the shape of the balloon is. It could be round, square, elongated, or anything.<br />
These dots represent all the galaxies in the universe. The difference is the dots are on a 2D surface, and the universe is 3D, so you can't really picture it, but it's the same idea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a fan of the balloon analogy because when you picture a balloon blowing up, it does expand externally</p>
<p>I like the rubber band one where if you clamp down both ends of a straight rubber band, then draw 2 dots near one end, then pull the rubber band from the other end youd see the distance between the two dots increasing without the space going anywhere in an easily visible fashion</p></div>		</li>
