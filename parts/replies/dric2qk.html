			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know that those trees in the Irish bog were 12k years old? Did they have 12k rings? Did they have 200 rings and we knew they were in the big for 11800 years? How do we know how long they were in the bog?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tree rings overlapped, They were like a bar code, the width of the tree rings vary according the how nice or poor the weather was each year. The tree ring record was stitched together from 1000s of trees, each a few decades old, to extend the recorded back 12,000 years, from the time when the bogs started to grow after the Ice Age.</p></div>		</li>
