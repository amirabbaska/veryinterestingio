			<div class="markdown"><p>I just moved in with my boyfriend. My sleep schedule was not great but finally getting better before the move. Now my bf is sick, snores, and his pug snores even louder plus a kind of high pitched noise occasionally. The bf also likes to listen to podcasts as he's falling asleep.  I have no clue how to make myself sleep better. I have ear plugs that don't always work. I can fall asleep better with rain sounds on my side but I can't stay asleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just talking about this today at work. I sleep separate from my spouse, so does my boss. Our coworker couldn't believe we did this. Then she proceeded to explain to us the years of sleepless nights because of her snoring husband. Anger, irritation, resentment. All because people believe there's some rule that if you're together, you have to sleep together. Bullshit. I'm sleeping separate so I get enough sleep to remain human. Our relationship is better for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might want to try sleeping headphones (they look kind of like a headband) and listen to some type of white noise on there. I listen to 8 hour sleep meditations on YouTube and it helps so much! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have room,  I'd suggest separate ones.  My husband snores and flails and I sleep in spurts but like to read my tablet or watch tv if I can't (and yes, I've tried it all and it's just better if I have something distracting until I'm yawning).</p>
<p>And he likes a fan going with no covers. I have 3 comforters and a cat that hates his cat.  So we're much better apart at night. We just get our cuddle on early or sometimes come in for snuggles in the middle of the night. </p>
<p>I hope he's understanding. It really sucks when you can't sleep! I hope you can both adapt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this is my issue. I'm not nervous during the day but at night time I feel vulnerable somehow and as a result I wake up to noises I likely wouldn't even notice during the day. Makes for rough nights sometimes </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was like this my whole life (my parents can attest to me being like it from an early age). Since going onto a very low dose of anti depressants it's gone and the pain in my stomach when I used to lie awake and over analyse every noise has gone too. I'm stunned as I went on them more for depression than anxiety reasons, but there you go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was like this my whole life. I would get very anxious at night, over analyzing every little sound. I even had a panic attack one night. Once I got a dog this issue seemed to almost disappear for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This works for me, but one problem if you have anxiety or feel vulnerable is the idea that someone could come into your house and you wouldn't be able to hear them.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I will give that a try. I used to use a fan but it made me tired somehow having the droning noise in the background. Perhaps a rainfall or crickets would work. Thank you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your reference to hypervigilance is interesting. I have a personality that is torturously vigilant. </p>
<p>I just cannot help but notice and be conscious of things that need attention. Fixed. Cleaned. Worked on. It's maddening. </p>
<p>I manage to compartmentalize most things. I'm ok with the arm on the chair being loose for awhile. Or the spot on the base board that needs to be repainted. </p>
<p>But sometimes it fucking tortures me. I recently spent some time in the mountains. And it snowed like a motherfucker on the night before I was leaving. I knew it would be tough getting off the mountain. </p>
<p>I had chains. I knew they fit. I even practiced putting them on before we left for the trip. But I was still up all night with my brain going berserk about the up coming drive in the morning. Fucking piece of shit brain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's not anxiety. It's about noticing things. Spending brain power on things. It makes me extremely good at certain disciplines and has landed me in crazy good careers. But thinking about all the ins and outs of a problem or situation sometimes keeps me up. I do very well managing anxiety. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, go to a shrink. Despite me calling them Shrinks, I harbor none of the ill will against them. Various Shrinks have helped me become the functional adult I am today. And are still helping! You have anxiety. LIke me! It's managed with medication, but general anxiety disorder and social anxiety have hounded me for decades.</p>
<p>Find someone you can talk to, and work out a plan to find a solution between coping mechanisms and perhaps some medications if you feel you want to go down that path.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lmao I'm not getting medication. It is nowhere near more negative than positive. I <em>occasionally</em> am kept up for a few hours at night. I know anxiety and this is not it. </p></div>		</li>
