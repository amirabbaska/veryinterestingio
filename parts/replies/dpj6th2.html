			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically your rather large uterus presses on the big veins in your belly/pelvis and slows the flow, increasing the relative risk of clots. There are other hormonal factors as well but it's hard to ELI5 them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pregnancy is considered a hypercoaguable state. Basically (through hormones and things) your blood gets way better a clotting up when your pregnant to help prevent postpartum bleeding once you deliver. Considering that everyone is at an increased risk for blood clots on long flights because your legs are stuck in one place and the blood isn't flowing it makes sense the pregnancy would cause an even greater risk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^ this</p>
<p>I broke my ankle pretty recently (it cracked). Everything is attached tho so I just stayed in bed and hopped around when I needed to. I'm young too.</p>
<p>Anyway, I could feel things moving up my leg a couple days later. Didn't totally stop til 2 weeks later.</p>
<p>I've since also stopped taking my birth control pills. I've been having some weird nervous system issues and the neuro said it could be due to blood clotting in my spinal column. Eek.</p>
<p>I was fine with the pills for the first year but then I guess something just happened. Body not made to be in &quot;pregnancy&quot; for that long maybe. My libido also slowly dried up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question- I usually sleep with a pillow under my knees/calves to alleviate lower back pain and knee pain. Usually I kick the pillow off the bed while I’m sleeping, but does this have any effect on blood flow? Although I’m relatively healthy, I’ve been pretty sedentary the last year, taken long flights, and I’m on birth control pills. Should I be worried? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're doing something that hurts the circulation in your legs, you will usually know it because you'll get an edema or a swelling in the limbs. People who sit on hard office chairs all day and get home and notice the skin on their leg looks a little shiny, and their socks are a little tight have experienced this. As long as you aren't waking up with swollen legs, or tingling in your toes from agitating the nerves, then you're probably fine. </p></div>		</li>
