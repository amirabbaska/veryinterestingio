			<div class="markdown"><p>So before this the only thing I associated a catheter with was the one you stick into the bladder. So reading this I imagined an RN repeatedly jamming an needle into a penis to put it in and breaking through the veins. Its 2am my groin hurts and who needs sleep anyway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Commonly we use &quot;catheter&quot; to mean a urinary catheter, but it actually just means a soft hollow tube we are using to connect to part of the body.  An IVC is an intravenous catheter, also called a cannula, which is the one that goes into the blood stream.  The urinary catheter is usually called an IDC or in-dwelling cathether, or more properly an in-dwelling urinary catheter.  In-dwelling refers to it staying in place, as opposed to, for example, an in-out catheter which is when you place an &quot;IDC&quot; just for the time it takes to drain the bladder (usually to sample the urine) or to deliver a drug.  We still call it an IDC when we do this though!  It's just the pattern of use of the terms now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be a little pedantic, just because the catheter advances doesn't mean you're in the vein. You can frequently advance a catheter under the skin and then when you try to flush it will bubble up and be painful. </p></div>		</li>
