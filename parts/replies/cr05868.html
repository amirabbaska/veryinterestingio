			<p>Thank you- that was very interesting and well written. You're smart and will do well in life. Change procrastination by calling it a 10 minute break- set a timer, give yourself one an hour and then get back to work!!</p>		</li>

			<p>There are some great apps and browser add-ons that run on a timer and block time-wasting social media worth scheduled breaks, too. source: chronic procrastinator</p>		</li>

			<p>Great summary!  <br><br>Riddle me this:  I learned, probably in childhood that yellow moth lights 'work' because normal white light resembles moon light they would use for navigation l, resulting in perpetual circling.   Yellow lights in turn didnt attract them due to no moon resemblence.  <br><br>Sounded kosher to me, but curious if that's truly how they work since you clearly know what you're talking about!</p>		</li>

			<p>Uncertain if the Moon's reflected light is the cue, but many insects see green-blue-ultra violet, where we see red-green-blue. I could imagine white light simply contains &quot;all the wavelengths&quot; while yellow has some filtered out, which are apparently the attractant colors.</p>		</li>

			<p>Makes sense...and another tidbit:  Mercury vapor lights attract as well ( to us green hue)... geckos know this and lie in wait for their nightly feast.  <br><br>Thanks!</p>		</li>
