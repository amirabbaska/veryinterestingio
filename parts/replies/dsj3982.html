			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Visited a desert climate for the first time last week (I'm from the US east coast and this was my first time out west) and ended up in the hospital for dehydration. Woke up with a killer migraine and couldn't stop puking long enough to keep down water, so they had to give me an IV and a nausea suppressant. Even after getting out of the hospital it took another day to stop feeling like crap.</p>
<p>TL;DR: if visiting the desert, make sure you drink enough water.</p></div>		</li>
