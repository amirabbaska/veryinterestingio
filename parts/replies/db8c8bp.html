			<div class="markdown"><p>(1) Popular movies today are not 90 minutes on average. The average length of the highest grossing films of the last decade is more like 130 minutes. </p>
<p>(2) I work as a screenwriter, and I can tell you both the first and third acts of a movie are rarely 30 minutes long (15 minutes apiece is more common), and the 2nd act is closer to an hour or more. </p>
<p>So I'm not sure this concept of narration fully answers the question. (Even if you grant the premise, it just kicks the can down the road: why, then, is each act 30 minutes long?) I believe the two-hour standard has more to do with attention spans, budget, and tradition/expectations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often with comedies, that first act is the best part of the movie.... when they are introducing wacky characters in hilarious situations without having to worry about advancing the plot.... once the plot starts to take over and characters have to start showing growth, shit goes downhill fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horror movies IMO are the easiest examples of this. </p>
<p>Act 1 everything is normal with minor spooky stuff happening. </p>
<p>Act 2 Spooky stuff ramps up with full blown midway through act 2.</p>
<p>Act 3 Spooky stuff starts to come down, with characters overcoming the evil (save for any plot twists) climaxes with either a happy ending or setup for a sequel via something unsolved</p></div>		</li>
