<p>For example, civil asset forfeiture in the US is very sophisticated corruption that wouldn't be captured in this metric. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but knowing this, we can understand the kind of corruption being measured. It's essentially measuring what portion of the population participates in corruption, which is an important and interesting metric even if it doesn't measure the type you're talking about.</p>
<p>Remember, there are countries where you need bribes just to drive any large distance. You hit a checkpoint, they ask for your papers. You can either wait an hour while they take their time running them, or hand them a $5 and be on your way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, not least because it is very difficult to define what constitutes corruption. In the case of civil asset forfeiture, it is an odious process but it is also perfectly legal.
Nevertheless, an individual being asked may still answer &quot;yes&quot; to the question if they have recently been subjected to this.
It is even more difficult with e.g. lobbying - in cases like this the person (or institution) paying the bribe actually plans to do so to get what they want, are in cahoots with the lawmaker who is the recipient. It's very unlikely that they'd be tempted to speak up, even anonymously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. What about the practice of hiring a lawyer who can use legal (if not well-known) means to get rid of a traffic ticket, or at least change it from a moving violation to some lesser crime? Is this significantly different from bribing a police officer to 'look the other way' at a traffic stop?</p>
<p>In that same vein, would you consider plea bargains to be a form of corruption?</p></div>		</li>
