			<div class="markdown"><p>The Argentine governments promoted European immigration between the late 19th century and the early 20th century. While most of the immigrants were Southern European (specially Spanish and Italians), there were also a number of German immigrants.</p>
<p>Another matter, unrelated to immigration but related to the Argentine army, is that, when the Argentine Army was professionalized (well, with conscription) in the early 20th century, German advisors were contracted to help organize the Army. Thus, the officer cadre during the first half of the 20th century was somewhat Germanophile - but that doesn't mean Nazi: thousands of Jews emigrated to Argentina in the aftermath of WWII and Peron was the first president to have Jews in his administration.</p></div>		</li>
