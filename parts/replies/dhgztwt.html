			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you only need (relatively) a few healthy sperm cells for the sample to be useful. If you freeze an organ (or a whole body) then you need almost all of the cells to still be healthy. That's still <em>very</em> hard to do. Part of that is because you have to freeze the entire body very very quickly to vitrify it, and partly because the chemicals we currently use to prevent the water from crystallizing are often toxic in the doses necessary to be useful. It's not much use freezing a body if it's going to die from the chemicals you used to &quot;safely&quot; freeze it as soon as it's thawed.</p></div>		</li>
