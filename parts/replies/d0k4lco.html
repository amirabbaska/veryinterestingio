			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this follow up question because at first I thought &quot;smartass&quot; when i read it and then it started to bug me and get me thinking about it.</p>
<p>So what you need to remember is that angular momentum is based on the squared distance of mass from the center of rotation.  So when we are talking about VERY small objects they have almost no angular momentum no matter how fast they are rotating.</p>
<p>But what does that mean?</p>
<p>It means that in this system other energy sources are going to dominate the physical properties of the system.  What other physical properties?  Temperature - which is, btw, what I think the real answer to this question is.</p>
<p>Temperature is the vibration of atoms within their atomic bonds and, since absolute zero is impossible (especially in a system that is supposed to be rotating), we know that even a five atom system is not going to be perfectly symetical due to the vibration of the atoms in the object.</p>
<p>More than that when you try and rotate something this small, quickly, and it's temperature becomes the dominant form of energy in the system, and its center of mass and internal ballance is dynamically changing, well you are going to find physically it just becomes unstable and tumbles uncontrollably until it cools.  So, really, it won't rotate at all, it will just behave as though it were heated.</p>
<p>My thinking anyways.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a thought experiment, so we can safely assume that we have somehow managed to coerce a universe into existence that only contains a spinning spherical magnet of uniform density and a point-like observer that doesn't interfere with the sphere.</p>
<p>The laws of physics would be identical to our universe where needed, and close approximations where it would not impact the experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>why would there be variations in rotation? because each external force that affects the object is pulling its sides to different directions as it rotates? what if the object is not affected by any forces?</p>
<p>edit: while object can lose energy, won't it receive energy (from light) as parts of it un-contract?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a plate with a brick glued on top of it.  You spin the plate in the air.  The brick on the plate is going to cause the plate to spin weird, kind of twisting and shaking in the air.  That is basically what I am describing.  You can try and take the brick off the plate but there will be a tiny, microsocpic bit of glue left on no matter how careful you are, and that will still cause the plate to wobble (though it might be almost imperceptibly).</p></div>		</li>
