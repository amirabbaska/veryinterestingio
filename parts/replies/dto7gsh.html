			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea I think that makes this a virus and not a user made patch is that it seems with a white hat virus the end user has no choice on if they install it or not.</p>
<p>If the virus was just a normal executable that you downloaded to patch vulnerabilities it would not have the virus distinction. Or that seems to be why it would receive the label virus when it is infact a 100% positive change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct. A virus is defined as a piece of code that executes regardless of the user's intent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda, in most cases it's more like the white hat viruses look for exploits that need to be patched and then rather than use that data for something nefarious they give it to the company who owns the product (sometimes for a reward) so they can fix it themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why companies like Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, and the like are strongly encouraged to fund their big bounty programs to encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities to them instead of selling them on the black market.</p>
<p>The hackers* are finding the vulnerability - now they want to be paid for their efforts. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, and good answer.   There is another category we call proof of concept viruses. Someone will write a public virus to prove their skill to a buyer who wants a specifically targeted virus for a corporate espionage hack or other targeted crime.  Many famous but innocuous viruses turn out to be auditions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Want to show someone you can write a virus that gets installed all over the web? Submit it to npm, submit a pull request to a popular package pulling in your change. Watch your download count skyrocket.</p>
<p>Gah, npm blows my mind sometimes...</p></div>		</li>
