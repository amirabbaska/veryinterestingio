<p>See it's all full of confusing stuff but I might think 'this is the kind of thing people will read'. This doesn't comply with all the rules of news writing but it's pretty close:</p>
<p>Could e-cigarette users face a higher cancer risk than smokers?</p>
<p>Alternatives to tobacco, such as e-cigarettes, have become increasingly popular in recent years, and are much-touted for their health benefits.</p>
<p>However, a new study, which found that smokeless tobacco users have higher levels of carcinogens than smokers, could end any claims that alternatives to cigarettes are better for you than cigarettes themselves.</p>
<p>The research, which was published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, found people who use smokeless tobacco have higher levels of tobacco constituents cotinine, NNAL and other deadly toxins than people who exclusively smoked cigarettes.</p>
<p>Brian Rostron, PhD, an epidemiologist in the Center for Tobacco Products at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said that these biomarkers show that smokeless tobacco users face &quot;adverse health effects, including cancer&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Our findings demonstrate the need for continuing study of the toxic constituents of smokeless tobacco as well as their health effects on the individuals who use them,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>As well as e-cigarettes, other popular nicotine-replacement devices include snus, snuff and chewing tobacco.</p>
<p>PS it's all bullshit man, the study's about smokeless tobacco products, and I strongly assume that this means snuff and snus and chewing tobacco and that ecigs don't even count. But nobody's gonna sue me and it's the kinda thing people would share.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. You just took an article and a bunch of quotes about smokeless tobacco products, which like you said, obviously includes snus, etc.. and maybe even dip, and without misquoting anybody or anything obvious like that, you managed to plant in the brains of anyone reading it that e-cigs are worse for your health than cigarettes. You did that. You nearly did that to me! That's not cool with me, and all you had to do was ask a leading question or two at the very beginning mentioning e-cigs and you let the reader make their own inferences. But <em>you knew. You knew exactly</em> what inferences they would make <em>and that they'd be incorrect, and that was the intention.</em> But you didn't lie so no one can be mad at you.</p>
<p>You.. you are the devil. I knew the situation was bad but to witness before my eyes how easily a professional at work just churns out a lie-not-a-lie is... frightening. But, also completely amazing. I mean I've taken courses on logic so I understand how this works but the fact that I almost didn't catch it makes me wonder, what else have I read that used subtle techniques for the directed purpose of causing me make an assumption on my own that the authors know themselves is untrue? I don't know, it's scary. Its super neat, but it's scary and I'm scared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did similar things for several years because I was <em>determined</em> to pay rent by writing, and was largely pretty successful. But here's the thing: if you want the internet to stop being filled with shitty clickbait articles written by desperate people, then <strong>pay for good content</strong>. The reason why /u/toastshop and I did things like this isn't because we wanted to, but because it's really, really hard to make money writing online.</p>
<p>When every website is fully free and runs on ad revenue, then you're going to get writing quality commiserate with whatever the ad revenue is - which is never much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stopped trusting journalism for anything after I had been interviewed a few times and did some things that were newsworthy (in local and university news). </p>
<p>Reading the articles just always made me think &quot;well, I said that or did that but I said and did some other things as well that were not mentioned at all, and which put the things in print in a different context&quot;. </p>
<p>After a few times of this I figured out that hey, this is probably the case for every event and interview.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't even do it any more. But I wasn't unusually good at it. If you do anything for a few years it becomes simple. </p>
<p>I was kinda happy I became a joke of a journo on the internet, rather than a proper journo in an actual newspaper, because I became increasingly disgusted with newspapers once I got involved in the industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking the top comment to say - I'm a scientist, I regularly get asked to comment for the BBC / other, and even they DON'T CARE ABOUT ACCURACY.  There's a news story on BBC news in the last few months where I was misquoted, despite offering (and being promised) a quick look over the copy to check that it was scientifically accurate.  The worst thing is that scientists are then castigated for being aloof and not talking to the media.  We would be happy to talk to the media if they DIDN'T COMPLETELY  DISTORT WHAT WE SAID.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But yeah, it's unfortunate, especially between R&amp;D and journalism. the goals of each party in the situation just don't line up. heck considering how people respond more when angered, it probably works out better for a journalist to leave an exaggerated quote in a longer news story that they can 'correct' later on to maintain an image of transparency.</p></div>		</li>

It's like the space shuttle and I'm a Wright brother. It should be required reading for humans who read the internet. </p></div>		</li>
