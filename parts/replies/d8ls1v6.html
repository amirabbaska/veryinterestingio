<p>Does it need to be easily accessible without tools (or cheap)-&gt; flathead (you can use almost anything which is flat for unscrewing/screwing it) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of the UK's Royal Air Force nuclear bombs - the set up cover was secured by a screw which would be undone with a penny - no locks, no security devices, no PAL etc, just a pair of small screws to set up the bomb, and the arming was done with a single bicycle lock key</p>
<p>They're long gone now of course, but the Trident warheads on our subs don't have PAL and are secured witha simple key. When questioned about this, the Admiralty commented &quot;It would be invidious to suggest... that senior Service officers may, in difficult circumstances, act in defiance of their clear orders.&quot;.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about Robertson heads? I know they have a lot of advantages for carpentry because they resist cam out, are usable with power tools, and can be turned with flathead or Phillips head screwdrivers if no Robertson screwdriver is available. I've never understood why they're not more popular outside of Canada.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is torque going to be a problem (so if you would destroy a Philips screw by screwing it in)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't make sense considering torx is used in electronics quite often. I'm pretty sure torque isn't the main concern there</p></div>		</li>

<p>Generally with electronics, it specifies something that shouldn't be opened (e.g. hard drive cases)</p>
<p>The screws used to hold a hard drive into a PC case are usually phillips.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually makes perfect sense. In small electronics with such tiny screws, a Philips head conceivably would strip under the forces needed to fasten it where a torx would not. To make the Philips strong enough the head would need to be larger and fatter and that might get in the way.</p></div>		</li>
