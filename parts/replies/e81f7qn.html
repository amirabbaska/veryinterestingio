<p>I'm curious, if the sun were to capture an extrasolar body in a retrograde orbit, what would that look like, long term?  Is there any chance of it being 'reversed' without crashing into the sun? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would most likely run into issues from interacting gravitationally with the Sun's other natural satellites. Jupiter in particular is a notorious changer of orbits. Without constraining the start condition further than 'capture of an extrasolar body into a retrograde solar orbit,' it's hard to predict whether it would end up in a stable orbit or not, and if that stable orbit would still be retrograde. The most likely outcomes are that gravitational interactions with the planets end up yanking it into a prograde orbit, ejecting it from the solar system again, or causing it to collide with something (most likely Jupiter).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Therefore the real question is whether such a retrograde orbit is possible.  It would appear that under almost every circumstance, any stable orbit will be a &quot;forward&quot; orbit however it leaves the question whether a retrograde orbit is feasible.  I do not know much about actual astronomical bodies but I must surmise that if such an orbit were possible there would be at least one actual physical body exhibiting such an orbit currently, given the time that has passed since the solar system &quot;formed&quot;.  Are there?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a youtube video that actually demonstrates the angular momentum example, though he uses the added explanation of how any bits going in the other direction were wiped out naturally by collisions over time.</p>

<p>So even if there was stuff going in the other direction, it would have eventually collided with the stuff going in the main direction, and at best merge, and at worst fall into the sun or be sling shotted by it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is. The Sun's rotation is tilted only about 7 degrees to Earth's orbital plane, so the alignment is fairly close.</p></div>		</li>
