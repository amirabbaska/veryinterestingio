			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  I work in pharma R&amp;D re: FDA submissions of new drugs (hem/onc these days; you probably see commercials for the drugs I've worked on in recent years). While generic drugs are generally fine, there is no real regulatory oversight to ensure their manufacturing processes lead to identical level of active molecule.  By that, I mean the pills/tablets/capsules you take aren't JUST the active treatment.  There are other ingredients, for instance, to stagger digestion in the stomach.</p>
<p>What this means is, you may have a deviation of active drug from what is advertised.  10mg of Ritalin may be 9.7mg with a generic.  OR it could be 10.2mg, too.  Point is, the data we have from clinical trials are from carefully controlled studies with subjects taking the exact dose on the label.  Parent companies are obligated to manufacture their name brand products with precision.  Part of this is because of the need for safety surveillance studies after a drug is approved.  By the time a drug reaches the end of a patent, those studies have long concluded.</p>
<p>Problem is, with sometimes millions of people taking a drug, you may be unlucky enough to find yourself on a threshold where you, as an individual, do not get the same effects from 9.7mg as you would from 10mg.  Improbable, but when you're one of thousands of millions, that's just the numbers playing against you.</p>
<p>As an example, I have narcolepsy and need to take a drug called Nuvigil every day so I don't need a dozen naps during the workday.  I ran into major trouble in 2017 because I thought I'd built a tolerance, which does happen with this drug occasionally.  I quit it for high dose adderall.  Once I realized I didn't do well on addy, I switched back to Nuvigil.  Still wasn't working very well.  Neurologist switched me to the Teva brand version and I'm back to normal again.</p>
<p>Not to say the anti placebo effect isn't a factor for many, but it seems like we're getting into a chicken/egg scenario without any studies specifically targeted to answer this question. Meaning, did someone form an opinion of generic drugs after they legitimately did not experience the same efficacy they did from the name brand. The source of bias is very important.</p>
<p>Edit: Quick Google search to back up my post.  <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/variation_in_make_up_of_generic_epilepsy_drugs_can_lead_to_dosing_problems" target="_blank">https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/variation_in_make_up_of_generic_epilepsy_drugs_can_lead_to_dosing_problems</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of this law, passed during the Reagan administration, states that generic formulations must have a peak blood concentration and total amount absorbed that falls between 80 percent and 125 percent of the name-brand version.</p>
<p>That range is suitable for the vast majority of pharmaceuticals, says Krauss. However, he notes, for some “critical dose” drugs that have a high potential for over- or underdosing, the window could be significantly narrower.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard of studies where patients are given the same generic painkillers in both generic boxes and name brand boxes and they report the name brand work better, although that's just based on what they report not on a measurable effect on thier health.  Unfortunately I don't have a link.  </p>
<p>It's similar to the effect where they put coca cola in a coca cola cup and in a off brand cola cup and people say it's better in the coke cup but whether they really experience a better taste or if they just say that due to expectations is impossible to know.  </p></div>		</li>

After treatment was done they explained that the recovery meds (stuff they give to mitigate the negative effects of the chemo) would be impacted if we were super apathetic and depressed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would you separate the lack of placebo and the nocebo? Or does it even make sense to speak of some medicine's effect outside of the placebo effect?</p>
<hr />
<p>Example: You take a legit pill, you're told this will help your whatever symptoms. You are then given the same pill, and told that this is just a sugar pill.</p>
<p>How will you different any eventual measurable nocebo effect from the drop in effectiveness?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One would have to do a multivariable analysis.
Test one: Name-brand pill presented as generic
Test two: Generic presented as name-brand
Test three: Sugar presented as generic
Test four: Sugar presented as name-brand
with these testing measures you could see a direct comparison between all variables.</p></div>		</li>
