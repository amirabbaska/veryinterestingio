			<div class="markdown"><p>Having worked with both alcoholics and opiate abusers. Alcohol is much more acute. Opiate w/d resembles the flu with cravings. They do not die. If no intervention is done with alcohol w/d, they can die. W/D from Benzodiazepines can also be lethal. The most compromised human I ever saw (30 yrs. psych. work) was an alcohol w/d case, that no one saw soon enough. FUBAR. If a cannabis user came into the unit for detox, the junkies would have laughed at them. W/D from cannabis is boredom. Long reply to: you are right on.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my worse nightmare as someone who has experienced alcohol withdrawal. Not being seen soon enough. It got so bad I just lied and said I puked blood and the ER doctor was like good job you puked blood because I was experiencing severe DTs. Two years sober now :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dear redditor,  your too brief story is almost typical. Many folks in w/d get &quot;discovered&quot;  just as you did. The ER Docs are really perceptive when it comes to alcohol w/d. They need to be. The best? Your recovering. I suspect the last two yrs. has been as difficult and rewarding as you've ever experienced. Being near death will do that. All my best wishes. You deserve them, and more. Namaste </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has been through opiate withdrawal several times, i can attest to the fact that is far more severe than the flu. With the flu you don't experience severe depression and anxiety. Or feel like you are going to die, even though won't. </p>
<p>With that said alcohol withdrawal is far worse, lasts longer and as you mentioned, can actually kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the thousands of people that die each year from the flu would object to your opinion, if they could. 23,607 a year on average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't address the severity of opiate w/d to any great extent. It is much more than just flu symptoms, as you noted. We used  Methadone to taper. The issue? It's as addictive, if not more so, than heroin. The difference is street shit vrs. pharmaceuticals. A clinic was set up for them to taper or be dosed after d.c. Thanks for the input
Ms./Mr. netizen. It's been awhile since I've done tx. Someone or a group should do an A.M.A. to dispel the bullshit, and general ignorance about all drugs. Thanks again and congrats.</p></div>		</li>
