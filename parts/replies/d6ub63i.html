<p>I think this sentence might be missing a word or two. Which sucks because I really want to know if getting a wound wet in the shower is bad or not. Does the water clean the wound or could it contaminate it  with bacteria or dirt from the water or the showerhead or something? What if a hair ends up in the wound?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, when I had an open wound my doc said I can shower normally, dry it and bandage it, although that wound was to &quot;bleed out&quot; an infection? there, so could be different other times, best to just ask every time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>S/He left out a comma: Getting it wet in the shower is, almost universally, pat dry and cover with bandage. </p>
<p>Basically, after it gets wet in the shower pat it dry, dont scrub it with your towel, and put a bandage back on it. Unless you bathe in the Ganges or haven't washed your towels in a week you'll be fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>check out hydrofera blue if you haven't already.  worked wonders for my leg (wide local excision with 3cm margins - skin graft failed).  i had to consult a wound care specialist about it and he got me on those foam pads.  took 2 months of sitting on my butt to heal, but it did (i got pics if you are really interested but it is pretty gory)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they took the entire dermis so there was a hole in my leg down to the muscle.  they said they even scraped the fascia off the muscle.  keep in mind this was the second wide local excision in the same spot within 2 years due to melanoma.</p>
<p>anyway, the skin graft didn't seem to have much to 'stick' to and moved around during dressing changes.  it eventually started turning yellow/brown and we thought there might be an infection.  skin graft actually did take in a small spot (maybe the size of a dime) near the middle which helped.  just wouldn't continue healing so they brought in the wound care specialist.  he said there was probably a biofilm formed that slowed additional healing so they scraped off the skin graft (without local anesthesia - ouch).  cleaned it and started me on the hydrofera blue pads.  i had to change them every two days.  well, friends and family had to so i'd remove the dressing and go get a shower and then someone would redress the wound.  i used the pads until they stopped turning white (they absorb bacteria into the pad, bacteriostatic, and two dyes to kill it or something like that).  this went on for two months in which i was instructed not to do much of anything and keep the leg elevated.  i took a picture journal to keep the wound care specialist appraised of progress and you can see the new skin growing in from the sides and out from the center.  still kinda amazes me that i got through it</p>
<p>edit: if you're really morbid - <a href="http://snarkfish.net/wound_care/" target="_blank">here</a>'s the photos i took each dressing change (as well as a few from after the surgery but before the skin graft failed and a couple others during the suspected graft failure)</p></div>		</li>
