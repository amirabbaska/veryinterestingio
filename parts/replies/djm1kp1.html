			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to note, that BMI of 23 is not even close to the overweight category, let alone obese. </p>
<p>The real conclusion there in the original source is that being quite lean appears to be cardioprotective, so long as you don't get there by smoking. </p>
<p>But the correlation also falls apart badly in a number of demographics, which suggests that the other known relationships with visceral and abdominal bodyfat are likely the more relevant predictors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different ethnic groups store fat differently. East Asian people show negative health effects of fat at a BMI of as low as 23. </p>
<p>Regardless, the evidence is overwhelming that being overweight/obese is devastating to your health.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. But a BMI of 23 is not categorically overweight by any stretch and it'd be a really counterproductive public health message to try to go in that direction. First focus absolutely needs to be on the 35+ and 30-35 groups, and telling a sedentary 250lb person at 5'10&quot; that they'd &quot;still be fat&quot; at 160lbs will only hurt the big picture. </p>
<p>Also, BMI itself is a terrible individual diagnostic measure. It's useful across a large population with known averages on the other variables, but a BMI of, say, 23, can easily range from an outrageously lean and healthy athlete to a very inactive person with alarmingly low lean body mass and alarmingly high lipids. </p>
<p>Totally agree with the basic concept of a healthy body composition being important, though, and it's probably the biggest problem the developed world is facing now in health. It's just critical that we approach the issue in a careful way in an environment where anything over a couple hundred characters may as well be a PhD dissertation as far as the public is concerned. </p></div>		</li>
