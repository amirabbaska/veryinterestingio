It's about coming across a question or topic you otherwise never would have encountered in the &quot;wild&quot;. I learn more things here <em>because</em> OP chooses not to Google.</p>
<p>That's why it irks me when people say &quot;durrr took me 2 secs to Google it!&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>side note: this actually happened. Ford was sued for it but, they got off Scot free due to the fact that the civil rights act said race, color, religion, sex, or national origin instead of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to chip in here to say that intersectionality branches out further than just gender and race (though that’s where it stems from). It can also look at class, sexuality, whether you are cis or trans, ability and disability, age and other identities. Some are more relevant in others in some situations.</p>
<p>Also if anyone remembers the ‘check your privilege’ thing from a while back, that was kind of a basic conscious raising activity based on the idea of sectionally. Acknowledging that while you are a woman you may hold more positions of power as a white woman in America compared to a black woman in America for instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but isn't &quot;power&quot; determined by where you are?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I work in tech and all of the executives are racial minorities, many of them are women as well.  White men are probably less than %15 of the company.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do the same power dynamics apply to this scenario?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in some sense. In the tech industry there is a dominance of Asian men in senior engineering positions and middle level management positions but there is a dearth of C-suite Asian men. This leads to employment surveys showing 'too many' Asian men in management, but they get stuck at the middle levels and never break through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, it's entirely contextual. But power isn't just measured by representation. If white men are regarded with equal authority, if they have the same amount of space in conversations, and if their opinions are considered just as valuable as every other employee, then you've got an even playing field.</p>
<p>But no company exists in a vacuum. If you're in the US, there are power dynamics outside the company that will have an effect regardless of the makeup of the employee base. That effect is what we need to stay aware of and compensate for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is contextual but also within context many things are relevant. For instance, as a guy if I was working with everyone in my workplace being female i'd never feel any of the base level threat, anxiety or just insecurity that many women would feel being the only woman in a space where everyone else was a guy. Socially it might not be great for me in some ways but the point is you can't take someone into a specific context and forget about all the other outside influences on them. </p></div>		</li>
