			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have a couple of pieces of this telescope, my favorite one is the reflector mount. Its milled out of a single piece of titanium alloy and has multiple flex point(joints) that make it so it can flex and focus the mirrors. It's small maybe an inch in diameter, and I have it balancing a piece of tungsten, It moves and wobbles but always stays true. Really cool engineering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Parts are ones that did not meet the tolerance for whatever reason. they were off by a thousandth of an inch, or the holes were wrong. Most of what I have are the scrap pieces that were thrown away or discarded. they became desk ornaments or paperweights at Ball here in Boulder, CO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've already done some shake table testing at Goddard. The facility they had to use for it is ridiculous, absolutely immense table located right next to the biggest clean room in the world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they just had it in a chamber for several weeks simulating the several hundred degrees below zero that it will encounter in space making sure that all the parts work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only all of that, but they also have to take into account the force of gravity on earth when it's made will not be there when it's in space. Pretty impressive.</p></div>		</li>
