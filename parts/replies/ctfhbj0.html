			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, I crunched the numbers and running my overclocked rig to do this used a significant amount of power. Fine when I was in the dorm. Not cool when I started paying my own utilities. I think with the more efficient chips these days you're unlikely to see much. Just something to keep in mind. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are not, to my knowledge, sending an intentional signal at this time. Such a signal would require a great deal of energy to generate av transmission signal (think of it as power to go far without dissipation) AND be of a wavelength which won't be easily absorbed by interstellar clouds AND an place to point it toward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've pointed them in various places before. The only notable one I can think of is the globular cluster M13, some 25000 light years away. Even though the purpose of that message wasn't to deliberately establish contact, if anyone actually receives the message, it will be quiet a while before we hear a response. </p>

<p>Given the comparative low cost of SETI and the enormous impact of a successful detection the cost/benefit probably makes it worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would the enormous impact look like? We're talking about civilizations hundreds or thousands of LY away. We couldn't reach them any time soon, we are probably centuries away from the technology and even more centuries from actual contact.</p>
<p>Is the hope that whatever targeted signal they are emitting contains all kinds of secrets to the universe and advanced technology? What if it's the equivalent of the Voyager package and just time capsule stuff?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some huge portion of the world's population believes in a magical space man because a person thousands of years ago made up a story about it.  Proving that there actually are real space men, and they aren't Christian, would pull the rug out from billions of people.</p>
<p>That's the smallest impact even a Voyager time capsule would have.</p>
<p>The greatest impact could be our very existence.  There's an explanation for why we haven't encountered aliens that says that some experiment that follows from a certain level of science results in their destruction.  That would be the most critical piece of information we could possible learn.  The only way to advance past a cataclysmic science event would be to learn from the mistakes of others.</p>
<p>And the cost to listen is just marginally slower overall progress, equivalent to any of the thousands of other ways we waste our time and energy.  It's a no-brainer.</p></div>		</li>
