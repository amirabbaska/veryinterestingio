			<div class="markdown"><p>The article talks in-depth about where this comes from but the gist of it is that fertilizer is made from apatite, which is a mineral. Loads of apatite is added to tobacco to coerce the plant into producing a certain taste. (Phosphates in apatite lead to nitrogen reduction, which creates the chemicals involved in the flavor.)</p>
<p>Apatite is mined, and tobacco is grown in poor areas, so the apatite they use in cheap fertilizer often contains lots of Lead-210.</p>
<p>The half-life* of Pb-210 is 22 years or so, which means it decays slowly enough to be a hazard for a long time. Pb-210 decays into Bi-210 via beta radiation, which can be extremely harmful to cells. Bi-210 has a half-life of 5 days, and it decays into Po-210 via beta radiation. Po-210 decays into Pb-206 via alpha radiation, which is only dangerous if it hits the nose, mouth, and lungs. The half-life of Po-210 is 138 days.</p>
<p>Pb-206 is the same lead they used to put in gasoline, the stuff that can cause brain damage (though smokers' exposure to Pb-206 is apparently not as high as inhaling leaded gasoline fumes)</p>
<p>(Other studies have suggested that the leaves of the tobacco plant can also absorb Pb-210 and Po-210 from the air, though the authors of the cited article do not believe this is the primary source of either.)</p>
<p>*Note that half-life is the time it takes for 1/2 the sample to decay, and after 1 half-life, the remaining 1/2 of the sample is still radioactive, though less so. After another half-life, 1/4 of the sample is still radioactive, and so on.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Fertilizer is made from minerals rich in Pb-210. Pb-210 emits radiation for decades, and its products emit radiation. All this radiation can cause cancer, especially in the nose, mouth, and lungs. The final product is still lead, which can cause brain damage.</p></div>		</li>
