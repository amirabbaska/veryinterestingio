			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like a bit of an urban legend now, but I was told as a kid that the surveyors originally came out as precisely 29,000ft. They decided that nobody would believe that was accurate, so declared the height of the mountain to be 29,002ft.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest#Measurement" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> has the story, too. So perhaps there is truth to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought the follow-up to the decision to do that- &quot;Waugh is therefore wittily credited with being 'the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest'.&quot; - was pretty cute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other aspect is the height difference between the two points you measure the angle of the summit from. To get it more accurate you want the point to be further apart I believe, but the further apart they are, the more significant the height difference</p>
<p>I mean, you can just do the same process again! But it's another layer of complexity... </p></div>		</li>
