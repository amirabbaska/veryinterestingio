<p>EDIT: You have no idea how badly I wanted to argue with every single reply to this comment. I just don't have time at work and thanks to /u/deathnotice01 I've realized that I won't have time after work either. Since I'm just going to be sleeping with each and every one of your mothers...</p>

<p>This right here is why Wikipedia is considered an unreliable source.  While those who monitor changes to Wikipedia try to eliminate such things there is no real effort to prevent an article writer quoting from a made up source in the first place.</p>
<p>Even when real and legitimate sources are quoted, not all of those sources are vetted to see that they are actually using the quoted words <em>exactly</em>, in the way that academics expect them to be used.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't that any Encyclopedia? But also isn't that any non-primary source? If I read a book that is about the War of the Roses by some historian, I didn't actually read the Treaty of Tours. </p>
<p>And there are tons of history books out there that are wrong. </p>
<p>That's really what gets me, the issues with Wikipedia aren't anything unique to any kind of historical document that is a non-primary source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is certainly true today, and was probably even true in the early days of Wikipedia, that's also the point!</p>
<p>In academia you're generally citing primary and secondary sources in order to back up your OWN statements and original arguments.  A critical reader is going to be questioning your source material's reliability at the outset regardless of your source.  And keep in mind that Wikipedia can be accurate but won't always be, and that primary sources can ALSO be accurate but ALSO won't always be.</p>
<p>But when you cite wikipedia as your source, you're citing a TERTIARY source, which aggregates information from primary and secondary sources.  On top of that, it is constantly changing unlike published encyclopedias.  It will take your readers significantly more work to find the source material, analyze the context and bias (if secondary), and come to their conclusion about the reliability of your citation.  On wikipedia, the facts you cite might have been removed before your reader looks them up.  But when you cite a primary or even secondary source, your reader will have an easier time determining reliability of the facts you're assuming to be true in YOUR argument.  If they're well versed in the subject, they may have already read your source material, be familiar with the authors or publishers, etc.</p>
<p>As an author of a paper, you generally want to lead your readers the shortest path of breadcrumbs possible, so that they have an easy time verifying what you give them.  The goal is to get readers to side with you, and hiding the ball doesn't do you any favors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have time to write the full response I want to write, but just two main things.</p>
<p>Certainly Wikipedia is a secondary source in a number of cases, where the footnote is pointing to the original&gt;</p>
<p>But as far as the facts, that is both Wikipedia's greatest strength as well as its weakness. A number of wrong facts have propagated into the world for so long because they continue to be in authoritative sources. These sources are then never fixed, or they exist for a long time. Wikipedia allows the flaws to be fixed without both making a new print run, and the author acknowledging them as flaws, which is often a whole issue in itself.</p>
<p>People also see books are more authoritative, so things that are wrong tend to be taken more seriously, and less critically.</p>
<p>What this all boils down to is what studies have shown, that Wikipedia is no more or no less correct than your average encyclopedia or large group of books in a subject. But people view it as less correct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Looking up an archived copy of a web page takes like four orders of magnitude less time than driving to the nearest decently large city to find a book that has been out of print for thirty years.</p></div>		</li>
