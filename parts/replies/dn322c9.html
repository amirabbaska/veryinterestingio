			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi red_bob. There are a number of ideas out there. One idea is that larger organisms have more tumor suppressor genes, or copies of tumor suppressor genes. This idea has the strongest support in elephants, where a couple of studies showed that they have a lot more copies of this famous suppressor called TP53 than we do. Another notion suggests that larger animals have better immune systems, what is called surveillance. They can detect and eliminate young tumors more efficiently. Also, larger animals' cells may be better able to divide more often than ours without starting into crisis. And then there's the tumor-on-a-tumor idea. Right now I see these as the leading hypotheses, probably in that order. </p>
<p>EDIT: I want to make clear that these are not all my ideas. There are a series of really nice review papers on this topic, mostly out of Carlo Maley's group. As soon as I get clear of the initial questions (thanks!) I'll start posting references. I really didn't expect so many questions so early. This is great!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's it. Here's the scale we're talking about. A bumblebee bat weighs about 0.002 kg, and a blue whale weighs something like 190,000 kg. Yet their cells are the same size. That's approaching the mass of 3,000 human beings. So in the simplest, roughest way of looking at it, a single blue what should experience the same cancer rate at about 3,000 people combined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is what I called a hypertumor. The name comes from the concept of hyperparasite--a parasite that parasitizes a parasite. (Say that 5 times fast.) One of my first cancer models had this cool property that a small focus of cells could grow into a tumor because they &quot;cheated.&quot; In particular, they didn't secrete factors that help form blood vessels. Because they didn't do that, they always had more energy for growth than the &quot;cooperators&quot; who produced the factor. So they parasitized the tumor. And since they always have an advantage, no matter how common they become and how poorly vascularized the tumor becomes, they always wiped the tumor out. It seems counterintuitive, but remember these cells aren't thinking, &quot;hey, I'm killing myself, so I should stop.&quot; They're little machines that either have an advantage or don't. So they can commit evolutionary suicide, a term coined by my friend Kalle Parvinen at the University of Turku. Here's his paper:</p>
