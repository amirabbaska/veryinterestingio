			<div class="markdown"><p>For most people, melatonin doesn't make sleep happen, it regulates it. It's only a hormone whose main job is to send signals to the brain on as to when to sleep and wake up. This is obviously very very simplied but I'm sure there are many more options for you out there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've tried everything from prescription sleep aids to home remedies. For whatever reason the only thing that's ever helped me &quot;feel sleepy&quot; (something I almost never naturally experience) is a liquid multi mineral with large doses of c, d3, calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, hesperidin, optiMSM, silica dioxide, selenium, boron, and some trace stuff. I had zero expectation that it would work and zero explanation as to why it seems to but whatever I'll take it. Now I'd love to be able to STAY asleep but hey baby steps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably the magnesium. Magnesium has depressant effects. And waking early is a tough form of insomnia to treat. For going to sleep, in addition to sleep aids you should probably start some sleep training and improve your sleep hygiene. Instead of just winging it, make getting ready for bed an active process to train your body and brain that these are the actions to get ready for bed. </p></div>		</li>
