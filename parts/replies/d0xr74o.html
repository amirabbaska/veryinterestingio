			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you assume that the fourth variable is time, would it be accurate to say that the 4d &quot;plot&quot; would actually be a series of images of how that respective 3d object moves over time?</p>
<p>Edit: or if 3 dimensions were our traditional x,y,z and the fourth was any other variable such as velocity, force, etc that would be acting on the object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably the best visualization we could give. A section of the Hypercone could be a sphere expanding in space at a constant rate. I think this misses a lot of data by having to change your picture. But definitely valid.</p>
<p>I like your idea for other variables. One useful extra dimension is temperature. It's a number for indexing a state, so it can be a dimension. So now looking for solutions of G(x, y, z) = k is looking for all the places in space that are the same temperature (say, 4 degrees). That is also a good visualization and more accurate, I think, then having the fourth dimension as time (which would actually not be a fundamentally true model of the universe (but still useful!), it would allow for infinite speeds and non-relativistic phenomena; a Newtonian universe.</p>
<p>edit: an extra word

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a useful visualization, but there are a lot of pitfalls to doing that because you're adding a time component to a space concept. The 4d &quot;plot&quot; is actually 4d space, so 3d space + time generally works when trying to reason about 4d space, but it's not an extensible model because the strategy breaks down when you start adding 5th, 6th, and further dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually not a good way of thinking about it. While an indestructible ball rolling down a hill could be represented as a 3D structure evolving over time(4D), most time based problems are higher dimensional spaces and require more finess to conceptualize. A good way of conceptualizing only 4D spaces is to thing about 3D spaces being shown in a mirror, or light casting 3D shadows(which for te sun relates to time but for non-solar light the same model can be constructed just having the light be on a fourth axis).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fascinating! I don't think I'll ever really understand geometry above 3 dimensions, but it's so cool to hear about what can be done.</p>
<p>Is there any way to create a projection of what the 4D graph might look like that contains 3D curves like spheres, paraboloids, ellipsoids, and hyperboloids?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might not be exactly what you're looking for, but someone is currently developing a 4D video game called Miegakure. They have a trailer with some really awesome visuals, and it might help you wrap your head around what 4D object would look like (at least, from the perspective of a 3D observer).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may have heard of it (or even read it), but just in case you haven't, there's a very old, classic book called <em>Flatland</em> that you might really enjoy.  A 3D being visits a 2D being and tries to explain 3 physical dimensions.  I've always loved it.</p></div>		</li>
