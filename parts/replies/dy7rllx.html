<p>Does this include quantum tunneling as well?</p>

<p>Understood. But any inhabitant of Flatland would say this very thing as well. Or am I wrong?</p>
<p>But I'm also familiar with the argument that the incorporation of higher-dimension would make many of the QM (or GR?) maths incorrect.</p>
<p>So I'm not hung up on it, but I do appreciate your time in talking to me about it :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tunneling is the extension of the probability density (not exactly but close) extended into/beyond some potential barrier. The 'jump' is a known part of the function in 3D. There isn't a discontinuity like you would expect with the 4D scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tunneling isn't teleportation. Tunneling is when the probability distribution function of a wave extends into or through the potential energy barrier that is confining it. In essence it's the wave/particle behaving in an unconfined manner even though it's confined. This allows systems to 'escape' their potential energy well without having extra energy added (I. E. The wave/particle tunnels through the wall that's trapping it) . Phosphorescence is an example of this (although there's some complications for it involving 'coupling' that I won't go into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tunneling isn't a teleportation in the classical sense. It's just the statement that even if the probability density for the particles position is denser on one side of a barrier, it can still be nonzero on the other side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So my understanding has gone from &quot;an electron orbits an atom like a planet orbits a star&quot; to &quot;an electron jumps from location to location around an atom&quot; to &quot;the probability density cloud in both position and momentum/velocity deforms (generally) smoothly over time&quot;, not even sure I understand the latter although that's certainly a problem with me and not your explanation.</p>
<p>Why do I feel like understanding physics is just moving from one inaccurate description to another? Guess it's probably cause my maths isn't up to par, huh? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not doing the math yourself doesn't help, but doing it only helps so much until you think about it.  </p>
<p>In an equilibrium state (one of those 'energy levels' or 'orbitals' you got told about in high school), the electron is in a &quot;stationary&quot; state--the chances of finding it in any particular place is constant over time.  The same is also true of the momentum distribution, though: it's not zero, so in some sense it's &quot;moving around&quot; the nucleus.  However, in order for there to be no net movement the movement must not change anything.  </p>
<p>Thinking of an electron as being in a particular place at any given time is unhelpful: it's distributed over the places it could possibly be at any given time. It's not that the quantum state describes some probability that the electron is here or there, the quantum state <em>entirely</em> describes the electron.  In an awful lot of processes the idea that quantum particles are localised to any particular place is just unhelpful.  </p>
<p>Tunnelling is an example of something that's made out to be much more complicated than it is.  A half-silvered mirror is an example of tunneling: the metal is a potential barrier for photons, but if you make it quite thin then some of the light gets through.  The <em>exact same physics</em> holds for all other particles, but people think it's all weird when it happens to electrons.</p>

<p>Is there any &quot;research&quot; into considering the electron as a &quot;higher-dimensional&quot; particle?</p>

<p>In a sense, this is what string theory does. &quot;Particles&quot; for string theory are, as one may guess from the name alone, strings, which is the next step from a point-particle: 0-dimensional (point) -&gt; 1-dimensional (line-element/circle). And the particles of the standard model (of which the electron is one) to string theory (from the type II point of view at least), would be open string end-points. This is a bit like what you say</p>

<p>The part that's visible in our 4D world is the point - the very tip of the electron if it were a hyper-sphere.</p>

<p>but not a sphere intersecting the 4D space-time, but a string (and it is just not intersecting, but it is actually attached (as it has boundary conditions to satisfy (which in turns defines a brane (which is another fundamental object with dimensions higher and lower than the string (and so on, similarly to [1]))))).</p>

<p>I'm afraid it is not like that. A string would have &quot;orientation&quot; (in some aspects), meaning it matters which end we are talking about, and this would affect their charges; think &quot;electron/positron&quot;.</p>
<p>But I'm not sure how a tunnelling (in this sense) would be seen from string theory, I have at least never seen such a calculation from a stringy point of view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a very good point. The 'part that's visible in our 4D world' you mentioned is the observable properties, e.g. position, momentum, spin, charge. Don't treat position as a special property as others, although we are more familiar with position and momentum in our everyday life.</p>
<p>The current well-accepted description of quantum level particles is the wavefunction, the square of which is the probability distribution in the space you are interested in. This means it's not a proper view to think of the particle as a solid dot that jumps everywhere. Instead, you might want to accept the intuition that the particle is a physical entity that is described by a wavefunction, which can be observed by experiment in the area that has an non-zero probability. The non-zero probability of this distribution on both sides of a (finite) barrier makes the 'tunneling' possible.</p>
<p>Back to theories about the 'higher-dimensions' that we can not observe, one theory you might be interested in is about entangled particles get evolved with 'hidden variables' that governs the behavior of entangled particles but not observable. This has pretty much been ruled out by experiments based on Bell's inequality.</p></div>		</li>
