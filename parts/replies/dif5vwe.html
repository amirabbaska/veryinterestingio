			<div class="markdown"><p>I went shooting with my friend, then played with shotgun shells in his truck on the way to the airport. They swabbed my hands, the machine beeped, and they didn't say anything to me. So I would guess not too often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, personally have been stopped multiple times within the last year for chemicals setting Off the machine and then getting swabbed. Each time the only thing I can think of is it was something with my electronic cigarette. But then they'd just swab, waste 15 minutes and be on my way. </p></div>		</li>
