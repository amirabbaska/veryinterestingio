			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, you and /u/MrFlippyNips both commented with very similar questions at the same time. I don't know enough about the nitty-gritty details of the experiment to say for sure, but the researchers were specifically selecting for 'tameness', or a willingness to be handled and bond with humans. Since a lot of what we consider tameness is the retention of juvenile traits (trusting, cuddly, submissive), tail-wagging as a form of greeting and happiness might be piggybacking on whatever genetic factors control those juvenile tendencies. One interesting thing to come out of the experiment was that other dog-like qualities that seem initially unrelated to tameness, like multi-colored coats and floppy ears, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Belyayev_\(zoologist\)#Results" target="_blank">also began showing up in the foxes</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The selector was aggression, more than tameness. </p>
<p>Generation one, approach foxes. - X foxes bite and hiss. X foxes growl. X foxes are apathetic. Breed the last two groups. Don't breed the first one.</p>
<p>Over the generations as they bred away from aggression, the foxes tamed themselves, for lack of a better term. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a dog wags its tail (or for that matter, when a cat does it, albeit for different reasons), do they have any control over it? Is it a response they specifically 'choose' to have or is it entirely automatic?</p>
<p>I suppose as a comparison, would it be more like a human laughing, or a human blushing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do have control over it, it's not a reflexive action. It's very similar to laughing or scowling--they might suddenly wag their tails in response to something the same way you might laugh if you unexpectedly saw something funny, but they are capable of stopping if they want to. Animals just usually don't have a lot of reasons to suppress their visible emotions in the same way humans do.</p></div>		</li>
