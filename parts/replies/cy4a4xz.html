			<p>what's happening in these pictures that is giving off Cherenkov radiation?</p>		</li>

			<p>That's an underwater nuclear reactor. Beta particles passing through the water cause it to glow.</p>		</li>

			<p>What would be the color/frequency of the Cherenkov radiation in other mediums like for example solid chunks of glass?</p>		</li>

			<p>Cherenkov radiation is not a single wavelength. Instead the photon yield is proportional to 1/(wavelength)^2 so it will always have more shorter wavelengths. But for extremely short wavelengths the index of refraction approaches 1 (i.e. photons aren't slowed), so you don't get the shortest wavelengths. So it'll always be bluish.<br><br>Different glasses are actually one of the materials of choice for Cherenkov detectors (detectors which use Cherenkov radiation to detect charged particles) at higher indices of refraction.</p>		</li>
