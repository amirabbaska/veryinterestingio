<p>Derivatives measure rate of change as defined by a function.  Think velocity of an object.  When the police use a radar gun to measure how fast your car is going, they detect where you were a moment ago and where you are now and they create a curve to represent your speed.</p>
<p>The derivative gives you a formula to measure your velocity at any given moment in time.  So you are driving at 50mph and accelerating when the cop starts measuring you.  The cop is actually determining how far away you are.  Then after a moment, let's say one second for simplicity, the cop measures your distance again.  And so on and so on...</p>
<p>While it is taking these measurements, it creates a graph of distance over time.  <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Parabola-antipodera.gif" target="_blank">The graph would look something like this</a>.  On that same image, you can see a solid black line tracing along the outside of the parabola.  It is measuring instantaneous velocity (e.g. How fast you're going at any specific moment).  That is what the derivative is.  You can then take this function and create a graph as you did before, but instead of distance over time, you will have speed over time.</p>
<p>You can take the derivative of that function as well and generate a graph that measures instantaneous velocity of your velocity.  Which is a fancy way of saying, acceleration.  Let's try a simple example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distance function: f (x) = 5x + 100 -- This describes a ball that begins at 100 feet away and moves further away at a rate of 5 feet per second.</li>
<li>Derivative function: f '(x) = 5 -- This is the instantaneous velocity at any given time.  And since the ball is moving at 5 feet per second, the velocity is always 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's say you had the reverse.  You know the speed of the ball was a constant 5 feet per second.  Now you want to know where the ball was at any given point in time.  In comes the integral.  Since you have the speed, you can create your speed graph and generate the integral function to measure the position of the ball at any specific moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed function: f (x) = 5 -- Again, the ball is moving at 5 feet per second.</li>
<li>Integral function: f (x)dx = 5x + c</li>
</ul>
<p>So we can recreate the first half of the distance function, but we've lost the information about where the starting line is, so instead we have to use c (stands for constant).  This means there are an infinite number of solutions for the integral of f(x) = 5.  One of those infinite numbers is the correct one (100), but only having the derivative means we cannot be certain which value that is.  </p>
<p>If you knew the starting position, you would be able to create the original function with these 2 pieces of information.  f (x) = 5x + 100.</p>
<p>EDIT: Fixed a mistake in the first analogy.</p>
<p>EDIT2:  I couldn't help myself, I wanted to convert this explanation and make an analogy to the OPs topic.  Let's consider f (x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 12.  This is your password. The hash algorithm is to take the derivative and save that to check when you attempt to login.  The derivative would be f '(x) = 10x + 3.  If we save this, then you can reverse engineer this back to f (x)dx = 5x^2 + 3x + c as our password.  We lost the 12, but any password that form will successfully pass the hash check because the derivative will match.</p>
<p>EDIT3: Fixed notation</p></div>		</li>
