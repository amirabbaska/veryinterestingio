			<div class="markdown"><p>Friction eats up power from the engine.
Reducing friction means more of that power goes into spinning the prop not friction.</p>
<p>There is a limit to the effectiveness since you want to avoid the prop going too fast, but you would at least have some fuel savings if you ran at the same power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the friction exactly what's translating into thrust here, though? Sliding through the water more easily could let you hit a higher RPM at the same output and theoretically optimize for the power band of certain engines, but I'd imagine the existing engines are already optimized for the already existing operating conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> wow, thanks to everyone for the great explanations! It's amazing how wrong intuition can be sometimes. To consolidate the understanding, it's all about the movement of the foil resulting in a movement of the medium in &quot;front&quot; of the blade leading to a pressure differential that translates to thrust via Bernoulli's principle. No friction involved, just the movement itself.</p>
<p>The other thing that's helping me reading on the side is to rationalize what friction actually does in this system, which is likely just to heat the water, kind of like what you get if you overload a blender to make heated soup.</p>
<p>So reducing friction on a propeller or rotor WOULD academically reduce energy loss and increase efficiency. But there's likely not a ton of loss to begin with (we don't see boats boiling water), so it's not significant enough most of the time to matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of props on larger vessels are coated in a solution called PropSpeed.  One of the purposes is to inhibit marine growth, which would increase friction, and decrease efficiency.</p>
<p>As a point to your original post, as a child, I used to coat the hulls of all of my RC boats with RainX.  I'd see gains in the 10-20% range in top speed.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrophobic coatings are pretty fragile, expensive and generally quite awkward to make. In addition the pressures generated during liquid impact are anomalously large. When people do experiments on these surfaces with liquid droplets (my area of research) their surfaces don’t last long before they’ve been damaged and their hydrophobicity greatly impacted.</p>
<p>Even without that, Moss, animals, rust and other fowling builds up pretty rapidly on ships which would screw the whole purpose of the coating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but many hydrophobic coatings have the tradeoff that they are not very durable (and expensive). Ship hulls also generate a lot of buildup very quickly that would eliminate the hydrophobic properties. I also know that big ships like cruise ships have to be repainted very often, which would be very expensive.</p>
<p>A solution that many large ships are now using is actually bubbles! The have litle air holes on the bottom of the hull that allows the ship to &quot;ride&quot; on a bed of bubbles that act as an intermediary between the water and the hull, thus reducing the friction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the ways the now-banned swimsuits worked.  The fabric was woven in such a way to hold bubbles in specific patterns and thus reduce friction.  </p>
<p>Unrelated to OP, the main reason for the ban is that suits were designed with buoyant and impermeable materials.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Echoing this, when I was on a ship that had stealth coating on the superstructure, that stuff was a <em>massive</em> pain in the ass. <strong>Constant</strong> maintenance and repair. Could only paint it with special (really expensive) paint, and only [x] coats before it would have to be replaced. </p>
<p>For those who don't know, the fastest way to make a well-worn ship look fabulous is to throw a coat of paint on it. Taking that tool away from the CO makes for a very tense relationship between the CO and the First Lieutenant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A representative of an Olympic Committee, and former rower, loved to talk about how much cheating there was, or is, in the sport. One of the methods was discovered when judges noticed a trail of foam behind some boats. They did some tests and found out the front of the boats had been coated with an effervescent paste allowing them to ride on bubbles, like you said.</p></div>		</li>
