			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to say that fat is more at risk for damage from frostbite than muscle because it isn't supplied with blood as readily as muscle. So stocky people may be more 'resistant' to cold, whatever that means, but obese people are more likely to suffer tissue damage from prolonged exposure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about states of &quot;cold&quot; that are short of &quot;freezing&quot;.</p>
<p>For instance it was common to see fatter guys spending an hour in the fifty-some degree ocean water of So Cal, while the skinny guys would be a shivering wrech without a wet suit.</p>
<p>There's not a lot of ethically repeatable testing done on the subject, but blubber is pretty much required for cold-ocean mammals for a reason.</p>
<p>I also didn't discuss heatstroke rates of various body types in the Australian outback.</p>
<p>So running to morbidly obese people in arctic temperatures as a counter-example is something of an excluded-middle analysis compared to my more centrist use of heat, cold, sweat, and whatnot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fat, or fatty tissue, is the term for the cells that swell up to store calories.  As a fat guy, I don't think he was condescending at all.  Instead of asking the rest of the world to be more &quot;sensitive&quot; to your feelings, you could either toughen up or change the thing you don't like about yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although I agree with the premise, I don't think using sweat is a good analogy. Elite athletes can get sweaty from simply climbing a flight of stairs. This is because their body become so efficient at cooling down, that any amount of physical excursion will be followed with intense physical activity. So to prepare it instantly starts sweating. </p>
<p>I can't really think of a different way to explain what you're trying to articulate. I just thought I'd throw that out there anyways.. </p></div>		</li>
