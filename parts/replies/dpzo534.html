			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the most familiar insects with larviform adult females would be the glow-worms, which are bioluminescent beetles in the glowworm, click beetle, firefly and railroad worm families. The females are called &quot;worms&quot; because they retain their larval form as adults. </p>
<p>In Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), the family Psychidae (bagworms) are known to have larviform females in some species. Bagworms in this family are detritus feeders, mostly feeding on decaying plant matter down in the leaf litter. They build themselves a little protective mobile home out of dirt, dust and bits of debris and carry it around with them. Their houses/shells have a back and front entrance, and are wide enough in the middle to turn around, so if they need to change direction they don't need to turn the whole house!  As an additional weird tidbit, some bagworms reproduce through parthenogenesis, with females giving birth to clones of themselves with no sexual interchange or males needed.</p></div>		</li>

They go through a pupal stage and emerge as fat adults with reduced or absent wings.</p></div>		</li>
