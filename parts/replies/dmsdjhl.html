			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure since sleep apnea is hard to diagnose and I'm assuming it would be more so for infants. Sleep apnea is not really a cause of death; rather, it causes other problems which lead to death. So it's hard to determine if SIDS deaths are due to sleep apnea or some other issue. It would be interesting to see if people who have died due to sleep apnea-related causes also have brain stem abnormalities.  </p></div>		</li>
