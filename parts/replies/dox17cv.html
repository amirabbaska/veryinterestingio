			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Yes your cells, ostensibly have the same exact DNA all over your body. The differences between skin and liver are not from the DNA. (if that was the case, you'd need to be conceived with skin DNA and liver DNA, but in reality you only get egg and sperm cell DNA) Luckily, your cells can selectively read the DNA - either expressing or shutting down gene expression or even using difference splices of a gene for different purposes. (Read about the &quot;central dogma&quot; to get a basic understanding of how that could work)</p>
<p>2) External influences to DNA: First off - as this OP is talking about, there are things/experiences that may change how your DNA is expressed in some tissues and we are beginning to understand that these expression rules (epigenetics) can be be transferred to your offspring. Secondly - Your actual DNA can and does change in individual cells for many reasons. Each time a cell divides (mainly stem and some other specialized cell types) there's a non-zero probability of replication errors, anytime you're exposed to a virus DNA can be injected into a cell's genome, environmental factors (ionizing radiation, like sunlight, and chemicals, including water) can and do alter the chemistry and therefore the information in your DNA. </p>
<p>2-tldr changing one cell's dna or epigenetics (unless it's a germline cell - sperm/egg) will not change your kids' DNA or genetic expression. BUT enough alterations to DNA in any of your cells WILL eventually cause some of your cells to malfunction (cancer), so it may not &quot;change everything&quot;, but it could kill you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK so for the second question, you're saying that there are likely minor differences in DNA in each cell in the body, either due to imperfect replication or environmental factors. It's just a matter of time and probability for that DNA to proliferate in a significant part of your body for you to be able to say that your DNA has changed? Or as you said, malfunction to cancer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, what I'm saying is that cells all over your body will have small differences in their copy of your genome. I wouldn't quite say that means 'your dna' in bulk has changed. </p>
<p>Mostly, that won't make a difference, since they are prohibited from reproducing and making more copies of their DNA. Throughout your adult life, only a few special types of cells are allowed to replicate (stem cells in your bones, some skin cells etc). If you're male, this includes your germ line (read sperm) cells, which could pass on any changes to your offspring. </p>
<p>Normal (somatic) cells turn cancerous when their deviations from 'your dna' (aka healthy baseline) allow them to escape the normal restrictions on their replication. </p>
<p>So I guess my point is that, even if you died from untreated cancer (and had tumors all over), if you sequence a healthy tissue it sample should still yield an average genome with very few changes compared to a sample from your childhood. </p>
<p><em>Disclaimer</em>- some of these are active research topics so we may have more info in the future. </p></div>		</li>
