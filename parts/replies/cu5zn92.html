<p>so why aren't their sales as high as Coke or Pepsi? Because most people don't actually buy cola due to pure taste, but rather due to brand relationship.</p>

<p>Probably has more to do with coke being literally everywhere and rc being somewhat difficult to find with people not having the level of brand loyalty to seek it out keeping things that way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely truth in your statement, although I suspect it's a calculated risk that Dr. Pepper Snapple (the current owners of RC Cola in the US) and Cott (Canada and elsewhere) have sized up.  It's also possible that given certain drink choices (not just cola), a consumer may choose RC cola over Dr. Pepper or Snapple as a drink.  Such a scenario would cannibalize Dr. Pepper or Snapple same-store sales, so it would not be in the company's best interest to stock the same fridges with all their products.</p>
<p>It's also possible (and likely) that the brand and product managers of RC Cola have found through market research that the cost to convert a customer from Coke or Pepsi would be monumental, and not worth the investment.  Coke and Pepsi customers usually won't even convert to the other top brand--what would it take to make them abandon their lifelong drink and exclusively drink something else?  Is the value of (maybe) slightly better taste of a cheap drink enough to change one's behavior significantly and permanently?</p></div>		</li>
