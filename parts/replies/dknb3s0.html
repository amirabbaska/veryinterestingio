			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a personal anecdote. </p>
<p>My father worked at Planters Peanuts as an electrician/machine maintenance man before the Kraft-Heinz merger.  They were asked by Walmart that they wanted an extremely large shipment of peanuts and mixed nuts, and were contracted out for quite the hefty fee. </p>
<p>Planters, wanting to make sure to keep Walmart pleased, produced the Peanuts as quickly as possible, in order to stay in good graces. Once they had the numbers that Walmart wanted, they contacted them, at which point Walmart told them that since they didn't put the great value label on the peanuts, they were pulling out of the contract. Planters was never told about the label switch, and going back to reapply the label over the already made cans would end up costing more than half of what they would make from the contract. Since Walmart pulled out after they produced so much stock, Planters now had way too much on hand, and so that stock had to be sold for much much cheaper than market price. This resulted in almost all employees, both the workers and higher ups losing their bonuses for the next few months as well as having to cut hours for everyone. Needless to say, my parents don't shop at Walmart. </p>
<p>Interesting note, Walmart tried to pull the same thing again once the Kraft-Heinz merger went through, and Kraft-Heinz said we're sorry, and pulled all Planters Peanuts from Walmart's shelves for a small amount of time, resulting in Walmart then having to scramble to find some way to stock their peanut shelves, which resulted in a drastically sub-par product, resulting in them losing an extremely large amount of profit. They went back to Kraft-Heinz with puppy dog eyes and offered the amount of the contract as well as extra to get Planters Peanuts back on the shelves. </p>
<p>Crazy stuff if you ask me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Walmart does this to all of their suppliers.  With high-end name brands (Planters, Vlasic, Heinz) they like to have a very large bulk item on their shelves, at an ungodly low price, to create an image for the customer that they can get <em>crazy</em> bulk deals.  They also like to drive down the sticker price year over year, creating excruciating pressures on the producers. </p>
<p>You can read another very similar story about the <strong><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/47593/wal-mart-you-dont-know" target="_blank">gallon jar of pickles</a></strong> which was one of the first stories to really examine the supply chain logistics of companies like Walmart &amp; Amazon.  </p>
<p>The big takeaway is this sentence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The gallon jar of pickles at Wal-Mart became a devastating success, giving Vlasic strong sales and growth numbersâ€“but slashing its profits by millions of dollars.</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Walmart isabsolutely brutal about this. Happened with Snapper lawnmowers too. There's a great interview with the former Snapper CEO about it. It eventually ends up being bad for business to put your products on the Walmart shelves for smaller vendors because every year when Walmart comes back to renegotiate the contract they squeeze the vendors tighter and tighter eventually resulting in a downward spiral of quality as the vendor is forced to make cuts to the product to meet Walmart's increasing demands.</p>
<p>That's one of the reasons shit is so cheap at Walmart :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true, Walmart pays out on time on net 30.  The only retailer that seems to do this on time and without the usual kicking and screaming.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a more interesting twist, the factory I used to manage inventory for, or its sister under the conagra  (now treehouse) brand made those nuts and either sent them to planters or Annes house of nuts (much less likely, only plausible if shipping on the eastern seaboard or to europe)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example is stitching quality. Turn an Old Navy or Walmart garment inside out and examine the stitching. Then compare with something high-end--midmarket (JCrew, etc or better). The higher-priced garment will have seams with stitches closer together, better thread quality, interfacing and other reinforcements, and tidier finishes. These may not be visible when worn, but have a huge effect on the drape and wear of the garment and how it holds up over time. </p>
<p>Cheap doesn't always mean bad quality, though. This weekend I disassembled a pair of pants from Uniqlo to alter them, and was amazed at the construction quality. The pants retailed for $19.90. </p>
<p>LPT: you can usually make a cheaper garment look nicer and last longer by washing it carefully and letting it air dry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sewn quality also can vary a lot between the &quot;same&quot; garment from a given manufacturer.  </p>
<p>Levi's jeans are a good example of this. Take two pairs of basic indigo 501s, one made in Mexico and one from somewhere else like Egypt.  Flip them so that they are hanging and the cuffs are up and look at if the seams line up.  Almost every time the ones from Mexico will be good, but the others will be twisted (seams not lining up).</p>
<p>There's a reason you'll see people digging through a pile of Levi's looking at labels, and it's not just vanity - the quality really varies a lot.</p></div>		</li>

Haven't found a single pair of jeans that fit me as well (nor as comfy) since. If anyone finds a store carrying stuff made in Pakistan, let me know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aye. Stitch count is a big one. </p>
<p>With modern consumerism, we're focused on image, not on product. We'll either take a brand name because we like the recognition (either publicly or privately), or a generic (when we know no one can tell) - but base quality rare comes into it.</p>
<p>Do you alter clothes for your own reasons, or is it part of your job? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think, for me, that's where the difference in quality really matters. If I forget to wash a higher priced item as recommended, it still usually holds up and you can't tell. The lesser quality items are more likely to pill or lose their shape. I bought a few cheap items while I work on fitting back into my wardrobe, and I was surprised at how disheveled I looked in them compared to when I initially bought them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some cases they only change the label roll on the assembly line. I worked for a lab that tested Cain's Mayonnaise. The director of R and D for Cain's came by one day and we got to chatting. He let the cat of the bag that Cain's contracts for many supermarket chains in New England such as Market Basket, Stop and Shop etc to product their generic mayonnaise for them. The containers, lids and product are the same the only difference it the label. The unenlightened consumer pays $1.10 a jar more for the brand name product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this is not as simple as you say.   I worked summers in a canning facility.  In canning the reason they produce for multiple brands is that they can not grantee a constant quality level.  For green beans for example, the highest paying company had &quot;first pick&quot;, meaning that we'd prioritize canning for them when the loads were top quality.  If the beans weren't that good looking or had issues we'd drop to the next brand.   If by some magic we only got great quality beans then all the brands would basically have the same stuff... So basically in this case the premium you pay is to ensure the best quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I do this a lot (in Aus): compare not just packaging, but also dietary info.</p>
<p>A brand name of mayonnaise (to use your example) has, let's say, 78.3g of fat per 100g, and 2.3g of protein? And the store-label mayo has 78.3g of fat per 100g, and 2.3g of protein?</p>
<p>Those numbers are way too identical for it to be sheer coincidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to work in Big Supermarket Dairy department. Knew a guy who was a top dog in a yogurt factory. They were contracted to make yogurt for an all natural 'organic' brand. At the store I think it cost maybe $1.50 a container. They were also contracted to make the store-brand cheap yogurt, which went on sale as low as .40Â¢. He told me when it came time to resupply the generic brand they simply put a new label pattern on the machine. He worked every position in the factory - the ingredients and recipes and containers were the exact same. Just a different label. Poor, poor consumers paying almost triple (when there was a good sale on genero) for the same product, on the same shelf. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think that's bad,   look at the beauty industry.   People will scream at you when you tell them that their dimethicone and argan oil contining eighty dollar hair stuff is no better than a dollar jar of coconut oil or generic version of the same ingredients.   The same name - I think it's L'oreal --  also produces Lancome.   And no,  the products are not that different.   L'oreal also owns a lot of other companies that sell for higher prices in dept.  stores.   Beauty industry is a billion dollar industry.</p></div>		</li>
