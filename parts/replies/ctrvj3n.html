			<div class="markdown"><p>Some fun facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hypnosis is not at all related to sleep, except in the sense that sleep is also an altered state of consciousness. Saying &quot;you're getting very sleepy&quot; is kind of a myth, and if anyone ever said it they were just trying to get the person to relax</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hypnosis is not mind control. You will not murder/rob/rape or do anything you don't want to. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hypnosis gives you no superpowers. No super strength, no improved memory, nothing. Of course, no other altered state (again think dreams, drugs, etc) will give you that either. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because it is an ability, it can be studied. People who are good at being hypnotized also tend to be really good at &quot;getting into&quot; a book or TV show to the point where they're totally absorbed and don't notice when someone in the room starts talking to them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A very motivated person/actor can do anything a hypnotized person can do, but studies usually show they wont. For example, fakers will stop faking when they think the experiment is over or the experimenter is not paying attention, whereas truly hypnotized people will not. </p>
</li>
<li>Although it is mostly used for stress relief, hypnosis can be used in surgery to numb pain and slow bleeding - usually resulting in a better recovery than drug-induced surgery, but of course the drugs work on everyone whereas only about 5-10% of people are good at being hypnotized without training. </li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT: Interesting looking at the stories in this thread. Some support the first explanation and some the second! It is still an open question. </p>
<p>Also I should note that a stage hypnotist definitely knows all these things, and will pick people who exhibit symptoms of both #1 and #2. Also they will usually pick a strong guy and a small girl to use in a finale &quot;feat of strength&quot; type thing, which of course works whether they're hypnotized or not.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: A lot of people have a very low threshold for what counts as a &quot;superpower&quot;. What is sometimes claimed by stage hypnotists is that the person gets superhuman strength, and could do something that would otherwise be impossible for them (usually &quot;plank&quot; across two chairs while someone stands on their stomach). This is not true and any normal human can do those things - though sometimes sleight of hand or other stage tricks are involved. </p>
<p>Drugs definitely give you energy, and can enhance physical and mental performance. People have brought up strength and PCP/Meth, memory and caffeine, etc. Personally I wouldn't count those as superpowers, because even Captain America is far above and beyond what any PCP junkie can do. Maybe that is a bad example because he basically used steroids, right? Anyway all those things are more like performing at your maximum potential - which hypnosis can help you do in some cases - not like going above what is naturally human. Even Black Widow could beat anyone on any drug, and she has no powers. Maybe Hawkeye would get beat up, but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had been to see a local hypnotist show live twice, the second time where I was able to be chosen to get hypnotised. I wasn't sure what to expect, but my experience was significantly different from one of the others who I had a conversation with afterwards. Witnessing her getting hypnotised, she appeared to fall into a deep deep slumber, whereas I felt quite alert with my eyes closed.</p>
<p>When we had our eyes closed, my mind was alert, I could hear everything, but I was very focused on the hypnotists suggestions. The first suggestion was we were to act as if we were holding a lottery ticket, and every number he would read out, it would be our winning numbers, but we would not be able to leave our seats, because we were stuck to them.</p>
<p>Hearing this suggestion while my eyes were closed, my 'alert' mind or consciousness found this absurd, why would I be stuck to the chair? It's silly, I can get up if I wanted to.</p>
<p>Then, as soon as he told us to open our eyes and 'wake up', he immediately went into the act, pretending to be a lotto announcer and reading out the winning numbers.</p>
<p>My alert mind had disappeared somewhere, and I found myself really excited hearing my winning numbers one by one. When the final number was announced, I wanted to get up and claim my millions of dollars, but I could not, I was stuck to the chair! I was so mad and desperate for that money, I started bunny hopping in the chair, my bum stuck to it, just to claim my winnings.</p>
<p>Before I reached him, he made us go back to 'sleep', my 'alert mind' came back, and I thought to myself, wtf was that? And told myself the hypnotist is at fault, this is all his doing. Thinking back about it now, my alert mind was probably another layer of consciousness, separate from my 'hypnotised and acting out suggestions', as well as my everyday 'awake' consciousness.</p>
<p>Some other crazy suggested skits from the night too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my own experience,  I went to a carnival thing and got on stage with I believe 7 other people.  They did some stuff and had us do a rest state of some kind.  This was ages ago and I cant remember amazingly.  They picked out 2 people from us who I guess werent into it a ton and sent them back to the audience. </p>
<p>They had us act out scenes like a play,  etc.  It was interesting.  On the one hand I was aware of what I was doing,  I was doing it because I didnt want to get sent off the stage like the other 2 for being 'not hypnotized'.  I kinda wonder if thats all it really was was the pressure to conform for the sake of performance.  And because there was an audience of course.  </p>
<p>My memory of that event is terrible,  it was when I was like 10.  I cant really say if it was altered conciousness hypnosis or social pressure hypnosis because I dont remember back that far.  </p>
<p>Though if I get the chance Id love to try it out again.  Maybe I'll get a more solid result on which it is for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good related point. Memory in general is very unreliable and it is difficult for us to separate our in-the-moment experience from information that comes to us later. </p>
<p>So, when you see reports of hypnosis (or literally anything in life) it is hard to tell whether they are an accurate account or a mix of the real event and information/myths/inaccuracies that have entered their mind since. Good that you're aware of this though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two times I, er, attempted to be hypnotized, the first I fully submitted to the process. There were peers present, that I wanted to please/impress to some extent, but damn it I wanted to be hypnotized. Proceeded to not get anywhere, decided to walk off stage after a significant amount of time of not feeling anything. </p>
<p>The second time, at a comedy hypnosis show on my birthday I was probably predisposed to thinking I wasn't able to be hypnotized, but nonetheless I went up after goading. The performer told us to relax, while standing and closing our eyes, tapped us on the forehead to encourage us to fall backwards a bit, and took those who would take the unannounced trust fall. I failed. </p>
<p>I'm convinced hypnotism only occurs if you are suggestible and rather into the act, but that's just me I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My fav anecdote regarding the limitations of hypnosis was a professor demonstrating to students each year that people wouldn't do what they normally are unwilling to do while under hypnosis, by inducing the state in a viable student, then asking them to take off their clothes.</p>
<p>This would immediately disrupt their mental state and clearly show folks can't be made to &quot;do things&quot; via hypnosis.</p>
<p>Until one year a female student promptly began disrobing.  He stopped her, and it turned out she was employed as a stripper, so had no reservations about removing her clothing publicly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice. Often stage hypnotists will have an early show and a late show, with the later one being more raunchy and involving nudity. But of course, the audience is full of people happy to provide nudity so it is just sort of ... natural?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a sceptic by nature and didn't really believe in all this and one time there was a hypnotist at a wedding from a friend. </p>
<p>I was one of the many called on stage to do various small things to show septibility to being hypnotised. </p>
<p>By just talking a few sentences to you and touching at various places suddenly some people could not take their hand of their head. Or their hands where stuck togheter or could not remember their own name and small things like at. </p>
<p>On some people it all worked with others only some things. Exept with me it did nothing. Not one of the things worked. </p>
<p>He explained himself that to be able to be hypnotised you had to be open to the idea. When you don't believe you can be hypnotised, not even the hypnotist in the world can hypnotise you. But if you are willing and open to it. It is remarkable easy to do once you know how. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have trouble believing that there is any true dissociation going on but there was one high-profile TV hypnotism recently that I have to wonder about. Howie Mandel has been well known for a phobia of shaking peoples' hands, I heard comedians and actors talking about it on some podcasts years ago. That part does not seem to be made up, or it's the most elaborate long con ever. So earlier this year a guy got up on America's Got Talent and convinced him that everyone was wearing latex gloves (they weren't) and he shook everyone's hand. Supposedly he was pissed about it later.</p>
<p>Either he really was hypnotized, or the only explanation I can think of is that he finally got over his phobia in therapy and did it for the ratings. He wouldn't fake something like that on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p>The part where he reads the note &quot;Go to sleep&quot; and nods off just <em>reeks</em> of bullshit to me though, it can't be real, can it?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a phobia of shaking hands. He has mysophobia(a pathological fear of germs/contamination). It's the reason why he doesn't like shaking hands and why he shaves his head.</p>
<p>He actually had to go to a therapy session after that hypnosis act</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I didn't word that well but you're right.</p>
<p>I guess just to reiterate the broader point while I'm here, is that either a) he really was hypnotized in that moment and was truly dissociative, or b) he had secretly already overcome his phobia and the whole act including all the media hoopla before and after was completely fabricated to get the maximum impact and media exposure for the show. So all of his interviews and whatever afterwards must be scripted too, if that's the case.</p>
<p>The point being, that OP's &quot;Social-cognitive theory&quot; couldn't possibly apply here - it either really, really worked or it was really, really made up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is tough because showbusiness is basically all a huge act. I did notice that he said &quot;I'm wearing gloves now&quot; and Howie didn't check (at least not on camera, you can't see his eyes through the whole thing). </p>
<p>It is possible he thought it was the first part of the act where there was a glove and was legitimately tricked. He even shakes his hand after, when the hypnotist said it was over. It looks more like sleight of hand or just getting a bunch of stuff to go on at once to confuse him. Keep in mind Howie's job is to have a producer in his ear every second telling him what to do, and he does it flawlessly and without question. So he might be used to the safety of that situation and not using all of his critical thinking skills while onstage. </p>
<p>Or who knows, he could be a high ability person too. You can never really tell from a stage show unfortunately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda piggy backing on the same hypnotist that hypnotized howie mandel. In a different episode, on mobile so sorry can't provide a link, the hypnotist tries to hypnotize michael buble. They go through the whole motion of it and it looks like buble is asleep. A minute later before the hypnotist actually starts telling buble things to do buble just straight up says &quot;i'm completely asleep&quot; in a sarcastic tone, and gets up. What was going on in this situation. Buble later says that he must of been too skeptical about the whole things and thats why it didnt work.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to the latter. Back in my day for our Senior All Night Party (So we wouldn't go out and get drunk around the time we graduated), we had a bunch of events....one beingba hypnotist. They took about ten of us up on stage. I remember almost all of it but it was just this indifference of &quot;Why not.&quot; I don't actively remember doing any of it, but it just happened. The emotions felt very real and he had added in a soundtrack and storyline. We drove to the beach, hit a car, it felt so real I was literally crying...but at the end, and I will never forget this, he had all of us hug and just said, You are going to feel great, better than you ever have. </p>
<p>I honestly truly did. I actually have a video of it out on YouTube, if there is interest I can throw it up. I am also really receptive to asmr, to the point I just feel like dead weight at points. Maybe it is just the way you receive things.</p>
<p>On that note, after watching the video, there were people that went under and came out...I imagine it would be hard to fake it. A lot of people said afterwards it seemed like we were all faking, but when I had broken down in tears they though....holy shit...Milkeater a bitch and this might be legit....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a great story out there of when Mark Twain worked as a hypnotist subject when he was a kid. Essentially he was totally faking, but was convincing because he acted well and enjoyed the showbusiness part of it. He would get stabbed with a needle, hit, etc and show no pain. Even though actually it hurt like hell.</p>
<p>But, he described another boy who also worked in the show and who was more honest. He also showed no pain even though he didn't seem to be faking. </p></div>		</li>
