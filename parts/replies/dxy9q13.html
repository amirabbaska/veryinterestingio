			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus a lot of other Christian sects didn't come to being until after the printing press was invented and the general public <del>learned to read</del> <em>had access to a translation of the Bible in their language</em>. The Catholic Church was sort of the only game in town when it came to Christianity and everybody was illiterate (EDIT: to church texts because they were in Latin) unless you were rich or a priest. It only seems natural that they would resort to using pictures in their church to help teach and remind the congregation about significant Bible stories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a little bit of a misconception that everyone was illiterate. Plenty of common people were literate in common languages including English, French, German, and so forth—but all the religious texts were in Latin, and were therefore inaccessible to the common person who could read, write, and do business in English but wasn’t educated in Latin. It was a big fucking deal when the Bible became available in “vulgar” languages like German, because then the clergy wasn’t the only group with access to different interpretations of the Bible, which was then a big fucking deal for European social fabric at the time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh! Speaking of huge-ass... you should see the murthi (statue, &quot;idol&quot;) of Sri Venkateshwara (a form of Vishnu) in my temple. It is black granite, as most are, a good 7-8' tall to the top of the crown, weighing several tons. I really don't know how they got it into the temple and into its sanctum. The sanctum itself is the size of a small room that 3 or 4 of the priests can move around in. </p>
<p>This is not my temple, but because of strict iconography, they are all virtually identical.</p>

<p>So he never read it himself.  Which always struck me as strange, especially as a kid who found out about his way of understanding religion <em>after</em> I read most of the bible myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was addressed during the Protestant Reformation. One big teaching to come out of the Reformation was &quot;the clarity of scripture,&quot; described this way in the Westminster confession: &quot;...those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them&quot;. This was a point of contention because people like John Wickliffe and Jan Hus were severely persecuted for distributing Bibles in the common language, because the Catholic Church at the time believed that interpretation was impossible, or at least very dangerous, for non-clergy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find that very common in Orthodox dominant countries even today, compared to the importance of the Bible for Americans, that I come across in all media I consume. The Bible is really not that important a pillar here. Yes, everybody has it, but just as a symbol and nothing else. It's not a rule/codebook like I see it being quoted many times everywhere in English. Only very few people quote the Bible here. When church people here preach, it's often narrated like a story around a campfire, deviating from what actually is written in the Bible. There are very few citations and it's mostly songs in the church-slav language.</p></div>		</li>
