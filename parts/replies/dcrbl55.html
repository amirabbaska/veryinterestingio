			<div class="markdown"><p>Since our bodies are not designed to work with it there would be a massive/fatal immune response. What you propose would involve an incredible &quot;from the ground up&quot; genetic rebuilding just to make it compatible - never mind making it efficient. For oxygen transfer hemocyanin is 1/4th as efficient so you would have to entirely rebalance the need/usage within the body. At that point you still can't do the same amount of work (chemistry definition) to make it effective enough to be worth the humongous and expensive eugenic effort. </p></div>		</li>
