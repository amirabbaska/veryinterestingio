			<div class="markdown"><p>The limit would be terminal velocity, which would be some combination of drag, rolling resistance, and the steepness of the hill, for a person on the given bike. Unless you were pedalling, then I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Edit: I was sleepy and didn't remember how terminal velocity worked.</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>c</em></p>
<p>But good luck getting anywhere near <em>c</em>. Even in freefall, drag combined with your finite mass will result in a much slower terminal velocity.</p>
<p>Ie: If you're not hitting the limit, it's because your hill isn't long enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangential question: if I were free falling infinitely in a vacuum under a fixed acceleration due to gravity, would I hit a terminal velocity?  Or would I asymptotically approach <em>c</em>?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't a counter example at all to his claim that there's no real limit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Image of the <a href="http://www.canosoarus.com/08LSRbicycle/Bicycle%20Images/152%20in%20tow.JPG" target="_blank">152mph bicycle in tow before (after?) its speed run</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The machine is almost impossible to pedal at low speeds because of the huge gear reductions that are required. Note the giant front sprocket and the teeny rear sprocket. These bikes have only one speed and do not have a freewheel - which means you cannot coast. It makes for a more efficient use of the cyclist's power. To slow down such a bike you carefully retard your pedalling speed.
This is the same setup used in the indoor track bikes raced in the Olympics. It eliminates the weight of the brakes and all linkages. Every ounce effects the explosive acceleration capabilities of these riders.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know nothing about cycling, but am I understanding this right; that this guy is able to cycle on the power of his own two legs to 152MPH (with the absence of drag due to this vehicle)? NO WAY? I understand he has the proper gearing setup on his crank but still!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Because the major factor liming speed is increased air resistance (at the cube of velocity). So long as something else can do the work of pushing the air out of your way, there's actually no great physical challenge in cycling up to that speed. The real challenge lies in finding somewhere long enough, and in the engineering of the bike. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is still the factor of distance per stride, even if the strides per unit time is the same.  Being able to go a greater distance per stride due to some of your push-off power not being eaten up by drag would make a difference.  A small difference, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the principle behind zero gravity treadmills. They're for obese people, people with leg injuries, or those who train super competitively but need to keep the joints fresh. At its core, it's just a mountain climbing harness suspended over a treadmill, but it allows you to run at 3/4, 1/2 weight etc, and with comparatively longer/gentler strides.</p></div>		</li>
