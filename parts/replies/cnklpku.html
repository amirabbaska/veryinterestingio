<p>edit: I assumed /u/Goldin was referring to particles in the sense of <em>massive</em> particles, as opposed to massless photons. </p></div>		</li>

If so we should protected by our atmosphere, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a Gamma Ray Burster which could be a lot further away. GRBs are not supernovas as such but appear to be directly related. It is envisaged that a GRB pointing in our direction could cause serious problems over a range of 7000 ly. There are several potential candidates at that range including a favourite of mine, Eta Carinae. None <em>seem</em> to be pointed in our direction though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phil Plait said in his blog that the current best guess estimate put it in the 100,000 year range^(1).  So, soon astronomically speaking, but a very long way off by human reckoning.  </p>
