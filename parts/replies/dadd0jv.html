			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a public charter that relies on a lottery system for student selection. We've had many articles written about our school in the local paper which have frustrated me because they've either completely misrepresented our student population (most diverse school in the state!) or just fail to truly represent what a charter school is. As a department head, I hit a lot of impediments with the district about getting the data and materials I request to improve instruction school and department wide. We're seen as less-than by the district, for sure, but we have a higher than average graduation rate, more diversity, and higher employee retention than any other school in our district. Our school is a success, but we're frequently battling public opinion about what our school even does. It's frustrating, but even with all that, I don't want the public school system dissolved into a charter/voucher system. Public school is important and necessary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charter schools are fabulous for students who go there and awful for the area. All the good teachers go there, and the teachers at public schools are spread thin. And I get it. Charter schools are much easier to work with. </p>
<p>I mentor young women of colour with a Bronx-based organization. We go to a charter school and we're greeted with pizza, a sweet principal, a responsive school liaison, and a group of girls who grasp the concepts we teach remarkably quickly. </p>
<p>We go to a public school and we have to pay for food out of our own pockets because otherwise the girls would just leave after school instead of staying for our programming (they're hungry), some girls don't have much exposure to media literacy and feminism (understandably) and are difficult to teach, school liaisons are flaky because they're overworked, and once we went to a school and they stuck us with a flipchart in an office that's was <em>converted from a locker room</em>. The office was <em>still being used</em>. There was a <em>toilet</em> chilling next to the wall. </p>
<p>Of course charter schools are good for the people who work there and go there. I am so frustrated, though, that the charter-public divide makes public schools even shittier. Sometimes my org is like &quot;let's just work with charter schools until we get more funding and become more established so we don't spend all our time chasing up flaky admin and finding rooms&quot; and it's pretty hard to remind ourselves that no, the girls at public schools are the ones who most need this kind of program and mentors and education.</p>
<p>If I were a teacher I'd rather work at a charter school. Better stability, better facilities, all that. I don't want to take away charter schools that are so good for their kids, and I don't want to fault teachers and admin for wanting to work in a pleasant environment. I will fault foundations and governments for assuming that private would be better, that progress can be measured only through test scores, that accountability is only possible when the stress of money is hung over your head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charter principal here.  Your comment hit a lot of very important points, and I know that the experience of charters varies greatly by state/municipality depending on local regulations. </p>
<p>In my area,  (Florida) what I see is very different from what you describe in some ways, but similar in some as well.  I definitely do not see the best teachers flocking to charters as a whole, as charters typically have lower pay and less benefits. They rarely provide insurance that isn't astronomically expensive (thankfully, my school is an exception to this, as we cover all employees 100%), there is no pension as they have in public schools, and perhaps most importantly, there is no &quot;stepped salary&quot; requirement where teachers receive raises based on years of tenure. </p>
<p>That said, I do think that the work environment itself is often better, allowing for greater flexibility in instructional style and curriculum. I think that the other piece that is largely ignored is that a great deal of charters serve niche populations that often do not meet their potential in public schools - at-risk youth, gifted STEM students, or, in my case, students with significant cognitive disabilities.  These students are successful exactly because of the flexibility offered by us being a charter, and contrary to the notion that we are negatively impacting the local schools, the district LOVES that we exist. We have the most severe, &quot;lowest performing&quot;, and most expensive to educate population.  If our school closed all of a sudden, the local district would have absolutely no way to educate our kids. </p>
<p>We also receive far less funding than a public school and rely primarily on fundraising and grants to fill the gap. We are a nonprofit, as many charters are, and our administrative staff are paid roughly half of what public school administration makes in salary. I realize that many charters seem like a cash grab by private companies, and in my experience this is largely relegated to those run by private charter management companies.  </p>
<p>Not in your comment, but further down the thread, I also see a lot of people talking about cherry picking students or removing those who are low performing in order to falsely inflate charter performance. This may be something that varies by state, but most states do not allow charters to turn away ANY student, as long as there is space, and once space runs out, those on a wait list are selected by lottery, rather than based on merit/performance. </p>
<p>All in all (and yes, I'm well aware that my personal bias is showing here...) my school does amazing things for amazing kids, and is a benefit to the area schools as a whole. I have the most amazing staff I have ever worked with anywhere, and all of them are there for the kids, not for the money. Everyone may make a little bit less overall, but they love where they work and get to see actual progress with their students, which is the most rewarding piece of being an educator. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a teacher who worked at a charter school in nyc and I left as soon as I could find a district job.  The teachers at the school really had their heart in the right place.  Everyone there wanted to help the kids.  However (and I know this varies greatly by region &amp; school) the system was a farce to put money into the hands of the people who started the school.  I remember administrators being excited at the prospect of being &quot;more selective&quot; at who was accepted into the school (in other words,  they were cherry picking students). The budget allocated money to certain things that I never saw when I worked there, yet teachers were paid less and worked longer hours.  Where did that money (tax payer money btw) go? No one knows. The insurance was crappy too. </p>
<p>I understand,  for every crappy Charter school you could name a crappy public school.  However, at least with district jobs there is some accountability with the money.  Charter schools promise the public they are more accountable,  but I don't think they really are or it's easier for them to hide. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it all really comes down to funding more than competition. I went to a charter high school in Texas and the local public high school was one of the best in the state simply because it was well funded. The charter was poorly funded, and although the environment was great and it was a more fulfilling place to work for most, teachers were paid less, the building was constantly in disrepair, and it took rigorous community fundraising to even stay open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that you are making schooling into a market based system, and there is one thing that markets are good at: Making winners and losers.  Thats the point of charter schools, take money away from &quot;loser&quot; schools so they &quot;improve&quot; but improvement is impossible without money, so what really happens is the &quot;loser&quot; schools go out of business.  But what happens to those students in the years before those schools go out of business?  They are in a shitty school getting a shitty education.  Its unknown wether these lost years can be made up, but youve just put a lot of children at a disadvantage for the rest of their lives.  Sure, the &quot;winner&quot; schools do great and produce well educated children who go on to have very successful lives.  The point is that every child should have a baseline education before the go off into the world. You can make the argument that inner city schools arent doing that, but the question is never answered: Why are inner city schools failing?  Is it lack of money, lack of parent involvement, lead poisoning etc?  Its easier to throw up a charter school law than to fix the underlying issues that are causing poor performance in public schools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parenting.   Children with involved parents do significantly better,  even in the lower performing schools,  than vice versa.  Lower income parents for multitude of reasons not all of which are their fault are generally not that involved.   Add on top of that the stigma in poor black culture that being successful in school is &quot;acting-white&quot; and you have the recipe for the poorly performing urban schools.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I think charter schools are a fair response to the problems with public education - the state of public education is just so bad that it's anyone's guess if it even <em>can</em> be fixed. Depriving public schools of funding arguably makes them worse, but at the same time giving the schools more funding often just results in larger football stadiums. Everything has been blamed, from bureaucracy and red tape, to pitiful teacher salaries, to standardized testing, and to completely questioning the efficacy of conventional class structure and teaching methods themselves.</p>
<p>I think that part of the thought with charter schools is that we could at least get an example of what a good school looks like, so that we can apply their approach to public schools. But you're right, it's risky, because it makes the public schools even worse, and if the charter school's big experiment turns out to be a failure, then kids get a substandard education.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm not sure if there's a better alternative at this point. It seems like every attempt at improving public schools just ends up like the No Child Left Behind act. I'm really not confident that anyone even knows <em>how</em> to fix public education.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way my district handles its finances is, in general, a point of deep shame to me. I agree that public schools, especially Title I and &quot;failing&quot; schools, absolutely need more financial support. Moreover, they need more community support. Two of the biggest issues I see here are lack of attraction of good teachers (I could say I am guilty of this, as I don't teach in one of those community schools, but I also &quot;only&quot; got interviews in 12 schools that weren't in those communities when I was starting out) and extreme emphasis from the State down on racially and culturally biased standardized testing. That needs to change, too. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Compared to the general district population or compared to those students who applied but lost the lottery?   The fact a parent was involved enough to apply to the charter is already self selecting students with more support. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, a big problem opponents have with vouchers is that it uses tax money to fund private religious schools. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to send your child to a private religious school if that is your choice, but the deal has always been that if you want your child to attend one, your family had to pay for it yourself, you shouldnt rely on others (via tax money) to help foot the bill for you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of this, private schools typically cost more than the voucher would be for (and they certainly will charge more after voucher) therefore this will only benefit the upper middle class and rich.  Secondly, private schools will not take the most difficult special needs students (or will make them unwelcome if forced to.  After all, it is optional to attend) which cost a lot of money. Same with troublesome students.  They'll just be booted back to pleb school. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never found this argument convincing. There are a million things in local, state, and federal taxes that you &quot;pay&quot; for but never use. The parents have the full and understood option of sending their kids to the public school. They don't get to take some of their money back if they forgo that option. If I only use my bicycle do I get some portion of my taxes back that went to the highways? What if I hate parks and open space? Where's my park money back?</p>
<p>Public education funds towards religious schooling is about as anti-American as you can get.</p></div>		</li>
