			<div class="markdown"><p>North American metallurgy didn't progress beyond hammering and annealing of 'native' metal (i.e. metal which is found pure in the ground or rivers, such as copper and gold/silver). In Southern America they were smelting silver, and there is evidence for pre-Columbian iron objects so yes, but I think not on any great scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Difficult to say. For copper smelting, there could be independent developments in Feinan (Jordan), south-east Spain, and maybe South-East Asia, but all of the early stuff used very small facilities with lower temperatures, which together result in poorer archaeological survival, so it is difficult to say. Likely copper smelting was discovered in multiple independent contexts.</p>
<p>Whether the spread of iron smelting in the Old World is the result of diffusion from a single point of discovery, or lots of independent inventions has not been conclusively decided. Iron smelting is much more complicated, so is less likely to have been discovered multiple times. The first sites of smelted iron are in the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East, the earliest possibly being a 3rd millennium BC sword from an Anatolian tomb. The first documentary evidence referring to iron smelting is from the early in the 2nd millennium BC, again in Anatolia. I generally tend towards believing a single point of origin in this region, producing an iron of highly irregular quality that was highly prized and used for kingship gifts etc.</p></div>		</li>
