			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend who was in an induced coma for quite a few months.  She had to do a lot of physical therapy and had scarring on her lungs, but she was otherwise completely fine.  [She was in her early 20s.]  When I asked her what it was like to be in a coma for so long, she said, &quot;I went all over the world.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
