			<div class="markdown"><p>Dutch does have a double negative though. Sure, you might not find it in a grammatica textbook but on the streets you hear it plenty. A few years back it was even used in a famous advertising campaign where they played with things like &quot;nie praten nie en nie bellen nie&quot; (I cannot talk not and not call not). The form might be a bit marked since it is somewhat associated with working class (that is also why the advertisements used it and they probably even had some role in establishing it as a working class thing) but in reality you hear it quite often.</p>
<p>This is not to discredit your comment cause I do think you're right, but I just wanted to add some context to the Dutch double negation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afrikaans always has a mandatory double negative. Even with indirect negatives like 'nothing', 'no one', 'never', etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't really call it &quot;double negation&quot; in Afrikaans as that connotes the idea that having two negatives in a row is still negative. I'm not sure what I'd call the second &quot;nie&quot;, but it's just word you add to the end of the sentence if you have a negative word in it.</p>
<p>For example as a response to &quot;You did nothing today&quot; you could say
&quot;Ek het nie niks vandag gedoen nie&quot; (I did not do nothing today). This means &quot;I did do something today&quot; and I'm not aware of an Afrikaans dialect where it would mean something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...just to confirm, you do mean double negative where it equates to a positive, yes? (I've heard some people claim that a double negative is still a negative!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the double negative does not change it to a positive, the sentence stays negative. For example in Afrikaans &quot;I did not do it&quot;, would be &quot;Ek het dit NIE gedoen NIE&quot; (literally: &quot;I did NOT do it NOT&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically all casual Dutch south of the Rhine has the double negative, it's just not the written standard. So that's fairly in line with Afrikaans' generally Southern (Zeeuws, Flemish, Hollandic) origins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... No. Even in Brabant it will tell you something about the person's background and class if they speak like that. It's definitely not commonly accepted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point was that it was not a French-&gt;Afrikaans feature loan, though the practice may be ultimately French still. In Brabant it just tells me people aren't elitist language prescriptivists, shame we have so many of those in our country.</p></div>		</li>
