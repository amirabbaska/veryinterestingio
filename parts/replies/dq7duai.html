			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a symptom of what's at the heart of nearly every major problem confronting us and the rest of humanity... </p>
<p>The disease is that decisions are being made by the fewest people. </p>
<p>Too few people are making the decisions about dispersing news and media to the rest of us, therefore it's easier for bad apples to apply pressure points to control the narrative. </p>
<p>Same with net neutrality. 5 people are deciding the fate of our internet. </p>
<p>And an example of when more people decide things...think about all of the weed legalizing that's occurred so far. We the people have legalized it by ballot initiative. The relatively few decision-makers in state governments haven't legalized jack shit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We didn't because the FCC doesn't get the final say. If they approve it it ends up going to congress sometime In December and then they. Vote on it to make it a law.  Really it ends up being decided by how many people comcast Verizon and at&amp;t decided to pay off in congress. </p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>For anyone who is unsure why Title II classification is important and wants some extra firepower when submitting your feedback to the FCC/your senators &amp; representatives/various petitions, please see below.</strong></p>
<p>From the Communications Act of 1934, Title II:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SEC. 202. [47 U.S.C. 202] DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENCES.</strong></p>
<p>(a) It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or
unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations,
facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly
or indirectly, by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or
unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or
locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any
undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Link <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, page 36</p>
<p>The whole Communications Act is rather long and there may be other pertinent sections, but this is the one that struck me as most relevant when reading through it back when Oliver released his video.</p>
<p>If you know of other relevant/useful information from the Title II classification, please comment below and I'll try to add them to this comment for visibility.</p>
<p>I'll be spamming this comment around, but feel free to copy it into other threads if you don't see it.</p>
<p>Keep calling. Keep fighting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an autocratic nation, where these sorts of laws do not exist, the dictator can punish anyone who annoys them by cutting off not just phone service, but water and power to their entire community. They can insist that certain people be forced to pay extra for an essential service, just because they belong to a race or sex or religion that the dictator doesn't like. And even if the dictator himself doesn't care to do these things, he's <em>certainly</em> not about to stop his corporate cronies from doing so when it suits <strong>their</strong> purposes.</p>
<p>In more democratic nations, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis" target="_blank">usually</a> not feasible to punish dissidents through their drinking water or their electricity. But corporate cronies will still go as far in that direction as they think they can get away with.</p>
<p>In 2005, employees of Canadian telecom company Telus went on strike. Telus responded by blocking <strong>all</strong> of its  4,000,000+ subcribers from accessing not only several pro-union websites, but over 700 unrelated websites that had the misfortune to be located on the same physical server as a pro-union website.</p>
<p>This is the sort of thing you would expect to happen in China or North Korea, not in a civilized nation that prides itself on caring about Human Rights. In 2005, however, the fact was that this was a legal grey area. The Canadian government immediately reacted to close this ridiculous loophole, and enacted strong Net Neutrality Laws. (These same laws have recently been strengthened again, in response to new anticompetitive &quot;Zero Rating&quot; schemes.)</p>
<p>This is the 21st century. Access to a free and unrestricted Internet may not be as fundamental on the Hierarchy of Needs as &quot;clean drinking water&quot;, but it's already <strong>far</strong> more important than access to a landline phone, television set, or newspaper has <em>ever</em> been. The fact that most world governments still consider it a &quot;luxury&quot; while those things are considered &quot;essential services&quot; is testament only to the glacial speed of legislature, and the power of lobbyists to act against the best interests of the people.</p>
<p>When ISPs are able to control what their users are allowed to say and what they're allowed to hear, they <em>can</em> and they <em>will</em> do this.</p>
<p>And this is one of the many, MANY types of abusive behaviour which Ajit Pai and friends want to make <strong>completely legal</strong>. This isn't a paranoid fantasy of something that <em>might hypothetically happen</em>. It's something which <em>does happen</em> wherever and whenever it's possible for it to happen. This is in <em>addition</em> to things like restricting websites behind &quot;cable package&quot; style schemes, or throttling the bandwidth of any company that doesn't pay them protection money.</p>
<p>Canada had its wake-up call in 2005. I <em>thought</em> that the USA had finally had its wakeup call in 2014 with the <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/comcast-jumps-netflix-speed-rankings-payola-style-agreement/" target="_blank">Netflix Payola Scandal</a>, but I guess underestimated the power of the lobbyists and the indifference of the voters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anytime someone it is suggested that people leave comments on the FCC site, they generally forget to point out one <em>HUGE</em> factor.</p>
<p><strong>Always leave a UNIQUE comment.</strong></p>
<p>Do <strong>not</strong> copy and paste a generic statement someone else gave you.  </p>
<p>Submitted comments that have the exact same message get lumped together and can often even be ignored entirely, on the justification that they are low-effort, canned and shilled responses.  It extremely easy to dismiss 10,000 comments that are identical as not genuine.</p>
<p>Write your own message with how it will affect you.  A few sentences, maybe.  Not too long, not too short, but <strong>always unique</strong>.  </p>
