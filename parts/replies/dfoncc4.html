			<div class="markdown"><p>This is sweet, in its way, but a little wrongheaded.</p>
<p>Your response is based on the idea that intelligence and complexity, in tandem, are the destination of evolution. But, evolution doesn't <em>have</em> a destination. Its just the word we use to describe species-level trait selection relative to moderately stable but also moderately flexible environmental conditions.</p>
<p>More intelligent (in the ways we're able to think about intelligence) has been adaptive for the featherless biped in its current conditions so far, for sure. But it's not the telos, the natural destination of evolution. Far from it.</p>
<p>There are plenty of &quot;highly evolved&quot; (i.e., continuously existent for a very long time, with various adaptations over time) species--especially underwater--that don't display anything that we think of as intelligence.</p>
<p>Indeed, it's not even certain that intelligence--as we presently understand it (itself a concept subject to ongoing development)--will continue to be adaptive for our species in other environments.</p>
<p>So, when you say we're &quot;early&quot; in the evolution of intelligent life, you make an enormous assumption about what will prove adaptive for our species over time. And when you say that &quot;absolutely without doubt&quot; we're going places, intelligence-wise, you're not thinking clearly about how evolution works.</p>
<p>As a species, we may not be long for this world. We've lived since around the middle of the 20th century with the real possibility--first, through atomic energy; now, through anthropogenic climate catastrophe--that our very intelligence may actually enable us to destroy most members of our species along with the habitability of our environment.</p>
<p>Of course, intelligence as we currently understand it may well proliferate in many forms in the millenia to come, and it may prove immensely adaptive to changing conditions. But, it also may not. We just don't know.</p>
<p>That's why evolutionary science looks backward, not forward. And it's why it's misguided to think of evolution in absolute terms--as though what is at stake is getting <em>better tout court</em>. We can, at most, speculate about whether future conditions will or will not make intelligence adaptive for species survival for humans. We certainly cannot say one way or another for sure, looking forward into the future.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all the mammals studied to date (<strong>including humans</strong>), oceanic dolphins known as long-finned pilot whales have been found to have the most neocortical neurons.[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not that I'd ever trust someone who throws around words like &quot;it's objectively indisputable&quot; but come on, if your strongest premise is shattered by a two second Wikipedia lookup.. why?  Why wouldn't you, yourself, brush up on your own knowledge before making claims?</p>
<p>And don't pull some BS about brain-to-body mass, because the ways in which a neocortex is used have been shown to differ between mammals in either case so the equivalence is false.  You don't know what you're talking about.  You're talking about &quot;objective facts&quot; in fields that we are still <em>barely scratching the surface of.</em></p>
<p>Again, your tone here and in replies to others makes clear one thing: you have no actual knowledge on the subject, and as such, regardless of whether you happen to accidentally fall upon some scientifically validated information, you shouldn't be attempting to educate anyone else on these matters.</p>
<p>All your replies are like &quot;it's not arguable&quot; ...you are either very young or very naive or have never actually been involved in any kind of rigorous academic discourse...</p>
<p>EDIT: to be clear, i'm not at all positing that <em>I</em> have any actual knowledge on the subject either.  I'm just pointing out the ridiculousness of claiming one does have knowledge about things that experts in the field haven't even come close to figuring out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely agree. The reason humans created civilization is because of toolmaking and not raw intelligence on its own. Dolphins and elephants lack limbs agile enough to shape the world around them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  There is absolutely no evidence that they could <em>or</em> couldn't evolve a form of writing, and therefore information transmission, and therefore advanced culture, roads, tools, etc, if they had the <em>physical body</em> capable of doing so.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... And the article goes on to speak of the <em>ways</em> in which different mammals use or don't use their neocortex.  In any case the point is: the fact that &quot;humans have a bigger / higher ratio neocortex than other animals&quot; is 1) not necessarily true and 2) even if it is true, it doesn't tell us anything about what seems &quot;more intelligent&quot; about humans, what seems &quot;less intelligent&quot; about any particular animal, or especially why there &quot;aren't&quot; other intelligent animals aside from us.</p>
<p>OPs post is a meandering masturbation of humanity as some ultimate intelligent force - which is fine especially for ELI5 - but when they throw around words like &quot;objectively indisputable,&quot; it becomes problematic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The bottlenose dolphin neocortex has nearly twice the surface area of ours. However, they have one less layer than ours, but it's unknown that the one layer can make up the difference in twice the surface area.</p>
<p>A sperm whale's brain has nearly 8 times more volume than ours. That's like comparing a motorcycle engine to a Corvette's engine. An elephant's brain is larger than ours as well. We have hands with opposable thumbs so it's easy for us to manipulate the world around us to build things that make our intelligence self-evident. But it's difficult to determine the intelligence of other species who can't do the same but may be intelligent in other ways that we can't recognize.</p></div>		</li>
