			<div class="markdown"><p>Also don't forget people sometimes eat because eating is a pleasurable sensation that may serve as a distraction when depressed. And conversely, some people find eating to be a chore and will choose not to eat if they are depressed out of apathy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't eat when I'm sad. I do when I'm depressed, which is always. It's like sadness is the feeling of depression and anxiety put together. Like a sad, depressed person is just anxious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would explain why my depression increases my appetite and makes it harder to sleep, while some people I've had conversations with about depression sleep somewhat easier than I and eat little to nothing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes you can swap between the two as well, just to make it more complicated. I have had a few years of depression where I rapidly lost weight and had insomnia, and then a year or so where I rapidly gained weight and slept about 16 hours a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I don't eat a lot, but Idk if it's an appetite thing or because there's no damn food in my house lol. I do often forget about eating, but once again idk if that's how I am, or because I've grown used to ignoring hunger. The sleeping thing really gets on my nerves though. I can't sleep. It's hard for me to fall asleep at all, and I normally wake up no more than 5 hours later. I can't really explain why. Other people I know that are depressed seem to be able to just check out and sleep whenever they are depressed. I can't fall asleep unless I'm 100% exhausted or wasted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just wrong. The serotonin theory was put forth in the 1960s and has been largely discredited and abandoned for the last few decades. The only people who still support it are the uninformed. </p>

<p>&quot;Contemporary neuroscience research has failed to confirm any serotonergic lesion in any mental disorder, and have in fact provided significant counterevidence to the explanation of a simple neurotransmitter deficiency&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2950973/" target="_blank">Here is an article from 2010</a> (five years more recent than the essay you've cited) published in World Psychiatry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost all established antidepressants target the monoamine systems. However, full and partial resistance to these drugs and their delayed onset of action suggest that dysfunctions of monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems found in MDD represent the downstream effects of other, more primary abnormalities. Despite this limitation, the monoamine-deficiency hypothesis has proved to be the most clinically relevant neurobiological theory of depression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you suggesting that the authors, editors, peer-reviewers of World Psychiatry are uninformed?</p></div>		</li>
