<p>Going down through a thermocline layer in a lake feels just like when you're in the shower and someone flushes the toilet. Also, if you hover and your eyes are exactly at the layer boundary level and look afar, you see some distortion â€” similar to the one observed at the surface of a hot road in the distance. Quite nice.
That's because of the different water density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it de-stratifies the water column?  Interesting.  De-stratification can be very beneficial in lakes and ponds, creating a larger &quot;livable&quot; column of water for life to thrive.  I'd be interested to know how de-stratification works in large bodies of water such as an ocean, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Researcher in ocean mixing here. You can't actually de-stratify the pelagic ocean (only possible in some coastal settings). However, lakes are usually due to turbulence induced by the atmosphere through either seiches or buoyancy, while hurricane mixing is also an effect of the atmosphere but essentially different. </p>
<p>Cyclones force large-scale circular motions in the sea surface, which are then transmitted into deeper regions inducing shear, which stirs up water. The very interesting thing about hurricane-internal ocean coupling is how this circular motion remains in the water long after the hurricane dies out. </p>
<p>Lastly, the reason why you can't de-stratify pelagic areas and one of the larger scale effects of hurricanes in the ocean: these motions forced by the wind eventually become something called near-inertial internal gravity waves, which are trapped but also radiate out of the hurricane area, transporting energy and turbulence thousands of kilometers from the actual hurricane. </p></div>		</li>
