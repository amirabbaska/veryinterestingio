			<div class="markdown"><p>The rapid mutation is <em>not</em> the reason for the quadrivalent vs trivalent vaccine. The difference between the 4- and 3-way vaccine is that the former contains both of the two prevalent strains of influenza B. The Flu B viruses do not mutate particularly fast -- the strains in the quadrivalent vaccine have been consistent since 2008 and 2013. The rapidly-mutating strains are the flu A strains, the H1N1 and H3N2 strains, which are present identically in the trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines.</p>
<p>The reason for the quadrivalent vaccine is that the two flu B strains, even though they are fairly antigenically constant, have been hard to predict in the past. Predicting which of the two would be dominant has been nearly guesswork. So instead of trying to guess, the quadrivalent vaccine provides protection against both strains, even though neither of them change remotely as fast as the flu A strains do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a huge effort in many countries, organized by the WHO, and (for the US at least) decided on by the FDA. Surveillance data from around the world is factored into the decision since they want to save as many lives as possible.</p>
<p>To quickly answer your question though, for seasonal flu (versus pandemic) it's usually just the dominant circulating strains.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is really an oversimplification. The lag is shorter than that, and there's a lot of influence from Southern Hemisphere countries -- the strain that hit Australia in their winter is a good candidate to hit the Northern Hemisphere in the subsequent winter, and vice-versa. </p>
<p>Emergence of new strains of influenza that require vaccine changes is a very complex topic and involves a combination of art (or experience) and science. The most important connection with Asia is that (probably) tropical and semi-tropical Asia represents one important region where human seasonal flu viruses can be maintained when it's not winter, and to some extent they therefore act as seeds for each new winter epidemic.  But that doesn't imply that they're the sites where the viruses drift and change; very often, the drifted viruses that are part of one winter's epidemic are detectable in the previous spring's isolates from the same region.  </p>
<p>To get a general sense of the process, the WHO has a very short and simplified version of the information they use available on their site; for example, the latest one is <a href="http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/201703_recommendation.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank">Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2017- 2018 northern hemisphere influenza season</a>.  </p>
