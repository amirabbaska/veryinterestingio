			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh, about the Mongolian spot...</p>
<p>My cousins and I are all mixed, and when we were small, all had blue patches like that on our back. I remember my parents telling me it was because of the different kinds of bloods mixing or something, and people used to think we were abused because they looked like bruises. </p>
<p>So is that thing about being mixed and resulting in the patches true, is that the same thing as Mongolian spots, and do Mongolian spots eventually fade (as the patches all have for my cousins and I)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter is mixed.  I'm white,  Dad is black.  She had much darker and condensed spots than the pic above but hers faded as well, were almost completely gone by the time she was 3 or 4 except for a tinge you had I look for.  People who generally have extra melanin already are the most prone to getting them but they just happen to show up really well on mixed kids who have that extra melanin from a darker parent <em>and</em> lighter skin in general as a result of being mixed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't a result of mixing. They are present on most asian and african babies, and most fade with adulthood. </p>
<p>The bruise/abuse thing is very common in eurocentric places like the united states.  Just one of the things whites don't know about and ignorantly assume is out of place.  </p>
<p>So its a good idea to photograph any mongolian spots at birth so you can show childcare providers and other mandatory reporters.  </p>
<p>Source: i was born with a blue spot in the us. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly, if that makes me ignorant, I'm okay with that. I'd rather wrongly worry about a child being abused than wrongly assume they aren't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... I am very pale white. At birth, I had a dark brown  birth mark on my inner calf. When I was 14-16, it turned even paler than my regular skin. I have dark hair, and the hair that grows there now is super blonde. What causes that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just guessing here, but it may have something to do with melanin, seeing as it affects hair colour and skin colour, turning them from dark to bright.</p>
<p>Considering you said it happened at about 14-16yo, puberty and hormones might be the cause.</p>
<p>But that's just a guess, I'm not a dermatologist :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wondering if you might know anything about this: when I was born, the skin at the crease of my neck was pinched together in a small spot. The doctor pulled it apart, resulting in a dark mark that I still have 31 years later. Does that sound more like a scar than a birthmark? I've never thought to ask my doctor about it, but since that's the topic at hand...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be a caf√© au lait that just kinda happened, or perhaps a port-wine stain. Caused by abnormal bleeding of blood vessels, port-wine stains may eventually darken, possibly in your case. Just a guess though, let me know if you find out!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not directly related but when I was born I had a lighter pigmented birthmark on my arm and a mirror image dark pigmented one on my backside. Not sure why but my mom thought it was strange as it matched my preferred position in womb. Unsure if it actually has any correlation or not. The darker birthmark seems to have disappeared or faded to barely noticeable (from what I can tell based on the fact I can only see my ass in a mirror)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe your arm skin got stuck to your backside skin and that's a &quot;scar&quot; from when they pulled apart? That's pretty interesting.</p></div>		</li>
