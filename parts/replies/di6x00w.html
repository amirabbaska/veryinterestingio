			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants are converting light energy into chemical energy.  We fundamentally do the same type of thing with photovoltaics and batteries (Obviously the chemicals we use to store this energy are different than those used by plants).   The question is about storing energy as light energy without converting to another forum of energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a technical standpoint if you wanted to &quot;store light&quot; using plants, you would end up with basic fuel in the end in the form of burnable plant matter. So you would basically be releasing the stored light energy at that point.</p>
<p>In a weird way since coal and oil are made from decaying organisms, they kind of are product of &quot;storing light&quot; since all organic life requires light as a basis for the producer class of organisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photosynthetic organisms don't really vary with each other because they are so inefficient. I think one of the most efficient is sugar cane. Other crop plants tend to also be on the high end of the spectrum (0.5-1.2% efficiency). Artificial leaves use a combination of genetically-engineered microbes and synthesized enzymes to increase that efficiency x5 or x10.</p>
<p>Currently, the most commercially viable way to exploit photosynthesis as an industrial energy source is to use it to produce biofuel.</p>
<p>Artificial photosynthesis is aimed at producing &quot;solar fuel&quot; which can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>biofuel extracted straight from produced starch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hydrogen gas produced through the electron pathway in photosynthesis</p>
</li>
<li>electricity (achieved with some of the artificial leaf designs I've talked about earlier)</li>
