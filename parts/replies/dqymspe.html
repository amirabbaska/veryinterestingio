			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently had a friend of mine tell me a story about someone who lost their dog because it's head got stuck in a bag of cheetos while no one was home. I cried because all the pup wanted was cheetos and it suffocated instead :(...also because what a fucking way to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can suffocate under a pillow too. Air <em>can</em> get through, but not enough to sustain your breathing (and get the CO2 away from you).</p>
<p>Just like a balloon loses air over time, so will a garbage bag. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and so too will it eventually stink. But when it doesn't initially stink it stands to reason it could suffocate for the same reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I crapped inside a HUSKY 3 mil contractor bag one time, tied the top in a double-knot and placed the bag inside a Home Depot bucket. I then placed the bucket containing the the tied bag of poop in the back of my work truck so I could dispose of it properly after work. The bucket smelled like shit when I got back to the shop and I had to throw away the bucket as well. Never could figure out how that smell went through the bag, but it did. No, there weren't any holes that I could see; bag was brand new out of the box. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be because it wasn't a kitchen garbage bag? I don't think contractor bags need to contain smells, particularly. At least not like a bag that contains potentially rotten food.</p></div>		</li>
