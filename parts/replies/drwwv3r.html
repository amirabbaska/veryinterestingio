			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing with the battery. The battery actually works slower in colder temperatures because a chemical reaction is happening, and the temperature affects the reaction rate and mass transport that occurs.</p>
<p>If the processor is not receiving enough power, it may slow down the clock of the device, making it in fact slower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how much current, that is how much energy, you try to extract from it. You can still use a battery when it is 0 Celsius, but you may only extract a tiny amount of power, like a few milliwatts.</p>
<p>Under ambient temperatures of 20 C to 30 C, you may extract watts. So, the order of magnitude changes by a hundred.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, lithium ion batteries work okay from 15 C to 60 C. Lower temperatures require lower energy extraction as I mentioned; and at 0 C it is rather difficult to extract any energy.</p>
<p>Obviously, many devices work in cold weather, for example, there are many Tesla electric vehicles using batteries in Norway. These machines essentially preheat the battery to a working temperature, maybe 20 C, before using it. Then the electrochemical reaction also produces heat, so the battery temperature remains more or less stable.</p></div>		</li>
