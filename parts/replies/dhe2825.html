			<div class="markdown"><p>There is one journalist who has a pretty good idea of his actual wealth and finances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually, as someone who saw Trumpâ€™s federal tax returns about a decade ago as part of a legal action in which he sued me for libel (the suit was later dismissed), I think there probably are some things to be learned from them.</p>
<p>The tax returns my lawyers and I reviewed were sealed, and a court order prevents me from speaking or writing about the specifics of what I saw. I can say that Trump routinely delayed -- for months on end -- producing those documents, and when they finally arrived they were so heavily redacted that they looked like crossword puzzles. The litigation ran on for five years, and during that time we had to petition the court to compel Trump to hand over unredacted versions of the tax returns -- which he ultimately did. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty interesting but even that information would now be pretty outdated with all the intervening years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, because valuing a &quot;brand&quot; can be difficult.  Much or most of his net worth is wrapped into his name.  There's no question Trump has value, there are hotels and apartments all over the world willing to pay for the association, but he values it very highly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still can't wrap my mind around the fact that Trump put his brand at risk by running for president. Win or lose, he had to have known that half the country would turn against him. That's got to impact his bottom line, don't you think? If it were a public company, I feel like there would be shareholder lawsuits or a revolt or something. Goodwill is a big deal to a company's bottom line. Trump burned a lot of his with no regard to all the people who paid so much to licence his name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people in the finance sector estimate he's worth far less. Some say less than $1B. And that the real motivation behind his not releasing his tax returns is embarrassment over how small his net worth truly is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've handled some celebrity divorces and have had to quantify their assets for division between the exes. The numbers reported on those celebrity tv shows were far off. They said one of our clients holdings was around $40 million and we tallied it up to around $70 million. It's all estimates and they are often very wrong. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I read an interview with some businessman that was earning 100s of millions a year. </p>
<p>He said that he has anything he could possibly want already. Money is just to, and I quote, &quot;keep score&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
