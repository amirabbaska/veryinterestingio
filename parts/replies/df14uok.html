<p>In all seriousness, a failed part doesn't give you anything like the same setup that was designed to not need that specific part.</p>
<p>But this is reddit, you are the boss here, and yes reading the responses can be fun. Carry on, and have a good evening! </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is of course true; a person with fallen arches isn't the same thing as a biped that evolved to not need arches. Just meant both have educational potential. </p>
<p>Goddammit, what's with all this friendly and respectful back-and-forth! Is this reddit, or isn't it?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of like when your power steering breaks (really bad) vs a car not designed to have power steering in the first place (not bad).</p>
<p>With power steering, the wheel activates pistons that then turn the wheels. When that breaks, you're now trying to turn the pistons through brute strength and it's really hard. A car not designed to have power steering, on the other hand, had a direct linkage between the wheels and the steering wheel, so it's not that bad. It is easiest with power steering, of course.</p>
<p>Similarly, if feet were designed to not have an arch, like an elephant's feet, then it wouldn't be that bad. But not as easy as having a good working arch.</p>
<p>That being said, elephants actually walk on their toes and have a big fatty tissue deposit under their heel that they walk on. Different design, resulting in an ostensiblyâ€‹ flat foot, but maybe not as nice for continuous running as an arched foot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this was so that it could withstand vertical shock by bending. If it was ramrod straight, a shock going right through the spine would cause it to break because there's nowhere to dissipate the energy. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a reason for using the arch in masonry and architecture.</p>
<p>And, be aware, the archbishop so useful you might be able to find other arches in your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want you to do a test right now.</p>
<p>Go barefoot and bend oevr a kitchen sink to do dishes. Feel that tightness in your back?</p>
<p>Just relax your feet and go to work.</p>
<p>After 10 minutes, I want you to try to pull the balls of your feet under your heels solely by flexing your feet, you should feel a shift in pressure from all over to the foot to mostly the ball and heel, and you should actually feel some air on the underside of the arch area.</p>
<p>If you do this right, by leaning back to arch  your foot like this, then leaning forward so pressure and friction prevents your foot from relaxing, then you should feel your back immediately become less tight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really care about arches/no arches. You have me confused with the OP. I was just clarifying what he was asking. So you can go bend over and do the dishes if you want, I like my arches, and I have a dishwasher!</p></div>		</li>
