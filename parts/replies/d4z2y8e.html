<p>If it helps, back in middle school and high school, i would skip eating breakfast and lunch, then go home, eat one huge meal, feel lethargic and go to sleep.</p>

<p>That's how I've spent the first three years at university, besides the lethargic and sleep thing. I guess the caffeine counteracted that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, uni is draining in so many different ways. Unfortunately, i don't get the benefits from caffeine and I can sleep like a rock even after i drink it. I see so many &quot;I can't live without coffee&quot; quotes and i just can't relate, just wishing some of that magical stuff would work on me. Lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I do now. It's called the Warrior diet. You fast all day and eat all your calories in ~4hrs or one big meal. I really like it. I feel great and I'm down 9kg. I eat whatever I want when I get home but try to also make it nutritious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The warrior diet is a specific fashion of intermittent fasting, for what it's worth. There is a lot of good information out there. I've had good experiences with it (not the warrior diet version in particular, though I have tried it) and I encourage anyone curious to read up and discover some stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What time of the day do you eat? Meaning, what is the clock when you normally eat. And is it ruining the diet if you eat just before bed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that won't ruin the diet. The idea is you have an eating 'window', and anything goes in that time frame. Eating before bed is a non-issue.</p>
<p>You also don't need to consume everything in one meal, and your eating window can be whenever you like. Say, eat from 12-4, or 4-8 (my personal preference). I usually have one large meal, then snack a couple times. Eat at 4-5, snack until 8-9, sleep around 10.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, the most weight loss and muscle gain I've accomplished was while using a diet like this. I find it works great to enable good control over intake and stuff, and getting used to being hungry was a bit of a life changer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a version of intermittent fasting. I used a variation of it to lose 150 lbs in a year. Mine was eating during an 8 hour window and fasting for 16 hours. Add in keeping calories under 2000 to 2500 per day and moderate exercise and it's pretty effective.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Stopped doing it when I got married and piled on the weight. </p>
<p>Started again 2 months ago and lost about 10k. Feeling much better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah i'm getting that it's actually some kind of benefit you get from dieting so i guess i'll keep doing it. It makes going without food sooo much easier.</p></div>		</li>
