			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it's actually much older than 2011 but I have a friend with a TV with burn in problems. It's quite old and large, but it's 720p and LED backlit, probably TN. So, same basic specs and technology you might find today (though 1080p is more common) but it does have burnin issues. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's an issue with plasma TVs in general. Panasonic may have made a better plasma TV but burn-in was a BIG reason LEDs have been so widely adopted over plasma. </p></div>		</li>
