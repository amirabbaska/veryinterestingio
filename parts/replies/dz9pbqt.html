			<div class="markdown"><p>It evolved to stingg invaders of their hives, usually other insects and even other bees. It won't usually come out when they sting a wasp, for example.</p>
<p>But it wouldn't matter anyway, there are thousands of them per hive, and stinging workers do not reproduce, so there would be little to no evolutionary selection pressure to stop it.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Healthy workers increase the fitness of the reproducing queen tho so selection is biased toward queens that make more adapted workers. I don't mean to say there is any evolutionary pressure toward more resilient stingers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue the exact opposite actually - smooth stingers work perfectly fine for defense against invertebrates. How else could wasps attack bees successfully if wasps have smooth stingers?</p>
<p>Rather honeybees evolved stingers that stick onto skin and pump venom specifically against mammals. How many non-mammals do you know would, given the chance, regularly attack honeybee nests or even would consume honey? By having stingers that fall off when mammals are involved, the bees can maximize damage while minimizing the workers consumed - defense against large mammals like raccoons and monkeys is a whole different ball game from defense against insects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the argument that mammals are the only major group of animals worth defending against - hive wrecking, honey stealing lizards and birds are almost nonexistent, so honeybees specifically have evolved mammal deterring, tearing stinger sacs that pump venom for the longest time possible (nobody cracks open smooth stinger wasp nests for honey).</p>
<p>You'll see this in <em>Pogonomyrmex</em> harvester ants of the southwestern US as well - they have venom that specifically messes with mammal nerves the most and is less effective on other organisms because the only thing worth defending their seeds against in their natural environment is mice and other desert granivore mammals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to imagine plenty of animals would be happy to raid hives if bees didn't sting.  Amphibians like toads would be happy to chow down on bees.  I could see ants raiding a beehive for honey, there are lizards which could happily eat bees with no stinger, etc.</p>
<p>I would posit that mammals are the only ones who raid bee hives, because they are the only ones who can.  Thick fur/hair is pretty good defence against insects like bees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. So ripping out their guts may actually ensure more venom delivery, since it continues after the bee is gone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The sting continues to pump venom for a couple of minutes after stinging in order to deliver the full venom capacity. If the bee could only get that instantaneous delivery, there would be much less venom delivered. It's worth dying to pump your full venom load when attacking certain large threats, which tend to be mammals, but not when attacking smaller threats, which tend to be insects. The sting has evolved quite elegantly to meet this problem; the barb rips out the sting in the elastic flesh of mammals, but not in the exoskeletons of wasps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only the queen bee reproduces, so worker bees evolve to do what's best for their colony (as they can only reproduce indirectly via their mother producing new queen bees and drones), not the individual. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely not. I mean evolution HAS favored what we see.   As others have mentioned, mammals pose the biggest risk to the hive so a barbed sting that remains and releases venom for a longer time is going to have positive evolutionary pressure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the stinging bees themselves do not procreate, the queen does. Stinging evolved because it protects the queen, so she can go on and have more descendants.</p></div>		</li>
