			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question and really relevant to the work that we do. Pollution and bacteria in the area (from combined sewage outflows) mean that shellfish in these water are not safe for human consumption. The oysters in our restoration program are not meant to be eaten, but these issues can still have heavy impacts on our work and can actually dictate where we are and are not allowed to put oysters. Restoration in the NY Harbor is restricted to closed waters (where fishing and extraction are not permitted) and permitting agencies can deny our applications in certain areas where they deem the water too hazardous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the water is polluted enough to cause the oysters to be unsafe to eat, wouldn't most of the wildlife be also unsafe to eat? I know that oysters actively take up pollution, but shouldn't it still bio-accumulate into the other species anyways? If yes then fishing in those areas shouldn't be allowed anyways.</p>
<p>Also what about other filter feeders, that don't have commercial fishing harvests? Like bryozoans? Or sponges? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So they can deny restoration efforts in hazardous water? That seems a little counterintuitive.</p></div>		</li>
