			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean if we breath in a lot of air before dipping in, the chances of floating  is higher?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. In dive school Iâ€™d dump out my water bottle and stuff it in my shorts to give me extra buoyancy during treading water beat downs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid, i used to compete with friends as to who could hold their breath underwater for the longest duration of time. Sucking in a lot of air before the plunge made it so much more difficult to not surface back to the top. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a survival technique.  If you're lost in the water, taking deep breaths and holding, letting out slowly with your limbs out. Less energy intensive as constantly treading water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To explain further: the water will get squashed into a smaller space until it's pushing back as hard as the water is pushing in. Water pushes harder the deeper you go, so if you were lying at the bottom of a very deep pool, the water would go further up your ears and nose.</p></div>		</li>
