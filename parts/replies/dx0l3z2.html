			<div class="markdown"><p>I drank solidly for ten days at a festival, came home and suffered through withdrawals for a week. I was relatively hardened before, so at a rough estimate I was drinking between ten and twenty-five pints a day, with anything from 4-15% ABV. I can't give more accurate numbers  (because I was constantly drunk) but that was some pretty heavy drinking, and the week after was hell. 0/10 do not recommend </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body builds up tolerances to it (like any drug) so it varies wildly with the person's tolerance, age, body chemistry, etc.  It's impossible to predict the severity, or which effects will be present, in any given person.</p>
<p>A lot of drugs have a withdrawal, none of which are particularly pleasant, but you can actually die from alcohol withdrawal.  In cases where people are serious drinkers and want to detox, the safest way is to do it under medical supervision since the effects can be lethal.</p></div>		</li>
