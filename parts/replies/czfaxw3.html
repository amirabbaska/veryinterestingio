			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Additionally, in Germanic languages, gender and case are delineated by articles and are therefore necessary for clarity. As English shed (most) of its case and gender structure, articles were dropped from many common phrases. Arguably, this cost the language some precision (especially the loss of cases) but the gains in simplicity were greater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to think of examples where an English phrase loses precision because of the lack of case.</p>
<p>I never understood in Latin, for example, what it adds in precision using the accusative case after the preposition <em>ad</em> (e.g. <em>ad factum</em>) or the ablative after the preposition <em>ex</em> (e.g.<em>ex facto</em>) when the preposition itself seems to have provided ample context.</p>
<p>The only loss of precision I can think of at all in English due to lack of gender is not properly identifying a group consisting entirely of women by the appropriate 3rd person plural identifying them as such, e.g. &quot;Ils/Elles&quot; in French instead of &quot;They.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polish is an interesting counterexample where the language has three genders as well as seven cases and no articles whatsoever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cases show word function.  That's important.  But there are other ways to do that (such as word order).  If you drop cases in favor of word order (like in English) then you give up some flexibility in sentence construction.  However, there's no loss of precision or clarity.</p>
<p>Grammatical gender is just decoration.  It's an additional complexity which provides almost no benefit.  (I suppose a few words sound the same but are different genders. I guess that's a small benefit.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. The definite article is applied to concepts across Romance languages, but in French it also serves as a marker of &quot;completeness&quot; compared to partitive constructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>J'aime l'eau.</em> - I like water. (I like water in general.)</li>
<li><em>Je voudrais de l'eau.</em> - I would like water. (I would like some [of] water). </li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I always hated having to learn all of that stuff when I was taking language classes. It's really tedious and from the perspective of a native English speaker it doesn't seem to actually add anything to the ability to communicate in general.</p>
<p>German for example, has masculine, feminine, and neutral articles that change depending on the grammatical tense of the sentence, and there are no set rules as to why any particular noun is designated a certain gender and they usually seem to be totally arbitrary (such as the word for girl, Madchen, which uses the neutral article &quot;das&quot; instead of the feminine one &quot;die&quot;).</p>
<p>I always wonder if people learning English are super relieved to learn that we only have two articles with no gender distinction. I know that there are tons of other weird quirks with English that don't make sense, but I figure at least that one aspect must be nice for those learning the language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Also surnames as we understand them in English were basically invented after the Norman invasion when the country was speaking various dialects of Old English. These dialects had a lot more inflexion (where a word changes form) of nouns than romance languages. Most of that disappeared over time, but we still inflect to show plurals (adding s) and the genitive (adding an s, what we usually call the possessive, but it's more general than just possession).</p>
<p>Now, &quot;of the&quot; is the genitive. So, in Old English this would have been represented by inflecting the noun (changing its form) rather than adding more words.</p>
<p>But English changed a lot after the Norman invasion, so a lot of these forms would no longer be obvious to us. <insert examples here></p>
<p>It's also the case that whilst the Normans loved these toponymic (relating to a place) surnames, the Anglo-Saxons were much less into them, preferring patronymic (named for the father/grandfather) or describing a person (the bold, the beautiful, the stupid), or their occupation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love how everybody here acts like an authority but is just wildly guessing.</p>
<p>A couple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed surnames in Europe only predate the Norman invasion by a century or two, when they began appearing among the Irish. It wasn't just the Anglo-Saxons who used patronymics. Everybody in Western Europe used patronymics. The Anglos were among the first in Europe to <em>drop</em> patronymics, in fact. The Dutch, parts of future Germany, and the Scandinavians all used patronymics well into the 1800s, and Iceland still uses them today. If anything, the Anglo-Saxons could be said to <em>not</em> like patronymics, since they made the Dutch in New York drop them in the 1680s, long before their homeland followed suit.</p>
</li>
<li>English absolutely <em>did</em> use &quot;the&quot; and &quot;of&quot; and &quot;of the&quot; style surnames in earlier days. Here's <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=EpYoePRWGAMC&amp;pg=PA56" target="_blank">a book of records</a> from Scotland in the 1200s where lots and lots of both Scottish and English people are named. You'll see &quot;de&quot; and &quot;the&quot; and &quot;of&quot; preceding lots and lots of surnames.</li>
</ul>
<p>That book is part of a series and if you google them, you'll see that naming convention was pretty consistent, but not universal, into the 1400s.</p>
<p>But some time in the 1300s, the &quot;de&quot; convention started to lose favor. This is evidenced by the fact that Geoffrey Chaucer's wife's maiden name is usually related as &quot;Philippa Roet&quot; whereas her father is usually related as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paon_de_Roet" target="_blank">Sir Gilles de Roet</a>&quot;. In truth, if you dig up surviving documents from that time, both individuals are recorded sometimes as &quot;Roet&quot; and sometimes as &quot;de Roet&quot;. It just depends on the convention the record-keeper was used to following.</p>
<p>By the 1500s, the &quot;de&quot; prefix had fallen out of fashion and was largely abandoned or swallowed into the name itself. John who lived near the woods was once called &quot;attewode&quot; but his ancestors became &quot;Atwood&quot;.</p>
<p>The big question: &quot;why&quot;? I don't have an answer to that except that it became a convention, just as the English say &quot;in hospital&quot; and Americans say &quot;in the hospital&quot;. </p>
<p>Maybe something to do with the transition to modern English or record keepers wanting to distance their countrymen away from Norman-sounding names. Who knows. We can't say for certain, except that it did happen and it happened over a couple of centuries, starting around the 1300s. It wasn't one event. It became convention to record surnames without the preceding &quot;de&quot; or &quot;of&quot; or &quot;the&quot; and the convention stuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you are talking about all this post Norman stuff. A lot of the examples you give are actually examples of the strength of norman influence. It's the norman influence which also leads to the drop in patronyms. By the period of middle English, so much has been killed off, so much changed, that we do talk of Middle English as a distinct language.</p>
<p>The question specifically asks also about the genitive case, which <em>is</em> quite different in romance languages and saxon, so we might not see the analogs. There also the relationship between England and France, during the Norman period Norman French was high prestige, after the loss of the French possessions, French became identified as &quot;foreign&quot; so French like features started to be dropped as &quot;unEnglish&quot;.</p>
<p>Your average serf wasn't going to be too concerned by this, and would just do what they are told as best they could.</p>
<p>I think what you are saying is totally compatible with what I said, since we are talking about different things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was a silly thing to say.  If he's his father's son, of course that's his clan.<br />
Unless his surname was different from his clan name, or there was something added to it to distinguish one clan from another of a similar name, it's redundant to say the name twice. </p></div>		</li>
