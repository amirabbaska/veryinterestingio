			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what bothers me most about homeopathy and dietary supplements. They’re marketed as drugs, the uneducated consumer thinks they’ll have similar effects to drugs, but because of the use of clever language and the blanket statement of “these claims have not been evaluated by the FDA, etc,” someone could literally put dirt in a capsule and sell it claiming it supports cardiovascular health. Perfectly legal, and nobody will come knocking unless your product hurts someone. Then you close up shop and open under a new name (e.g. almost all weight loss products).  The system is a crock. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, most people probably have the expectation that they won't be lied to due to all of the consumer protections out there. So I'd say that falls to the people lying about their product rather than consumers that have been taught to believe products can not directly lie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay. This doesn't answer why they aren't punished under fraud and false advertising laws. They aren't supplements either. (and they are still advertised and often prescribed as medicine even when called supplements)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, well technically I guess.  But they do list ingredients on the bottle and not a single molecule of that ingredient is in it.  They list the dilution amount instead of a weight.  People see homeopathic and think natural remedy, and see the ingredient list but don't take the time to understand what the amount means.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean they do, all the time - it's not enforced, though.</p>
<p>The real answer is &quot;because large amounts of fraud are de facto legal in the US&quot;</p>
<p>Politicians have frequently gone out of their way to carve out legal exemptions for it to insure it keeps getting sold. </p>
<p>It's an even bigger questions in places like Canada though, where it's specifically sold as medicine (and covered by medical insurance)</p></div>		</li>
