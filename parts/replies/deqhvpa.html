			<div class="markdown"><p>Is lithium-11 unstable?  If yes, does that instability have anything to do with the large, distorted orbitals?</p>
<p>I am <em>impressed</em> by this answer, by the way.  Extremely readable!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you follow the wiki link on huge orbitals, you will see that the configuration is very unstable and that half lives of nuclei with huge orbitals are usually within milliseconds. The instability absolutely comes from the large distorted orbital. A material gets all it's properties from the structure the atoms are arranged in. Atoms interacting with each other will attempt to arrange themselves in the lowest possible energy configurations. So Lithium 11 almost immediately decays into Be 11 by releasing an antineutrino and an electron to lower it's energy and become more stable. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Except in almost all cases interaction between atoms doesn't involve the nuclei, only the valence electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All known halo nuclei are unstable and decay with half lives on the order of milliseconds. I'm not an expert on why, but it's not hard to imagine the instability when part of the nucleus (the 'halo') is sitting in an excited energy level even in the ground state of the nucleus. In ^(11)Li's case, it decays <a href="http://www.periodictable.com/Isotopes/003.11/index.full.dm.html" target="_blank">most often into ^(10)Be</a> by beta and neutron emission, but the highly unstable structure of the halo nucleus means that it has a ton of different fission products. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask a really dumb question that has been bothering me? Point like particles suggests near zero separation is possible. With protons, this would require near infinite energy to overcome the coulomb repulsion. But what actually happens with oppositely charged particles? such as positronium? I realise that orbits will prevent the electron and positron actually sharing the same space until they decay into gamma rays, but if we hypothetically removed that limitation, would there be an infinite energy release if they did collide?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he means it does not have a definable spatial extent, so just a point makes more sense. On the other hand, he used the extents of a nucleus orbitals to define its size, that does not mean the nucleus is a sort of tangible ball which you can bump into.</p></div>		</li>
