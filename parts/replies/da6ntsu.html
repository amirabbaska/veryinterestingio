<p>1800 seconds is 30 minutes. I assume this is 1800 milliseconds or 1.8 seconds. </p>
<p>Ninja edit: Oh wait I just saw you said 1800 milliseconds later, so yeah that's probably it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing, this just seems like someone put together a paper without looking for any evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>I'm a music game player, so discrete notes is what I'm about. I can pretty readily discern adjacent notes up to 330 bpm 16ths.</p>
<p>Edit: Interesting aside. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbNUR1P0fTM" target="_blank">One of my friends composed a song which starts at 100 bpm, and increases by one beat per minute, every single beat, until the song ends at 573 bpm.</a> You can hear some pretty discrete 16th notes around <del>365</del> 389 bpm.</p>
<p>For the math nerds, he also wrote a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/B6nKkEM.jpg" target="_blank">formula</a> to calculate the bpm of this song at any given second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would encourage you to read through the paper and get a better understanding of what it's saying before you start writing it off as incorrect. It's a doctoral dissertation by one of the more complicated composers I know. The information is solid. </p>
<p>You misunderstand though. The paper isn't saying that above 300 bpm people can no longer hear subdivisions as audible individual notes its saying that above 300 bpm people start to perceive the individual beats as being apart of a bigger larger beat rather than each being its own beat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are 16th notes only if you are at ~140, which is the real tempo at the end of that song. They would be quarter notes at 573.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing. Just like the frequency of sound some people can hear outside the average  rangem my understanding is most people can hear 67-150 BPM without out issue. Below 33BPM or above 300MPM is more of a hard cut off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>300BPM is absolutely not a hard cut off. Plenty of music is at tempos faster than that. 1950s-1960s swing/bebop was very often at tempos between 300 and 400BPM, and there is a very discernible difference between those two tempos even to the untrained ear. Take <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SSzWPNFX7sc" target="_blank">this</a> for example, which is at about 380BPM. It's very clearly faster even to a non-musician than say, <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=30FTr6G53VU" target="_blank">this</a> which is at a tiny bit less than 300BPM. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It didn't say you can't <em>hear</em> them. It said you &quot;start grouping individual pulses into larger units&quot;, presumably meaning that you stop thinking of each individual pulse as carrying the beat and start thinking of each group of 2 or each group of 4 as carrying the beat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer, and why the comment doesn't answer OP's question. The quote above is talking about discernable tempo. Once a piece of music gets fast enough, you start tracking the tempo by the half note or measure or some other grouping instead of by the beat. </p>
<p>OP's question is about when repeated beats will sound like one tone. On average, that's around 20bps (don't have a source for that, just learned it once upon a time). So if you were playing 16th notes and the tempo was 300bpm you'd be around the point that the notes would start blending into one tone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to gives some context as to why these limits might be where they are:</p>
<p>300 BPM is 5Hz, which is getting close to the threshold of human hearing at 20Hz, especially considering that a sound has duration and components (attack, sustain, decay and release). If you can't distinguish those components I would think it would be very hard indeed to discern duration, and if you can't separate a sound into individual durations it will sound, almost by definition, like a continuous note.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlRo62RjuGY" target="_blank">this</a> suggests the 300 BPM number (100ms) is way too low. In fact, it is around the 20Hz number (1200BPM) that you start hearing a tone develop.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9FrW-Wr-ds" target="_blank">Also, you can still distinguish these.</a></p>
<p>33 BPM is very slow indeed, but at 0.5Hz it corresponds to the slow end of Theta brainwaves. Delta waves can be slower but they are associated with sleep. However it should be noted that music using slower cycles extensively, so it depends on where you draw the line for &quot;beat&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the drummer video I am actually a bit doubtful on whether you can actually distinguish all the hits. You can clearly identify some of the hits, but are you hearing <em>all</em> of them? While watching it I could not make the number of hits I could distinguish match the number incremented on the counter by any stretch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the whole point of the question is the point where we can't distinguish any. So while I agree with you, I still think this isn't the limit. If you could distinguish even just one or two out of the 1208 then it is not a single continuous note. Although this is probably one of the closest you'll here from a human. Amazing either way you think about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure the point of the drummer video isn't about what an outside observer hears. It's that a person is able to make 1208 single-stroke hits in under a minute. So the player can essentially distinguish each hit as a discrete left or right stroke without any double-strokes or drags. Considering that's a video of a record, what you're witnessing is the current limit of how fast a drummer can play single-stroke notes.</p>
<p>It's important to understand how much control it takes to accomplish this. If you notice, all the hand movement actually occurs with the weakest fingers of the hand. His thumb and primary fingers are held in place, acting as fulcrum for the sticks. The other fingers are then hitting the butt-end of the stick to cause the stick to strike the pad, then releasing to allow the stick to bounce back up. Each hand alternates this process, which means each hand is capable of 604 bpm. That's 604 discrete hits per hand by the player (or ~10 bps). Even if you can't hear each individual beat, the point is that the player is legitimately playing them as discrete hits.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A 5hz frequency is different to a sound within the audible range being retrigged 300 times per minute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what happens is that the audible part of the sound starts to become heard as harmonic components of the underlying sound. It would be most effective if it actually lined up with the overtone series though. The fact that it isn't probably explain why it is still possible to hear both interpretations.</p></div>		</li>
