In theory if they had the equipment and expertise to do genetic screening and IVF, they could select sperm and egg pairs that don't have matching genetic defects. So the offspring should be healthy despite having sibling parents.</p>
<p>Don't know if current technology would be good enough, but I think it would be theoretically possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with your hypothetical, I would argue that the lack of technology is a necessary assumption in the context.</p>
<p>No two humans will have all the required expertise to maintain and operate the relevant technology, meaning that even if it's available for the first two generations (one parent is a geneticist and the other an engineer of the appropriate discipline to maintain the tools using scrap/salvage, and they both have enough gardening/hunting experitise to not starve), it will decay fairly rapidly without the industrial base to support it.</p>
<p>Granted, the first couple of generations would probably be the most important to sort out, but you're not going to avoid most of the relevant concerns entirely. </p></div>		</li>
