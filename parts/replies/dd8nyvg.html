			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, The OA had one episode that was 30 minutes long (most of the episodes are around an hour).  I was really confused at first and actually went to IMDb to make sure there wasn't just an error with my Netflix account.  But, yeah, it's pretty cool that if they feel like they want an episode to end at plot point X but there's only 30 minutes of content between the previous episode-ending plot point, they just make a short episode.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched that show, and I flipped between &quot;That's a good show&quot; to &quot;Alright, this isn't really that good&quot; like every other episode. The ending left me on the fence.</p>
<p>Overall, worth the watch, I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably thought about it more than you would most &quot;not really good&quot; shows, so that tips it to the &quot;good&quot; side for me, even if it had some really terrible plot elements.  Everytime I see my little girls casting &quot;Frozen&quot; Elsa ice spells now, all I can think of are the dopey &quot;movements&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wife and I loved every minute. I think they ended it perfectly and am actually disappointed there will be a second season. I feel that tying up loose ends will only weaken the narrative.</p>
<p>The unreliability of The OA as a narrator is a strength to the story telling. It gives equal weight to each characters perspective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I remember one of the few negative reviews for their &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; complaining that the episodes varied so much in length and how that would somehow indicate cluelessness on part of the show's writers. </p>
<p>I wonder if that critic also complained that the Harry Potter books didn't all have the same page count...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but the annoying thing about varying runtimes is you don't know how long an episode will last and if you're &quot;fitting in&quot; an episode before doing X, Y or Z getting into an episode only to realise it's much longer than all the rest can be a bit frustrating.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyway that show is absolutely incredible. Better than anything else these other companies are putting out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watched the first episode of &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; and was not impressed. Should I keep going, or if I didn't like the first then I shouldn't push forward?
Thanks in advance for the input. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first one is definitely a lot of setting the stage and a bit awkward trying to get everyone introduced. The second episode is where it really shows the voice they're trying to create for the show. Then the show gets a lot more fun from the 3rd episode on with all of the disguises which really up the humor and make it even more enjoyable. So yes, I'd keep going. I didn't like the first episode either but I've really liked all the others. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're on the fence about it, you may want to give the second episode (and maybe even the third one) a try, as well. The tone and style do take some getting used to, and IMHO the first episode isn't the best of the lot.</p>
<p>The later episodes do retain the same absurdist, mock-gothic, and over-the-top atmosphere, however. IMHO they make better use of it than the first one, but they do build on it. So, if part one left you completely unimpressed, the show just might not be your thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. Netflix original content feels so fresh because it doesn't have to play by a lot of the rules that traditional TV shows do. This includes not being a slave to episode run time. Letting a story unfold without having to jam in useless minutes can lead to more organic feeling development. Just think of how much nonsense you had to add to a paper back in school to meet the minimum length requirement, only to have those extra words often detract from the quality of the paper as a whole.</p></div>		</li>
