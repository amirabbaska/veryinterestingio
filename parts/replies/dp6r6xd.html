</blockquote>
<p>Considering the fact that half of India's states (the more developed and progressive half) have dropped below replacement level naturally without a one-child policy, I can fully believe that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Nearly half the states in India have fertility rate of 2.1 or below, not surprising since the states with 2.1 or less have more industrial economy than agrarian. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's reasonable. The One Child policy worked a LOT better in cities than the countryside. A large part of that is due to enforcement, but I'd also like to believe that access to education, work, and medical services played a part. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factor is probably the fact that it costs more to raise a child in the city than in the countryside and that people in the countryside also rely more on their children to help them in manual labor, encouraging them to make another one if the first one turned to be a girl. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One funny detail China. There is 13 million kids more than we thought. They were hidden during the one child policy. There are more females than males in that group too. Only in China can hide 13 million people. That is the size of a small country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The One Child Policy wasn't a policy except in urban areas and for the ethnic majority.  It actually only applied to about a third of China's population.</p>
<p>The biggest impact on China's birthrate happened between the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, where Chinese fertility rate fell from 6-7 to less than 3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say economic power for women is the major factor.   Women who have their own economic support system don't need to fall back on marriage for financial support and thus lose a lot of exposure to pregnancies they don't want. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't disagree, but I think 'economic power' is simplifying it a bit too much. It's also about autonomy, education, and access.</p>
<p>They have to be able to make their own choices, know what the choices are, and be able to follow through with those choices. So more than just letting women work, but also birth control, education and financial stability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factor that is quite unintuitive is child labor laws, and access to retirement benefits drastically.  If old people don't need children to support them when they are old, they'll stop having them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to my answer, for Europe specifically over the timeframe you're interested in, economic shifts at the end of the Cold War affected population growth rate in the Eastern Bloc countries, most of which are in Europe.  The details are complicated and country-specific, though.</p></div>		</li>
