			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, I guess I just suck - I feel sleepy at night, but not quite bed time, /<em>think</em>/ it's a good time for bed, fall asleep for 10mins, wake up feeling like shit but also super awake, then end up going bed at 4am. I HATE it. I've had to learn to stay awake an extra hour after I feel sleepy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I double down on my natural 'sleepy now' feeling by taking my 24 hour allergy medicine at the first sleepy feel. I also eat dinner later,  like 8 or 9pm for bed at 10 to catch the blood sugar down wave.
Before I struggled with insomnia for years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really annoying how my dad just works from home, falls asleep instantly on the sofa then snores the fucking house down in the afternoon, gets back up an hour or two later, more work, goes out for ridiculous sized steak meal coupled with multiple coffees and then he's in bed by 11pm and instantly falls asleep. </p>
<p>Me on the other hand, awake till at least 1AM even without Reddit, wake up at 5AM for a piss every night without fail and then up by 9AM. </p></div>		</li>
