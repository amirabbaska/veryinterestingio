			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that any dissolved salt will increase conductivity of water, which can affect corrosion (rusting) of metals. However if we're talking about good old NaCl salt, those chloride ions can wreak havoc on metals in ways that most other ions can't and that are far more impactful than conductivity.</p>
<p>Some metals are protected from corrosion by a thin layer of oxides called a 'passive film', which spontaneously forms on the its surface. This passive film is what keeps aluminum from reacting with everything, and is what makes stainless steel 'stainless'. However these passive films can be disrupted by chloride ions and even cause them to break down. Chloride ions destabilize the film but aren't consumed. This results in increased corrosion of the metal that was underneath. </p>
<p>This effect can be amplified in a tight space such as a crevice or a pit. A pit is a tiny hole formed by corrosion reactions that can penetrate deep through a metal, which becomes a problem if it pokes all the way through. They may form where there are small breaks in the passive film. Here is a simplified explanation of how the chloride ion is catalytic inside a pit: (1) Positively charged ions are released inside the pit as the metal is corroded (2) Chloride ions, which are negatively charged are pulled inside the pit to balance the charge. (3) As a result, the pit environment becomes very strongly acidic with lots of chloride ions, in other words its highly concentrated hydrochloric acid. (4) The harsh environment increases corrosion of the metal in the pit by preventing the passive film from re-forming. (5) Return to step 1. </p>

We run into similar problems with stainless in anoxic environments, where it's unable to maintain its oxide layer. If we know about this ahead of time, galvanized steel is normally a better bet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some stainless steels are designed to have higher pitting resistance, which is important for marine environments due to the presence of chloride ions. Pitting resistance of a stainless steel can be predicted by its [pitting resistance equivalent number (PREN)] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitting_resistance_equivalent_number" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitting_resistance_equivalent_number</a>).</p>
<p>316 stainless steel is the most common 'marine grade' stainless steel, and has better pitting resistance due to its 2-3%wt molybdenum content. Molybdenum increases pitting resistance by improving repassivation kinetics. This means that if a pit forms, the molybdenum helps re-form the passive film inside the pit, which would stop corrosion reactions and keep the pit from propagating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lowering the activation energy is a method some catalysts employ, though it's not necessarily an alternate chemical pathway. The same chemical steps can still occur in a catalyzed reaction, it's just the catalyst in some way makes those steps easier. Take for example a lot of enzymatic catalysts, which do not alter the pathway but reduce the energy required to reach an activated state. One way they can do this is to form a binding pocket that stabilizes, or at least increases the likelihood of formation of the activated, usually unstable state. If the reaction combines two different molecules the enzyme is usually shaped so that both molecules are near each other, in the right orientations when they are bound to the enzyme. Both effects, stabilizing the activated state and orienting the molecules together can reduce activation energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're wrong. A catalyst increases the rate of a reaction by offering an alternative reaction path with a lower activation energy than the non catalyst reaction.</p>
<p>In this case the reaction is rate limited by the conducitivty of the medium. Increasing the salt concentration increases this term. The activation energy is unchanged.</p>
<p>What us actually happening is you're in 'pseudo first order conditions' where the concentration of everything except the salt is high.</p>
<p>Increasing the salt concentration enough allows you to move into a new regime where oxygen availability becomes the rate limiting factor.</p>
<p>You're confusing rate in the thermodynamic sense and rate in the practical sense, it's an easy mistake to make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, it's been a while since I've had to use any form of chemistry so I'm a bit rusty here... Pardon the pun.</p>
<p>So I get that salt content in water affects how charges are distributed. As some one below said it has to do with the arrangements of the ions when salt is dissolved in water, reducing the energy required to separate Hydrogen from Oxygen, thereby increasing the availability of Oxygen as a reagent. </p>
<p>I take it that's what you referenced when stating that Oxygen is the rate limiting factor but how is that different from the reaction without salt present? Wouldn't Oxygen also be the limiting reagent in a senario without the electrolytic compound present?</p>
<p>If so then salt is simply increasing the rate of reaction by being present but not actually going through chemical change. Hense the reason it would be classified as a catalyst. </p>
<p>If not, then could you elaborate? Where am I dissconecting in my understanding? </p></div>		</li>
