			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily &quot;always&quot; (unless you have very low thresholds for calling something &quot;radioactive&quot;), but &quot;almost always&quot;.  e.g. neutron bombardment of boron would yield stable Li-7, He-4, and B-11, but I'm not sure why you'd want any of those things via this process since it would be an expensive way to get cheap materials.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He-4</p>

<p>With the looming helium shortage, just how expensive are we talking about? If one unit of helium costs x today, how much would one unit of transmuted helium cost?</p>
<p>You talk only about hitting things with a beam of neutrons. Is proton bombardment not done, not possible, not feasible? I might be totally wrong, but I would think controlling a beam of protons would be much easier than neutrons since they are charged particles and can be manipulated as such. So would it be feasible to load up a tank with hydrogen and bombard it with protons to make helium, or am I just describing a very expensive method of creating a fusion explosion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is neutron bombardment the only process or is proton bombardment similarly effective? If so, can one not start with a more plentiful element, proton bombard it up to an element on which one can apply neutron bombardment to yield a useful/valuable element? (not accounting for the expense of the actual processes themselves) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem like the person to answer this question then: Let's say you have a classic lead to gold scenario. I was to add and subtract electrons and protons etc to turn a brick of lead into a brick of gold. How does adding/subtracting those electrons, protons and neutrons change the color of the element? How would swapping some subatomic particles change the whole visual aspect of an element?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that photons are subatomic particles too.  They interact with electrons, causing them to jump to higher energy orbitals and fall back again, which emits another photon.  When you change the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons, you change the available orbitals, thus changing the energy levels, which changes the emitted photons.  Hence the different color/visual aspect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything seems to interact with photons. Is the universe somehow fundamentally photonic in nature? Not in the sense that photons make up the universe, more in the sense that the same more-photon-than-anything-else-like fundamental mechanism is running the show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every interaction between light and atoms except radiation happens between the light and the electrons that make up the atom.</p>
<p>Different configurations of electrons absorb and emit different wavelengths of light based on the energy level that shell (group) contains. </p>
<p>The amount of electrons will be the same as the number or protons (I am ignoring ions).</p>
<p>Electrons arrange themselves in groups with different &quot;orbits&quot; around the nucleus,  more electrons will affect the orbital patterns and energy levels you get, thus affecting the colour emitted.</p>
<p>There may be a few gaps in my explanation, it's been a while since Ive had to use this knowledge.</p></div>		</li>
