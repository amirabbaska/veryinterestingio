<p>there's always a spot where water comes in contact with a solid surface (The rock or ice) that momentarily brings the fluid to a stop, in that short amount of time it has to be cold enough to freeze the water</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a side note,  the water in the video is supercooled, and probably didnt need the ice it was being poured on to freeze. </p>
<p>The effect he is describing is the no slip condition. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fluid dynamics, the no-slip condition for viscous fluids assumes that at a solid boundary, the fluid will have zero velocity relative to the boundary. The fluid velocity at all fluidâ€“solid boundaries is equal to that of the solid boundary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the water at the boundry isnt moving, thus making it easier to freeze onto the below freezing rocks or ice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, in the example photo inspiring the question, it looks like it started out as icicles hanging from the top. As the water continued to pass over it, more ice kept accumulating until the whole opening was closed. I'm assuming the waterfall is still falling on the outside of the ice.</p>
<p>There is a small waterfall next to the west portal of the west tunnel on the Going-To-The-Sun Road in Glacier National Park that causes the west portal to freeze shut completely many winter seasons. This reminded me of that.</p></div>		</li>
