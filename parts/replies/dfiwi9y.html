			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured that might be the case, things being easier with a clean cut (i read they're using a very expensive diamond blade for the cut), but it still seems like a lot to repair.</p>
<p>Also, while I do agree that it's technically a body transplant, it's the head that would get rejected in the case of the nervous system freaking out, so that's why they refer to it as such</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The immune system of either individual can reject the body parts of the other.  IE the head can reject the body and the body can reject the head.  Both the head and the body will have blood making marrow so determining which is graft and which is host is semantics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I view it more from the angle of who the recipient is. This guy is getting a new body, therefore it's a body transplant. If he were getting a new head, but keeping his old body, it would be a head transplant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the skull bones really are outnumbered by the long bones in the body and the other lymphatic/immunological organs in the body...so an immunological host vs graft response will be body against head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter which immune system fights the other. An example being bone marrow transplants. You can have graft vs host disease, but just because the transplanted immune system is attacking, doesn't mean you recategorize it as a body transplant. It's still a bone marrow transplant. </p>
<p>We generally accept that who we are is in our brain, so whatever organs you receive are the transplant organs. In this case it's the whole body other than the head, which is &quot;receiving&quot; the transplant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also SCI/regeneration researcher here... none of the nerves other than the cranial nerves will be intact and even that depends on where they sever the head from... There is absolutely no point to this procedure and at best will make the terminally ill patient brain dead faster, but more likely than not, just kill him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is quite similar in case of bone marrow transplant. If there happens to be a rejection, it is the new bone marrow attacking recipients body, not the other way around. So imo we should call it body transplant, since we are saving a head. Body is a donor.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the injury completely heals properly... Do all brains transmit the same signals down the same paths? Every brain develops independently with it's own body, so couldn't some of the signals being sent and received to one body be incompatible with another? Or do they all function similarly and use the same &quot;code,&quot; so to speak?</p>
<p>For that matter, a reattached finger is usually reported to have a significant reduction in nerve function, so doesn't that bode poorly for a higher precision system like a heartbeat?</p>
<p>I really do hope it works though, for his survival of course, but also in part because I'm really curious how much consciousness and personality are decentralized throughout the body; he could be a completely different person afterwards...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A finger is a higher precision system than a heartbeat, at least to the brain. The heart is relatively autonomous while you can't have fingers moving without central control (and the fingers have massive cortical representation). </p>
<p>I see your point in the first paragraph though. That's the most interesting/frightening aspect of this whole procedure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I wrong in thinking literally everyone involved (save maybe a few) know this will fail, but passed ethics (if it did get approved) because the guy doesn't have much quality of life going for him and it's something that seemingly would have a lot of information to glean from it regardless of failure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does it need ethics reviews? </p>
<p>I'd the patient wants to have a 1% chance of survival vs a 0% chance, why should anyone but him and the doctors have any say in that? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could glean the same information without needing to do the procedure.  Why not sever and reattach the spine of said brain dead patient instead of guaranteeing a worse life for a living patient?  We need to establish that it can work before doing a live test on someone.  It's insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/09/the-audacious-plan-to-save-this-mans-life-by-transplanting-his-head/492755/" target="_blank">this article</a>, they will be trying it the exact same way that you just described. Quoting the relevant bits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His team still needs to collect data from hundreds of mice, and conduct more large-animal transplants, probably with dogs. Ren also wants to choreograph the surgery with cadavers and, as a final test, <strong>swap the heads of two brain-dead donors</strong>. All of which takes timeâ€”months, maybe years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine.</p>
<p>EDIT: My bad. You said severe then reattach. They've done that in rats AFAIK. Not sure if on monkeys as well.</p></div>		</li>
