			<div class="markdown"><p>The Kyo is the same. If I’m not mistaken, the Kyo means capital, whereas the to in Kyoto is like a small prefecture. The to in Tokyo is actually a long to (tō) which means east.</p>
<p>Kyoto was once the capital, but it was later moved to Tokyo, previously Edo, which is east of Kyoto.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wish I had not to add, but these are the big things. There are still a few xenophobic people here, so try not to rock the boat if you look rather foreign. </p>
<p>I have to say that trying to slurp Eastern noodles will win you brownie points, as will trying to talk about Japanese comedians. </p></div>		</li>

<p>As for Eastern, you could debate that ramen is actually Chinese... But yes, slurping spaghetti is not a thing I see here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious to know if it's considered rude to cool down your ramen as you eat by lightly blowing on it, like, it'd imply the chef doesn't know how to serve their food at a reasonable enough temperature for their customer to eat, much less enjoy or some other wacky shit. I've always been audible when eating ramen, but having it straight off the stove top, it can prove to be too piping hot.</p></div>		</li>
