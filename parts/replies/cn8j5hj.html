			<p>If a succulant was given more water than it needed, would it take it all in anyway or is there a physical maximum it could absorb? </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm having trouble finding a definitive answer for you. I do know from growing them that they can be easily overwatered. However, typically what you will see in that case is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_rot" target="_blank">root rot</a> from too much water standing around the roots.</p>		</li>

			<p>That really answers his question on its own, though. The root becomes saturated with water and cannot absorb more, and this causes the excess water to stand out and create the rot.</p>		</li>

			<p>So just as conjecture, it doesn't absorb the water? My basic understanding of a plant's biology, is that it requires osmosis to actually absorb water. When the plant runs out of salts to salinate the absorbed water, it would stop absorbing water into the cells because the concentration would be at equilibrium.</p>		</li>

			<p>If its hot enough, possibly. There needs to be adequate soil drying to allow  air to the roots, and there must be enough sun to cause transpirational pull. Too much water would just sit around and root the roots</p>		</li>

			<p>As others have pointed out, too much water sitting around the roots is bad. Roots &quot;breathe&quot; and need oxygen. If there's too much water, then the roots can drown. Once dead or weakend, they can rot. <br><br>However, some plants can grow in water vases indoors. Likley there is enough dissolved oxygen in the water to support the roots--whereas the roots would have to compete with more microorganisms in soil for that oxygen. <br><br>As for the rest of the plant, water uptake is a passive process. Water enters a plant until there are no more cellulose fibers it can stick to (think of a paper towel soaking up water) and the cells fill up with water and push against their cell walls. At this point, a plant is at its maximum capacity. Water may even drip out of leaf margins (water drops on leaf edges in the morning). <br><br>Water can then be lost as it evaporates from the leaves. A little bit is used by the plant for biochemistry, but most evaporates. This evaportion opens up room for more water to come up. Also, since water likes to stick to itself, water molecules that move up help pull other water molecules too. Minerals that were absorbed can join the ride up to the leaves too. </p>		</li>
