			<div class="markdown"><p>[Pedantic rant below]^1 It would be the exact same situation, the effect would effectively be zero! The average energy of a system varies linearly with the temperature, so a chunk of material at 600K would be as hot as a body at ~0K would be cold. In other words, an atom from a material at 600K would on average dump about 50 meV into your body, which would make no difference whatsoever. </p>
<p>Having said that, the temperature/energy scale isn't completely symmetric. While on the low end there exists an absolute zero/zero energy, there is no upper limit. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-energy_cosmic_ray" target="_blank">high energy cosmic rays</a> that reach the Earth sometimes have energies up to 1*10^20 eV, or an energy higher by 23 orders of magnitude than what I had discussed. The good news is that such highly energetic particles don't strongly interact with our bodies. But even at lower energies, if such particles do interact with our bodies they can act like bullets, cutting up our DNA and other biomolecules (think of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray" target="_blank">gamma rays</a> coming from nuclear radiation).</p>
<p><strong>1. Rant:</strong> Temperature is an average property of a collection of a large number of particles. Talking about the temperature of a single particle is dangerous and rather misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wanted to mention this, too. Boltzmann distribution is a thing. There are plenty of atom with twice the mean energy (i.e. double the temperature, so to speak, i.e. 600k) of the ambient air hitting you all the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If we had an atom at ~600K</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A candle flame is about twice that temperature, and you can easily move your hand through it without suffering any permanent damage.</p>
<p>In general, you need <em>a lot</em> of matter for temperature to actually matter. Consider how long you can stay in a sauna where the air is hot enough to make you boil, if it could just raise your body temperature to the temperature of the room. But it can't, because air just isn't massive enough, and there's not enough of it in contact with your skin, so your body temperature doesn't really rise significantly even if you're in there an hour. It'll kill you eventually, but it's going to take a ridiculous amount of hot air to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A single photon, like from the sun, hitting your skin, is equivalent to an atom of about 10000k. </p>
<p>So no. Thats not even enough energy to locally damage a cell membrane. You will just get a couple atoms excited for a few picoseconds until that energy propagates away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now divide that by more than 10^22 to see how much that atom would hurt you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put it into perspective, because scientific notation has the habit of being hard to wrap your head around: dividing by 10^22 is taking <em>less than one millionth of a millionth of a billionth</em> of that energy.</p>
<p>Or more visually: 0.00000000000000000001% of that energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A shower will be ok, a bath will kill you. LN2 can touch your body for a second or two without doing any damage. I used to be bored in a lab and would dunk my hand in LN2 all the time, scoop out some, etc. </p>
<p>Oh did I mention that you'd have to be completely hairless? If any of it gets caught in your hair/beard/pubes it would freeze them off after nary two seconds </p></div>		</li>
