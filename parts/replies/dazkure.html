			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, but the house of representatives electoral system is almost identical (large number of seats, one seat per voting area etc, voting areas kinda correlated to pop sizes) whereas the senate/presidential systems have some variances (2 senators per state, state weighted areas rather than pop weighted areas)</p></div>		</li>
