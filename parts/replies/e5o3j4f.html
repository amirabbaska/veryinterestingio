			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool. But why would it take a computer more than a fraction of a second to learn how to imitate that movement?  (ie:  watch humans move to the box from 10,000 locations on screen and copy whatever the relevant path is?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because it'd defeat the purpose of the robot using the website. Are using robots to access and potentially attack website, the hacker relies on the speed of the robot to be able to overload the servers or otherwise cause trouble a robot that does its job as quickly as a human isn't nearly as useful even if it could be left on its own to work. so while the path factors into it, there's also the speed at which you access things and if a robot quickly clicks on it much much faster than humans are likely to it'll get rejected</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean just have it act like a human before the captcha, then revert back after. I feel like you're trying to deduce this through logic and not actual inside info</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a cat and mouse game. While it's possible what you say, it takes effort to implement. Fraudsters are business men too, so instead of investing into defeating such a system they instead target the plenty of other pages that don't have something alike or focus more on attacks based on social engineering.</p>
<p>Eventually they'll implement what you suggest and captcha companies will adapt by trying to detect this or other biometric indicators</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's tricky to make computers act like humans, even if it had 100,000 inputs to start at and they all ended at the same point. There's millions of pixels to start at, and if a computer starts at a new one it will have no idea what to do. Programs follow precise instructions, so if you wanted it to act like a human you'd have to tell it to go this speed, make this kind of curve, slow down for this bit and then speed up here. It would have to act different each time if it was trying to do some sneaky bot stuff which makes it even harder. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's less persuasive than the other answers I've seen here (too costly/time consuming).  Anything a bot can learn to detect, another bot can learn to fake.  It is, as another poster put it helpfully, a &quot;cat and mouse&quot; game.  It's not clear why one side (the faker or the detector of fakes) should have an advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For goodness sake, I wish that people would read about how things work before spewing speculation as if it were fact. <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf" target="_blank">This</a> is one of many studies disproving the idea that mouse movement impacts how successful your attempt at passing reCaptcha is. </p>
<p>It's all done based on browsing history and the browsing environment the reCaptcha widget is being run in. That's it. And if you honestly don't think that a computer can imitate the &quot;wobblyness&quot; then you can look at some of the aimbots used in games like the original counterstrike (almost 2 decades old) which implemented a more natural way of snapping aim to someone's head (this was an attempt at ban evasion). I'm sure if we had the technology to make mouse movements wobbly 18 years ago we might <em>just</em> be able to do it today as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that programs online trying to beat capchas are trying to do it as fast as possible. Even if you make a computer take long enough, that defeats the point of a bot who goes from testing dozens of times a second to once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just movement, and in fact movement might have 0 part in it. It also depends on cookies you have in your browser and other stuff you've been doing online I believe.</p></div>		</li>
