<p>It's also important to note that clinical bruxism isn't ubiquitous and that there is debate concerning its etiology. It's also not limited to night time. Attrition is ubiquitous with time, whereas bruxism is considered to be pathologic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to my professor, elephants only have 1 big molar per arch, and are replaced 6 times in their life.
These molars are naturally worn down from attrition and will be replaced by the next set of teeth. When the 6th set of molars erupt they must last the rest of the elephant's life, if they are worn down the elephant cannot eat anymore and will die of starvation.</p></div>		</li>
