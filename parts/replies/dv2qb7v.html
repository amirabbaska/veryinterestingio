			<div class="markdown"><p>Potassium gets absorbed into the skin.  With a greater concentration than normal, eyelid tissues pull water from capillaries to account for increased potassium concentration which causes the swelling (edema).  The extra potassium is eventually swept up by lymphatic vessels and water levels return to normal in the tissues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes get puffy from allergic reactions due to histamines. </p>
<p>Histamines are compounds released by cells in your body which cause the capillaries in the affected area to expand and allow for more blood flow (to bring white blood cells and proteins) to the affected area.</p>
<p>More blood flow = increased inflammation/swelling</p></div>		</li>
