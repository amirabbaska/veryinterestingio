			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point. People (like many animals) shout or yelp when hurt so that anyone that hurt them immediately knows and stops the behavior. A ancestor that did not have a vocal response to pain would have been more likely to be accidentally maimed or killed by one of their own, and therefore less likely to pass on their genes. This is one possible evolutionary mechanism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually did that with my cat when she was a kitten. She would bite and claw my hand. Initially the claws weren't too bad, but she didn't learned her limits. When I started yelling out, she learned she was digging in too deep.</p>
<p>Now when she wants attention, she will press her claws against the skin, but not with enough force to break the skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a useful point in dog training is teaching them to control how hard they're biting. If they learn that, many dogs, when older, will close their jaws gently on someone - instead of biting hard - to request the cessation of an annoying behaviour.</p></div>		</li>
