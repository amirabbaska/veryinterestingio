			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a <a href="https://goo.gl/images/HQX4BH" target="_blank">sponge test engineer</a>. There are many ways sponges can degrade, but since this is ELI5, I'll stick to one main method.</p>
<p>Sponges have a few main parts: the sponge (negative), the not-sponge (positive), a separator between them, and some stuff in between (usually a liquid) that conducts <a href="https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/c_limit,w_680/fl_lossy,pg_1,q_auto/sponge_t4pngp.jpg" target="_blank">sponge-worthiness</a>. When you charge a sponge, you are cramming a whole bunch of liquid molecules into the sponge, kind of like absorbing lithium ions into the anode of lithium batteries. When you use the sponge, these liquid molecules flow to the non-sponge, generating a puddle. Over time, by cramming the liquid molecules in and out of the sponge and not-sponge, you begin to damage the 'lithium battery', so it can't hold as many liquids molecules any more. So your efficiency goes down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably a lot of reasons. I'm not a PhD level researcher but I did some research as an undergrad.</p>
<p>Edit: it has to do with Li reacting with other parts of the battery and therefore not being able to interact with the electron transport anymore</p>
<p>The &quot;sponge&quot; is a highly organized crystal structure with pockets, kind of like a honey comb. These structures may not be the most energetically favorable states, and if the temperature goes outside normal range the honey comb shape could crumble into a more energetically favorable state.</p>
<p>I suspect their could also be issues with the different charges between the Li and the honey comb also but I'm less sure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the worst thing is deep discharge. Discharging until the protection circuit turns the battery off is bad. Leaving it lying around in this state until self-discharge further harms the battery is even worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The worse is to leave it fully discharged for a long time.</p>
<p>The second worse is to deep cycle them on a regular basis.</p>
<p>For lithium, the cutoff is 3V, at this point the device should turn off (many don't). At 2.75V the protection circuit should kick in and disconnect the battery. At 2.5V the protection circuit will permanantly disable the battery (prevent any more charge). The battery is now dead.</p>
<p>From what I know, bellow 2.5V there is some crystals that can form inside the cell, and pierce the insulation between the electrodes, causing a short. That damage can happend at any time, which is often when the battery is charged.. When that happend, the short cause lots of heat, which decompose the.. I beleive the electrolyte, which cause the oxygen contained in it to be separated (due to the decomposition). And eventually it reach a temperature high enought to ignite the lithium. Now it have some available oxygen... And it burn. That burning cause more decomposition, so more oxygen to be available, which allow more lithium to burn...</p>
<p>And this is why lithium battery fire are so serious: burning lithium is very hot, and the battery generate it's own oxygen. It is then basically impossible to extinguish. All you can do is do dammage control and watch it burn. Which is a big issue in an aircract, specially with the aircraft control wires that is close to the luggage/cargo... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm the real world effects of this. I have a 3 ryobi 18v li-ion batteries. Avoiding the protection cut off is near impossible on the job. I had 4 when I first got them, I ran two till they quit and didn't charge them right away. They refused to charge. I was able to revive one but the other was dead. I charge batteries regularly now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both high and low charge will degrade it, as well as high or low temperatures.</p>
<p>Ideally you would keep it at 60-70 % charge at all times, or actually just keep it at exactly 65% always and only in room temperature. That kind of means you can't actually use it though. But avoiding discharging it to less than say 20% and charging it to more than 80% is more realistic and will also significantly increase it's life, likely doubling its effective life. This is exactly what many car manufacturers do for plug in hybrid vehicles to extend the battery life.</p>
<p>Also, don't charge it faster than necessary, as this generates heat that degrades it. E.g. for an overnight charge you would ideally charge it so slow that it's just reached 80% or so when you unplug it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the fast charging it is... only half true. In a Tesla car, it's actually better for the battery to supercharge than slow charge. The reason for this is because of the TIME exposed to heat.</p>
<p>The car has enough cooling to keep it within a good temperature during a supercharging cycle. So the time exposed is very minimal. Even though it gets warmer than normal charging, the degradation is actually even less because if you slow charge, the buildup of these degradation materials add up more than supercharging over time.</p>
<p>A phone is a different story. A phone doesn't have active thermal management, so it's always better to slow charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern lithium-ion batteries are pretty well designed to take care of themselves.  You don't have to worry about overcharging or anything like that now.  Basically, don't let the battery get too hot or too cold (room temp is best).  If it were practical it would be best to keep your battery charged to maybe 60 to 80% but since that's not easy, especially with built-in batteries, try not to cycle it anymore than necessary (keep your phone/laptop plugged in as much as possible).  A few times a year you'll want to drain the battery and charge it back up so that the software can calibrate itself to give a more accurate state of charge [percentage] and how long you can use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting you say about leaving a laptop plugged in, as that seems to be the thing that ruins the battery the quickest, for me.</p>
<p>I used to use a laptop plugged in at work for 12 hours a day, and the battery would be quite hot throughout that time. After a year or so, the battery would only hold 20 minutes of charge, and eventually wouldn't even turn the laptop on anymore.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's the constant 100% battery, or if it's because the laptops had their batteries get hot. Either way, the batteries were ruined after leaving the laptops plugged in.</p></div>		</li>
