<p>“The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, &quot;Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?&quot; And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, &quot;Hey, don't worry; don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.&quot; And we … kill those people. &quot;Shut him up! I've got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.&quot; It's just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it doesn't matter, because it's just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to write this all out! I have major depressive disorder and whenever therapists ask me if I have suicidal ideation, I always respond with &quot;not really, I just feel like I don't want to exist&quot;. &quot;Casually suicidal&quot; is a great way to summarize that feeling, ha.</p>
<p>I have my next therapist appointment in less than an hour, so seeing this post is helping me get in the right mindset for that. Something I've been struggling with recently is that even though I've been doing everything &quot;right&quot; (eating well, sleeping well, exercising well, surrounding myself with positive people that I like, meditating, practicing gratitude, etc.), I've still been sinking into a depressive episode for the past two weeks. This made me pause though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real bitch of mood disorders caused by chemical imbalance is that the negative mood can <em>sometimes be brought on by being otherwise good to yourself.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like, maybe my body just isn't at all used to all this ~positive mental activity~ and I tired out my dopamine channels. Either way, this is a good takeaway:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A bad mood does not equal a bad person.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like I needed that. Sorry that this is kind of all over the place.</p>
<p>Thank you again, so much, for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Today I found out that I'm casually suicidal. Great way to put it. This thread came at a very opportune time for me as I have just had a huge cry. It seemed like it happened for no reason at first, but I know that it stemmed from my number one problem - feeling lonely. Thank you for this, I'm going to drink some water and take a shower now (the easiest things to do). </p></div>		</li>
