			<div class="markdown"><p>That I couldn't give you a confident answer on. Having used a tire balancing machine that spins tires around at high speeds, they definitely get warm. so, I would think that it contributes, but the friction between the tire and the ground would be far greater than the air in the tires. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it only within the scope of aerodynamics that air is considered a fluid?  I had to google that as it was the first I had heard of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluid describes anything that can flow.</p>
<p>Liquids are the obvious one, but all gases are considered fluids.</p>
<p>Fine powders can also be modelled as fluids to some extent, and even crowds of people share many properties with fluids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insofar as aerodynamics is the study of air's behavior, but it's a fluid no matter how you slice it. All gasses are, they're just considered compressible, whereas water is considered incompressible..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So oceanic-transportation can't use aerodynamics, and hydrodynamics would be used..</p>
<p>And, if I built a chamber where the medium was entirely... say flowable iron(under appropriate temp. and press.), i'd need to create ferrodynamics... heheheh ;)</p></div>		</li>
