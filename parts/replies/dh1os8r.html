<p>But the gov. figured out that by regulating the down-payment rate, they could save themselves from a disaster, and shield obviously underfunded people from buying property.</p>

<p>Has this had the same effect as the UK where it pushes more young people into renting while they try and save the larger deposit, but this in turn pushes up rents which makes it harder / impossible to save?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that has been one of the side effects. But interest rates have been at a historic low, which in turn has made lending money much more accessible, if you already have some money/collateral to start with. People have been able to take out very high loans, which has driven the price up much, much faster than salaries. </p>
<p>They just recently implemented the 5 times annual salary limit, which effectively hammered down the last nail for young people, or poor people. Simply put: If you don't earn enough, you have to compensate by paying a larger down-payment. So instead of the 15% down-payment, some people have to save up 30% to 40% in down-payment, simply because the 5 x annual salary is much, much lower than the loan needed. </p>
<p>Now, that rule was implemented to regulate the out-of-control prices, and hopefully prices will either calm down, or reverse a bit. That would sadly mean that people who overpaid are going to lose money, but it also means that regular people can get access to housing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thing is, the average starting salary in Norway is about 450k ( according to DnB). So If you have 2 people with an average starting (!) salary you are already looking at the possibility of getting a loan around 4.5M Of course you can't get that far with that in Oslo, but even just 30 min outside of Oslo that will get you some might finy houses.</p>
<p>So unless you want to have something in Oslo (center) then 5*the combined average starting pay of 2 people should be more than enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Overall, an excellent scheme for redistributing wealth from the poor to the rich, and the people that grew up in the country to the people from the cities.</p></div>		</li>
