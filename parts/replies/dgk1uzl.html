			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to say (at least from a scientific perspective!). However, Einstein did publish work on prolific and very basic topics in physics that have been used for a broad range of applications: for instance, the photoelectric effect and relativity. Relativity theories also truly changed our thinking (in physics and philosophically) about how the basic ideas of light and gravity work. While there have been many scientists that were great out-of-the-box thinkers, Einstein's published work was very influential in that it brought an orthogonal line of thinking to knowledge of these topics at the time.</p>
<p>Of course, he was also a bit of a goofball. Everyone loves a serious thinker with a funny bone.</p></div>		</li>
