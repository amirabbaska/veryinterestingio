Some examples are that O group is protective against cholera but more susceptible to H Pylori, A group is protective against smallpox, some other blood factors matter for noroviruses, malaria etc.</p>
<p>With modern sanitation and vaccination such issues aren't terribly important any more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About as much as behind astrological signs. It's mostly nonsense.</p>
<p>Blood types correlate with some digestive tract infections, so if you wanted to force it, you could probably find some minimal correlations.</p>
<p>And likewise, people born in different seasons would traditionally have more or less food available, so you could probably find some marginal correlations between astrological sign and health.</p>
<p>If you want something more interesting about genetics and food, <a href="https://www.23andme.com/" target="_blank">just get yourself sequenced</a>, some genes correlate with metabolism of alcohol, caffeine and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is completely correct. Blood types relate to the antigens which are present on the surface of red blood cells. The adaptive immune system only comes into play because it is what makes some blood types incompatible with some people as some people's immune systems (eg those with O blood types) haven't learned not to attack cells displaying the A and/or B antigen. </p>
<p>The key evolutionary advantage of different blood types probably doesn't relate to the different antibodies people with different blood types are able to produce because we already produce billions and billions of different antibodies. The fact O blood type people can produce anti-A and anti-B antibodies isn't likely to make a whole lot of difference in the vast and complex scale of the immune system. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the advantage has been shown to lie with the way different infectious agents interact with the red blood cells depending on whether the A or B antigens are present or not. For instance, O blood type has an advantage in Africa where a lot of malaria is present because infected cells without the A and B antigens will not stick to other infected cells as readily and therefore the infection cannot spread as easily. On the other hand the reverse may be true with other diseases. </p>
<p>So I think the different blood types came about more due to the different ways the RBC interact depending on what antigens are present, and the way this affects resistance or susceptibility to different diseases. This isn't anything to do with the immune system, although it does affect our susceptibility to diseases</p></div>		</li>

<p>Genes related to immune system are among the most rapidly evolving ones, blood groups are just one of many such genes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand where you're coming from. I just don't think that genetic variation leading to different cell surface antigens with resistance to certain diseases counts as part of the immune system. You wouldn't say that sickle cell anemia is part of the immune system but it is virtually the same thing as it is a genetic variation which evolved to be prevalent in high malaria regions due to the resistance it provides against malaria. </p>
<p>I agree with everything you said in your original comment aside from the first sentence. Instead I would have said &quot;blood types have a role in disease resistance&quot;.</p>
<p>Now that I write that out I realise I was being a bit nitpicky and probably shouldn't have commented in the first place but now that I have I thought I should explain my reasoning.</p></div>		</li>
