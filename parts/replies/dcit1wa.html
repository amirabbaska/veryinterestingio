<p>So you wouldn't be able to see the Sun (or any other stars) whilst looking behind you.</p>

<p>Though you would be able to see solar UV light which is likewise red-shifted down into the visible spectrum.  With your z=1400, blue to red would n reality be far-UV of about 0.28-0.43 nm wavelength.  Which is really bordering on X-rays, and the sun is several orders of magnitude less bright in that area, but it's still visible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. There's just no way to speed up past the speed of light, it's somewhat similar to the fact that there is no way to rotate your left hand so that it looks like your right hand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that photons don't experience time gives some people pseudosciency ideas. All it really means is that we can't label the changes in a photon's position in space-time with a (proper) time. You can still label each part of a photon's path with some other parameter. It still does travel at finite speed.</p></div>		</li>
