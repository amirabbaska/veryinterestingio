			<p>The problem with glass blades is that they're too hard. They may have an extremely sharp cutting edge but it will break very easily on anything harder than a well done steak. Aztecs had a weapon that was a wood cricket bat edged in obsidian shards. while effective against unarmored meso Americans, the glass weapons shattered against the armored Spaniards.<br><br>In knife making the blade is hardened so that it keeps an edge, but then it's softened somewhat (called tempering). This adds enough flexibility to make the blade resilient while keeping enough hardness to keep an edge.<br><br>In the case of cutting someone in half take a traditional katana. These blades were tested by cutting pig corpses. They're so good at this because the blade is made with two different kinds of steel. A high carbon steel is used on the edge so it keeps a razor edge. Then the spine of the blade is made from a low carbon steel that's flexible. So you have a really flexible blade that can deform without breaking with a razor sharp edge.</p>		</li>
