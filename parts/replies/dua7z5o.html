			<div class="markdown"><p>No one single reason. Basically, it’s just that it’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>really old, so a lot has been lost with time</li>
<li>superseded/supplanted by the Romans, so a lot of stuff was just lived on/used up</li>
<li>pre-paper, so what we have are mostly short and repetitive inscriptions - names of Gods, that sort of thing. There exists no literature or original texts</li>
<li>potentially a language isolate, which makes comparison difficult</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, the last known speaker of the language was the Emperor Claudius, who was something of an antiquarian and historian prior to being unexpectedly made Emperor. He wrote a 20-volume history of the Etruscan peoples, and a dictionary of the language, although both have since been lost. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to u/whistleridge's response, another thing is that translation doesn't work like laypeople (especially media) seems to think it does. You more or less <em>can't</em> get a translation without <em>already having one</em>. For living languages, this comes from people you can interact with - I can point to a rock or mimic sleeping to try and get words for those things, and eventually be at a place where I have the vocabulary to ask about nuances of meaning or get clarifications.</p>
<p>For dead languages, though, you pretty much <em>need</em> a bilingual text to get you started. Linguists can also try comparing with already-known languages to see if things happen to line up, and if they do can sometimes deduce <em>some</em> meaning that way. However, there's plenty of problems with words that aren't directly translated - see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon" target="_blank">hapax legomenon</a>, where even in known languages a word may be unknown in meaning, because we only have a single recorded instance of it.</p>
<p>So without <em>some</em> kind of external source for what something means, it's impossible to translate.  For example, if I give you the sentence &lt;daeklet ufkunis iŋlo'sat ŋoqo&gt;, no one would ever be able to deduce what it means from just that. I could give you dozens of examples, a novel, an entire library. It has a working grammar, but it's ultimately something I made up, and without some kind of context to get things started it wouldn't be possible to actually translate. Best-case, someone who knows what they're doing would be able to pick out <em>some</em> of the morphology and syntax, but nearly 100% of lexical words and the vast majority of grammatical words you wouldn't be able to determine the meaning of.  You <em>need</em> bilingual texts that more-or-less spell out exactly what the words means in order to get anywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easier. It was invented by two Byzantine monks, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Cyril_and_Methodius?wprov=sfti1" target="_blank">Saints Cyril and Methodius</a> circa 850 CE. They based it on the Greek uncial script, and so adopted the same ordering as that alphabet. </p>
<p>The fun question is, how do languages like Chinese, that don’t have an alphabet, organize things without alphabetical order? I have a broad idea, but I’d love to hear a more detailed response from someone in the know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their dictionaries are mostly sorted by stroke number. The symbols are drawn in a specific order, with a specific number of lines. If you need to look up a symbol, you count the lines and look in the appropriate section of the dictionary. </p>
<p>I don't exactly know how symbols with the same stroke count are sorted. I think they break the symbol down into parts, or radicals. One of those radicals will have higher priority, so you sort symbols with the same stroke count by the stroke count of their highest priority radical. </p></div>		</li>
