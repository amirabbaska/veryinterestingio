<p>But not necessarily, for example, Neanderthal and human overlapped and may have interacted with each other. And if we go back thousands  of years (or a couple of millions or so) there might be  Homo like homo habilis and homo erectus that looked very different and couldve interacted with each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the original poster, but I can expand a little. Group membership is often thought of as &quot;in-group&quot; (people associated and similar to you) and &quot;out-group&quot; (people not associated with you/dissimilar to you). What this means can vary over time, but race would be an example. The reason why the more generic word &quot;group membership&quot; is used is because there is some learning involved in determining what the important &quot;groups&quot; of people are and how to recognize them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/98/26/15387.long" target="_blank">Cosmides</a> and colleagues theorized that judging people's race was not an automatic biological process but more likely a specific expression of a more generic system used to detect whether someone was part of your &quot;group&quot; (or coalition in their words). Basically, the authors argue that we automatically try to figure out whether someone is an ally/trustworthy/part of our group and the characteristics we pay attention to in order to figure that out can be changed through learning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you or does anyone else know if there's a disorder characterized by an inability to identify gender? Considering all of the various neuroses, delusions, etc. that we know to be symptomatic of an injury to specific parts of the brain, I wonder whether cases in which one can't tell the difference between genders (if there are any) point to an answer regarding whether the ability to do so is inherent or learned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>any social group: your village, your country, race, even immediate family or football team. no matter what it is, one tends to naturally develop an &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; mentality.  this also suggests that one's social identity is heavily dependent on a person's perceived group membership, giving pride, self-esteem, and a sense of &quot;belonging&quot;. any group that you belong in is an &quot;ingroup&quot; and conversely, any you don't is an &quot;outgroup&quot;. Donelson R. Forsynth's &quot;Group Dynamics&quot; is partially available <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=RsMNiobZojIC&amp;pg=PA422&amp;dq=ingroup+outgroup+bias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz_eutz-rRAhXBxFQKHZ69COEQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ingroup%20outgroup%20bias&amp;f=false" target="_blank">free on google books</a>. I linked a section that is mostly complete if you want a quick run down that ties ingroup/outgroup bias into ethnocentrism.</p></div>		</li>
