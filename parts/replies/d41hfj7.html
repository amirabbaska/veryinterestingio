			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most common type of ice, formed by cooling water below 0 degrees C at atmospheric pressure, yes.  But the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/700px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">full phase diagram of ice</a> is substantially more crowded than the simple <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Phase-diag2.svg" target="_blank">three-line phase diagram</a> you might remember from high school, and some specific phases of ice, such as Ice-VII, Ice-IX (no relation), Ice-X, and Ice-XI exist at higher pressures than an equivalent mass of liquid water (and are hence more dense than liquid water).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's due to the way ice crystals form, there are all different types of ice depending on conditions.  actually a very interesting topic!</p></div>		</li>
