			<div class="markdown"><p>It was more about the infrastructure, and even then it was really about sending a message.  If the goal had been to turn the facility and as much equipment as possible into a giant smoking crater they could have done that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an episode of Arrow where they use the suicide squad to infiltrate an embassy and they target the building with a drone carrying a hellfire missile. They are talking about how the entire embassy with get blown up from this one missile. Ignoring the chase scene at the end with the middle twisting and turning while still burning. </p>
<p>No. No. No. it is an armor penetrating warhead designed to take out tanks. It is relatively small. They had issues using it to begin with killing personnel in soft targets before the fragmentation elements were added. </p>
<p>Cruise missiles are in the same boat. Small precise warhead. Designed to take out high value soft targets like radar or a small building. And EXPENSIVE!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought about that but do jets have constant repairs after use? Maybe they could not just put shit back together, hiding in bunker is quicker than putting the engine back in the tank or getting them on flatbeds when you only have an hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.  Much of the materiel <em>was</em> evactuated.</p>
<p>The purpose of the attack was not to kill 1,000s and destroy everything.  It was entirely symbolic and achieved it's aims.</p>
<p>&quot;The USA has the capability to strike you, and are willing to do so.&quot;</p>
<p>If they had wanted to kill everyone and destroy everything, they very easily could have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how was it worth $90 million with that outcome? I'm not saying death and destruction have to feel worth it, but that's roughly the cost of the missiles and id love to know the strategic thinking behind that calculation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theory is that this sends a very strong message to the government of Syria (and other countries) that they had better not use any more poison gas. This small attack -- with a courteous early warning -- was surprisingly easy for the USA to accomplish, and clearly a larger and more destructive attack would be feasible.</p>
<p>If by spending $90 million we can save the lives of thousands of civilians in the future, and/or prevent the need for a much larger attack, it was a bargain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. To be fair, this was a special case, because there were Russian personnel and equipment in the area, and the USA is taking  special precautions not to accidentally attack Russia's military.</p></div>		</li>
