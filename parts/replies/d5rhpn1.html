			<div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally, now you've swapped the word to bugs and while not incorrect from a layman's perspective, at a level of scientific semantics, &quot;bug&quot; refers to the hemipterans. Hemipterans, or the &quot;true bugs&quot; are a group of largely shield-shaped insects with piercing mouthparts like the stinkbugs and cicadas, plus many more.</p></div>		</li>
