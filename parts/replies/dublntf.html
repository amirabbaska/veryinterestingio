			<div class="markdown"><p>Most hearing aids are designed to pick up magnetic fields so you can use a Tcoil. This was originally designed so you could use a phone with a hearing aid but a lot of auditoriums and churches have an inductive sound loop so people with hearing aids get direct sound from the pa system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's not as good as having good hearing, and many audio engineers don't know how to mix or use it well (most of the time the house mix is optimized for the speakers and accoustics of the room, which is also why live recordings usually suck)  but it is usually better than using the microphones in the hearing aids, especially if you don't have noise reduction aids. The newer, more expensive aids have multiple microphones and mimo filters that can adjust the pickup patterns of the mics to focus on speech sounds  and reject other noise.</p></div>		</li>
