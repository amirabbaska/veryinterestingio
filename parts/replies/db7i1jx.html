			<div class="markdown"><p>My post was sort of based on anecdotal evidence so after your response I decided to do a little bit further research. I'm hesitant to totally dismiss the role of musculature in posture but for the most part the papers I looked at seemed to lean more towards your answer (which honestly surprised me). I didn't spend all that much time, but I couldn't find anything directly supporting the points I made, nor did I read anything directly refuting your points. I'm gonna go ahead and say this probably the better answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But yes, muscles are an integral part of it, you are right about that.</p></div>		</li>
