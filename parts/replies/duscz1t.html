			<div class="markdown"><p>You're looking at it one layer too shallow.  A signature doesn't prove that I'm me at all.  Anybody could sign a reasonable approximation of my signature.</p>
<p>What it does prove is that someone who is <em>claiming</em> to be me is standing in front of the register at the store. If it turns out not to be me, now there's another element of fraud.  Not only are they accessing money they don't have a right to access, they're pretending to be someone who does have access.  That seems like a subtle difference, but it it legally significant.  For one thing, it's hard to argue that it was all some kind of mistake when you commit that kind of intentional fraud.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is mostly the function of signatures on legal documents too.  It doesn't prove that <em>I</em> agreed to anything, but it does prove that someone <em>claiming to be me</em> was present and agreed to whatever.  It prevents me from coming back later and trying to say that I didn't agree to the terms I signed to, but doesn't prevent a claim that someone else pretended to be me.</p>
<p>In a legal context, you can add notarization for another layer of verification.  That's when a trusted third party with some kind of certification from the state, a notary public, verifies everyone's identity and adds their seal to the document saying everyone is who they say they are.</p>
<p>On cards, if you actually want to verify identity and agreement, you can use a PIN.  In theory, no one else should be able to enter your PIN even if they somehow steal your card.  The US hasn't transitioned to PIN and chip cards, due to concerns about complexity partially, but they probably should.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably why most countries don't ask for signatures. I think the US is the only place I've ever been asked for one (in recent memory), and I was baffled as my card issuer doesn't have a copy of my signature and the check out assistant didn't look at the signature on the card, so there was otherwise definitely nothing to compare it to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Wait, how do you know that guy is actually the owner of that card?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't you see! He signed it. Duh&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And where is the signature of the owner?&quot;</p>
<p>... &quot;I think you may be onto something.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They only look at them if there is trouble.  Some terminals won't accept my &quot;doctor's signature&quot; and I have to draw a little smiley face afterwards to meet their requirements for complexity.  My dad once wrote &quot;fuck&quot; instead of his signature after getting fed up with a persnickety self-checkout machine.</p></div>		</li>
