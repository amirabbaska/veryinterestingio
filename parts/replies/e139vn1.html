			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically when raindrops impact dry, porous surfaces, tiny bubbles are produced which launch droplets containing bacteria and organic matter into the air. These droplets and the aerosols they form are what's lofted by the wind and carries the smell with it. A paper came out of MIT a few years ago about this phenomena.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, for a double whammy, the air becomes more humid, making you more receptive to scents. (I believe this is because the particles making up the scent bunch together on the water vapor so they're more concentrated, but I can't find a confirmation of this.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hu, if true its not so much getting wet that makes you sick (from being in the rain, wives tale with truth?), its getting wet with water that has bounced off the ground and now contains and aerosol of bacteria/viruses/etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the word is constructed from “petra” (stone) and “ichor” (blood of the Greek gods). I’m a plant ecophysiologist and I can’t tell you how much that smell excites me after a long dry season. </p></div>		</li>
