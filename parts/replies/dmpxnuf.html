			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. Whiplash brain injuries have not been seen in humans in accelerative loading without a blunt impact (head doesnt hit anything inside the car). Trying to brace yourself will actually just increase the accelerations your brain is subjected to. Also, copy-pasting from my response above:</p>

<p>Cars safety systems are designed using a combination of dummy tests, cadaver tests, and finite element tests, none of which have muscle tone, so attempting to move differently will not help you.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That didn't sound right to me either. I've always understood whiplash injuries in those circumstances to be about the neck and shoulder muscles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah. Whiplash brain injuries are mostly theoretical in humans because IIRC, they have been seen in some animal tests, but not in humans, but there is a good deal of angular acceleration, so it's not unreasonable to say it's possible to occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also incorrect to describe brain injuries as the brain impacting the skull, as this isn't the case, there is certainly a transfer of force from the skull to the brain, but there is no impact as such. Instead brain injuries have been linked to increased strain (stretching or squashing) of the brain tissue.
This explains why you are more likely to knock someone out by hitting them on the chin or nose (coming across the face) than in the forehead </p>
<p>Edit:stress not strain, although I'm not sure that it makes a practical difference
Edit 2: I did it again STRAIN not STRESS</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, yet another challenge in our field is that legislation for brain injury prevention stuff is only based on straight linear impacts directly to the forehead. Of course a super hard hit to the forehead that breaks your skull will be devastating, but that's not most brain injuries.</p>
<p>Also, small nit-pick. They are mostly due to strain, not stress, which is an important distinction in engineering. Strain is defined as change in length/original length (so your stretching or squashing is right), and stress is force over an area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diffuse axonal injury is caused by rapid deceleration, no? Is that the &quot;whiplash brain injury&quot; you were referring to? Does the head have to strike something for DAI to occur? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>basically, there havent been documented cases of the brain being injured without the head ever hitting anything. I'm not exactly sure why, but it could be because the amount of acceleration necessary to hurt your brain that way could possibly snap your neck, but that's just speculation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Your brain moves inside of your skull. This can injure you. The acceleration deceleration can impact your insides too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way this was explained to me in the military is that there are usually three impacts in a force trauma: whatever you're in hitting the thing you hit (car hitting car), your body hitting the thing you are in (you hitting the seatbelt, or the car if no seatbelt), and your organs hitting your body (brain sloshing, everything else moving). </p>
<p>Helped me understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, seems to make sense. Even if there's no brain injury like others are saying, your organs still slosh about inside you like a bag full of raw meat. Mostly because, well, we <em>are</em> bags of raw meat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know why drunk drivers are usually the ones to survive car crashes then? I also heard that going limp was better on impact and drunk drivers tend to survive more often than the sober people they crash into because they don't tense up fast enough due to being drunk. I've also heard that sleeping people have a higher chance of survival in a car crash for pretty much the same reason- no time to tense up. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I am  curious as well because it seems skewed in the drunks' favor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current belief is that ethanol inhibits some biochemical pathways that can disturb healing and thereby can be protective in a one-time dose. The exact pathways are being studied so that we may better understand the phenomenon and perhaps use ethanol to improve survivability of trauma patients. Keep in mind, chronic alcoholics have significantly worse trauma outcomes than normal people though, and this is mostly due to poor liver function.</p></div>		</li>
