			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer to why the current method of lethal injection has so many problems, but there is also the question of why this method at all. Lethal injection generally uses three drugs: one to sedate the inmate, one to paralyze muscles (mainly for the benefit of the audience as the executions sometimes go badly and the person writhes around in pain), and one to stop the heart. Obviously, there are easier and more direct ways to do it that would not be terribly cruel. Injecting morphine until their heart stops likely wouldn't be unpleasant, and if the drug companies threaten to stop supplying that, just use fentanyl from the evidence locker. (Nitrogen asphyxiation would be another painless option, but the point is that if you wanted lethal injection there are other ways to do it.)</p>
<p>However, I believe one of the rules is that the drugs can only be used for their intended purpose. While there are many ways to kill a person by using drugs outside of guidelines, you aren't allowed to do that. As a result, we get this odd workaround that kills a person while technically using all the medications as directed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;benefit of the audience&quot; is the whole reason that the US used these methods in the first place.</p>
<p>A properly performed long drop hanging or bullet to the head would be a quick and painless death to the condemned criminal. The problem of course is that we know that there is a far greater psychological effect on the executioner with methods like bullet to the head (the few US firing squads use the &quot;three rifles, two blanks, one bullet, aim at the chest&quot; method), and hanging in the US has the stigma from centuries of lynching innocent people (almost always african american).</p>
<p>A quick browse through the list countries with the death penalty on wikipedia seems to show that, outside the US, it is pretty much just hanging and firing squad. (which also brings us back to the lack of market for an execution specific drug lab)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of the countries that even allow for the death penalty. Most developed countries have abolished it for a variety of reasons, such as the horrors of state sanctioned killings in WW2. &quot;To benefit the audience&quot; is a strange point to bring up, since isn't that person's death supposedly suppose to &quot;benefit the audience&quot;? One of the problems people are leaving out about death penalties in the US too is that who gets the death penalty for what crime and who doesn't is pretty much random.
<a href="https://works.bepress.com/john_donohue/87/" target="_blank">https://works.bepress.com/john_donohue/87/</a>
So it's hard to argue that this person's death is objectively &quot;more&quot; beneficial to people than this other person. And deciding that someone deserves to die, that the state is allowed to kill them, just to emphasize, is a pretty big deal. A lot of people here are kind of understating this fact, as if everyone who gets the death penalty is absolutely deserving of it and any effort to ensure that they are killed humanely or that they have a degree of protection is an annoyance. </p>
<p>It's hard to assure a &quot;quick and painless&quot; and not cruel death by gun shots to the head or hangings, or to be honest by literally any method. There are times when someone doesn't quite die from a hanging (rope breaks, doesn't get tight enough, too long too short, etc) or times when people survive a gun shot wound to the head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only correct answer. The US lost access to the induction agent thiopental (UK manufacturer) in 2010 because it was used in lethal injections.  The Italian manufacturer of propofol, now our most widely used induction agent, threatened a US embargo if it was used for lethal injections. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The events you mention both happened in 2010. But we have examples of botched lethal injections going back to the 80's and 90's.</p>
<p><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/some-examples-post-furman-botched-executions" target="_blank">https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/some-examples-post-furman-botched-executions</a></p>
<p>Additionally, the US also uses gas chamber and electrocution rarely. According to the above page, these methods have botch rates of 5.4% and 1.9% respectively without requiring drugs or doctors - lower than lethal injection's 7.12% but by no means insignificant when we are talking about killing people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First guess is that it would start rumors of the state to kill someone for the purpose of getting to their organs. Though it does sound like a sci-fi movie premise. Second guess would be reliability of organs from someone who lived that lifestyle and then was given a lethal amount of painkillers would be low. Some would no doubt be unwilling to give blood and tissue samples beforehand to aid the process of finding a suitable donor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) ethically bad to take organs from an unwilling donor. a violation of all ethical medical principles in the US and no medical professional could ever take part in it in any capacity.
2) there have been cases where someone on death row wanted to donate his organs but this was not allowed. The whole issue of killing someone, then taking their organs, even with their consent, is ethically bad--the donation is tainted by the killing, because it's impossible to get away from the idea that they may have been killed in order to take their organs. Like, so and so needs an organ now, they're a match, let's move up the execution.  Or, I know that lots of nice, good, deserving people need organs, so why not dispose of even more of these murderers and rapists and kidnappers because their life has no value and these other people's lives have a lot of value. There is extensive evidence that China has killed tens of thousands of people for their organs, many of whom are basically political prisoners who have not committed anything we'd consider a crime.  The US medical community wants no part of anything that resembles that. In fact there s a major ethical dilemma today--a patient who needs an organ in the US but who is low down on the transplant list suddenly shows up at their doctor's office with a transplanted organ and without details on where they got it from. Should the doctor treat that patient? Some won't.
3) no doctor would participate in organ harvesting of even willing donors if they're executed prisoners. A person has to be brain dead before their organs can be harvested, legally. They can't be killed via organ removal, they have to be dead before that. But, and here's something few realize: their body must be kept alive with life support equipment until their organs are harvested, or else the organs may be too damaged to use. So what would have to happen is that the patient would have to be rendered brain dead via an execution method at the prison, yet then afterwards transported to the hospital and hooked up to life support so that their organs can be harvested. This presents some unpleasant possibilities since they have to be rendered brain dead in a way that doesn't damage the rest of their body so that the transplant can still work. No drugs/poisons, no bullets, no electrocution. Hanging or garroting/strangulation might do it, but maybe not. Again, it would have to involve doctors in an uncomfortable amount of effort to make this person just dead enough but not too dead.
4) Given that people can be on death row for 20 years, and on average are on death row for something like 10 years, that timeline is too long to find matches and arrange things beforehand so there's not going to be any specific person the organ will be chosen for before the death.
5) Many transplant recipients may object to the source of the donation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Drug Companies who make euthanasia drugs <em>generally</em> add language to their contracts requiring that the drugs not be used for executions. That includes the ones that make drugs for putting animals to sleep.</p>
<p>Oklahoma tried using animal euthanasia drugs <em>once</em>. They mixed a lot of them together in high density. The guy survived, but really wished that he hadn't. I think his sentence actually got reduced after the botched job, on the basis of the botched execution being so much worse than death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you talking about the execution of Clayton Lockett? Yes, it was very botched, and likely excruciation to him. They did put a stop to it as a result, but by the time that message was sent, he had already died. They don't reduce sentences on the basis of botched executions.
