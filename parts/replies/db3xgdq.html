			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest I couldn't tell you for certain. I think it would generally be in time of dire need and emotional duress -not enough to stimulate adrenalin. We have plenty of adrenalin rushing through our bodies every day, it's one of the hormones responsible for waking us up. Also caffeine causes our pituitary gland to release a adrenalin and even some noradrenalin (epinephrin or norepinephrin). Upon some critical thought, I imagine that there are other factors at play  than when these probably few-in-a-lifetime events can trigger that level of power (though what they are, I couldn't tell you).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In light of this, do people who perform these sorts of feats come away with any ill effects? Obviously there would be a massive adrenaline crash, but what sort of long term physical damage would you expect from this sort of overexertion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your muscles aren't built to trigger all at once, and these limitations exist to prevent you from damaging them.  Also, in a heightened adrenaline state, your body diverts energy from other places (like your digestive tract and immune system), which can cause long term problems.  This is part of the reason being chronically stressed is extremely bad for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also is similar to weight-lifting, and maxing out.  When it comes to huge feats like what this girl did, you can <em>guarantee</em> that it won't be happening again soon - this one task drained everything out of her.  That's why 'maxing out' involves one rep, whereas the rest of your training involves much smaller weights but many repetitions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the strength limit got naturally selected out, or at least, among those who didn't have that limit, imagine one day, you try to lift something very heavy, and instead of not being able, you end up breaking several of your bones from it.</p></div>		</li>
