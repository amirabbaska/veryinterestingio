			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean this specifically for cameras though, I get 100% that I shouldn't look at it but every single website Ive seen says not to take photos with anything without a filter, and that just seems bizarre to me since I have plenty of photos with the sun in them with no damage to the camera.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking photos of the sun can probably damage your camera, I'm not sure.  </p>
<p>I have taken photos with my phone of the eclipse (from 2015) without issue.  </p>
<p>They probably mean if you use something without a digital display but rather a purely optical sight (and look through it), like on an SLR Camera, in that case you could literally burn your retina in seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the optical display makes sense to me but some sites directly address smartphones which seems like theyre reaching a bit imo. Maybe they meant zooming in with a telescope attachment/binoculars cause that would definitely fry the lens, but honestly I can't see how an eclipse would fry the camera more than a normal landscape photo (on a smartphone/digital display).</p>
<p>Thanks for the info though, if your phone was fine then mine probably will be too haha </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought you could look at an eclipse for like 30 seconds when it's in its totality with no protection and not damage your eyes. After those 30 seconds (or whatever the amount of time is) you need to put the glasses on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually that makes a lot of sense for an SLR or DSLR that I hadn't thought about, particularly older dslrs that can't use the screen as a viewfinder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can damage the internal camera sensors if you point your camera long enough at the sun. Depending on the lens you are using it can focus a large amount of damaging light onto the camera's light sensor. May not damage it completely but it's generally advised that if you are  imaging the sun for long periods you need to have a filter. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So for just quick snapshots of the scenery and a few closeups of the sun on a decent smartphone should be ok? I'm not planning on any superzooms or timelapses or anything, I just want to actually document it and be able to see it happening (even if it is in the corner of a digital screen for 10 seconds)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The light level during an eclipse isn't significantly different than under normal circumstances, except at totality, when it is fine to look directly at the eclipse. The light from the sun is too bright to look at directly regardless of your pupil dilation. The problem is that the sun is much more interesting to look at during an eclipse, so there is greater risk of people doing so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally an explanation! I used to stare at the sun as a child sometimes and had no lasting problems, so I've been wondering why the eclipse could blind me. I hadn't thought of how pupils work. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>
