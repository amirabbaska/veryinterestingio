<p>An L(i)PT: Rub a finger along your nose to pick up some oil and wipe it on your lips. Sounds gross, but that's the same oil that was meant to protect your lips, your nose is already too oily, it's free and always available.</p>
<p>A lot of these moisturizers (moisteners, really) just don't really do anything special, but people spend tons of money on them anyhow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! I remember learning this as a student naturalist when our instructor was showing us how a bow drill works and explained that nose grease was good for lubricating the point of contact between the board and the spindle. We all thought she was nuts but she was right, and insisted it was superior lip balm, too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me if I'm wrong, as I really have no idea what you're talking about. </p>
<p>Do you mean like trying to make a fire with a bow and a stick? If so, wouldn't it be best to have a lot of friction and to not use a lubricant? Or is the oil applied to a board above the stick used to apply downward pressure?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit 3 Some fellas with beards have mentioned not having as much trouble with chapped lips since growing said beard. I'd never even considered this until now (girl here, can't beard) but I would believe that the oils from your beard would make it to your lips and keep them moisturized and happy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beards and moustaches also provide some 'cover' for the lips from the elements, creating something of a microclimate that's a bit less dry and exposed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, it's kind of like the fur trim on a hood that creates a pocket of warmer, more humid air around the face. I don't know how well faux fur works (honestly I think it's more for show) but they say coyote fur is superior.</p></div>		</li>
