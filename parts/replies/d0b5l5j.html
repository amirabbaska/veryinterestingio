<p>People with 3-4MM in assets that are spending 150k a year don't understand how badly the depletion of 5% of your assets at the top of a market cycle will crush you at the bottom of the cycle unless you have significant cash reserves to weather the downturn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's a realistic scenario. In America, historically you can expect a 7% ROI (average including recession years), 2.5% inflation and a 15% capital gains tax rate if you just put in stocks. Which means that over a 30 year period where you have 3 kids say and you spend 1,000,000 a year in real dollars, your money will have increased in real amounts from $100,000,000 to $285,000,000</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2% is far from unreasonable.</p>
<p>Start at 7%</p>
<p>Lose tax of 1.05%</p>
<p>Lose inflation 2.5% (simplification,but good enough)</p>
<p>Lose 1% to pay the mutual fund. (Unless you are a finance major or very market savy, don't do it your self.</p>
<p>Now you are at 2.45%</p>
<p>That is close enough to work with his example. Reality will always be more complicated, but that is why we are here on this sub.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you invest in the S&amp;P 500 over 30 years, your annualized return is 7+% adjusted for inflation.  It's actually much higher if you don't adjust for inflation, closer to 10%. So again, 2% is overly conservative and you can essentially draw 3% without destroying any wealth over the long run.  </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>If you are paying 1% to someone to invest your money you are losing a lot.  It is very resonable to invest your own money if you abide by some really simple principles.</p>
<p>If you want a no effort approach (literally) just stick all your money in a target fund with low fees.  It'll follow the stock/bond market while keeping a balanced portfolio for your target date.</p>
<p>If you want a little more effort appraoch look for total market funds that are passive but follow the total market (becuase that is what it invests in) and choose the percentage of bonds/US stocks/foreign stocks that you want.</p>
<p>Look up Bogleheads investing for more details.  Don't play the market, invest in it with sound principles that anyone can understand and don't freak out during recessions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will concede that 2% is low, but I also think that CPI consistently under reports inflation. I chose the numbers I did because they were easy to do math with. I think $1million in expenses for someone with $100 million in net worth is fairly low (comparitively speaking, not objectively). I also originally included a bit about how a significant portion of wealth was tied up in unproductive, illiquid assets. Such as:</p>
<p>You buy a mansion for $20 million. The mansion is otherwise unproductive, and the capital gains on the mansion are completely offset by taxes and upkeep. Your children collectively inherit the mansion through a trust. Your children get along well and share the mansion, coming together for the holidays.</p>
<p>Their children, do not. Legal battles and infighting prevent the house from being sold, simultaneously funds for upkeep run out. The house falls into disrepair and loses substantial value. After hundreds of thousands in legal fees, the house is sold at a significant loss.</p>
<p>I felt like that distracted from my point so I removed it. My main point was that if a person consistently removes the long term expected return of an amount of money. i.e. a person expects 7% real return on investment, so removes 7% of the total each year, the money will deplete as the reductions in principle during recessions will create a negative over the long term. </p>
<p>Example:
I have $100 and know that long term I will get 7% so I remove $7 dollars each year. That $7 removal will have a disproportionate impact during recession years, and will eventually drive my net worth to zero. It's sorta a financial version of &quot;gambler's ruin.&quot;</p>
<p>Compound that with expanding generational size and fortunes are easily lost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People with fortunes of this size typically invest in municipal bonds. They have a lower ROI historically than stocks, but the wealthy prefer them because they are considered safe, less volatile, provide regular income from coupon payments, and the best part is that you typically don't pay federal and sometimes don't pay state taxes. </p>
<p>I'm not saying that they don't invest in stocks, because I know for a fact that they do, it's just that most will take a diversified approach with higher than normal concentrations in municipal bonds. </p></div>		</li>
