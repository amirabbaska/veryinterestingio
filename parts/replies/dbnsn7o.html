			<div class="markdown"><p>That number for the Giant Oarfish seems suspicious. 110 feet is 60 longer than any other number I can find and wikipedia says it can grow up to 36 feet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be wrong.  It was the first line in the link I provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The giant oarfish, which has been known to reach up to a whopping 110 feet (36 meters) long, is considered a deep-sea fish. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia may be more accurate than livescience!</p>
<p>I know a lot more about underwater volcanoes than deep sea fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One idea is that it is similar to how animals are larger in colder environments see <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1012336823275" target="_blank">Bergman's Principle</a>.</p>
<p>This is not demonstrated conclusively.  Too little is known of deep sea biology to say for certain.  It could be the &quot;feast or famine&quot; nature of food falls in the deep ocean, and the larger animals can withstand longer periods without food.  It may be the nature of reproduction, where millions of tiny larvae are required (as opposed to thousands) for reasonable fecundity.  Or, as Dr. Craig Young is studying, it could be more directly related to the pressure effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting stuff, Bergman's Principle. What I'm getting out of this basically boils down to this: For an organism to function as it's supposed to, as in: in the same way and equally well, its physical size has an inversely proportional relationship with the average entropy of its habitat. Am I on the right track here? From a common-sense perspective it would make sense. If you want an organism to 'do', process, metabolize, whatever-- the same amount in the same amount of time, it would need grow bigger as entropy decreases (less energy available, lower metabolism).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I vaguely remember hearing that it's because of the high amount of pressure and oxygen in the water that deep, but hopefully an expert of some kind can correct me because I'm not one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the detailed answer. This is just one of those things that amaze me how we have been to the moon , planning on going to Mars but yet have only explored 5 percent of the ocean. It's mind-boggling, not only because if the fact that it's an extremely tiny amount but also because of the fact of how much we do know about the ocean with only 5 percent, imagine what we would know if we discovered 20, 30 or even 100 percent </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To survive in space we need only build structures able to survive one atmosphere of pressure difference vs earth nominal (plus radiation etc.). Plus observation and communication in a vacuum are relatively simple.</p>
<p>In comparison, the deep ocean requires us to survive many many atmospheres of pressure difference, and while radiation isn't a problem, corrosion is, as is observation and communication.</p></div>		</li>
