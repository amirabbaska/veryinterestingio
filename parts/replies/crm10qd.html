			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually not true. The moving car is actually in static friction as long as the tires have traction with the ground. If the tires were sliding, then it would be kinetic friction, but rolling is a form of static friction, not kinetic. However, This impact has the potential to break static friction and make the car begin to skid. If that happened, the impact could be very serious and for the driver who was hit, it would be like suddenly driving onto a patch of ice and he or she would lose control of the car.
Ever watched auto racing? This exact scenario happens all the time and it has been known to result in lots of accidents</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But a car is not an example of rolling motion. In fact there is dynamic friction between car body elements and rotating parts (like axles etc) when the car is moving. When it's stopped there is still static friction to overcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually rolling wheels on the ground (assuming no slip) are always dealing with static friction. This is because the point on the wheel in contact with the ground is always stationary while it is contacting the ground.</p>
<p>Assuming the car that isn't moving has it's e-brake engaged, the car might budge forward a little bit without the wheels moving. In this slip condition, the wheel and the ground are experiencing kinetic friction when the wheels cannot spin, but the ground is moving relative to the stationary wheel.</p>
<p>Tl;dr Wheels experience their friction counterintuitively. Rolling wheels mean static friction and stationary wheels mean kinetic friction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I wanted to say, but my wording would not have been as accurate.</p>
<p>I was gonna say the car in motion would take less damage as it would just absorb the impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they both absorb the impact, but one transfers that energy into a deformed bumper while the other transforms it into an increase in speed.</p>
<p>I know this, I was just trying to simplifying it because the person above me already explained it perfectly. </p></div>		</li>
