<p>This is exactly what it is. </p>
<p>IIRC the tech will require that each user gives up like 10% of their phone to this new solution, but in return they get to use this <em>magical compression algorithm</em> on their phone for all of their personal files. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the routing would maybe somehow be decentralized? </p>
<p>Anyway, as someone with a little background in the technical subject matter, I decided a long time ago to stop asking questions and just <strong>let the underlying technology be a MacGuffin.</strong> There is just too much wrong with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, give the show a little bit of credit. There is so much they get right. They're allowed to invent an imaginary technology which, for all intents and purposes does obey internal logic and is miles ahead of any other depictions of tech on TV.</p>
<p>It's one of the funniest shows on right now and the respect they have for viewers who actually know things about the tech world is icing on the cake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the show. It's worth it, but it's sometimes hard to ignore &quot;Weissman scores&quot;, lossless compression for video/image optimization, and several other such things that are only noticed by someone with very niche knowledge (which makes me wonder how much outside of my sphere of deeper understanding is wrong)....</p>
<p><strong>But it's worth it</strong> because of the meaningful jokes they make about the business/social aspects of Silicon Valley, VCs, tech start-ups, incubators, personalities in technology, geek (sub)culture(s), etc.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Also, it's hard to believe someone as talented as Richard is supposed to prefer tabs over spaces. Just kidding. But not really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is exactly what you are supposed to do.  It is a means to an end, and it'll fail hilariously and be replaced with some other &quot;cool tech&quot; before the end of the season anyway.</p>
<p>The fact that it's so vague and people are throwing money at him is part of what is supposed to make it funny anyway.</p></div>		</li>
