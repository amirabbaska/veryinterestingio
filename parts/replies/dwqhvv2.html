			<div class="markdown"><p>that link doesn't mention the draw strength of those bows. since they can be cocked mechanically with tools, there's a much higher ceiling for distance. the problem is identifying the &quot;pound-for-pound&quot; distances. so with the bow's additional length on the string, there's some sort of ratio showing optimal distances within human capabilities of drawing the bow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you insinuating that english people from hundreds of years ago were significantly stronger than athletes of today? If anything I would think increased leisure time, as well as modern weight training and nutrition would make people of today stronger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the point was that an English longbowman would have been stronger than any given archer today, not that people today couldn't train to that level.</p>
<p>Modern bows just don't require it.  If you gave an English longbow to a modern Olympian they wouldn't be able to draw it (is what he's saying).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they trained from childhood to develop those specific muscle groups, then yes; athletes of today would absolutely be able to draw a 90+ lb bow hundreds of times in battle. The problem is, nobody does this. There is no market for intensively trained archers today, except for recreation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A longbow wouldn't do much against a  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ej3qjUzUzQg" target="_blank">decent quality plate mail</a>. Instead, the archers would go for the gaps or just stress the knights and disorient them on the battlefield. With overwhelming firepower this can have quite a psychological effect which might explain the large number of captured knights at Agincourt.</p></div>		</li>
