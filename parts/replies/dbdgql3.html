			<div class="markdown"><p>While none of the first stars have yet been found, there are good candidates for extremely metal-poor stars having been polluted by a single supernova! For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMSS_J031300.36-670839.3" target="_blank">Keller's star</a> has the lowest abundances of iron and calcium in any star, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDSS_J102915%2B172927" target="_blank">Caffau's star</a> has the lowest overall metallicity.</p>
<p>Concerning OP's question, the chemical composition of these stars can be compared to supernova models of the first stars, and generally indicates that they were 40-60 times the mass of the Sun. But, models of these supernovae are parametrized, and this is important. We don't know how exactly the supernova explosion happens, and instead use a simple piston-explosion model where the explosion energy is just a free parameter. It cannot be predicted, since the model doesn't explode on its own! <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07416" target="_blank">This analysis of Keller's star</a> shows that because of this, we can't actually pin down the mass of the first stars! Or, at least not in this particular case.</p>
<p>More massive first-generation stars should have exploded as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair-instability_supernova" target="_blank">pair-instability supernovae</a>. The problem then is that they produce such huge amounts of metals, which would enrich the interstellar medium too much. The stars that formed would be too metal-rich to be easily distinguished from stars which formed much later - e.g. thick disk stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible that first-generation stars are still around in the form of neutron stars or white dwarves? Can we examine neutron stars and white dwarves to determine their full age (not just when the original star died)? I know that if a star is small enough it can live for trillions of years, but we can't find any of those because their luminosity is so low. So could we examine the corpse of a first star instead (if we found one today)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with stellar remnants is that they give little information on their progenitor!</p>
<p>White dwarfs for example are the intert remnants of intermediate-mass stars. Inert, because the stellar evolution goes through hydrogen burning (leaving a helium core), helium burning (leaving a carbon/oxygen core), and possibly further burning up to neon. This progression depends on the central temperature and pressure of the star, which is a direct function of its mass. As the star is unable to further process the carbon/oxygen or oxygen/neon core, while the outer layers are ejected by winds.
The properties of the remnant will mostly indicate the mass of the progenitor, but not its composition since the production is mostly primary (i.e. independent of metallicity).
Furthermore, whatever hydrogen or helium remains in the white dwarf tends to diffuse toward the surface, so that even though it is composed almost entirely of carbon, oxygen and/or neon, the spectrum is entirely due to hydrogen or helium.</p>
<p>But, if we can measure the temperature and luminosity of the white dwarf, we can accurately determine its age. In stellar clusters, this is known as the white dwarf cooling sequence. The problem is that since the first stars were so very short-lived (3-10 million years, as indicated by /u/kagantx), the first and second generations of stars are really too similar in age to be distinguished today, after 13 billion years!
Additionally, I doubt we could identify whether a white dwarf of neutron star were the remnant of one of the first, metal-free stars, or from a later generation. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Please elaborate. I was taught the basic hydrogen stellar model should undergo supernova at high enough stellar mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know stellar evolution pretty well up until the core starts thinking about collapsing. The problem is that when this starts to happen, the ridiculous pressures also start making the core do some wonky sub-atomic stuff that is impossible to recreate in a lab and will be implausible to simulate directly for a long, long time. We generally get that something should go boom, but it can be very difficult to tell how exactly everything goes to shit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if my question is pretty basic, but I've been wondering how widely dispersed heavy metals are across the universe. It seems from your comment that you can distinguish stars with heavy metals and this with hydrogen and helium pretty easily.  I was just wondering if lack of heavy metals could prevent intelligent life from evolving on an otherwise habitable planet. Or is this too simplistic? Would there be other covarying factors preventing intelligent alien civilization? I know in our system heavy metals are abundant but I didn't know how homogenous they are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The general idea is that metals are created during the late stages of stellar evolution, and depending on mass are dispersed via winds (low-mass AGB stars and high-mass stars), and/or supernova events. These enrich locally, inside galaxies, so that the chemical enrichment of any galaxy is only due to its history of stars.</p>
<p>The amount of metals can be measured spectroscopically from star light, either from individual stars (in our own and nearby galaxies), or from the integrated galactic light.
In our galaxy, we're also able to detect whether stars host planets, and it seems like stars with higher metallicity are  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity#Star_metallicity_and_planets" target="_blank">indeed more likely to host giant jupiter-sized planets</a>.
Rocky planets are less massive, and thus require smaller amounts of metals to be present in the protoplanetary disk in order to form. Therefore, rocky planets are probably <em>not</em> more common in metal-rich systems, but are instead ubiquitous throughout the galaxy.</p>
<p>Whether this implies life is ubiquitous is a different question :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I don't think it's fair to say all stars had over 100 solar masses.
(this is really the paper and model I'm basing this on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0112088v1.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0112088v1.pdf</a>)</p>
<p>The large cloud around the star may have 100 solar masses, but not all that mass is accreted. A more realistic estimate is 30 solar masses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Stop thinking of the big bang as a supernova. Think of it more as expansion of space, with a lot of energy filling that space. In the immediate aftermath, some of that energy started to form fundamental particles like electrons and quarks. Through random collisions some of the quarks came together to form protons and neutrons. Through more random collisions, some of the protons came together with electrons to form hydrogen. More rarely, some neutrons got involved forming deuterium and tritium. Even more rarely, another proton got involved, forming helium. As time passed, space got larger and larger making collisions astronomically unlikely. The largest element probably produced in measurable quantity in the big bang was lithium.</p></div>		</li>
