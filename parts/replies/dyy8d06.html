			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this answer, in addition to males fighting to hold territory from other males, some solitary bees will defend their flowers from other species as well - I've seen Anthidium sp. (wool carder bees) do this and found a quick clip(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reYMWwBmTag" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reYMWwBmTag" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reYMWwBmTag</a></a>) of an Anthidium pulling a bumblebee off a flower. (For those unfamiliar with solitary bees: The majority of bee species are solitary bees (vs. eusocial bees like honeybees and bumblebees). There are thousands of species and they can vary from metallic blue and purple Osmia species, fuzzy gray Anthophora, to somewhat wasp-looking Anthidium - Sam Droge with the USGS has some beautiful photos of them (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/usgsbiml/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/usgsbiml/" target="_blank">https://www.flickr.com/photos/usgsbiml/</a></a>).</p></div>		</li>
