<p>There are two mistakes in your assumption. In paint, you mix Cyan (not Blue) and Yellow to get Green</p>

<p>OP is likely referencing the RYB color model, which far predates the CMYK color model. It's still used in painting, since it's comprised of more natural pigments, unlike CMYK, which is pretty much only used for color printing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True! The blue they use in RYB is very similar to the cyan they use in CMYK, so I guess it's just a matter of where we draw the line between cyan and blue, and what exact shade of green we want to get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Color from light to me is more fascinating by virtue of physical wavelengths each emits. Red sunsets because the sun is now furtherst within viewing distance -red=longsest wavelengths. Blue skies from light refracting off atmosphere molecules. Stars twinkling because our brain tries to put together a color of an image light years away the size of a pinpoint. Light color was something I feel my youth education didn’t touch on as it wasn’t until college that a color projector was in test mode and was confused how magenta and green made yellow on the wall. </p></div>		</li>
