			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d be careful not to confuse the issues here, though. The plastic changes in the CNS occur because those circuits are, by function, supposed to be plastic and adaptive. The mesolimbic circuit is there to encode incentive salience to stimuli perceived as rewarding, so that the subject learns to pursue that kind of reward in the future. Peripheral and enteric circuits don’t function that way. They operate either as relay points or to maintain homeostasis. </p>
<p>It’s well known that people starting SSRIs tend to have gastrointestinal side effects for some amount of time. But the number of people for whom this is a serious and long-term complaint seems fairly low. So the enteric nervous system probably just reaches a new homeostatic set point at the elevated serotonin level and maintains that set point, just as it does the “normal” one in “normal” people. </p>
<p>The serotonin pathways in the gut just aren’t meant to rewire themselves based on life experience like the ones in the CNS. They regulate things to reach a stable equilibrium.</p>
<p>I would be interested to know if this isn’t entirely the case, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, thanks. That was actually the intent of my question - whether or not the capability to rewire itself actually exists - since we don't generally think of the peripheral or enteric nervous system in that way.</p>
<p>I totally get that SSRI's exhibit their gastrointestinal effects directly, and probably not adaptively, but what's not to say the peripheral or enteric nervous system are not designed to be at least in some part adaptive?</p>
<p>We are aware of plenty of disorders that demonstrate mal-adaptive functioning: IBS and Pain-sensitization syndromes to name a couple. What's to say there <em>isn't</em> some adaptive capacity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be really interesting to know. I’ve done some searching, but it looks like nobody’s really worked on this question. That’s probably because it’s interdisciplinary and verging on the philosophical. </p>
<p>I’d really like to know more about the adaptive capabilities, if any, of the enteric nervous system. Or what exactly goes on inside those autonomic ganglia. </p>
<p>I’m a chemist by training who’s really interested, personally and professionally, in neuro-psychopharmacology. You probably know more about me on GI disorders, so I’m willing to be corrects there if what I said is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, this is a principle that should be useful in your practice whatever the discipline. Many if not most of the systems of our body are chains of buffers that can be nudged to various degrees. </p>
<p>These temporary or sustained nudges can accumulate to cause shifts in the physiology or even the anatomy of the pathway yields the capacity. </p>
<p>This could be anything from neurotransmitter levels to synapse structuring, muscle growth, bone remodeling, histology of epithelial linings in various places, or the development of cancer, atherosclerosis, obesity, and other consequential states of risk, suffering, and deregulation.</p>
<p>In the end, I’m a chemical level, we are just highly buffered and organized open systems. </p>
<p>You can push around the chemistry this way and that the expensive way with just medication, but can also do it with nutrition, behavior, thought process, methods of hydration, conditioning, exercise, meditation, reenforcement, education.</p>
<p>The farther you go in your career, the less likely you are to lean on the medication as the primary treatment modality rather than root cause analysis and corrective intervention.</p></div>		</li>
