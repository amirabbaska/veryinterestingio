			<p>Has BP actually paid any of those penalties yet? I thought they were still fighting it out in court. </p>		</li>

			<p>They've already paid a huge amount. Most estimates put it at around $40 billion that has already been actually paid. <br><br>Even though it's tax deductible, this is a gigantic hit to BP.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not sure if they've paid any, but they're putting a &quot;charge&quot; against their accounts which essentially means they're paying it. Whether that's direct to the people or whether it's to an account in case they lose the court case I'm not entirely sure.<br><br>That said, they know they'll have to pay a certain amount, the question is simply how much.</p>		</li>

			<p>Basically they'd be paying what the court said into an account which they can't touch unless the appeal rules in their favor.<br><br>They're &quot;paying&quot; it to themselves until the appeals are over then the court will tell them to hand over all the money they should have been paying under the original suit (or reduce it).</p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't go into a separate account.  It's an item on a balance sheet; actual day-to-day management of cash is predicated entirely on the actual need for cash over the coming weeks, months, and years.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well yeah it's not necessarily technically in a separate account, but for the sake of this explanation it's the same thing</p>		</li>

			<p>In a sense, yes.  Its priority on the balance sheet is higher than (some) others, so the government would get its fine before, say, lenders who were owed money would.<br><br>It would be possible to put it into some sort of escrow/trust, but I don't think it would be necessary.  Organisations at that scale don't really work like that.</p>		</li>

			<p>In accounting, there is an &quot;accruals concept&quot;. It means that income/ expenses are recognised when they are incurred rather than when cash is received/ paid. This is true of everything.<br><br>In this case, the company is recognising a &quot;provision&quot;, which is a type of liability. It means they have an obligation to pay a certain amount of money as a result of past events. The provision hits the balance sheet and the income statement causing a loss even though no money has been paid yet.<br><br>I haven't looked into this but from what I read above it sounds like in this case the provision is what is known as an &quot;exceptional item&quot;, in which case it is fairly standard to report a profit figure before deducting this amount.</p>		</li>

			<p>Right now it's just being &quot;set aside&quot;, but you can basically think of it as going into an account ready to give to the cleanup/fines etc if BP lose the appeal.</p>		</li>
