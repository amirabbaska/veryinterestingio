			<div class="markdown"><p>Very nicely explained.   However, it is not necessarily sensationalism to report the &quot;book&quot; loss. It is meaningful for some purposes as the &quot;Operational&quot; profit is meaningful for other purposes.  </p>
<p>I would argue that the more sensational route the CNN could have taken would be to say &quot;BP -- the company that screwed our environment -- is still pocketing $5bn profit! OMFG!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't <em>quite</em> suggesting sensationalism, but I accept your point.</p>
<p>I was more pointing out that the BBC article is more &quot;newsy&quot; in that it is reporting the new information. The $12bn charge has been known about for months, and we've had a good idea about it for several years... it's not news at all to anyone who actually cares about the specifics.</p>
<p>I'd wager that the majority of people with any interest (financial or personal) in BP, on reading the CNN article, simply went looking for the actual profit figure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I always look at both.  The pre-charge figure is useful for gauging how profitable the company will be in the future.  The after-charge figure is useful for tracking the company's balance sheet; this will affect the company's ability to invest and expand, buy back stock, etc.  Also, a track record of having large charge offs is a red flag that the company is making bad investment choices. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best carpet is kind of a stretch. Sure it's our carpet and you're going to replace it, but let's be honest the West Coast is clearly our best carpet</p>
<p>That leaves the gulf being like the kitchen rug (Mid Atlantic coast is the welcome mat in this scenario).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should we panic now that we know that Jon lost $20?  I for one wouldn't trust Jon with my finances.<br />
Edit: Jon is also a liar.  He's down $30 because of a broken vase, but he's also down $30 because he bought a video game.  He knew it was a flagrant purchase and tried covering it up with the vase fiasco.  Jon is also horrible at PR.  Jon needs to resign immediately.  </p></div>		</li>
