			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm interesting... what if we realize we are dreaming during our dream? I used to do this when I was younger when I'd start to fly in my dream. It became so common that once I started to fly, it became my signal that I was dreaming. Then it just stopped happening...</p>
<p>I miss being able to fly in my dreams. It was quite enjoyable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard the trick to lucid dreaming is to get in the habit of trying it when awake. For me, the trigger is when a piece of information has logical inconsistencies. Like a bad script writer introduces continuity problems, such as having a conversation with a relative long deceased, or being absolutely certain that a dream character was wearing a different color shirt just a minute ago. Then you try to fly, or move something with your mind, and then you realize you've unlocked god mode. Just try to remain calm so you don't wake up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did it once because a few weeks before, I read of a technique to lucid dreaming was on looking at a clock in your dream. If the time becomes drastic after looking at it again, then you know you're dreaming. One time I was dreaming and I see a clock on the wall and instantly remembered the article I read. I looked at it twice and realized the time was drastically different. Then Was when I realized I was dreaming. I was so excited because it was my first lucid dream. I was jumping up and down in excitement to the point where my body was starting to wake up. I realized I was about to wake up and I didn't want this awareness to end so I quickly tried to calm down and control the rest of my dream. It felt awesome until the dream transitioned and I forgot I was dreaming again. Fascinating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have lucid dreams all of the time when I was younger. It had stopped for a while, but my mom told me (and this sounds absolutely insane) to sometimes push your finger into the palm of your hand. If you're dreaming your finger will go through your hand, if your not then your finger will obviously not go through your hand. I've gotten in the habit that when things feel unusual I try it (when no one is looking of course). I usually forget to do it when I'm dreaming, but I've been able to do it a few times and it worked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This one always intrigued me. I feel like my dream logic would be cool with it though. Like &quot;ok, finger through hand check... Better get back to tossing zombies off the freeway overpass.&quot;  </p>
<p>That never happens for you though? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really amazing when you realize it but is still playing with it to make sure, probably that's when you don't wake up. You just go along and try to do crazy stuff. </p>
<p>I had multiple times around 15 yo, but nowadays I'm always tired to try. Many tracking apps use external sounds to trigger it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what your describing is a lucid dream. When you realised you were dreaming and started flying you most likely got excited that you could pretty much do anything you wanted and the excitement woke you up. You can train yourself to lucid dream, theres a subreddit with a large community that provides tips and discussions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a theory. Imagine dreaming was your true state of consciousness and you only remember glimpses of it. Our state of consciousness now (being awake) is a secondary state. Quite cool to think about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, it's definitely a secondary state. We are only consciously aware of about sixteen bits per second, when our senses are presented with nearly 11 million bits per second. That's a lot of information our senses throw away and somehow still manage to give us a complete enough simulation of reality where we can live and grow. I'm particularly interested in what the other 10,999,984 bits are trying to tell us, but our brains have deemed them unnecessary for survival and we are therefore unequipped to understand them. Again, this is my take on the User Illusion. I suggest anyone interested give it a read. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there are theories that psychedelic drugs like LSD and DMT allow us to delve deeper into our consciousness in ways that is very difficult if not impossible yo experience without the assistance of such drugs. <a href="https://vimeo.com/18608588" target="_blank">Heres a three part BBC documentary that touches on some of it</a>. Really good documentary. The presenter actually takes LSD and goes through a fMRI machine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>16 bits per second is an incredibly small amount of information... and considering I'm consciously aware of what's on my phone right now, I'd say I'm aware of more than that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you want another little fine thought nugget?</p>
<p>How do you actually know other people around you are actually thinking?  The only thing you can base it upon is that you yourself is thinking? But if you are thinking that, how can you know that anyone else is thinking at all?  You simply can't.  You just have to assume it to work the way you expect it to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of this has been scientifically verified. It's an interesting hypothesis, but in order to make a factual statement, a significant degree more research is required before we can begin to make definitive statements about dreams. The brain is insanely complex, and boiling it down to a computer/mechanical model completely underestimates the sheer power and complexity of it. </p></div>		</li>
