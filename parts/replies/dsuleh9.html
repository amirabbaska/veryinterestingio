<p>broadening the spectral lines that are emitted or absorbed</p>

<p>So does that mean that a given atom will virtually <em>never</em> absorb certain wavelengths? Say we have a H atom and we send photons w/ a wavelength directly between two H absorption frequencies?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Very cold gas can be cooled further by irradiating them with light frequencies just below a spectral line frequency. Only those atoms that are moving towards the source will absorb the light, due to the Doppler shift. This slows them down, then they emit a photon at the higher frequency, losing energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doppler spectral broadening doesn't really apply to one atom. If we're only looking at a single atom, for us to define an incoming frequency in the first place we need a reference frame so the atom is fixed. You could down shift or up shift it by a fixed amount by moving the atom, but it's still a very fixed frequency. </p>
<p>However, if we have a box of hydrogen gas, any atom could be moving at any velocity at any given time while the gas as a whole shares a reference frame with us. So then we see Doppler broadening. How much broadening we see (and hence, how rare it would be to see absorption between two spectral lines) would then depend on how fast and how much variation is velocity there is, also known as the temperature. There's some frequency you would not expect to see absorbed very frequently, but there's no limit to how much a random velocity of an atom might shift the energy. Anywhere from radio waves to gamma rays could be absorbed on hy </p></div>		</li>

<p>It is very unlikely to interact with that photon. As a result, neutral hydrogen is largely transparent to visible light and infrared. The same applies to hydrogen molecules, and also to nitrogen and oxygen molecules. The air is quite transparent as result of that.</p></div>		</li>
