			<div class="markdown"><p>As much as I like XKCD and as much as I may be biased by being a physicist, I always took issue with this comic. Physics is certainly <em>NOT</em> applied Mathematics in the same way that Chemistry is applied Physics. A sufficient knowledge of all of Physics would, in principle, allow you to derive anything you wanted to know about Chemistry (given enough computing power), and both are empirical sciences. You certainly cannot say that about the relationship between Physics and Math. Many mathematical constructs have no bearing on the real world, and the validity of a physical model can in no way be deduced from Math alone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh, hey, I didn't see you guys all the way over there. </p>
