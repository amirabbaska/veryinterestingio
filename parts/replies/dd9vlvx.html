			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that outfits like Lucasfilm and Pixar (and I assume Marvel) are beneath the Studio umbrella but often work pretty autonomously. In these instances, the studio is more a distributor than anything else, though they may act as financiers as well, and certainly get a nice tidy cut of the profits regardless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some more distinctions, </p>
<p>Line Producer will spend the money the Producer raises</p>
<p>Assistant Director is not a director's assistant, it's a department covering a lot of (principally) cast logistics</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Producer is even more involved than that. They decide on which screenplay to develop into the film. They'll often work with the writer on making sure the story works and once it does they'll choose the director. It's the producer who is Boss and can do the hiring and firing. The Best Picture Oscar? That goes to the producers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly why I don't subscribe to the author theory in MOST cases (exceptions generally being when the director also has writing and/or legitimate producer credits). </p></div>		</li>
