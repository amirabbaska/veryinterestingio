			<div class="markdown"><p>In reality, ebay wouldn't as they dont actually handle the money. However, bear in mind that taxes are calculated on profit, not revenues so whether you have to declare a pass-through or not would have no effect on your profit (and therefore your taxes). This is because the money you receive (recorded as revenue) is exactly equal to the money going out (recorded as an expense).</p>
<p>When people are evaluating a job or piece of work you may hear them talk about ignoring pass-through for this reason. It won't impact profit.</p></div>		</li>
