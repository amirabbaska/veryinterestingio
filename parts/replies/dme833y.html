			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow that same analogy. Some &quot;vehicles&quot; are built at a higher level of quality, require less maintenance and have greater longevity. The same can be said about a persons towing capacity, speed, handling, suspension and fuel economy.  Personally I wish I wasn't so good on gas because the ole reserve tank has a few extra gallons that need to burn off.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't even have to be genetics. Things like drinking and smoking do not give you a disease, they simply increase your likelihood of obtaining that disease</p>
<p>You could very well have a person with poor genetics who smokes and drinks until their 90 it's simply through the lottery of life and cell replication, they never develop the disease</p>
<p>Which is why it always is so pointless when people say what my grandma drink till she was 90 and never developed liver disease. Or I'm 600 pounds overweight and my blood work is fine.</p>
<p>We generally deem in the health world that increasing your risk to disease is a bad thing</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, no. Alcohol is a direct cause for liver cirrhosis and tobacco smoke is a direct cause for cancer. We know how they cause these things. They absolutely give you the diseases. It's just that it's not guaranteed and often based on quantity and duration and a bit of luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're on the right track, but people never &quot;dropped dead&quot; at 27. That's not how average life expectancy works.<br />
The leading cause of death in hunter-gatherer societies was  external injury (eg. falling off a cliff or being mauled by a bear), and it was very rare for someone to survive to the point that heart disease or cancer would be an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK anthropologists and archaeologists don't calculate average from mean, they use median.  And even in modern population statistics means for human life span trends are considered misleading and and medians are preferred, but means are used when trying to calculate future expectancy.</p>
<p>People also died in:</p>

<li>child birth</li>
