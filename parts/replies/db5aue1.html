			<div class="markdown"><p>Something more to add to your analogy is that in running the 40 yard dash in the combine, that's in optimal conditions. Correct me if I am wrong as I don't watch the combine, but I am assuming they don't really have to worry about carrying the football, choosing routes, avoiding tackles, and maybe not even wearing equipment. Sure they may be able to run it faster, but in reality it carries very little significance, on the whole, to being able to do it in a game. Equating that to GPA, there's a lot of factors in school that are and aren't there in the workplace that absolutely can factor into the final result. Things like how many courses the person takes, how many extra curriculars, having a job on the side, the organization of your final exams and their weightings (only 1 to worry about, or 6 in the span of 3 days). All of those things can significantly effect your GPA.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are mostly correct, there are no obstacles, no change of direction, no football, and no pads when running the 40. However, a player who runs fast at the combine will still run fast in a game most of the time. I've seen Marquise Goodwin blow by skilled defenders just with his speed. The athletic prowess based drills don't measure for route running savvy or the ability to read a defense (i.e. if a cornerback is playing man or zone, inside technique or outside technique). That was what Jerry Rice had in spades and is what made him the player he was.</p>
<p>Another good analogy is Peyton Manning, he wasn't the most physically gifted athlete. His arm strength was mediocre and he wasn't fast. Jamarcus Russell (famously a huge bust) was big, fast, and had a cannon for an arm. Based purely on their physical stats, you'd take Russell 10/10 times. But Manning was an incredible leader and incredibly diligent student of the game. That was what made him the amazing player that he was.</p>
<p>You want to hire people who have those intangible qualities that will make them good employees, and the GPA is often an incomplete measure of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the point I think is lost in his analysis. I think the GPA is a piece. Much like building a stool with four legs, if GPA is a leg of that stool can the stool stand without the fourth leg? Maybe, maybe not, it depends how that stool was built with the other aspects of legs. Experience can easily be seen as another leg of the stool. Without that leg, perhaps the stool can stand. The point being, if you focus your interview about one variable instead of big picture ability to perform the job function or SJD you may limit your candidate pool substantially by basing a decision on one factor too much. </p></div>		</li>
