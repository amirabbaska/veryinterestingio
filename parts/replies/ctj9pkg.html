			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent point about scheduling. Sometimes committee attendance is also brought up in addition to  voting attendance. Committees regularly schedule meetings that conflict with those of other committees, regardless of which, if any, members sit on both. There are plenty of times where it would be physically impossible for a legislator to attend all of the scheduled functions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ducking a vote -- sometimes, for whatever reason, the vote is particularly contentious in that legislator's district. In that case, he or she might duck the vote to avoid going on record.</p>

<p>And this isn't always a bad thing.  In the partisan world in which we live, an elected official usually ducks a vote to support a more moderate position than his or her primary electorate wants to see.  </p></div>		</li>
