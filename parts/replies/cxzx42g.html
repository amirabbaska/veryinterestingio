			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that these PRO's have people who regularly visit businesses, particularly newer ones who may not have registered to pay royalties, and check if they're playing commercial music in the establishment. If so, they'll likely be given a warning to start paying fees or else they'll be threatened with legal action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I run a chinese restaurant, and I play chinese music over the speakers. Music from CDs I bought in Taiwan. Just instrumental stuff, too. Well I get a call one day and its a lady who asks &quot;Do you do live music?&quot; and I said no of course. &quot;So you play CDs?&quot; &quot;Uh, yeah.&quot; &quot;Okay thank you good bye&quot;.  </p>
<p>I then get a letter saying that I have to pay BMI some money to play music. I told them that none of the music on the CDs I bought come up on their website, which means they don't own the rights to them, and I'm not paying some company for music they don't own. They sent another letter saying that they own a lot of international music (keep in mind I already searched their database to make sure I wasn't infringing) and I should sign up with them and pay a fee. I told them to pound sand. So they sent another letter...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that BMI and ASCAP are required by law to follow a consent decree. If a business receives a visit and a letter or email they should immediately respond with a request like this &quot;We request a license for the right of public performance to use your repertoire.&quot; This will protect the person or business being targeted and protect their rights under the consent decree while rates are negotiated. Without it they could be sued into oblivion because of ignorance of the law.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In America it depends on the size of the store. If it's under 2000 square feet it can play the radio without issue. If it's over 2000 square feet then they are fine if there are 6 or less speakers, with no more than 4 speakers in one room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally don't know anything about any of this but I would presume some time after it was very popular on the radio and such, because someone above said they get paid quarterly but about 3 quarters late. They'd probably suddenly get a couple of pretty big checks over the course of a year or something and altogether it would add to such an amount?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the business (bar or DJ depending on who's playing the music) pays a flat fee, like a netflix or cable subscription, then the agency uses the various market analysis methods at their disposal to determine how to split the fees between the artists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They weight all of the flat fees VERY heavily toward the top 40, under the assumption that most of what is being played in retail is probably fairly analogous to what is on the charts. So if you have a hipster bar spinning deep techno cuts chances are good their license fee is not going to those creators..</p></div>		</li>
