			<div class="markdown"><p>Ex senior observer here. I did field work for many years. I also worked on project with Stanford University back in 80's. We had jumpers that would allow us to not have a string of geophones at each takeout. We would lay out about 10 miles of line and park the vibrators 5 miles from station 1. We would sweep 6 to 10 Hz dozens of times. I don't remember what depth we were recording to, but our shallow CDP was around 20,000 ft. (If it helps to put it in perspective, I worked on MDS 10, DFS V, Sercel, and Mini Sosie. Mini Sosie is the equipment that you see at the beginning of Jurassic Park.) So to answer the last part of your post, the government hires people like Western Geo to do their projects. Those companies have the biggest and the best. I could regale you with tales about drug and gun smuggling in foreign lands and nights of drunkenness and debauchery, but since you are already on a crew, I suspect you know this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I got to visit a shoot earlier this year, totally awesome experience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, back about the mid 90's, I was on a job down in Argentina. We had finished a big project in by the Andes around Chos Malal and were most of the way through a project just south of the Parana river. We lived in a man camp out in the jungle. I was sitting in my little trailer one night and it hit me. I was done. I put my resignation the next day and went home. I worked in a processing center for  a couple years and then moved to Santa Fe. Too many years of hard work in jungles, deserts and everything in between and drinking and carousing takes a toll. I'll leave the future of seismic to the young guys. I'll leave with one statement. I absolutely loved my job and my life and wouldn't trade one second of it. If you are sitting in a bar and some guy asks you &quot;Hey, would like to to do a job Brazil&quot; don't be like 99.9% of people. Take it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>would you mind regaling those of us who aren't on a crew? this sounds like fascinating work, seeing the inside of the earth is cool enough but where does the smuggling come in? underground tunnels?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you know but Western Geo merged into Geco to form Western Geco and then was absorbed by Schlumberger who has everything from A-Z.   Did you work with Gary Mavko at Stanford? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I had no idea. I got into computers (although I had worked with them in the field) and never really kept up with geophysics. All I remember about the Stanford job was guy named Jon. The only reason I remember is because that is how I spell my name.</p></div>		</li>
