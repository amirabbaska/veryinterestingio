			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically what we hear is our perception of a real sound and when we remember the sound our brain just does the same thing from memory but without external stimulus? Or am I over simplifying it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, thats pretty much it. The strength of the neural connections that you have related to the sound will determine how easily you can remember it, and how good of a memory it is. If you have listened to one song a thousand times, the strength of the neural connections related to that song are going to be very strong, so you’ll be able to “hear” a fairly accurate rendition of the song when you think of it. </p>
<p>There really isn’t much of a difference (if any) between experiencing something in the real world and just having the necessary neurons in your brain fire for you to “experience” something. So if you imagine a sound, and its 100% accurate to how it sounds in real life, there shouldn’t be a physical difference in how you subjectively experience it. Which leads to the [Brain in a vat theory.] in philosophy. The question is just as much a philosophical one as a biological one.(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this explains why I sometimes think that I forgot to turn off my iPod and that I'm hearing it playing quietly through the headphones, but then I realize it was just playing in my head. I legitimately can't tell sometimes and I feel slightly crazy when it happens. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For people with a mental illness that experience hearing voices or the like, is the response in the brain more &quot;real&quot; or is there something else happening that makes the individual more susceptible to believing what they're hearing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t speak for all mental illnesses since they are really diverse and in general poorly understood, but if you are getting a sensory experience, you can bet that parts of the brain that are necessary for that experience are being activated. </p>
<p>A cool analog to this is phantom limb syndrome, in which a person who loses a limb still feels as though they have it, despite not physically getting any sensory input. In the brain, the areas that are responsible for the limb are still firing off, so the sensation exists despite nothing happening in the real world. For people with mental illnesses, perhaps areas of the brain are firing off despite having no external input, and this kind of incorrect brain response can happen for a lot of different reasons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for responding!</p>
<p>I guess I meant specifically, for people with things like schizophrenia who really believe they hear it, is that area of the brain activating more than a normal person remembering something or are they just more susceptible to believing the things they &quot;hear&quot;. </p>
<p>But as you said, a lot of mysteries there so it might just not be known. </p></div>		</li>
