			<div class="markdown"><p>Adblock would target the src attribute in an <img> tag and see if it has any of the common ad server links such as Google adsense or something like that. For instance: <img src="http://www.admaker.com/ad/ajHOj8a"></img> of course this isn't an actual ad link. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't even have to go that far. Most people don't host their own ads. Most people do host their own images. Or at least an obvious subdomain for your media. </p>
<p>For example, Reddit uses redditstatic.com and thumbs.redditmedia.com. These are quite obviously related domains to reddit.com, and calls to them for data are probably something you want to see if you are on Reddit.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are on Reddit and there is a third party call to redtube.com, somebody's probably trying to serve you an ad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>basically an ad is it's own unit that gets slapped on top of the website once the website creator finished making it (they allot space for ads when making their website). so the site loads and the ads load separately, and adblock just stops the ads from loading. so you're seeing what's behind the ad (sometimes empty space, sometimes a message to adblock users) when you use adblock on sites with ads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it doesn't differentiate. Easylist (one of the most popular lists of 'ads' to block) contains rules which will block any image with, for example, '-728x90-' in its URL. Learnt that one after much head scratching looking at a client's site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The alt text would be hidden when the element is hidden. Alt text usually only appears when the image source is broken. Most of the time that is just for search engine purposes to know what the image is for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>weird, I already agreed to that but the person who posted it deleted the comment.</p>
<p>Anyway, yes that is a good point for the purpose. I completely neglected that.</p></div>		</li>
