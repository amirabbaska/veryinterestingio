			<p>How does adblock differ between an ad and an actual image? could you not just put an image under the ad, or just have an unblockable ad?</p>		</li>

			<p>Adblock would target the src attribute in an &lt;img&gt; tag and see if it has any of the common ad server links such as Google adsense or something like that. For instance: &lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://www.admaker.com/ad/ajHOj8a"&gt;&lt;/img&gt" target="_blank">http://www.admaker.com/ad/ajHOj8a"&gt;&lt;/img&gt</a>; of course this isn't an actual ad link. </p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't even have to go that far. Most people don't host their own ads. Most people do host their own images. Or at least an obvious subdomain for your media. <br><br>For example, Reddit uses redditstatic.com and thumbs.redditmedia.com. These are quite obviously related domains to reddit.com, and calls to them for data are probably something you want to see if you are on Reddit.<br><br>On the other hand, if you are on Reddit and there is a third party call to redtube.com, somebody's probably trying to serve you an ad.</p>		</li>

			<p>oh man... I once was building a site and used 'ads' as the name of a folder... then could not understand why the images were broken. Adblock was filtering the damn things. Ouch.</p>		</li>

			<p>Been there, done that. And that happens not only in English, but even in languages like Serbian where I had a div called &quot;reklama&quot; (ad) and it magically disappeared.</p>		</li>

			<p>I know most people don't host their own ads. What I was getting at, is that the ad server would send different ads to that specific url when needed. It's also easier to implement in an ad space. </p>		</li>

			<p>Specifically, reddit uses Adzerk for their sidebar ads. The self-serve advertising uses the same system reddit does for normal submissions (just in the /r/promos subreddit), so they don't get blocked.</p>		</li>

			<p>basically an ad is it's own unit that gets slapped on top of the website once the website creator finished making it (they allot space for ads when making their website). so the site loads and the ads load separately, and adblock just stops the ads from loading. so you're seeing what's behind the ad (sometimes empty space, sometimes a message to adblock users) when you use adblock on sites with ads.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sometimes it doesn't differentiate. Easylist (one of the most popular lists of 'ads' to block) contains rules which will block any image with, for example, '-728x90-' in its URL. Learnt that one after much head scratching looking at a client's site.</p>		</li>

			<p>The difference is where it's hosted.  </p>		</li>

			<p>It's because like 99.99% of ads aren't hosted on the actual website you're visiting. So you visit the website, then that site tells your browser to pull ads from the ad providers. Ad blockers simply stop your browser from pulling the ads from those providers...<br><br>But it <em>doesn't</em> stop your browser from pulling images which are hosted on the site. So the site hosts a &quot;you blocked our ads :(&quot; image, and posts it &quot;behind&quot; the ad. If the ad gets blocked, the image shows up instead.</p>		</li>

			<p>The alt text would be hidden when the element is hidden. Alt text usually only appears when the image source is broken. Most of the time that is just for search engine purposes to know what the image is for.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's also for browsers that don't display images, such as web browsers for the blind.</p>		</li>

			<p>weird, I already agreed to that but the person who posted it deleted the comment.<br><br>Anyway, yes that is a good point for the purpose. I completely neglected that.</p>		</li>
