			<div class="markdown"><p>As an engineer, you should be able to understand F=qvxB.  Maybe you've misstated your comment, but the magnetic force B interacting here would come from the Sun or some other entity - not the circuit itself.  And as the strength of that field varies with distance, your acceleration due to the resulting force would be variable as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's a good hint, and I was thinking that the Lorentz force would affect the switched-on flashlight in any electric OR magnetic field, simply because switching it on forms a loop.</p>
<p>What I'm not clear on is what happens if the flashlight is switched off. It's a <em>near loop</em>, and the open integral of force on the wire becomes vanishingly small. Well, in the switch itself, two contacts are held at potential. Would particles passing between those contacts gain momentum, and would that momentum direct the flashlight to spin?</p></div>		</li>
