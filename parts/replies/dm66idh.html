			<div class="markdown"><p>The English use the dot for multiplication as well. It's easy to make the dot product symbol a bit bolder than a period.</p>
<p>The problem with the comma decimal system is that when it comes to punctuation in language, it's a soft stop while a period is a hard stop. Using a comma to separate integer values and a period to separate fractional values makes logical sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't follow how a hard stop versus a soft stop somehow makes more sense. I'd go so far as to say that's the best argument I've heard for a decimal comma. Why would you use a hard stop in the middle of a number? You wouldn't use a hard stop in the middle of other things that are highly related; sentences, lists, etc. Why would you insist it should be used here? I think this is more of a matter of you being used to it being that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another way to say it. In writing, a comma is used after a dependent clause. E.g. &quot;While surfing Reddit, I commented on an article.&quot; For a number such as &quot;1234&quot;, think of &quot;234&quot; as a dependent clause to the one thousand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Now everyone uses 'x' for 'times by', but the decimal separators have stuck.&quot;</p>
<p>Still using &quot;.&quot; for times by. -Belgium</p>
<p>We learn it at age 8 as 2x2=4 but when we choose classes ( age 11-12) we learn that in &quot;real maths&quot; it's 2.2=4
Ofcourse by that time we 've passed calculating how much 2 times 2 is. It's an example :p </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in my algebra classes, everyone uses (10)(10) or 10(dot)10, never 10x10. we only use x for dimensions now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>99% of the population isnt going to use x to mean cross product they're going to use it to mean multiplication.</p>
<p>Are you in university of highschool? Scalar dot scalar is only something thats really seen in highschool, at least where I live. I probably wouldnt write 5 dot 10 on an assignment incase the marker saw it as 5.10. </p>
<p>If im not doing a dot product I'd rather take the extra 0.5 second to write x and not risk having the dot too low and it looking like a decimal point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, I've used parentheses since seventh or eighth grade.</p>
<p>I just don't like x because I always default to using x as a variable... and everyone feels the same.</p></div>		</li>
