			<div class="markdown"><p>The first part of your answer is fine, though an assembly-line worker shouldn't have very much idle time, particularly compared to your other examples.</p>
<p>However the 2nd part is...well, not accurate, at least in the US.  IANAL, but I do have google:
<a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/hrg.htm" target="_blank">https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/hrg.htm</a>
In the link one can find the first reason why all employees are paid by the hour.  All employers are required, at a minimum, to pay minimum wage for all hours worked, and overtime beyond 40 hours.  So the hours worked must be tracked and compensated for.</p>
<p>Piece Rate labor is not prohibited, so it is technically legal, so long as the minimum hourly wage and overtime are covered.  Search for 'piece rate' in the link, or check out this resource from the state of Colorado:

<p>In short, piece-rate is allowed, but employers still need to pay minimum hourly wage, and be able to prove it if an employee were to sue for unpaid wages.  Thus, even in piece-rate employment, employee hours must be tracked and compensated for.  The additional complication of overtime and accounting for the piece-rate within the overtime makes it more trouble than it is generally worth.  Thus, piece-rate employment is not very common.</p></div>		</li>
