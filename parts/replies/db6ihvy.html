			<div class="markdown"><p>Next to the fact that Sound and light aren't the same thing at all and don't behave the same, I want to comment on the resonance thing.
Vibratingâ‰ resonance!
When you have a nice subwoofer which is standing on your desk and playing your amazing music, you will notice that your desk/items on your desk are vibrating. That is vibrating, not resonance. Same goes for walls and such. Every object has only 1 frequency on which it resonates (it's resonance frequency). A famous example of something big resonating is the Tacoma bridge.

(Interesting stuff is from 2:00 on)
When something resonates it will actually take the form of the soundwave and you can see it passing through the object. (Which looks cool af)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound and light are not the same mathematically insofar as sound is not transverse and light is, and sound has a preferred reference frame and light does not, but the mechanics of waves are general and the piece that I compared (long wavelengths averaging over small features) is shared by both.</p>
<p>There are multiple resonant frequencies corresponding to integer or sometimes half-integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Different waves can resonate with different modes of whatever's resonating, too, so &quot;the resonant frequency of a house&quot; isn't really a single frequency. You can have &quot;the resonant frequency of the house parallel to the ground&quot; and &quot;the resonant frequency of the house perpendicular to the ground&quot; and &quot;the resonant frequency of the house's brick exterior&quot; vs &quot;the resonant frequency of the house's wooden frame&quot;. Exciting any of these will cause the sound to propagate farther without losing as much amplitude as it otherwise would, and these will tend to be longer wavelengths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not true that objects only resonate at a single frequency. That is true for very simple scenarios (mass-on-spring, for example). A guitar string has many resonant frequencies (a fundamental, plus overtones).</p>
<p>Really, it's probably better to think of resonance as being a spectrum, rather than just discrete frequencies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the blue light penetrates into water, while the red frequencies only heat the top... you're reasons/reasoning is/are way off: Compare a gamma ray and some ordinary infrared radiation... that gamma ray is very likely going to go right through the earth... that heat radiation might heat up a little bit of air between it's point of propagation and the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gamma rays do not penetrate the Earth very far at all. Neutrino observatories use signals coming up from the interior of the Earth as an ultra-pure sample of neutrinos because <em>only</em> neutrinos can travel all the way through the Earth undisturbed.</p>
<p>Water <em>absorbs</em> red light and allows blue light through relatively unaffected. It's not <em>scattering</em> like in the atmosphere, it's an intrinsic preference of the water molecule to absorb light in the red frequency band. This does not apply to sound, as in, individual gas molecules in the air etc. do not absorb sound waves, so it is not appropriate to use as an analogy.</p></div>		</li>
