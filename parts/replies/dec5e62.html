			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pregnant, constantly waking up just enough to shift position (I sleep on my front usually, which I cannot do right now, except my asleep brain has not got this message and keeps rolling over onto my tummy, realising it's squishing something important and waking me up to deal with it) and go back to sleep. </p>
<p>Can confirm, incredibly annoying, super disruptive and I don't feel like I've slept properly despite probably still technically being asleep for 7 hours or so.</p>
<p>I would give pretty much anything right now, to be able to sleep from the moment I drop of until my alarm goes off. </p></div>		</li>

I think once I get larger I'll be checking out the narrow body pillows though, they're beginning to look more and more attractive! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>huh, it's like an airbed with a hole in it.
That's pretty clever actually. Must be a weird thing to stick into bed though XD
I'm just imagining the look on my husbands face XD
thanks for the suggestion though, definitely interesting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone below suggested a body pillow - this helped my wife a lot during those last few months.</p>
<p>Also, how many people have told you to 'sleep now!' well screw them all because they know you're not sleeping now and that you won't be sleeping in the near future. It's just psychological mayhem!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been looking at them and wondering.
Just trying to work out how to fit my pregnant butt, a body pillow and my husband in our bed XD</p>
<p>Early on there were about 3 or 4 weeks where I was utterly exhausted. Slept for about 14 hours at night, had naps in the afternoon, had to take sit down breaks whilst making a sandwich etc.</p>
<p>Everyone was like 'enjoy it while you can!'</p>
<p>Needing that level of sleep is not fun! I am not enjoying it! I would like to be awake and alert for more than 30 minutes at a time!</p>
<p>Heh, I'm hoping my kid is like me - apparently I was fairly sedate as a baby. My husband was a bit of a whinger according to his mum so I guess I've got 50/50 XD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the point of sleep is to rejuvenate your body, I'd just figured it'd be pretty straight forward for the body to realize it's screwing itself over in the morning. And for sure, in your situation that makes sense due to the sleep issues, but as a guy who sleeps well and wakes up in pain or in weird positions is rather annoying.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but this is the night shift. They dont care. As long as no alarms are going off about catastrophic failure they are perfectly happy coasting along and leaving all the minor problems for the morning shift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Night shift always gets a bad wrap when a good deal of problems are caused by other shifts going &quot;let second/third shift take care of it&quot; or other regular issues. Worked on/with plenty and many many many of them work just as hard (or are just as lazy) as their counterparts and some even more. If they are screwing off and shit, that's a management problem. Hire someone new and train them. Problem employee will get the hint and straighten up or be replaced. At will employment has perks. </p>
<p>That being said... dear God this is the best night shift reference/definition and it's hilarious to randomly come across it XD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add. The point to sleep is not very well understood. Sure rejuvenation of the body is one aspect, but modern research suggest that things like memory consolidation and a variety of other things may play just as much part, in as to why we need sleep.</p></div>		</li>
