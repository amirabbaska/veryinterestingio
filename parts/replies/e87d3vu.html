			<div class="markdown"><p>And Alto-Shaam is a brand of oven. They make lots of different kinds. I have no idea what this person is saying about “overnight ovens” since literally any oven can be left on overnight.  Not just an Alto-Shaam oven. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just correcting &quot;Aldo sham&quot; </p>
<p>And while you are correct, I think he's referring to electronically programmable ovens that can roast on high for an hour for maillard exterior then drop to a slow cook temp before dropping to hot holding all based on meat thermometer and timer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of those things in a home kitchen would be counter top appliances, and could never draw the wattage needed for the temperatures you list. There is a reason that ovens are 220 volt in north America. and why an electric griddle just can't get as hot as a stove top. </p>
<p>My high end panini press puts out 1500 watts at 110-120v, and my computer's power supply is 1300 watts, and thats about as much as the law permits. My parabolic space heater is 1000 watts. Plug too many things in and you're blowing breakers and starting wire fires. Houses just aren't wired for that heavy of consumption. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your PC is not drawing anywhere near 1300 watts. You way overbuilt. My 7700k/1080ti tops out at 400 watts under full load with a 95W TDP CPU. Threadripper 2990WX has 32 cores and is rated at 250 watts TDP, so a top end single GPU desktop system can maybe pull as high as 600 watts.</p>
<p>My 6600k/1080 rig maxes out at around 320 watts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is the (roughly) largest sized PSU for a reason. That is why I mentioned it. </p>

<p>Yes...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small ones are just little broilers with really good performance (and IIRC efficiency) compared to setting your oven to broil.</p>
<p>However, there's big commercial LPG (natural gas) ones available too, and those let you turn fresh dough into a perfectly cooked pizza in 6 minutes easy. It's no flaming stone oven, but it's fast, clean and reliable.</p></div>		</li>
