			<div class="markdown"><p>Caused by cortisol instead of adrenaline.</p>
<p>Cortisol is produced when it’s a long term or future event you’re stressing about. You basically carb load so you have energy to run or fight.</p>
<p>School tests, weddings, big events induce this same type of stress, and our bodies haven’t evolved to handle it differently yet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered about this, surely the then nervous pooh in the morning right before the battle would be so much worse and you'd be doing it with 100s of others.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why the celts generally lost, half the army was in the bushes... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain foods like fats and carbs and sweets and salty foods either invoke comfort based on past memories - the mama effect - or induce a hormonal change that is calming - countering a stress or anxiety response. Eating a plate of cookies or chips and dip - for example - actually sedates and calms. This is why a lot of people stress eat. </p></div>		</li>
