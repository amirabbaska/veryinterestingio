			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this.  The wick burning is not required.   You can make a candle with a non burning wick, such as a twisted strand metal wire.  The wick doesn't need to burn. It just need to have a surface where wax can surface tension up to a hot location</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing then that burnable wicks are used mostly because they are self-trimming? In candles anyway. Curious why I've never seen e.g. an oil lamp with a non-burning wick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often seen fibreglass wicks for oil lamps, you can even get them on Amazon. They look exactly like the cotton or whatever regular ones are made for, and when you search for &quot;torch wick&quot; the first page is completely fibreglass only.</p>
<p>As to for candles you need self trimming wicks, otherwise you'll quickly get a fire. Try sticking a match vertically into a candle and light it up, the flame will get pretty large very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Self-trimming wicks are actually a relatively modern invention. When candles were in daily use, you had to regularly trim the wicks with a scissors, or the wick would grow to long and too much wax would get vaporised, leading to a smoky flame.</p>
<p>Modern wicks are made so they curve as the char, poking then out of the side of the flame, where the end of the hot wick burns away.</p>
<p>edit: I typed this on my phone, which worked as well as it always does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun trick. If you blow out a candle and right away hold a lit match in the white vapor/smoke trailing away above the wick, then the flame from the match will &quot;jump&quot; down to the wick and relight the candle, demonstrating that it is, indeed, the vaporized wax that is burning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to be pretty close to the wick, in my experience. And you can't wait more than a second or two, either. Close, and fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done it from about 3 inches up, it's very possible. You just need to get it nice and smokey without any air currents so that there is a long stretch of smoke undergoing laminar flow. Once the smoke becomes turbulent you're too high up for it to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't tried it in a long time but I used to play around with it all the time. If I recall correctly, the timing and placement of the lit match are critical.  If you wait too long after extinguishing the wick, the vapor trail dissipates and if the match is held too high above the wick the flame won't jump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whelp, TIL how a candle works. I've always thought that the wick burns and makes the candle, and the wax melting and evaporating was just a way to slow down the wick from burning (no pulling of the wax into the wick for evaporation). Though, to be fair, I doubt I've really ever put much thought into how one worked anyhow.</p></div>		</li>
