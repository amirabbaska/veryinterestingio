<p>If it's not made out of metal, wood, or 100% cotton, it's got a little oil in it somewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if it is made of those things, they were likely produced using things which depends on, or are derived from, oil.  Gotta think about the entire supply chain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a saying we geologists use. </p>
<p>&quot;If it can't be grown, it needs to be mined.&quot;</p>
<p>Oil falls in that category. A surprising amount of people don't realize this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's an interesting thought.</p>
<p>Mined or recycled, but while most common metals and many rare earth metals can be recycled reasonably efficiently, the many uses of oil can't really. Plus, we spend a lot of oil on recycling processes.</p>
<p>We need oil for stuff. We can use solar for moving stuff around.</p></div>		</li>
