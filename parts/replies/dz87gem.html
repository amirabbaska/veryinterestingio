			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't mean to make it seem like I quit cold turkey, I more meant to say that I wasn't expecting anything more than a mild discomfort. I tapered off for 3 months before I quit completely, but like my doctor said at the time, the worst is the weeks after you quit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh.. Your doctors didn't inform you? I've been informed several times by several different health personnel about the withdrawal. And it shouldn't really be a problem if one tapers over a few months. Long enough taper should lead to practically 0 withdrawal symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All my doctor told me was that it could be uncomfortable. Never <em>how</em> uncomfortable it could be, but I think the reason she didn't tell me that was more along the lines of it being a different experience from person to person than anything else. It's hard to predict how hard the withdrawal will hit someone. </p>
<p>Also, I suspect, she wanted to avoid nocebo-effect, which is actually more common than people think. </p>
<p>I spent 3 months tapering off, and didn't think much about it until I came to the last few weeks. The last week or so was the worst of it. I felt feverish, I slept horribly, I was on edge, and oversensitive to touch. I was dizzy, and I completely lost my sense of balance at times. </p>
<p>According to my doctor, the majority of symptoms of withdrawal are the worst in the week following your last dose, regardless of how quickly you've tapered off. If you didn't have any symptoms at all, you most likely wouldn't have suffered a lot of issues even if you tapered off quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it kicks in quick!  I’ve been on antidepressants where it would take a couple of days.  I always dealt Effexor withdrawal within several hours.  I knew people who would start to get sick of their dosage was off by an hour!</p>
<p>Great antidepressant, but damn does the withdrawal suck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been on 20mg citalopram for nigh on a decade and have been coming off them for about 2 months now and took the last one about a month ago. Brain zaps are wild, is this is a brain chemistry thing? The half life of the tablet is about 35 hours so it’s well and truly out of my system. </p>
<p>So you’re saying that one, and only one single fluoxetine will rid me of this awful experience?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure it would've helped me coming off of zoloft, because the halflife of prozac is about a week, but my withdrawals lasted 4 weeks and didn't get bad until week 3. And I still get bursts of anger from being off that almost a month after the withdrawals ended.</p></div>		</li>
