			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, put another way: doing something easy is hard and doing something hard is easy.  Solving a math problem that you know no one else around could?  Super rewarding, piece of cake.  Doing the dishes?  Might as well be climbing Mount Everest, except that would be easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the downsides with <em>none</em> of the upsides.</p>
<p>If I'm not medicated, it is so uncomfortable to sit and work on something or do anything menial. I'm not claustrophobic but that's the best way I can describe how it feels - like I'm trapped in that task and just want to escape from it. My body wants to escape, my mind wants to escape.</p>
<p>But if I'm medicated it's no big deal and I can sit and work for hours at a time without even realizing it has been hours and I haven't eaten anything since 8pm last night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody knows.  u/Wrenigade mentioned that parts of the brain in people with ADHD are underdeveloped, but it's really not known if that's a <em>cause</em> of ADHD, or an <em>effect.</em> It's well-known that brain areas associated with certain functions can grow or shrink based on whether someone utilizes those functions it not, so the underdeveloped parts of the brain that are associated with ADHD may be underdeveloped because someone with ADHD doesn't use them as much as someone without.  We just don't know.</p>
<p>As to the issue of phenethylamine itself, I'm not entirely sure.  It's a neuromodulator, which means it's a sort of meta-neurotransmitter.  What it does, how it does it, and why it did it in the first place are incompletely understood, and what is understood is extremely complex.</p>
<p>You're asking the right questions, but they're the sort of questions that people write dissertations and books about, and get Nobel prizes for answering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, its likely that ADHD has a multitude of causes with a commonality of a screwed up dopamine cycle, so if a structural brain abnormality were shown to be a definite cause, the absence of the abnormality might not indicate the absence of the disease. Really, its a host of diseases with a common treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADHD is characterized by an imbalance in dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. There is evidence that there is a deficiency of PEA in children with ADHD. PEA's role is to stimulate the release dopamine and norepinephrine, so it makes sense that people with a deficiency in both those neurotransmitters  also have a deficiency in PEA. That being said, I don't think it's that simple and there are probably more effects at play.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It's effects are similar but its coming from the opposite direction.</p>
<p>As a barely suitable analogy, imagine you have a leaky tire. There are 2 treatments you could use.</p>
<p>1) Apply an air pump to try to push air in faster than it's being lost (amphetamine)</p>
<p>2) Try to patch the hole a bit so the air that is in there sticks around longer (methylphenidate)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this. My analogy has always been:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flooding the fields with a limited water supply (amphetamine)</li>
<li>Irrigating the fields (methylphenidate)</li>
</ol>
<p>It may be a biased analogy because I like methylphenidate better for focus, although I cycle with amphetamine so I don’t feel like a productivity zombie all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its sort of a weird drug because it can mimic the action of phenethylamine, but it can also mimic the action of another neurotransmitter called &quot;piperidine.&quot; Piperidine receptors are targeted by antipsychotics, vasodilators, and a variety of other stuff.</p></div>		</li>
