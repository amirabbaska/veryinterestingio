			<div class="markdown"><p>Either refrigeration or a perfect seal are required to prevent botulism, yeah?</p>
<p>I pickled some corn not too long ago.  I think you need some air for decent fermentation.  Wish I had refrigerated.  Didn't consider botulism until after I ate it all :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effect wouldn't start until after you had already closed the door. But if the fridge was sealed perfectly, you might expect the door to pop open at some point after you closed it. Of course, almost no fridge is perfectly sealed, so what would actually happen is air would slowly just escape from the leaks in the fridge.</p></div>		</li>
