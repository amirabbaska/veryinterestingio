			<div class="markdown"><p>The benefit is this:  you can't go to the bank if you work a day job.  Banks are open at the same time most people work.  In my country, most &quot;day jobs&quot; are from 8-5.  Most banks are open from 9-5, and until noon on Saturdays.  Want to go to the bank?  Call in sick, or don't expect to sleep late on your weekend off.  When I worked &quot;normal hours&quot; at a &quot;normal job&quot; I had to do direct deposit of my checks and my bank transactions were limited to the ATM.  </p></div>		</li>
