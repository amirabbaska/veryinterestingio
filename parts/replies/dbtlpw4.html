			<div class="markdown"><p>The diode is the important part, but you do want a low power LED. The voltage drop on the diode is critical and germanium diodes work well. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNJVhzOjWgU" target="_blank">This guy made one and uploaded to youtube</a></p>
<p>the unclipped legs of the components act like an antenna, and the LED and diode combine to form a simple rectifier, which converts alternating current and converts some of it to direct current, which will light the LED. This is also how crystal radios operate. </p></div>		</li>
