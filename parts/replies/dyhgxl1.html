			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe so.  The first animals to appear on land were millipedes, or some close relative.  Some of them evolved to be almost 2 metres in length.  The sea was probably the scariest place to be, with predatory sea scorpions (a close cousin to the arachnids) reaching 2.5 metres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right? Millipedes are just like long pillbugs though, decomposers. I'd be more afraid of whatever centipedes there were. Those things are hunters made of poison!

Some eurypterids for you. (The smallest, megarachne was first thought a spider, hence the name) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>150 million years ago oxygen levels on earth were close to 32% vs today at 21%. Ancient insects were able to grow bigger because of more readily available oxygen but there was a cap to size due to the passive nature of the distribution of oxygen in their systems. There are fossils of dragonflies that have 2 foot wing spans. Although, that doesn't necessarily mean giant spiders were running around but the environment would have been ripe for increased size except for the caveat of predation from early birds. There are giant spiders right now in the Amazon that are over 1 ft across so potentially even bigger species existed in the past. </p></div>		</li>
