			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. Gyres typically don't get much rainfall, but they still only qualify as a ocean desert if they get less than 10in of rain a year. Likewise, ocean deserts get less than 10in of rain a year, but aren't necessarily part of a gyre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The edges of a gyre may recirculate pretty well, but as you get closer towards the center, the water moves less and less. If it were a perfect vortex, you would have a single point of water at the center that is literally just spinning in place. Obviously, that's not the case, but I think it illustrates the point pretty well.</p>
<p>As you move towards the center of a gyre, water following the currents won't move as far from the center. Ultimately, you end up with a gradient that gets warmer and saltier as you move closer to the center of the gyre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you mentioned there will be a gradient of temperature and 'saltiness', does that mean there will always be a source of heat or salt around the center, or one step further, the source of heat or salt is necessary for/the reason of the existence of the 'gyres'?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're talking about structures that are <a href="http://www.seos-project.eu/modules/oceancurrents/images/global_currents.png" target="_blank">hundreds to thousands of miles in diameter</a>, not storm-sized but ocean-sized. Circulation is driven by large movements like the Gulf Stream or global trade winds passing in opposite directions a thousand miles apart. The [Pacific Garbage Patch] is not a whirlpool full of trash, but &quot;one side of the globe&quot; full of trash that washed out from the beach and will swirl around out there forever. A raft on the edge may end up in Japan or Alaska, but a raft in the middle will never see land again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has anyone mentioned the massive amounts of plastic and trash that accumulate in ocean gyres? They're not just a high salinity and low nutrient areas anymore...there are whole trash islands inside of these gyres. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is apparently larger than the size of the state of Texas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, doldrums are due to two occurrences. The trade winds of the Northern and Southern hemispheres collide running directly into each other.</p>
<p>The other is the equator area gets intense heating from the Sun. Warm air rises. </p>
<p>So what happens is the trade winds collide, slow down, and rise away from the surface of the ocean. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're close to each other. Think of the doldrums as a slow moving walkway at an airport that only has a wall on one side. When it's crowded, people/things will be shuffled off the slow current onto the non moving flat ground, those are the gyres. </p>
<p>Gyres also roomba up a lot of the ocean's little bits of plastic. Think of them like Hometown Buffet vegetable beef soup right at the end of the night. No animals left, extra salty, and just a bunch of little floating bits of indistinguishable material you can dredge up from just below the surface. The famous Pacific Garbage Patch is a gyre. </p></div>		</li>
