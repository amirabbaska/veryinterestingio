</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but if the venous pO2 is 40mmHg, you wouldn't be <em>losing</em> oxygen. You would just be not replenishing it.</p>
<p>I think the key is that, at a normal altitude, when you hold your breath your lungs have a reservoir of air that contains some oxygen that you can draw from for a while, extending how long you have enough oxygen in your blood to stay conscious.</p>
<p>At a high altitude, your lungs get depleted of the high-pO2 air they had. So I guess, in theory, you may last longer by holding your breath even for altitudes of a pO2 around 40 mmHg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes that's true (I've corrected my above explanation, so thanks!). If, however, you very rapidly went from an environment with a normal pO2 to an environment with a very low pO2 (i.e. lower than what your blood has), the oxygen from your blood would diffuse into the air rather than the other way around, and eventually the blood pO2 would be balance out with the pO2 in the air (but also you'd die :-P )</p>
<p>Venous pO2 isn't exactly 40mmHg at all times, it's still dependent on atmospheric pO2 (or more correctly, alveolar pO2) as well as how quickly your cells are consuming oxygen from the blood</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a separate reason you do poorly at altitude.  Technically you can get your mixed venous down to nearly 30% (PO2 20 or so, and possibly slightly lower if you are a little acidotic); people do this with exercise all the time - extraction goes way up, venous sats reach the lowest possible, lactate production starts etc.</p>
<p>Sick people do this too: in heart failure we see venous sats of 30 to 40% sometimes in folks just lying still.</p>
<p>At rest normally, however, given an O2 consumption of say 250 ml per min and O2 delivery of say 1000 ml per min (typical 70kg person),  this should allow an arterial sat of only 50 to 60% to be survivable.</p>
<p>However, its not.  Partly because at sats &lt; 90%, you get some pulmonary artery vasoconstriction, and this will get extreme at lower sats putting a huge strain on the heart and lowering cardiac output.  Thus no more 1000 ml per minute O2 delivery due to BOTH hypoxia and a drop in cardiac output (DO2 = 13.9 x CO x hemoglobin x saturation )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that describe the scenario of an airplane suddenly losing pressure due to a hole in the chassis while in the air? I wouldnâ€™t think people would die from that sudden change right? Maybe a popped ear drum</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong, but I think that an additional part of why you can hold your breath underwater longer than TUC at 10,000' is due partly to Boyle's law.</p>
<p>At 10,000 feet, the available molecules of oxygen in a person's lungs (tidal volume I think) would be less than the available molecules of oxygen in the same tidal volume at sea level.</p>
<p>So in addition to the reduced pressure, you'd have less actual molecules of oxygen available.</p>
<p>Or maybe that is what you already described above and I'm just stating it in a different way. But I <em>think</em> what you stated above was Dalton's law?</p>
<p>.... Assuming temperature would be the same at elevation... Which it's not.</p>
<p>Just my thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;available molecules of oxygen&quot; is equivalent to the partial pressure of oxygen, so you're describing the same thing with other words.</p>
<p>Boyle's is the law for partial pressure, and Dalton's is the relationship between volume, pressure and temperature? If so, they are very related, Boyle's is like the equivalent of Dalton's for mixture of gases.</p></div>		</li>
