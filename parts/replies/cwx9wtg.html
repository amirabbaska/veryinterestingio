<p>The problem is when it comes to governmental policies, there's no lab to experiment in. Hard sciences can do that, soft sciences can't.</p>

<p>Speaking as a scientist, I'd argue that's not the main issue.  That kind of controlled experimentation is impossible in a lot of sciences--most of astronomy, paleontology, a fair amount of ecology and some other aspects of biology, geology, and of course some (but not all) soft sciences.  And even when experimentation is possible, it's not possible in the real world to control for all variables.  But we've got good statistical and observational methodologies to deal with that.</p>
<p>I'd propose that the difficulties with minimum wage have a lot less to do with experimental design and a lot more to do with the fact that people are invested, both monetarily and personally, in the findings.  Nobody really cares whether a certain class of stars turns out to be old or young.  But people care a lot about what minimum wage is best, not only because they may have money riding on the outcome, but because they've constructed a whole worldview that depends on certain facts being true.  This keeps people from being objective.</p>
<p>Edit:  Plus, it's complicated.  I'm kind of an ecologist.  Ecology is hella complicated.  Economics is ecology where the participants are sapient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way the United States was designed, we were supposed to have 50 'labs' to test out variables, if you will. Its kinda like DNA, and biological diversity/natural selection: It was designed so different law codes, give different results, and states could learn from eachother, &quot;pass on&quot; their law codes to those that might listen. Good laws would thrive, and cause their states to do well, bad laws, the opposite. Unfortunately, so often people want their ideas or laws passed on a national level, which significantly reduces the political diversity, and thus the potential of testing different policies among the states. Sometimes it still gets done, and sometimes it gets really messy with states and fed writing laws in different directions, when the states try to say 'hey fed, read amendment 10 again will you'. But most of the time, the fed hangs money out the window to force the states into uniformity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once we changed Senators to being elected directly by the people, States lost all their power.  The senators aren't there to represent <em>the people</em>.  People already have a house, with more evenly distributed representatives.  The Senators are supposed to be there to give the O.K. to the Federal Government by the states - to agree that the states don't mind the Federal Government taking authority, responsibility, and power over this issue or that.</p>
<p>Now they're just lop-sided, tenured, super-representatives.  It was a stupid move and we should really change it back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>okay... but... that's not the case with the minimum wage. Most states have their own minimum wage that is higher than the federal minimum, and many localities have even higher minimum wages. Do we have the results from these experiments?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might not be an expert, but I'm pretty sure very few legitimate people in science are debating evolution, climate change, the efficacy of abstinence-based sex-ed... etc.</p>
<p>But I get your point - that science is meant to be debated.</p></div>		</li>
