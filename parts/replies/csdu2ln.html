			<div class="markdown"><p>There is. Black holes give off electromagnetic radiation, which is produced through pair production. The most basic way to put it, is by imagining a particle travelling along the event horizon. Then that particle splits into a particle-anti particle pair. One of those new particles falls into the black hole, and the other escapes due to quantum effects. This decreases the mass of the black hole. The radiation doesn't come from the black hole itself, but from virtual particles being pushed into existing as real particles by the black hole. If you want to know more look up Hawking Radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, that works but you'd come out looking like a soup of photons that make up a load of microwave noise vaguely resembling an experimental heavy metal recording that was assaulted by a slug, and it takes you about a quadrillion years per photon to get out. Not a very attractive prospect to someone who worries about bad hair days and being late for soccer practice.</p></div>		</li>
