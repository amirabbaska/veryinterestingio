			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely the latter and possibly the former, but really it's just to early to know. Whereas much of the quantum world in relation to the standard model and how it relates to strong and weak forces, etc., has been mostly proven out via particle accelerator experiments, the mechanics of gravity are still largely hypothetical. We've had recent success observing gravitational waves, but we don't even really have a quantum model that would explain how gravity happens that we can test for. We're a long way yet from fully understanding gravity, and longer still from knowing if it can be manipulated. </p></div>		</li>
