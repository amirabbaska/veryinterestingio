			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I understand what you're saying correctly - There is no maximum temperature, because at really high temperatures, regardless of how much energy you put into the system the entropy only changes by a small amount?</p>
<p>So does that mean at really high temperatures the rate of change of temperature with energy input gets smaller and smaller?</p>
<p>Also, on a related note - How do you define the lowest possible temperature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that there is no maximum temperature comes from the fact that as you put more and more energy into certain systems, the entropy will reach a turning point. Not <em>just</em> because the entropy changes by a small amount, but because there is a point where it doesn't change at all. </p>

<p>It doesn't necessarily imply this, no. Usually it's true - but that's due to the fact that with more energy, you make more states available. </p>

<p>The bottom of the temperature scale, for the positive values, is absolute zero. 0K. But this, like the speed of light, is a limiting value. You can approach it, but can't actually reach it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lowest possible temperature to regular folks it's the point at which atoms stop moving completely. I'm also deducting from what the right honorable gentleman said above us, that energy added at that point would obliterate said thing at said temperature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'laymans' explanation of temperature would imply its when the atoms stop moving, but that misses a lot of what temperature is.</p>
<p>Its not that it would obliterate it - you just cannot reach absolute zero. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a minimum positive temperature - 0K. But there isn't a minimum negative temperature. Absolute zero isn't actually achievable, but is the limiting value. You could approach it and get really, really close. But like the speed of light, you can't actually get there. </p></div>		</li>
