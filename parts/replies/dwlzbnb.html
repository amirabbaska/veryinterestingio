			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed some sites will re-read publish old articles and it'll appear new because it has a new headline and is &quot;today's article&quot;. But then, lo and behold, a 2 year old publish date near the top or at the end. Thankfully my biggest qualm has been with Cracked, a comedy site. When I see old news posted to Facebook, it's pretty much always shared by an undiscerning individual instead of by a news source's page. </p></div>		</li>
