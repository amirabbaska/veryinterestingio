			<div class="markdown"><p>Man that's weird. At my hospital you get CD's with your x-rays on it free and your medical records free. Like all it costs the hospital, at least for the paperwork, is the paper and ink. In EPIC (a very common hospital info program) you can just one click print a bunch of stuff for the patient. Maybe that's just Arizona but that feels scummy to me since you have a right to that information since it's yours, by law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tech in ophthalmology. We started charging for FMLA paperwork recently because they take a ridiculous amount of time and effort to fill out! I recently had to write out the dates of every single appointment this patient had had in the past ~5 years (it got rejected and sent back to us because we did not give all of the dates). The patient came in at least monthly for a couple of those years. They also ask for speculation and some questions that only the doctor is able to answer. </p>
<p>We do not charge for records - that doesnâ€™t seem legal. My last office charged $6 for CDs of the images... I always thought that was bullshit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The office I used to work at charged $25 for the first 20 pages of your records and $0.50 per page after that. This was charged to patients and lawyers. Other doctors offices were not charged and if the state requests it for a disability claim, they would normally pay a set fee of $18 regardless of the amount of records, but this was their choice.</p>
<p>I disliked this policy and had not seen it at other offices in my town, so I would normally give records to patients for free if they asked for a single test result or MRI scan. If they requested their entire chart, I had no choice but to charge them because my physician would get suspicious of me printing 50+ pages, but I would often advise them of the cost and suggest that they have another doctor request them and get them from their PCP for free. </p>
<p>Stupid policy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Few choices in a small town. Florida law does require medical records to be given, but it doesn't always happen. The local hospital has flat out refused to give me a record of a procedure I had done. They also lied to me (in advance) about the cost. </p>
<p>Elsewhere is a significant distance away.</p>
<p>This area is basically all tied up in monopolies. Not just medicine. </p></div>		</li>
