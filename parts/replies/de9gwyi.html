			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. Never saw this article. Weird that boys were actually made to look very much like little girls and practical considerations do not explain this fully.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ponder though if it was more of dressing then as girls as much as gender ambiguity being more commonplace for children then. Perhaps the practicality came from simpler changing of dirty linens or less protective diaper methods so more easily soiled pants? Such strict baby gender norms came much later. But yes, I do agree it was quit the odd time for little kids.</p></div>		</li>
