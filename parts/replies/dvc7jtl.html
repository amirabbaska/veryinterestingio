			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been on the floor of a hospital moaning and dry heaving waiting for someone to see me. Turned out it was a 9mm infected kidney stone stuck in my ureter. My kidney was in bad shape they did emergency surgery to unplug it with a stent. I spent six weeks with that stent for my ureter to heal. After they removed the stone with a laser it was another six weeks with another stent so my ureter wouldn't collapse. The last stent removal was in his office. They slide a grabber device up you into your bladder then pull it out. It's been years and I still tear up in apprehension if I get any back pain at all. </p></div>		</li>
