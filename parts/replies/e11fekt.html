<p>But what if I told you I could <em>guarantee</em> you can do it in only eight shuffles?</p>

<p>Yep. I have actually done this, I riffled shuffled a new deck back into perfect order. Then struggled for years to convince people that it had happened.</p>
<p>You see, at the time (1992) I was learning card manipulation and magic. Riffle shuffles are the coolest looking shuffles so I practiced them obsessively. In a riffle shuffle the deck is split into two equal sized packets and the thumbs are used to &quot;riffle&quot; the packets together in an A,B,A,B ... order.  I always had a deck of cards nearby and constantly practised.</p>
<p>So one day I opened a new deck, took out the <del>jacks</del> Jokers, riffle shuffled a few times and then absent-mindedly a few more, then fanned the &quot;shuffled&quot; cards. The deck was back in order.</p>
<p>Of course, the riffle shuffle is not a shuffle at all, it is more of a &quot;dosey doe your partner&quot; cycling of cards. </p>
<p>I had to wait for the internet to be invented to find out that I am not truly magical and cannot defy entropy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I assume you mean jokers, otherwise I have no idea what game you were playing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The game I was playing was called &quot;<em>get really high and shuffle a deck for 45 minutes while listening to Pink Floyd and tell myself it's for a thing</em>&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is the point of a perfect Faro shuffle (of which there are the in and out variants), you can exactly layer the two packets in the A,B,A,B order every time. This creates some cool effects, like a neat 'unshuffle' where you can return a seemingly shuffled deck back to normal (like you managed to do with some perfect riffles), or as a way to easily manipulate an ordered deck into other useful orders. Also provides a neat way to practice Faros, as you can tell if you've done it right when the deck returns back to perfect order every 8 shuffles.</p>
<p>Though I would argue that most riffle shuffles are shuffles, (imperfect layering, etc) and that Faro shuffles ending with a bridge look a little cooler</p></div>		</li>

<p>I agree that an <em>imperfect</em> riffle shuffle is a shuffle, but is the perfect riffle a shuffle?<br />
A puzzler!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have also done this, although in a much more boring way.</p>
<p>Many years ago as a first year undergraduate I wrote a simple blackjack simulator.  I decided I wanted to &quot;simulate&quot; a riffle shuffle, and naively implemented an out shuffle, only to learn the hard way that this doesn't randomize the cards.  While I knew I could randomize using random pair swaps, I became somewhat interested in the mechanics of randomization via riffle shuffles, and played around with various &quot;shuffling algorithms&quot; to run a bunch of experiments with.  Implemented things such as one-to-three card drops, uneven numbers of cards after the cut, randomizing which side drops first, etc.</p></div>		</li>
