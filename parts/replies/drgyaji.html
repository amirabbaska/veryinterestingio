<p>How majestic it would've been to see those noble beasts stalking the prairies of north america. Don't forget about the ancient alaskan lions, those guys were nuts. ooh ooh and the swamp lions of florida, oh man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, if xiagen had said &quot;The <strong>cat</strong> was one of the most widespread mammals not too long ago&quot; then I'd agree. But I'm skeptical that <em>lions</em> (specifically) ever had a more widespread presence (geographically) than humans. But I could be wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a (mountain) lion that lives behind my house. Neighbors witnessed it snag their pet cat right out of their yard. It's a fun idea until you have to bring the garbage cans up at night and your imagination goes off at every rustle of a leaf lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people confuse &quot;Lion&quot; with &quot;african maned lions&quot; which were savannah dwellers... when really Lion is <em>usually</em> more akin to &quot;mountain lion&quot;; in other words &quot;big forest cat&quot; eg things like puma's, jaguars, leopards and lynx.</p>
<p>They wouldn't be roaming the plains or prairies of north america, that's wolf territory. They stick to forests because wolves don't climb trees, and bears aren't as good at it as they are.</p></div>		</li>
