			<div class="markdown"><p>Though I agree with your response for say, hallucinogens, I can't say I agree here for weed. I don't consider myself an overall anxious or stressed person. I loved weed for a very long time and used to smoke all day, every day. Then I quit for awhile to save some money up. After that, it all went downhill. I can't smoke anymore because it gives me massive social anxiety and I lose my ability to speak. I'm fairly a outgoing and confident person otherwise. I don't get it, but I don't care to - it's not worth it for me to hit the pipe anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely can't use pot if i'm around any people at all. I get the worst anxiety, and like you said, lose my ability to talk or interact with people at all.</p>
<p>If I use it when i'm by myself though, it can actually be enjoyable. If i'm chilling playing games or listening to music by myself, it can be great. Also having a beer or two helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to disagree with you and even say your answer is a little lazy and condescending. </p>
<p>I am very relaxed overall but marijuana always gave me intense paranoia, racing heart, feelings like my bones were too brittle and would break if I moved, hypochondria, jitters, huge anxiety. I didn't understand how anyone found it enjoyable. </p>
<p>And this wasn't one bad experience or tainted product either. This is dozens of attempts over 15 or 20 years.</p>
<p>I've used many many other substances and never experienced this with any other substance. There is something physiological happening there, not just the user being an anxious person. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't true. In some people it triggers anxiety. It has something to do with THC's pharmacology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this one. I have almost 0 anxiety, and I've been like that my whole life. One hit and I feel like my world is crumbling around me even if I'm in the best mindset and my own home with noting bad going on. </p></div>		</li>
