			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a close link between production (by companies) and consumption (by individuals), and both are important to consider for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
<p>Individuals definitely play a big role in the climate; more than 60% of global GHG emissions come from household consumption choices, primarily mobility, shelter, and food [Ivanova et al., 2016]
(<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12371/epdf" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12371/epdf</a>).  </p>
<p>It’s also true that the majority of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have come from burning fossil fuels, and these can be traced to the companies that produced them, with 63% of cumulative emissions in the atmosphere traceable to 90 companies [Heede 2014] (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0986-y" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0986-y</a>). There’s a nice [visualization in the Guardian] (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2013/nov/20/which-fossil-fuel-companies-responsible-climate-change-interactive" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2013/nov/20/which-fossil-fuel-companies-responsible-climate-change-interactive</a>) of these data. </p>
<p>Keeping fossil fuels in the ground is critical to meet the below 2° climate [Meinshausen et al., 2009] (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08017" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08017</a>); [McGlade and Ekins, 2015] (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14016" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14016</a>), and one important way to do this is by making sustainable lifestyle choices to reduce the demand for fossil fuels. </p>
<p>Political action can definitely be an important way for individuals to act collectively and make an important climate impact, but we weren’t able to quantify this impact (in tons of greenhouse gases saved), so we couldn’t include it in this study. The divestment movement is an important example of boycotting that is having a big impact. </p>
<p>Informed spending is another strategy, but previous studies have shown that the climate impact from the direct consumption of “stuff” (e.g., clothing, electronics, household goods etc.) tends to be smaller than transport, housing (electricity &amp; heating), or food. Therefore, making informed spending choices on stuff is not as high-impact as focusing on avoiding flying, living car-free, or eating a plant-based diet.</p>
<p>For example, a US household study by [Jones &amp; Kammen, 2011] (<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es102221h" target="_blank">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es102221h</a>) showed that transport was about 30% of household greenhouse gas emissions, housing (mostly electricity &amp; heating) 27%, food 15%, and “stuff” only about 12% (see their Figure 1). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume all figures you provide in your answers are in relative terms.</p>
<p>I'm curious what kind of impact would an individual have in absolute terms. For example a train will leave the station even if it's empty. Similar for an airplane, it will take off regardless of being full or half-empty. These things are on the level that probably no realistic number of individual initiative will have an impact on and it's something that only governments or the companies themselves can change.</p>
<p>In light of these scenarios, how does my individual impact on CO2 emissions change?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are people reading the research underpinning the basic claims in this AMA?  I make no claims to having a PhD, but why is no one challenging one of the fundamental arguments presented here?  The authors are positing that because the supply chains necessary to maintain a house/have a child/eat meat account for a majority of global GHG we should stop doing those things because that would have the greatest impact.  </p>
<p>This is like noticing that your arm is infected and all the systems (vessels/blood/nerves) are negatively impacting you due to the infection so clearly the most effective solution is to cut off your arm.</p>
<p>It definitely would have a huge impact, in fact in the majority of cases if you do it early enough and in a proper way, you will remove the infection and any chance of it causing damage to the rest of the body.  But, shockingly, and seemingly unnoticed, you will no longer have an arm. </p>
<p>In these specific scenarios relating to climate change you aren't even chopping off the arm!  You're removing the finger and assuming that that will have an impact on the underlying structures.  Yes, if everyone lops off a piece it will have a broader impact, but at that point why not go for the deeper fix anyways.</p>
<p>In this analogy, it makes much more sense to me to try and keep your arm and try to change the underlying mechanisms that are causing/connected to the infection.</p>
<p>We need to recognize systems we use are the primary polluters and that the answer is not to stop seeking the products/lifestyle/children we desire, but in fact to accomplish these passions in a way that is in balance with our environment.  If you imagine that you as an individual on a small scale are somehow altering the trajectory of global warming by not driving, it seems like you have fallen for the faulty logic presented here.</p>
<p>You can look at the only country that has gone the one child path or simply lack of sustainable population to see the dangers to society. Obviously, if you already assume less humanity is a good/necessary thing or being down an arm isn't really a big deal, or global communities having access to efficient transport, or the elderly being able to get around aren't important it's a moot point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your argument is that we shouldn't stop doing these things, we should find technological improvements to reduce their impact on the environment instead. See this  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7bsv2d/askscience_ama_series_we_are_climate_scientists/dpkmab8" target="_blank">question and answer</a>  which discusses the feasibility of some such improvements.</p>
<p>Choosing to not have a child, or to have fewer children, is something I can do now to have an immediate, ongoing, and quite large impact. That is not at all analogous to cutting off my arm. Even waiting until you're older to have children would have some impact.</p>
<p>Nobody said we had to legislate (eg China). Individuals can make a personal responsible decision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voting should be at the very top. Political action is the only way to make meaningful change, (that's actually the whole damn point of politics, collective action for the benefit of all), I'm pretty convinced  this &quot;lifestyle activism&quot; mainly give you good conscience while human civilization rush full speed toward a big hard wall. We know how humans work, saying &quot;we ought to do this&quot; won't work if the material conditions we're in don't push us towards it. Sadly most our political systems have been enslaved to economic interests. But maybe when some countries sink below sea, we will wake up. Too late probably (it already is afaik).</p></div>		</li>
