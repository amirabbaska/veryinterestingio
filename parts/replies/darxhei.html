			<div class="markdown"><p>Momentum is specifically a conserved quantity relating to the fact that physics is the same at every point in space. We derive such a momentum from the Noether theorem, and in general it's called the canonical momentum of a system. It's the quantity that keeps an object moving in a straight line along a path where the laws of physics are the same. If the laws change mid way, such as by introducing a force of some kind or more specifically having something block the path, then the laws of the motion's physics are different at that point and hence the motion changes. In a sense, momentum is a measure of how difficult it is to change the motion of an object.</p>
<p>In another sense, momentum is the square root of an object's energy squared minus its mass squared (relativity) up to some factors of the speed of light. That is, it's proportional to the energy related to motion of a particle.</p>
<p>Edit: an interesting side note, we can think of a particle's energy as being its &quot;time momentum,&quot; or the canonical momentum associated with the fact that the laws of physics are the same from second to second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry if I am not understanding this properly. </p>
<p>Most people understand the newtonian form of momentum, mass times velocity, so we cannot measure momentum of a massless object (e.g. light particle). </p>
<p>But you are saying momentum is also a function of energy. But energy is mass times the speed of light squared (and assuming mass is zero) plus momentum times the speed of light... So how do we determine momentum of a massless object? Is knowing the energy of the massless object a requisite for determining its momentum? </p>
<p>Again sorry for the confusion, your explanation is great I'm just not getting the full picture from it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Momentum isn't independent of mass and velocity at all, it just has a different functional form than you thought for a particle with mass:</p>
<p>p = mv*gamma</p>
<p>Where gamma=1/sqrt(1-(v/c)^(2)).</p>
<p>Since gamma is very close to 1 when v&lt;&lt;c, you can see why the Newtonian approximation works so well. </p>
<p>If you understand how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula" target="_blank">different inertial observers measure velocity of the same object in special relativity</a>, then you can verify that relativistic momentum is conserved in every reference frame. The Newtonian momentum is not conserved.</p>
<p>For massless particles like light, that formula is problematic because if v=c then gamma=1/0, and momentum is undefined. Here it helps to use the energy-momentum relationship that u/Rannasha used to derive the momentum of the photon as p=E/c. If you know the formula for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift#Doppler_effect" target="_blank">Doppler redshift</a>, then you can confirm that momentum is conserved as you shift to different inertial frames and measure the recoil when a charged particle absorbs a photon.</p>
<p>If it helps, note that you can assume that photons have a very small mass, too small to ever make a measurable difference. They would therefore travel at a speed slightly less than c and obey the first equation I wrote for momentum perfectly. As long as the mass of the photon was small enough, we would have no way to detect the difference. Currently a photon mass of up to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.1003v5.pdf" target="_blank">10^-27 eV or so</a> would be completely consistent with all our observations, so this remains a possibility.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That looks like some unit circle calculation(pythagorem theorem) where the relativistic part is a different dimension. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is, but the correct way to write in that context is</p>
<p>(E/c)² - <strong>p</strong>² = (mc)²</p>
<p>where the left is to be understood as the Minkowski norm (the &quot;length&quot;) of the 4-momentum (the space-time equivalent of the linear momentum).</p></div>		</li>
