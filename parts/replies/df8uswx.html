			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there's a Smarter Every Day video where Destin meets some of the Curiosity engineers and the full scale model they keep on Earth for reference.  </p>
<p>That was the first time I realised how bleeding huge it is and what an achievement it was to put something the size of a VW on another planet.</p>
<p>Edited, because I am obvious not a clever guy.  Cheers /u/mogulermade</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i was at the science museum in the uk a few months ago, and they had a model of the rosetta lander. was about the size i could hold in my arms without too much problem. and i thought it was an accurate to scale model. </p>
<p>then next to it was a textured block about the same size. it took me a few moments, but it clicked, that the model was a scale one, and the block was a bit on the model but at real size. as i could see a tiny block, maybe an inch square that had the same pattern. </p>
<p><a href="http://spiff.rit.edu/richmond/asras/rosetta/lander_with_human.jpg" target="_blank">this is the model size</a> </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, they're travelling over very different terrain. <em>Curiosity</em> is transiting lots of what its handlers call in the article  &quot;'briar patches' formed of broken-up fragments of hard sandstone&quot;: basically half-buried, unweathered and sharp-edged capstone. This of course takes its biggest toll on the guiding wheels, especially considering the weight of the rover.</p>
<p>Comparative lightweight <em>Opportunity</em> has mostly travelled over sand dunes and  through gravel fields, as it explores around and between raised craters that tend to sift such stuff out of windstorms and deposit it in their lee; consequently, one of its biggest problems is constantly having dust collect on its solar panels, reducing their function.</p>
<p>To put the four successfully landed rovers in relative scale, <em>Sojourner</em> has about the dimensions of a cocker spaniel, <em>Opportunity</em> and its non-functional twin <em>Spirit</em> have about the dimensions of a large desk, and <em>Curiosity</em> has about the dimensions of a compact car: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/PIA15279_3rovers-stand_D2011_1215_D521.jpg" target="_blank">roughly 2, 5 and 10 feet long, respectively.</a> </p>
<p>It still blows my mind that they're actually rolling around on an entirely different planet. (Well, except for poor little  Sojourner. It suffered a base station malfunction after 83 sols and has been unable to send telemetry ever since; it was shut down in '97.) </p>
<p>I can't even play with the RC 4X4 I was given for Christmas, without accidentally causing it to smash into something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that not just because they would rather give an underestimate than an overestimate?</p>
<p>It makes them look better if they say 10 years and the thing runs for 12 instead of saying it should last 15 years and the thing only lasts 12</p></div>		</li>
