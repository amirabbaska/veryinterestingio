			<div class="markdown"><p>You can test this effect for yourself. If you hyperventilate for a minute or two you will clear out virtually all of the CO2 from your blood. You will find that you can hold your breath for 1-2 minutes afterwards with absolutely no urge to breathe while your body's CO2 levels return to normal. You can get the opposite by breathing the gas from a coke bottle (dilute it with air a bit or you'll get a nasty shock). If you hold that gas in your lungs for a few seconds so it can diffuse into your blood you will end up completely out of breath as if you just sprinted up 3 flights of stairs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres receptors in the brainstem that are sensitive to blood pH. The blood becomes more and more acidic as more CO2 is dissolved in blood. Beyond a certain point your reflex is to just breathe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the blood cells in your body have a very high concentration of oxygen in them at all times, so instead of measuring oxygen, your body measures levels of CO2 to decide whether or not you need to breathe - <a href="https://youtu.be/cF0rwEd05VY" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/cF0rwEd05VY</a></p></div>		</li>
