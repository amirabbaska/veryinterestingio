			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, good old neuropathy pain.  At least, it sure sounds like mine.</p>
<p>If that is going on, there are medications that help, gabapentin and the very very similar but delayed release Lyrica help with mine, though that's not the primary reason that I take them.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just a thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has happened to me for most of my life. But there's always one regular pain that happens in my abdomen, in the right side, just under the ribs, where it'll hurt real bad for a few minutes. Taking deep breaths or stretching the area by moving my body makes it worse but poking at it with my hand does almost nothing. The only way I can describe the feeling is &quot;imagine a single strand of muscle meat getting pulled over a rib and staying there for a few minutes until it suddenly snaps back into place&quot;. Whenever it happens my girlfriend thinks my appendix exploded but I always know it'll be gone like nothing happened in approximately 2 to 4 minutes. Now that I think about it, I'm overdue for another one. </p></div>		</li>
