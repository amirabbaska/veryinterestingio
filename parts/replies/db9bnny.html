			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Except that</del> To clarify your last sentence, pi is not a root to any polynomial with rational coefficients.</p>
<p>edit: I didn't think pointing out the transcendental nature of pi was so controversial. It's similar to the square root of 2, except that it's transcendental in addition to irrational, so it doesn't &quot;provide part of a perfectly rational solution&quot; the way that sqrt(2) does (interpreted as being the root of a polynomial e.g., x^2 - 2.)</p>
<p>edit 2: I realized the &quot;Except&quot; part made it sound like I was correcting the parent comment. I was just trying to clarify, not correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a better, though less helpful answer, is that it is defined that way.</p>
<p>Pi is defined as the ratio circumference of a circle to it's diameter.</p>
<p>The area of a circle is calculated by multiplying that ratio by the radius squared.</p>
<p>In the same way, the square root of 2 is defined as the number you square to get 2, pi is defined as the number that satisfies these equations.</p>
<p>Actually getting that equation is slightly more involved but can be proven by several methods (calculus and geometry, off the top of my head) to be what we see it to be, and pi, or the ratio between the circumference and the diameter, just is in that equation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfectly fine. Just pointing out that pi doesn't &quot;provide part of a perfectly rational solution&quot; the same way that sqrt(2) does. sqrt(2) is a root of x^2 - 2 = 0, a polynomial with rational coefficients. Pi is transcendental; i.e., there is no polynomial with rational coefficients which has pi as a root. You can divide the circumference of a circle by 2pi and sometimes get a rational answer, but that's slightly different from the example given. I didn't disagree that they were &quot;similar.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
