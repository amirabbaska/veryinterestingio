			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking that big breath is such a pain in the ass. You know its going to make you feel better but you've spent the last 30 seconds taking the shallowest, shortest breaths you can and its like this mental leap you need to make. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this and if I exhale all the way out the pain goes away. No more slow breathing in waiting for the pain to hit, it has worked 100%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I came here for, I get this all the time! It makes me unable to take a full deep breath for sometimes 10+ minutes at a time before suddenly going away.</p>
<p>Is someone able to explain what is really going on here?</p></div>		</li>
