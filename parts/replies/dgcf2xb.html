			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything you say is true but, why would a tech company the size of reddit even bother trying to write their own search algorithm in the first place?</p>
<p>When I've worked at plenty of companies (some large, some 2 man startups) that have needed search they have usually purchased a GSA box, stuck it in a data centre somewhere and configured it with a couple of scripts.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>No out of the box solution works at the scale Reddit operates.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, searching through every title or every comment site wide is a really, really tall order. Reddit is still a very small company compared to most super big websites (the only other comparable one would be wikipedia, who's search also sucks) and it simply doesnt have the resources to build a super efficient search engine like google is able to. That server power costs money, the development and maintenance of the code costs money, and reddit needs its server power to focus on the rest of the site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Won't the 2nd and 3rd algorithm take the same time to execute, since it will check until the end in both cases?And if implemented correctly,the 3rd would be faster than 2 actually,if it stopped once it found the &quot;water&quot;if it was in the middle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, since it is just as easy to check the last string in a text as it is to check the first, IF the text is treated as an array.</p></div>		</li>
