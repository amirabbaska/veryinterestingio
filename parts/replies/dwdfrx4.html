<p>Until cheapskates design something expecting cell resistance so they don't have to install a 0.$$ resistor.</p>
<p>Or you could put the wrong type of resistor in and have a Google Pixel engineer roast you.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em> I'd bet money that the battery industry has a long innovation cycle because they make more money that way /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See my other post - copied here  - and work the math through....</p>
<p>I dont think you quite get the source impedance thing.</p>
<p>Lets say we have a battery with an internal resistance of 1 ohm (really high) and a load of say 50 ohms, which wouldnt be unreasonable for a bit of consumer portable electronics. The battery is 1.5v.</p>
<p>This would mean the whole circuit is 51 ohms, and about 29.4 mA is drawn. As the battery has an internal resistance of 1 ohm, then we would lose 1:51th of the voltage in the cell. So the load would &quot;see&quot; 1.471 volts. Working that back in ohms law, 1.471 volts on the actual 50 ohm load is still, near as damn it 29.4mA.</p>
<p>Now, assume the battery has no resistance AT ALL. You will have 1.5v across a 50 ohm resistor. Thats approx 30.0mA. A tiny increase in current and you have the full 1.5v on the 50 ohm load.</p>
<p>Where does all the massive increase in current come from? It doesnt, as its the load resistance, not the source resistance, that controls the current. Unless you have a really high resistance battery, in which case the output would collapse under any kind of load.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Replacing alkaline batteries with NiCd is like removing resistors from the circuit. A basic application of Ohm's Law tells us that the current in the circuit will increase when resistance decreases and voltage remains the same. It's hardly unheard of for an electronic component to overheat when it's fed more current than it was designed for.</p></div>		</li>
