			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, many modern generators use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_generator" target="_blank">induction generators</a> rather than dynamos. In an induction machine, the permanent magnets are replaced with a conduvtive rotor. As the rotor move through the magnetic field generated by the stator coils, eddy currents form in the rotor, generating an opposite magnetic field. In an induction motor, the stator field is moved around the stator, moving the rotor field (and by extension the rotor) ahead of it. In an induction generator the rotor field moves the stator field, generating AC at the stator terminals. The advantage of induction machines is that they don't need heavy, fragile permanent magnets. The downside is that they require the rotor coil to be energised to start, so cannot be started by themselves. Induction motor need the rotor to be moving to run and induction generators require an outside power source to energise the coils.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is the reason many power plants can't be started &quot;cold&quot;. From what I understand, generators use capacitor banks to provide the energy required to start them, which are in turn charged from the grid. I imagine some generator will have dynamos on site to allow cold start but I don't know how common that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there is a magnet inside the belt cavity, so that as it rounds the end and non-ferrous materials are ejected, ferrous metals stick to the underside of the belt and are dropped off later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering if maybe they just put that pile here to show us and it was actually separated earlier on in the process with being magnetic, probably much easier to do that pile.</p></div>		</li>
