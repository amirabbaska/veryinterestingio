			<div class="markdown"><p>A poorly made pair of headphones or a bad source will have audio crossing over between channels so that you lose the stereo separation, essentially making it mono.</p>
<p>There are other factors that contribute to poor sound stage beyond just electrical separation, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends how the instrument is panned. If it's panned using balance and time delay, then yes, it will sound like it's in a discreet position. If it's just done using the panning knob (just changing volume balance) then not quite so much.
Very few people bother to recreate a soundstage using inter-channel delay. You will often get one or two instruments or effects done that way as a kind of sonic polish on things.
A recording of classical music performance is most likely to have things panned using delays and balance, however, simply because of the methodology of recording large orchestras. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, it depends on the style of headphone. There are closed-back which I prefer since I've been using them forever - they give the impression that the sound is coming from <em>inside</em> your head. With an open-back system, the sound seems to come from <em>around</em> you. The problem with open back systems is that, by virtue of being open, they are more susceptible to environmental sounds.</p></div>		</li>
