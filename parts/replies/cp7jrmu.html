			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you though? Unless I understand it wrong, the only way the dinosaur example works is because that light already &quot;happened&quot; on earth and reflected off of the dinosaurs so technically somewhere in space it is still traveling and able to be intercepted/observed. </p>
<p>But in terms of the future, that light didn't &quot;happen&quot; yet, so regardless of how fast you go towards earth, you'd only be able to see light that is currently happening on earth (aka the present)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't, but <em>everything else does</em>. Time included. If you're moving at a high enough velocity relative to the Earth (regardless of direction), time for you will be sped up compared to Earth, so if you were able to observe Earth you <em>would</em> effectively &quot;see it in fast forward.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If its in fast forward wouldn't that mean there are more photons per second hitting your eyes? Since the speed of light doesn't change there should always be a constant stream of photons. I can't wrap my head around this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The light is traveling at the same speed, but you're traveling toward the light at a faster speed. Just like when an ambulance is heading toward you, the sirens are higher pitched, if you're heading toward a light source at high enough speed, the light waves are hitting you more quickly. Doppler effect.</p></div>		</li>
