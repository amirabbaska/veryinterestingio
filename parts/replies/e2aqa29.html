			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm saving this comment because it saves me the trouble of having to say it myself and do the legwork. Only commentary I have is that the radionuclides are largely fission daughters and their decay products, so they won't eliminate themselves through fission, but they will reach stability through decay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure I understand the difference, would you mind elaborating / linking a source?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some isotopes are unstable, so they will spontaneously decay. This results in the release of alpha, beta, or gamma radiation, and sometimes changing into a different element. After enough time (which can mean up to billions of years), they'll reach a stable state and not be radioactive anymore.</p>
<p>A very select number of isotopes (like uranium-235) can spontaneously undergo fission. Rather than emitting a single particle and changing into a different element, they split into several parts, and a few neutrons go flying out. A nuclear reactor engineers the situation such that this fission event triggers more, and so on, such that a lot of fission is happening in one place, generating a lot of heat. Outside of the conditions of a reactor or a bomb, fission is very rare and the vast majority of radioactive particles simply decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>the amount of refractory elements (including actinides) emitted in the course of the Chernobyl accident was approximately four orders of magnitude higher than during the Fukushima accident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to clarify this for anyone unfamiliar with the terminology: &quot;Four orders of magnitude higher&quot; does not mean that Chernobyl released four times as much radioactive material as Fukushima.</p>
<p>Order of magnitude means that two numbers are in the same amount of tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. 3 is in the same order of magnitude as 8 (below ten), 15 and 91 are in the same order of magnitude (tens), and 12,345 is in the same order of magnitude as 66,783 (tens of thousands).</p>
<p>So, Chernobyl releasing <em><del>ten</del> four orders of magnitude</em> more refractory elements means that the Chernobyl accident released somewhere in the order of 10,000 times more radioactive materials into the environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chernobyl's fallout was mostly airborne and resulted in some contamination of vast areas of Eastern and Northern Europe, while most of the radioactive elements released in Fukushima were washed off into the Pacific ocean where they fairly rapidly diluted to background radiation levels. Airborne contamination did occur on Fukushima as well, but in <em>vastly</em> smaller quantities as in Chernobyl, and on much smaller area as well.</p>
<p>However, due to Japan being - shall we say - <em>slightly</em> more densely populated than rural Soviet Ukraine in 1986, the amount of affected population was actually somewhat comparable (in the same order of magnitude). Chernobyl exclusion zone is 4,143 km² and used to be home to some 120,000 people (49,360 in Pripyat alone). Fukushima  exlusion zone was 807 km² at its biggest, and by 2017 the total off-limits area had shrunken to &quot;just&quot; 371 km². Despite the much smaller size of the contaminated area, Fukushima accident still displaced about 156,000 people (as of 2013), and by some figures as many as 165,000 people altogether left the area - though this may include people who did not live in the evacuation zones but decided to move elsewhere nonetheless.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a health standpoint, it is also worth noting that the governmental response to Chernobyl was particularly mishandled, and evacuations did not start until several days afterwards, and the Soviet government refused to really acknowledge the scope of the problem, even to itself (much less to outsiders and citizens), for several days. </p>
<p>Japan's response to Fukushima by comparison was pretty proactive, some have argued even excessively so.</p>
<p>Which is only to say: there are many differences between the two situations, even beyond the technical differences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Japanese reaponse was disproportionate. No one died from radiation and no one received a medically significant dose, but hundreds of people (mainly the elderly and patients on life support) died during the evacuation.</p>
<p>If there was no evacuation, everyone stayed where they are and took simple measures to reduce their exposure (such as sleeping on the upper floor, not digging in the garden, not exercising outside, closing the windows, etc.), the consequences would be much less severe.</p>
<p>A common thread in Chernbyl and Fukushima are the psychological effects of evacuation and the feeling of absolute helplessness and lack of agency. Allowing people to choose whether to evacuate based on accurate information about the potential health risk would restore that agency. Given a choice between evacuation and 1% increase in lifetime cancer risk (200 mSv total dose), I think the majority of people would stay, but the current policy is to unconditionally evacuate everyone from all areas which exceed just 5 mSv per year additional dose.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know it's probably a typo but 10,000 times the material would be (4) orders of magnitude, not (10).</p></div>		</li>
