			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This reminds me of an old Doonesbury quip about the reporter character who interviewed Imelda Marcus' wide when she blew $7million in Paris while their country burned. Upon hearing this husband asked the reporter: ok but what she do with the rest of it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not &quot;government&quot; that is the problem, it's the groups that support shoveling money into a corporate furnace and bailing them out when they get into trouble, but then turn around and say Individuals shouldn't expect public help because they were irresponsible.</p>
<p>At this point, we shouldn't expect them to do anything else but patch their current infrastructure and keep raising prices to pay the shareholders their 10% dividend.</p>
<p>What we should do, is allow regional power cooperatives who have built smart grids with their own money to offer service as an ISP, let google roll out where ever they like, and when the current providers try to sue or prevent this competition, tell them to build their own network. When EPB did this in Chattanooga, the lowest tiered internet subscribers had speeds double and the only reason they haven't grown despite having people begging for it is </p>
<ol>
<li>Apartment complexes signing agreements with the other providers forcing the tenants to choose the non-fiber option</li>
<li>Area's nearby that could easily be served &quot;are not within EPB's service footprint&quot; but are part of another electric Co-op</li>
<li>Other service providers suing them, and the State of Tennessee suing the FCC for allowing them to operate as an ISP</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems an awful lot like the other providers have no interest in competing, and would rather sue EPB out of the ISP business, and have paid off legislators at the state and federal level to try to prevent electric cooperatives from setting up ISP's as they have no interest in building a fiber network ( can't take that risk with shareholder money ).</p>
<p>ISP's that are based on Electric cooperatives are generally run like a utility and the customers are treated as shareholders, and whenever someone figures out a way to make fiber faster, you change the boxes on the ends and call it a day - Fiber is tougher, doesn't catch on fire, and is uneffected by EMP or EMI (Electromagnetic interference). </p></div>		</li>
