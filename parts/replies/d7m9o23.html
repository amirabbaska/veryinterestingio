			<div class="markdown"><p>I write the letter r in 3 strokes in our (local?) traditional cursive. Everyone from age 6 to 12 is/was forced to write with fountain pens and I still write that way.</p>
<p>Also, capital letters like B or D are partially &quot;pushed&quot; with the pen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Can someone explain to me how to write it because I think I am dumb</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember that there is no one way to write any letter.  Most people are taught to write cursive words without lifting the pen.  They're trying to do <a href="http://www.bigactivities.com/writing/alphabet/lowercase/images/small_r_instructions.png" target="_blank">this</a></p>
<p>But unless they write very slowly and carefully, it almost always ends up looking like <a href="http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/12523667_895923697191953_1424069167_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTE3MjcyMjc5NzcyNjk4MjA0MA%3D%3D.2" target="_blank">this</a></p>
<p>A traditional nib pen cannot be &quot;pushed&quot;.  The point digs into the paper.  Therefore, you cannot write &quot;r&quot; with a single stroke.  Using 2 strokes produces something like <a href="http://freestencilletters.com/cake-stencil-letters/lowercase-r.JPG" target="_blank">this</a></p>
<p>1) the pen draws the left vertical line downwards
2) the pen is lifted back to the top
3) the pen draws a horizontal line to the right, and then cuts back downwards to the left, looping into the next letter.</p>
<p>With modern pens, #1 is actually reversed (or it's drawn twice: down and back up).  we draw the line going up.  As a result we don't produce a sharp angle at the top and the letter looks sloppy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always written my cursive &quot;r&quot; in <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ZTyao" target="_blank">three strokes</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe he's talking about printing r? That's something that only needs two strokes for either capital or lower case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhhh.  I thought it was only counted as a stroke if you lift up the pen.  :P. But yeah I'm still not seeing how the cursive r would have two strokes then.</p>
<p>Also, you write your printed rs (both cases) rather oddly.  I pull the left sided line toward me whereas you push it away.  Doesn't mean anything, just observing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think my word &quot;stroke&quot; confused people.  I meant modern writers don't pick up the pen, so they write the entire letter at once.  With a pointy nib, you can't do that.  &quot;r&quot; must be written in at least 2 separate parts.</p></div>		</li>
