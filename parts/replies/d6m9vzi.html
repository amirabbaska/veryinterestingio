			<div class="markdown"><p>Flash memory is non-volatile because it uses <a href="http://imgur.com/tDtrBNf" target="_blank">floating gate transistors</a>. For sake of simplicity, as electrons flow in a channel from source to drain you can force some electrons to the floating gate and it'll retain it's charge until they are forced through the oxide again. This is actually the reason why flash memory has limited write cycles because the process wears down the transistors over time</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot of flash memory doesn't use floating gate transistors, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_trap_flash" target="_blank">charge trap flash</a> instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, NAND flash tech will slooooooooly lose its charge. It varies depending on the specific type of flash used, such as SLC, MLC, TLC, etc, and the specific manufacturing technique used (2d, 3d, etc). But it's been found that solid state hard drives (SSDs) can become unreliable for storing data after 1 to 2 years without power. The slower flash used in usb drives is a little bit longer, but not more so, 3-4 years max before it starts suffering really bad &quot;bit rot&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically, a block of flash memory can be erased 3k to 5k times. Special blocks might go up to 100k erase cycles. You have to erase the block before you write new data to it. A single block might be 64K or 128K, depending on the drive.</p>
<p>In the most simple-stupid method, blocks are erased and reused in sequence, which will wear the first blocks out very quickly. A basic USB flash stick will be slightly smarter, using a simple wear-leveling algorithm to spread out the erases. SSDs typically get more sophisticated algorithms. In either case, bad blocks are marked off, effectively reducing the total capacity.</p>
<p>Of course, that applies to typical use, where we add a file here and delete another over there. Wear leveling is no help when we're deliberately erasing all the blocks over and over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that often, around a thousand times up to maybe 100.000 times. SSDs work around this through moving the logical position of data around on the physical storage, so that when a file is changed often this particular area of the flash storage doesn't wear down as fast.</p>
<p>For a hard drive, you look up a file and get information like &quot;it's in box 1234&quot;. (depending on the amount of data, it will be multiple boxes, not neccessarily directly connected - doesn't matter here). You go the storage room, get box 1234, and there's your data. If you write the file again, and it still fit's that one box, you put your data in box 1234 and put it back. Done.</p>
<p>On an SSD, your file system would tell you it's in box 1234, but then the SSD does a second lookup where box 1234 is currently located. The SSD's storage system would get the box for you. When you write the file again, it goes to the same abstract box, which is then put to another location in the storage room by the SSD, which keeps track of the mapping between the abstract box number and physical location. As long as there's sufficient free room in the storage, this shuffle algorithm works pretty good, and an SSD will keep up for a very, very long time, as long as it's considerably larger than the data you're putting on it. To help you with this, SSDs are built with some extra room, so you can never use the full space to always let it shuffle around a bit.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question: if you write all the data on the drive continously, there goes your data; if you choose a larger SSD to store your gigabyte, it will hold up exponentially longer. But, all in all, the number of write cycles is limited - but that's also true for HDDs, where mechanical failure can and will occur at some point in time, possibly way more catastrophic than some defect sectors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>they do wear out over time, but you dont really need to worry about it. Most drives are measured in TBW (terabytes written) and we are in the 60+ range at this point.</p>
<p>here is an article that breaks it down:

<p>How Is Digital Information Stored Without Electricity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, for one thing, people have been doing it for thousands of years, long before electricity was discovered. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_script" target="_blank">cuniform in clay tablets</a>. You may be more familiar with other systems, such as using a pen to store numbers on paper in the form of decimal digits. (I had to do a lot of that in grade school. I think youngins still do it.)</p>

<p>And If Electricity Isn't Required, Why Do GameBoy Cartridges Have Batteries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not own a GameBoy, but I would expect most cartridges would not have any batteries. The Pokemon ones may do more than just store information. For example, they may contain a clock to keep track of time even while off/unplugged. Does anything change in the game while you're not playing?</p>
<p>Another alternative is that they used some form of volatile memory, because it may have been cheaper than FLASH back in the day.</p></div>		</li>
