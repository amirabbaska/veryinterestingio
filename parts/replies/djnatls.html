			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to do a more in depth explanation of metabolites, enzymes, and temperature, but it felt like it was beyond the scope of the question. Yes they produce harmful things like oxygen radicals. The living polyps and the zooxanthellae together are responsible for color. </p></div>		</li>
