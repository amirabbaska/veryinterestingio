			<div class="markdown"><p>I need to look up a reference but it turns out that the most &quot;dangerous&quot; frequencies just happen to be around 50 or 60 Hz. We just happened to settle on some of the worst frequencies medically speaking.</p>
<p>I think they tested the voltage required to stimulate muscle contraction at various frequencies. The curve hits a minimum around 60 Hz so less voltage is needed to create a spasm. I'll edit when I find the source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just went into detail on this in reply to the top level comment, but the people citing capacitance are correct.</p>
<p>Your skin has both capacitive and resistive elements to it. When a DC voltage goes through a capacitor, it... actually doesn't. The voltage across the capacitor will be the same as the DC voltage, which means there's no &quot;pressure&quot; left after that to move electrons (create current). The freqyency comes into play because capacitors don't like charging and discharging super fast the way a wire can. So at 60 Hz, the capacitor lets the back and forth signal through, and it gets into your internal organs in this case. At 20 kHz, it instead absorbs the voltage becauze it can't charge and discharge fast enough, releasing heat.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is Ohm's law. In AC analysis, it still basically holds up, and you can think of capacitors as being high resistance at high frequencies. This means, since V=IR and the voltage is constant, current will drop proportionally to compensate for the massive resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Capacitors are low impedance at high frequencies. </p>
<p>For the case of the human body however, high frequencies just tend to flow on the outside of the resistive skin and dissipate. Of course leaving a nasty burn at the entry and exit points. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got it backwards, with regards to capacitors and AC.</p>
<p>As the frequency of an alternating current increases, a capacitor will behave increasingly like a short in your circuit while an inductor will behave increasingly like a break in your circuit.</p>
<p>As the frequency of an alternating current decreases, a capacitor will behave increasingly like a break in your circuit while an inductor will behave increasingly like a short in your circuit.</p>
<p>Capacitor = short at high frequency, break at low frequency</p>
<p>Inductor = break at high frequency, short at low frequency</p>
<p>As mentioned by many others, what you are seeing when a person touches a high frequency power source is the skin effect (here's the wikipedia for it that goes into depth on it: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect</a>). The basic gist of this is that as the frequency increases, more and more of the current will travel along the &quot;skin&quot; of the conductor rather than through the center of it. This means that in the case of a person it will literally send almost all the current through your skin when the frequency is high enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with the electric chair was that they wanted to kill effectively, but not destroy.</p>
<p>If it's just a matter of killing, then simply crank the power to ludicrous levels and absolutely obliterate the victim. Hell, enough power means you don't even need to make contact, just put them in a room next to a super high voltage wire and watch the arcs fly.</p>
<p>Clean up is gonna be a bitch though. Enjoy scrapping bits of human and carbon off the floor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, people can and usually do survive being hit by lighting. Meanwhile entire herds of sheep/reindeer/cows can be killed by a single lightning strike. The innumerable factors, biological and physical, that goes into determining the severity when living this interact with electricity is quite something. </p></div>		</li>
