			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, regular ice does melt under high pressure. But there are more types of ice that form on different pressures/temperatures, and have different crystalline structures giving them different properties</p>
<p>Check <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Phases" target="_blank">ice phases</a> for more info about those weird ices</p></div>		</li>

<p>Again, only if it's warm enough. If ice is colder than -22 C, no amount of increased pressure will cause it to melt.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/1214px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">Looking at the phase diagram</a>, that's only true if the water is between -25°C and 0°C (-13°F and 32°F). Ice that approaches about 100 MPa will have a small window of pressure where it turns liquid before refreezing at even higher pressures.</p>
<p>For water above 0°C, though, once it freezes at 2 GPa, it stays frozen at any higher pressures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An ice layer at the surface would work as well. A lower temperature and lower gas pressure makes atmospheric escape very slow as well. See Enceladus for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most definitely, if it's cold enough.</p>
<p>Saturn's moon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_(moon\)" target="_blank">Tethys</a> is a good example here - with a density of 985 kg/m^(3) (very close to Ice I and Ice XI's density of around 920 kg/m^(3)), it's almost pure ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure! That's more or less what comets are, although they're fairly dirty. They're not big enough to be entirely round, but I don't think there's a theoretical limit to keep clumping them together.</p></div>		</li>
