<p>I know this to be true as a family member used to work in the field (specialist dentistry, she got bitten... a lot).     </p>
<p>Non availability of GA causes a MASSIVE issue. With financial cuts to services over the last 10-20 years (in the UK), it's been far harder to get the go ahead for GA, and the recommendation just seemed to be 'do without'. What I think people, and I include the people who made the policy/financial decisions, don't understand - for some people any real dental work without GA is not tricky, its <em>impossible</em>. Professionals with decades of experience working specifically with people with severe autism/mental health conditions etc. will have developed an incredibly impressive toolkit of strategies and methods, but they still don't have a magic wand. For a lot of patients, if there is no GA, there is no real treatment. And that person just has to live their lives in discomfort and/or unable to eat properly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In California there is a fairly new license for dental hygienists (RDHAP) similar to a nurse practitioner for dental hygiene, which allows them to go into the homes of these groups of people SNFs 6bed homes etc. without having a dentist on site so that they can work with them in a less scary more familiar environment.  It seems to really help a lot with people who were previously only able to be seen with general anesthetic.  However last year medical cut RDHAP reimbursment rates by ~60% and over half of all licensed RDHAPs have closed their practices.  YAY POLITICS</p></div>		</li>
