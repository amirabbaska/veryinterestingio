			<div class="markdown"><p>The jury is still out for a final and definitive answer, but I suggest you look up the paper I linked as a &quot;snowball Earth&quot; reference to get an idea of the kinds of changes we're talking about. Essentially, Earth's atmosphere enormously changed in those times, passing from a methane-rich greenhouse to an oxygen-rich coldhouse. So we're looking for a mechanism which can account for that kind of wholesale change. Kopp <em>et al</em> posit that the main culprit was the spread of photosynthetic activity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main mechanism is uncontroversial, there's a positive feedback loop between low temperatures and ice/snow cover. This is because ice and snow have a high albedo and reflect a lot of the sun's warmth back into space, cooling the ground. When there's a lot of land area in the equatorial region it can make the snowball Earth scenario easier. There's a point at which permanent glaciation below a certain latitude level becomes a runaway effect that tips toward whole Earth glaciation.</p>
<p>Exactly how (or if) the Earth gets that far in glaciation, and the exact details of global glaciation, is still up for debate however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what we understand, it's through the volcanic emission of CO2. Since photosynthesis has now ground to a virtual halt, volcanic CO2 stops being removed from the atmosphere and slowly builds up over time untill it produces a greenhouse crisis and ends the glaciation abruptly.</p>
<p>In the geological record, the most typical expression of Snowball Earth is equatorially deposited glacial deposits (tillites and stuff like that), abruptly topped by a layer of warm water carbonates.</p></div>		</li>
