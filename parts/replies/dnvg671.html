<p>Your body can create eggs in which the telomeres are restored, allowing for a new human baby that can then continue to grow up normally. Thus, clearly a mechanism exists to correct the loss of telomeres</p>

<p>This in particular is what I was seeking an answer for; everything that followed was certainly interesting; thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correcting the loss of telomeres isn't what allows a baby to be &quot;young&quot; though. My point is that telomeres are actually not really important except as a cellular means of guaranteeing eventual cell death. What actually makes the egg &quot;young&quot; is that the epigenetic markers on its DNA have been reset/removed and thus it &quot;acts young&quot;. That is, age has nothing to do with time or decay, rather it is a programmed process. You are the age you are because your epigenetic markers say you should be that age. If you reset all your telomeres you will still be &quot;X years old&quot;. But if you could reset your epigenetic markers you would actual physically revert to an egg, and die of course. This means that not only can aging potentially be reversed but it might even be possible to select the age you wish to be!</p></div>		</li>
