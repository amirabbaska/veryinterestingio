			<div class="markdown"><p>There are similar contests right here in 'Murica. California hosts at least one, cause my neighbor was bragging about how his strain won an award. Yes, it was selective breeding that brought us our new, extra potent strains. And yes again, it will continue to get more potent, albeit at a slower rate, until the breeding has done all it can.</p>
<p>I strongly suspect that once it's legalized, and Big Business takes over, genetic modification will raise potency even more. </p></div>		</li>
