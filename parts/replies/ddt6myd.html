<p>Increase in temperature produces a decrease in the concentration of dissolved gases at equilibrium.  That's why you see bubbles form in water as you heat it even before it starts to boil.</p>
<p>Solubility for gases goes down with increasing temperature because dissolving a gas releases heat.  Many solids (like salt) absorb heat when dissolved, so they show the opposite trend in solubility.</p>
<p>The effects of climate on ocean oxygenation are more complicated an not just an equilibrium effect; the recent news report suggested that 15% was from this effect but the majority was from less efficient mixing of ocean layers, I believe.</p></div>		</li>
