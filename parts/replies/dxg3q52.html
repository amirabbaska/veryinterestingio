			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding it’s not just like any muscle where you can work it out and expect it to rapidly grow stronger. I don’t think there’s been enough neuroscientific research to really say one way or another. What you’re basically asking is how to be better at thinking and that’s a real tough thing.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could the fact that autistic people's minds wander so much that their analytical thought is inhibited due to lack of focus?...</p>
<p>...i.e., their brain spends too much of its resources on &quot;trivial matters&quot; rather than focusing on an analytical task at hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Basically scarcity is a fundamental tenet of iterative systems, or our reality. In this case this specific function is &quot;recharged&quot; through resting and sleep. </p></div>		</li>
