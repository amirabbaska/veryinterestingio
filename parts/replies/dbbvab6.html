			<div class="markdown"><p>This process is called retorting. It kills off all bacteria, both aerobic (survives with oxygen) and anaerobic (survives without oxygen) bacteria. It is especially important to kill off the anaerobic bacteria since they will thrive in canned foods. This includes clostridium botulinum which produces the neurotoxin that causes botulism.  Always cook your canned food folks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've always eaten the tuna from the can without doing anything else, just draining the liquid and serving it.</p>
<p>RIP me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only if it is done incorrectly (caveat, 99.9999% of companies do it correctly since they need a processing expert to create their retort operations) so you should be just fine. I am just paranoid because for my job, they explained how you die if it's done wrong. In the US there are very few cases each year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cooking food that has clostridium botulinum in it will kill it, but it doesn't do anything to the toxins that cause botulism. You'll still get just as sick as you would without cooking it. </p>
<p>Better advice would be: don't eat expired food, or cans that are distended or bulging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got it backwards; the botulinum toxin is destroyed by heating at 85 C for at least 5 minutes, but the C. botulinum spores can survive that. The spores need high heat and pressure to be killed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is good advice. I also would add dented on there. The dent could cause s minor can rupture which can lead to C bot toxin production </p></div>		</li>
