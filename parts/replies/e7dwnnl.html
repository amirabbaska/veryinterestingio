			<div class="markdown"><p>I am from New York State. I align myself with alot of laissez faire concepts, and hold a strong distrust for socialist implements. I believe that relying on a free-market society gives more control to a healthy middle-class and individualism while more public methods are arbitrary, invasive, and suppressive even for the poor to bring themselves up. I don't believe non-voluntary (non-local taxes, unions) are either ethical or effective. I am, in my personal experience, the massive minority in political belief of my generation.   </p>
<p>Yet, I do think America is tainted by an excessive work culture. To live by your own means you invest a good 40 hours of your life (That really is a lot of our life spent working) every week, usually only after spending 2-6 years in some form of higher education working even harder and putting yourself in debt for awhile. Most people even if they become well-off, have no time for travel, art, and are filled with stress. What is the point then?  </p>
<p>I think economically we suffer from both corporate and state dependence, the common man will have a hell of a time with a startup business, and no job short of technological specialist or high-end manager will pay for a house, or even an apartment really. Today it seems the popular policies of both Right and Left empower both the shady big business and invasive and controlling state.  </p>
<p>The current situation is complex, and I too do not know the answer, and it is clear that free-market without regulation is vulnerable to abuse, yet the alternative is a slew of highly-invasive operations that drain our populace in a different way.</p></div>		</li>
