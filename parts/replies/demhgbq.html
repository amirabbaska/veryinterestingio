<p>Luckily, there is a part of your brain that decides what information is important, and filters out the extra info so you can concentrate.</p>

<p>What exactly is meant by &quot;you&quot; here?</p>
<p>Edit: I'm serious. What makes &quot;you&quot; different from &quot;your brain&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There really isn't much of a difference. It's all very nuanced and difficult to explain/understand. But I will say that the process of filtering out extra info is an unconsciousness process (something you do involuntarily/don't know you're doing) whereas an inability to concentrate is something that you're at least aware of. </p></div>		</li>
