			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah I see. That makes sense. I used to think it involved some crazy math or tracking down people and tracing steps and a whole lot of investigating. This is a lot easier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there is investigating involved especially since incubation time is a factor and for new diseases or mutations, the disease may not be identified until long after the outbreak.  It may not be possible to narrow it down to a specific person.  It might be &quot;Patient zero was likely infectious in New York City from Aug 10-14th.&quot;  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. If a few people become infected at the same time, they would probably guess that someone came into contact with all of them, indicating that Patient Zero is an unknown subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, not entirely. The worst part was I caught it on my 21st birthday. And had to cancel a trip to the Dominican Republic,The best part was I used to have a bottle of tamiflu that day “ from the strategic national stockpile. For emergency use only”. It made me hallucinate. Also, my finger pirates jumped ships after a shower </p></div>		</li>
