			<div class="markdown"><p>The example works because negative numbers are basically the same as numbers going in the other direction along the number line: 5 means go 5 whole numbers above 0, so -5 means go 5 whole numbers below 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t really. I can see how that gets confusing. But it’s simpler when you consider what negative is. Just means counted in the opposite direction. And what multiplication is. 2x3 is 2 counted 3 times or 6.
So -2x3 is -2(two below zero) counted 3 times or -6(six below zero). -2x-3 is -2 counted 3 times in the opposite direction. So instead of counting -2 three times as before. You count the opposite of -2 three times. Which is 6</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like in physics. Let’s say a car is moving west with a velocity of V, thus a car moving at the same speed to east would have a velocity of -V.</p>
<p>If these cars collide (ill explain without going into momentum) head to head, the effect will be the same as a car going with a velocity of 2V and hitting a stationary wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This just made it more confusing. It doesn't explain the mathematics at all. The concepts are still a mystery with this analogy. Multiplication is a form of addition, not watching a movie.</p></div>		</li>
