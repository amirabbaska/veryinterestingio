			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think I would be able to to replicate a certain art style if I was an artist. And the text? Even harder. Replicating another person's handwriting that isn't your own natural handwritten is supposed to be very difficult. It really looks as if all political cartoons ate made buy the same person.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, keep in mind that being an illustrator isn't something you're born with. It takes discipline, practice, teachers and support. All this things influence an artists style as they find their <em>voice</em>. It's easy to imagine that a master's students are going to have similar or influenced styles. </p>
<p>Further, economics may play a role. If there's a particularly popular illustrator then institutions may hire others who have very similar looks because they know people like it. So, alternative styles are given less exposure. </p>
<p>If you listen to popular music that's curated by the big record companies then you'll likely feel that all musicians have a similar style. But in reality, it's just a matter of exposure. You're exposed to one particular style while others are diminished. So naturally, it's easy to think a particular style is universal. </p></div>		</li>
