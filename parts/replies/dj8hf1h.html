			<div class="markdown"><p>There are broadly four types of hypersensitivity which have different mechanisms. In laymen's terms, most allergies are type I (food allergy, hay fever, etc.), but some are actually type IV reactions (many skin &quot;allergies&quot; like those to poison ivy and non-precious metals). What people refer to as &quot;allergy to sun&quot; can be either type IV (common) or type III (somewhat rare, lupus). And then there are certain types of &quot;food allergy&quot; which are not allergy at all, so some distinction needed to be made.</p></div>		</li>
