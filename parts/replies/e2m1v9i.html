			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd start by punching 'color theory' into google and looking into graphic design. It's essentially the applied science of these sorts of questions. It'll also explain how color can create a depth of field (colors farther away lose saturation -- ie, become more grey), how color can be 'faded' by placing it next to a complimentary, etc. Complimentaries, when mixed, produce grey, which is why certain 'black' inks aren't actually black but have varying amounts of blue, red, etc., mixed in to better frame a photo, for example. A 'flat' black (ie, 100% K - black) won't look anything like 100/100/100 CYM, even though both are 'black'. </p>
<p>There's also quite a bit in there about color matching -- and will explain to you why purple is the bane of every graphic designer. It's a very uncommon color to find in human endeavors, yet it's everywhere in nature. Color theory will explain why that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each color has a certain wavelength, think the rainbow. When you look at something and see the color, you're seeing the reflected light from that object. So if an object is red, it has absorbed all the light that is NOT red, which we can simplify in this example as blue/violet. Our eyes then perceive all the reflected light. Our eyes contain rods and cones, the latter of which is responsible for color distinction. Cones come in a few varieties with different sensitivities to different colors. When the incoming light excites cones, the signals go to our brain and we interpret the color. Color blind people often have fewer varieties of cones than normal, or missing altogether, thought you can also have issues with your brain rather than the eye. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not very complicated. </p>
<p>It's a wave. First I'll go over waves.</p>
<p>The core of wave math is that frequency(amount of oscillations, measured in Hertz(times per second) is the inverse of wavelength. High frequency and short wavelength are interchangeable. In regards to light speed is constant so we don't have to worry about it.</p>
<p>With light, visible light isn't the only light there is. The entire spectrum is called the electromagnetic spectrum. Going from low to high frequency, we have radio waves, microwaves (yes they do heat hot pockets) infa-red, visible light(this is the only light you see) ultra violet(gives sunburns), x rays(used in medical applications), and gamma rays.</p>
<p>Let's focus on visible light. On the low to high frequency we have red, then green, then blue. These are the primary colors of light. </p>
<p>If you mix red and green light, you get yellow light.</p>
<p>If you mix red and blue light, you get magenta light.</p>
<p>If you mix green and blue light, you get cyan(very light blue) light</p>
<p>White light is all three mixed together. You can also do subtractive colors by starting with white light.</p>
<p>White light minus magenta equals green</p>
<p>White light minus blue equals yellow.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>The reason we percieve color is to be able to better contrast between different things, in particular red things(like fruits) against green things(like leaves) which gave a competitive advantage evolutionarily.</p>
<p>The way we percieve color is we have three kinds of special receptor cells(cone cells) in our eyes and each one detects one primary color. We also have cells that detect in grayscale for night vision but they aren't important for color.</p>
<p>The primary colors of light are entirely constructs of our evolution. Certain animals(like dogs) see less colors than humans. Some animals(like mantis shrimp) see more colors than us. Many animals see different parts of the pectrum along with different colors. </p>
<p>Pretty much the basics of it all. There are more details in the evolution part if that's what you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's different. You have cells in your skin called melanocytes. UV radiation damages the DNA in your skin cells, and your skin cells are designed to detect this damage and destroy themselves as a result of it (to prevent them from malfunctioning or turning into cancer). Actually every cell in your body is designed to do this as it is in your DNA. This is known as apoptosis. Cancer only occurs when apoptosis fails, but cancer doesn't always occur when it does. Melanocytes react to nearby cells destroying themselves by releasing additional melanin which is a biological chemical that absorbs solar radiation. This is why it is dark, and it reduces the cellular damage your skin receives. This is a reason why you are less affected by the sun when you are tanned, and why it is so much harder for a black person to get a sunburn than a white person. The quantity and qualities of these melanocytes is the main determining factor in the color of your skin, and that's mostly genetic.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that is a different process.  In that process certain cells in your skin (Melanocytes) detect that your skin is receiving a high level of high energy radiation and responds by producing large amounts of pigments in your skin to absorb the energy of those wavelengths thereby protecting your cell's DNA.</p></div>		</li>
