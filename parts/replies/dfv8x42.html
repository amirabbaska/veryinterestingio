<p>It's there primarily to stretch the skin (since taut skin results in a better shave). Source: <a href="http://gillette.com/en-us/products/razors-trimmers-and-blades/mach3-razors/mach3-turbo-razor" target="_blank">Gillette's description of their razor</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Female razors are more likely to have it, male razors are doing less bulk and need to be able to get into tight spaces such as the nose and other nooks on the face, legs and pits not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I know of and it probably wouldn't be as effective, especially since part of what the soap does is soften the hair during the couple of minutes it's sitting there. Why don't you use some sort of shaving soap or shaving cream instead? If normal shaving creams mess with your skin, you can always try shaving soap or ordering nicer cream off of the Internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't mess with my skin as far as I am aware but I was never really taught how to shave. I was in military school when we did our morning head count one day I was given a little 1-2 blade razor and wad told to &quot;shave that peach shit off.&quot; Since then I never used cream except once in a blue moon.</p></div>		</li>
