			<div class="markdown"><p>But could humans travel at those accelerations?</p>
<p>I mean, what acceleration and deceleration would it be necessary to reach there in 1000 years?</p>
<p>EDIT : I miss-read &quot;would cut the trip time down by a factor of maybe 10-1000&quot; with &quot;would reach there in 10000 to 1000 years&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

<p>First, by conventional means it's impossible to travel faster than the speed of light. So a 1400 light year distance is going to take at least 1400 years. </p>
<p>Now, <em>if</em> you could sustain an acceleration of 1g (very comfortable) you could acheive 0.999 of light speed in just under a year. You'd need another year at the other end of the trip to decelerate. The travel time in between would be around 1401 years. So the total trip time is about 1403 years. But because of the relativistic speeds the pilot would experience about 63 years. </p>
<p>Edit: The energy required to sustain 1g of acceleration for a year would be incredibly high. And you'd need the same amount of energy to slow down at the end of the trip. </p>
<p>Edit: Another way to consider your question would be how much acceleration would you need to make the trip in 1000 years as experienced by the crew. If you could accelerate at 0.0016g, you'd reach 0.999c in 618 years, travel for 783 years, decelerate for 618 years. The time experienced by the crew would be 1000 years. </p></div>		</li>
