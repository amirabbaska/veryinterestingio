			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you, I was going to post similar.  OP The &quot;opposite&quot; of depression is not happiness.  but if
you've ever met someone on a 'high' where they think they are always right, or dee invincible,  or that the world is shit but they can fix it single handley!  This is closer to what the &quot;opposite&quot; of depression is.  However, manics/depressives and manic depressives can actually have more than one 'feeing' at a time, your brain can mix it up and it's pretty scary in the end usually.  There isn't really opposites,  and in general the happiest people tend to be just middle tempered/even keeled.</p>
<p>edit:  'in general... not germans lol'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gradious delusions are what they always call them when I've been in a manic state. Good example: Thinking I could buy 3 sailboats, talk enough buddies to sail to africa, all to give the boats away.  After people realize your off the loopy train and just plain outta contol, you get really mad at why &quot;the world&quot; cant see it your way. </p>
<p>Then you feel its all up to you, ...how can I get into politics and become president ect. Then its a spiral...a lot of the times creating very strong convictions you might not even agree with, for lack of better way to say it, during  your normalcy.</p>
<p>The unfortunate fear I have is that Ive been known to get violent and very demeaning with my words...resulting in so much guilt and regret most people just cant comprhend. Especially the ones youve told off, ussually your closest friends n family.  That then leads to cutting everyone/everything you enjoy out of your life leading to crippling loneliness.  Pretty sure thats why it used to be called manic/depressive.</p>
<p>Nowadays they call it bipolar, which most people take as just being really mad.  Believe you me...its much different than just being mad. I have very very hard time remembering everything I've said n done while manic.  Hope this helped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hitler? Not kidding, that's what mania can do. Plus, with all the Meth he took, his mania could have developed even more. He was doing all this awful shit, but I'm guessing he wasn't depressed throughout. Political leaders typically do not get elected when they're depressed, people don't like being led by depression</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP is talking about emotions, and not necessarily mental illness... depression can be used to describe a feeling as well as an illness, so I think OP might have been aiming for a question that reflects the average person (not mentally ill).</p>
<p>For example: &quot;why do we recall sad emotions more often than happy ones?&quot; (not so eloquently phrased, but you get the idea). The way OP stated it, it seems like this was vaguely directed at emotion and not specific diagnoses (at least that's my interpretation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i mean its pretty true, if you think about how often the average person (not you, probably because of your thing which i would love to hear more about btw) hears in the news or reads stories abotu people with depression, sometimes crippling, or reads about some new treatment/pill for depression but i have literally never before heard about persistent mania, only manic-depression which also contains depression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My manic sessions are almost completely non existant, extremely mild when they do come, its more like a relief from the depression tbh.<br />
I'd say in the last year I'll spend two weeks depressed then have two days where I alternate once or twice during the day followed by a couple days of mania, then start it all over again.<br />
Tried for a while to figure out you meant crash, I would say no that it's all very subtle and almost subversive like my brains fucking with me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you give us a scale of what &quot;mild&quot; means in reference to your manic episodes?</p>
<p>As in, does your manic state look like an everyday-person's life (just being able to do what you couldn't while depressed)? Or is your manic state more likely to cause you to be more &quot;hyper&quot; than the average person?</p></div>		</li>
