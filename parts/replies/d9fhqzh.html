			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad worked in the printing industry beginning many decades ago - the bigger hazard for him was touching all the chemicals they used for inking/cleaning the works, without gloves.  His skin on his hands is rekt and basically constantly has patches peeling like when you are getting over a sun burn.</p>
<p>LPT: take the time to wear gloves when dealing with hazmat</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother-in-law was a linotype operator for the newspaper El Tiempo of Bogota Colombia. As a fun fact, I'd like to add that his union had negotiated that each operator would get a glass of milk each day to offset the health problems of working with lead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;I think computers will replace most people's jobs like this&quot;</p>
<p>in not even 50 years. It's crazy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting and somewhat saddening addition to this is that many used linotype molds and injections are purchased purely for disassembly and melt down nowadays instead of collection or historical reasons. The primary reason behind this being that the &quot;clean&quot; injected lead is ideal for casting reloads for ammunition. With the rising price of ammunition this method has often been seen as a more cost-effective alternative.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to agree that I hate to see a piece of history and a tool of free speech being destroyed. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm just overly optimistic, but I suppose that one way to look at is that the pen becomes the sword. Or perhaps that the a tool of free speech becomes a tool to defend it. </p>
<p>Like I said though, that's probably just an optimists way of lessening the sadness of loss of a beautiful piece of history and technology.</p></div>		</li>
