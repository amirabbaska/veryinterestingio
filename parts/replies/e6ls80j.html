			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for all this info! I stopped breastfeeding a few months ago, and still produce small amounts of milk (enough to get a few drops from hand expressing). Nice to know more about what's actually going on there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hormone changes in pregnancy specifically block the release of milk while at the same time increasing milk production. The interaction between all of these hormones are crazy. some hormones that have nothing to do with breast/milk development act to increase mammary development just because there is so much of them circulating in the blood stream. (these hormones do have a similar structure but do not assist in breast/milk development when hormones levels are &quot;normal&quot;/non-pregnant)</p>
<p>technically, breast feeding can work as contraceptive. but a woman would need to breast feed about 10+ times per day for extended period of time each time. super hard to pull off</p></div>		</li>
