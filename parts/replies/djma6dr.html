			<div class="markdown"><p>Another big thing that I learned from a teacher who used to work in the sale of tar or whatever they use to build roads is, prices. The government will have economists predict the fall in prices of road building material. When it all drops by a few cents, the government is willing to pay as much overtime as needed to get the project done asap because the drop in price makes such a difference at the quantity they need. This is why you will see a ton of road projects going up at once sometimes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone working in government, it's not really that. It's that they are budget driven, and their budget is taxes which is largely tied to income. The budget is predicted by Congress (federal and state) plus the local town, based on how the economists predict the taxes will generate revenue. That predicted budget is then divided up by Congress. In the case of roads, the federal government puts in money at a rate dependent on traffic on the road (those hoses that you sometimes see layed out on roads for a few weeks are counters for this).</p>
<p>When someone wants to build a thing they find out how much money they have together for the project (given by Congress), predict how much that costs, and make a plan for it. Generally they try to spread it out time wise, both so one years budget is spent in exactly one year and so they can make sure the government contractors have work year round (if they don't they'll charge more to cover for the months they don't have work and keep their payroll going). This means they can hire cheaper crews by spreading out the budget and not requiring overtime. They can also take expensive projects and spread them I've years, because there is a new budget with new  money every year. Once they have the plans, they bid it and let the contract and the work goes along the schedule the government made.</p>
<p>They schedule this stuff years out. So if they have 10 bridges replacing, they might schedule them to be replaced year after year sequentially. So they know how they'll spend their budget for the next 20 years with very rough numbers.</p>
<p>They are not watching when rates go down though. Those spikes in work are actually because the economy is doing better than the prices, causing them getting more money in a year than they predicted. They'll usually push up work by accelerating a project or starting the next early. Money not spent in the government isn't saved, it's lost (technically, given back to Congress/people providing it who will typically give it to some other projects that is over budget). That policy means it's better to run out of money at the end of the year than have some leftover, so they may order overtime type work just to finish up the budget, letting them accelerate next year's projects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there is also a couple of other reasons for a bunch of projects to start at once. </p>
<p>Weather, you can only really do road work in the summer in most areas. Rain make it too muddy to work the ground and even if you're working in an area with good drainage if the gravel that they are going to make asphalt out of gets too wet they can't use it cause once it hits the hot tar the rocks will explode. </p>
<p>There is also the matter of matching funds. Often in the US local or state projects get funding from the state or federal government grants. These grants are time limited if the project does start on time no funding. So you'll seen many jobs started a once so as to not lose grant money. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's also because asphalt roads can only be paved above certain temperatures. Depending on where you live, it may be too cold in the winter. So paving projects will peak in the summer, when conditions are ideal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The system is broken and abused, which is why more control doesn't necessarily work better, and less control doesn't necessarily mean work is completed faster.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that people in power who can make changes to these systems instead exploit the issue to stay in power rather than trying to fix it because fixing it is way harder than pretending to address it every few years and then having some talking points about your accomplishments which actually didn't do shit for the businesses and communities but they gobble it up because they think everything else would be worse without you because you've successfully indoctrinated them into grass is not greener on the other side black and white, rich vs poor, blame the other guys mentality wow now wonder everyone's jaded as fuck. Oh wait thats just me heh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, as far as I know, that's not really the issue; it may play into the issue, but not really a whole lot.</p>
<p>Construction company A gets awarded a job for $5M to reconstruct a new highway junction.  In the contract, they receive $2.5M (I made that up) once those orange barrels get placed out on the road and then get the other $2.5M after it's complete. </p>
<p>In the meantime, a lot of smaller jobs (like a $250,000 job), they don't get any of it till the job is complete.  </p>
<p>So Construction Company A would want to increase the schedule from the big job as much as possible (like weeks-months).  They would then collect the money from the bigger job (typically state/interstate jobs) and then use that money to fund the smaller jobs, which would get done much
quicker.  After they're done they will concentrate on the larger, more expensive jobs.</p>
<p>Basically they accept the larger jobs, take the money to fund the smaller jobs, complete them, and then finish the big jobs.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite was an anecdote from someone about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-plus_pricing" target="_blank">cost plus pricing.</a> He was told to write a report for his boss about some specialized drifting software they needed to purchase for the project. The license for the first choice was ~$3,000 overall, the company was known to have a good technical support contract, ran on existing hardware, etc. The other choice was over $25,000 overall, the support would be cut at EOL which was only a few months away, the software was missing critical features, required high end hardware, and was just miserable to use. </p>
<p>They went with the second choice anyways, because higher cost meant more money overall. It caused severe delays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a grain of truth there,  but that's not quite accurate.  We get awarded a contract,  but you never get a downpayment or money upfront.  There's a monthly billing cycle, and you can only bill for demonstrable progress on the job.  If all I've done on the $5M highway job is $50,000 worth of drawings and planning meetings, and I try to bill 20% of the job,  they'll kick my bill right back to me.  The GC or Construction Manager has to justify whatever draw of construction funds they get from the client, and they ain't gonna risk their asses to go to bat for you.  </p>
<p>I can bill for stored materials,  for labor expended, for ongoing costs every month,  so it's progress payments as you go. At the end of the project,  there's retainage - the GC usually holds the last 10% of your money until the job is  demonstrably 100% complete and there are no outstanding issues.  The real kicker is that you don't get paid until the GC gets paid,  so if the client is unhappy about anything in the job,  your funds get held up by situations beyond your control.  Construction jobs are kinda fun,  but the contracts and all the stress about getting paid make it a hard row to hoe.</p></div>		</li>

I get that shit happens and you might accidentally damage someone else's work, or even just need it rerouted to make room for yours, but for the love of god just <em>let them know about it</em> rather than destroying it and leaving it for them to find.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally think that this is an entirely different problem. Deadlines are ridiculous and unrealistic and becoming more so every year. </p>
<p>If a general says they can build the job in 10 months, then the steel is three weeks behind, then concrete is another week behind, framing is another week behind, flooring is a week behind, and now the job is 6 weeks behind total - but the deadline didn't change, and now electrical, mechanical, and finishing trades are the ones holding up occupancy, not the guys who were actually behind.</p>
<p>Add to that consultants, engineers, and architects from half way across the continent who set foot on site three times total, take four weeks to answer an RFI, but still want every single change to go through the channels and issued as a site instruction or PCN. </p>
<p>And then add modern safety policies, which every major contractor expects you to follow to the T, but without taking any longer. </p>
<p>The whole thing creates a &quot;fuck you got mine&quot; situation because nobody wants to be the one holding the potato come occupancy day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what gets me, people complain about the jobs leaving and hiring lower paying employees for things which is understandable in certain areas but when it comes to construction and the attitude of we will just charge more or take longer that hurts <em>your</em> bottom line.</p>
<p>The company salesman/owner does their best to get a job and because of the &quot;it's not my job&quot; or &quot;it's in my way&quot; mentality the job takes longer than they planned for something they control, that keeps happening and the business will close because the reputation they get for never finishing on time and the work not being reliable.</p>
<p>If you move it or have no choice but to do something with work already done hang a note on the work or let the foreman know that you had to move it, they aren't going to fire you over it and the ones that put it in can go and double check to make sure it's good takes 5 minutes to do and saves a major headache down the road for everyone involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a couple friends in the business and they say that another major part is the scheduling set up by the lowest bidder scenario. One of the more important jobs for a company that bids low is the scheduler. The scheduler has to make the schedule in such a way that they know where the delays will happen in road work, but the schedule is organized in such a way that the smallest mistake by the government will cause the delay, allowing them to charge more money and have more time to finish the project.</p></div>		</li>
