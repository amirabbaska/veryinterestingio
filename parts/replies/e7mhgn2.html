			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it's a mistake to imagine the 1800's as some quaint time where we had little scientific insight and tools. I know I'm guilty of the assumption, because so much of our science and technology has moved to electronic and digital platforms that without them I can't imagine a world with tools to take measurements like these. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. I guess I shouldn't say that I can't imagine there being tools, but rather the whole process of using the tools in the right place and time, organizing and communicating the data, and reaching a scientific consensus on what it means.</p>
<p>For example, I have no idea how they would have known that hurricanes are circular unless they all just decided one day to record wind direction at locations which take days/weeks to communicate between and then ride their notes to some HQ via horse to compare, all just on the hunch that &quot;maybe hurricanes are round&quot;.</p>
<p>Obviously that's ignorance on my part, but that's what I'm saying. I, and probably many others, are totally ignorant of scientific methods before electronics because they've been mostly replaced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Talking about keeping records of scientific events. We have the so-called Venus Tablets from the Babylonians who recorded the rise times of the planet Venus and the first and last appearance of the planet before or after sunrise and sunset. This era of history is relatively unknown to us, but because of these tablets we have actually been able to narrow it down to three different timetables, giving us a clearer idea of the chronology of events in that time.</p>
<p>So records kept more than 3.500 years ago are still accurate and clear enough for us to use in the present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A cool thing to note is that we started the National Weather Service just after the Revolutionary war. Farmers in the newly formed US were paid for weather reports from their farms. All they had to do was collect temperature and barometric data from their hones, and then mail them into the nearest office. </p>
<p>It was critical for national defense if troops had to be deployed anywhere, since knowing the weather meant that you could give them the proper route and equipment.</p></div>		</li>

Farmers and soldiers need that data and you claim to care about both of them.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Station_Kurt" target="_blank">The Nazis didn't sneak into Canada and set up a weather station because they were bored.</a>  They did it because knowledge of weather is important for national security.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a bit of context ships generally, especially then, keep a log book where every hour or half hour you would log your position,  weather conditions (wind speed, direction, barometer), and anything else of note.  They are kinda fascinating to read as an primary source and the weather data helped inform early forcasters.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess today is the day you learn that the Tainos (Arawaks) from the Hispaniola and neighboring islands in the Caribbean knew exactly what a hurricane looked like and what the season for them was. </p>
