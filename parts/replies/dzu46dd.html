<p>It hasn’t got much to do with credit or debit. It is up to the issuing bank on how they want to authenticate the transaction. In some countries, such as India, it is mandated by regulators that a PIN is only acceptable mode of authentication. In few countries (EU), there are limits set after which a PIN or Passcode is necessary. In Middle East (e.g. UAE) it is merchant’s choice to opt for PIN or signature. US is a bit in transition phase, but MC/Visa have been trying to mandate auth through PIN for a few years (and things are moving along these lines now).</p>
