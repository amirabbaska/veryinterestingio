			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation. Who defindes when a condition is fulfilled? For example, let's say Le Pen just became president a second ago. On what source does Ethereum rely to get this information? Newspaper live tickers (probably not but I hope you get my quesetion)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Decentralized prediction markets aim to solve that problem. </p>
<p>Augur will have decentralized parties who confirm different kind of results - and as these parties establish a trustworthy track record over time, their collaborated confirmations of an event happening are considered more and more reliable.</p>
<p>How Augur reputation system works: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCms-snzHk4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCms-snzHk4</a></p>

<hr />
<p>So in case of Le Pen, lets say 100 politics active users with 99.9% track record each confirm it, and 100 French people with 99.9% track record each confirm it. The overwhelming majority of the network agrees that Le Pen became president.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the price fluctuate? What factors and is there anything we can look at to predict future price?</p>
<p>I actually own a large amount of ether as I bought them about a month ago when they were priced at 15$ and can't decide if I should sell them off or hold them.</p>
<p>I honestly have no clue what I'm doing with it I just like the volatility and ability to make large gains in a day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll type a few different things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What determines price? Price is decided in markets by supply and demand. Every market in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did ETH rise? MANY reasons.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Undervalued longterm with no huge movements since the DAO crash  </li>
<li>Bitcoin scaling and politics, people sought to move their funds elsewhere </li>
<li>Several large corporations announced their involvement with Ethereum (google Enterprise Ethereum Alliance)   </li>
<li>Additionally large sums of institutional money was prepared to enter the field following the (failed) Bitcoin ETF attempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What should you do?  </p>
<ul>
<li>Don't risk more than you can afford to lose.</li>
<li>Never daytrade or short term speculate.</li>
<li>Overall just hold whichever asset (cryptocurrencies or stocks) that you have the highest amount of faith/belief in on a long term basis. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where will the market head in future?
<ul>
<li>IMO, the crypto market is extremely bullish for the next few years. And ETH and BTC are seem like the safest bets you could make.</li>
<li>As soon as regular financial market starts showing bigger problems, people WILL escape their funds over to alternatives, such as gold and Bitcoin. (eg. France leaving EU, destabilizing it and collapsing the Euro?)</li>
</ul></li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the insight man.</p>
<p>If you were me would you hold onto it or sell for 4x what you paid. It's excess cash so I don't need it per se.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supply and demand, just like other currencies and stocks.</p>
<p>There are only so many to go around, so if more people want to buy at the current price than current owners want to sell, the price goes up.</p></div>		</li>
