			<div class="markdown"><p>Although I think your section on physical effects leaves out some responses, I find the rest of the comment to be very comprehensive and also indicative of why it is so hard to talk about the placebo effect. Some of these things have nothing to do with the body or top-down influences in perception, but others that do could be targeted for therapeutic benefit. Placebo is known to reduce inflammation, boost immune function, reduce pain via endorphins, and improve outlook and mood. Placebo can influence gene expression, so these can be real physiological changes.</p>
<p>Here is a great article on what placebo is doing, and it also has a great summary that the placebo affect has been blocked pharmacologically by blocking endogenous opioid receptors in pain studies, meaning that the body is releasing something that actually does reduce pain.</p>
