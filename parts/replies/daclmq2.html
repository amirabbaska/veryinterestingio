			<div class="markdown"><p>But does this mean you are never supposed to clean your ear then? Or is it okay to do it with some water/your pinky/ other ways I can't think of? I've had times where I had so much ear wax that people could tell and told me to go clean it up when I hadn't cleaned for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sticking your finger in won't do any damage as it will only clear wax from the very outer part of the canal. The rest of it? LEAVE IT ALONE! Sticking stuff in your ear is a good way to end up with a ear that hurts, leaks, or doesn't hear too well! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if I've already done it many many times since my mom taught me to do so a child? Should I still stop or am I at the point where the damage is already done and the stuff would over-accumulate if I stop now, making me forever dependent on q-tips or similar? My ear sure feels pretty weird if I don't clean it out for a week or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another ENT man here. I tell my patients that I have a love/hate relationship with q-tips. Hate em because they cause all kinds of mischief...love em because they're going to single handedly put one of my children through college.  My official position is that nothing smaller than your elbow should be inserted into your ear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I q-tip my ears every single day.  There's always a little bit of yellow slime on them when I pull them out.   I do it because my ears are <em>always</em> itchy.  Sometimes I do it multiple times a day because of the itching.  It's so annoying.</p>
<p>Stuffing that q-tip up there is literally scratching an unbearable itch. </p>
<p>Are you saying that's not normal?  Should I get my ears checked out?   I don't want to ruin my hearing (I work in an audio field), but so far (20 years) I've never had a problem with my ears. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>How do you kick the q-tip habit?  I can go about a week without using them, but by about day 7 or 8 the itching becomes unbearable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is basically saying people are too dumb to clean their ears safely without damaging themselves, and it's not bad advice.   I had such bad wax build-up that it was affecting my hearing.    I had to get one of those scary looking small wire loops to get it all out.   It would have been easy to mess up, but other remedies weren't working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's simply mechanical - the sheet of cells moves like a raft along other non mobile skin cells and if you force it back on itself it can roll into a ball rather than a nice little conga line of cells out the ear </p>
<p>A disease called acquired cholesteatoma does a similar thing when these skin cells get into the wrong bit of your ear (the middle ear, behind the drum) and start to get bigger...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean if you theoretically get some sort of complete and thorough removal of the wax ball and every bit of cerumen around it, the normal conveyors can start their conga line again?</p>
<p>I really don't enjoy hearing health related things in combination with the words &quot;ruined forever&quot;, especially when it's about something I have done in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had water get stuck in my ear and it somehow made my earwax build up into a plug and push its way out of my ear. It affected my hearing for a couple days but my ear's been fine since. It was weird. What happened there? </p></div>		</li>
