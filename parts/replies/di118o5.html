<p>It happens. We get hit by meter-sized objects frequently, and most of them don't get tracked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some countries have setups to monitor them and there are dedicated programs to estimate their quantity. If you know how many asteroids hit 1% of the surface area of Earth, you can be quite sure that the remaining 99% are hit by asteroids as well, even if you don't monitor them there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Satellites in orbit intended to detect nuclear detonations also detect the impact of these things crashing into the atmosphere. The difference is that the intensity of the flash over time is different between a nuclear detonation and an asteroid impact. (The sensors, amusingly, are referred to as Bhangmeters)</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is of course unless it was sending out rf signals of some kind trying to be found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weâ€™d still have to actually receive them and detect them among all the noise. Communication with far away probes works with very narrow beams. Both the transmitter and receiver have to point in the right direction.</p>
<p>IIRC you can also use some signal processing tricks to receive signals below the noise floor if you know what the signal should look like.</p></div>		</li>
