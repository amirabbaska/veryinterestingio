			<div class="markdown"><p>You're completely right, creativity does give an advantage over other mates. The first hominid to think, <em>hey, I can use this as a tool to hunt and fight</em> definitely had an advantage over others. And he was probably more likely to pass his genes on (<em>2001: A Space Odyssey,</em> anyone?). </p>
<p>But that doesn't give a satisfying explanation for the exaggerated nature of artistic creativity in humans. Why do we create art? What is the purpose of art? Miller proposes this exaggeration is the result of sexual selection, at least in part.</p>
<p>We wouldn't be the only ones! The Satin Bowerbird is known for building &quot;art galleries&quot; as courtship displays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, creativity can be advantageous but it comes at a cost, namely a large brain, very costly to maintain. The question is whether the large human brain is worth the maintenance. This is at least a bit doubtful because it took so long to evolve. If it were useful, evolution would probably have come up with it long time ago. </p>
<p>According to sexual selection and the handicap principle, the human brain isn't worth the cost which, paradoxically, is precisely the reason why it evolved. A large brain is a signal to potential mates about your evolutionary fitness. If you can afford to waste scarce resources on a brain which isn't worth the costs, it shows that your genes are so good you can afford to do so. According to this theory, our brain is the human equivalent to the peacock's tail. The tail itself is harmful but it is a great indicator of evolutionary fitness. If the peacock can survive despite its disadvantages, it must be a great mate. If a human can survive despite its large brain, he must be a great mate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't find it so doubtful. Once we evolved to apes, i.e. two hands with thumbs and two legs, the only thing left to improve were our brains! Also, imagine how unlikely that would be - the property that makes us attractive to mates is what made us the most powerfull speciecs that ever existed on planet earth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a really strange question to ask. If it weren't worth it, we wouldn't be here, and we wouldn't have so completely dominated the planet (and eventually even other planets). Intelligence isn't just for showing off - it's for adapting quickly without requiring actual biological adaptation. As humans we can live underwater, in space, in frozen wastes, in scorching deserts, all just by utilising the appropriate equipment. Simply making a brain larger doesn't necessarily make it smarter either. New parts/functions of the brain needed to evolve as well as just having more brain in general, for us to get from fish level brains to primates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure? Perhaps creativity is just a side effect of having a brain that can think in advanced ways - or learn to speak a language, etc.</p>
<p>It strikes me that we could equally well be sitting here discussing what the evolutionary advantage of peeing is. &quot;Why would a potential mate find a jet of water attractive?&quot; &quot;Clearly it displays virility!&quot; &quot;A source of sterile water!&quot; Etc, when in fact it's a byproduct of our need for water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a leadership and social aspect to humour that is important. We tend to see humour as a leadership trait and again I think that's because of the creativity and intelligence you talk about, but also because it serves a purpose in its own right.</p>
<p>People who can make us laugh can help us manage our emotional state. The British Royal Marines list 'commando humour' as one of their four core values (also called 'Cheerfulness in the face of adversity'). The idea here is that humour is a leadership tool and bonds us together, helping us seek out and latch onto the lighter side of dire situations. An ex royal marine have nee an example just last week of patching up a buddy who'd just had his heel blown off and said &quot;Well that's the end of your tap dancing career&quot;. </p>
<p>So there is good reason women seek out humour in mates, yes because it's a proxy measure for creativity and intelligence, but also perhaps because they know that when the times are tough their mate will help them both deal with it through humour.</p></div>		</li>
