			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great explanation, but I suspect the OP is more interested in how the man managed to get a copy of the German list of instructions.</p>
<p>When you write a program using whatever language you're familiar with, you save it as a file that contains source code- if you open up that file, you see it written in Java, C++, Python, or whatever.<br />
But that's not a program; it won't run like that on its own.  You use software called a compiler that turns that source code into machine language, which is something the computer understands (and is basically impossible for humans to understand)- 1s and 0s, essentially.  </p>
<p>From there, you would use software to turn the machine code into assembly language (German), which are the actual instructions that the processor executes.  It'll end up looking something like &quot;move information from this memory slot X to register A, then compare the information in register A to register B and if they're equal then jump to the code at line Y, otherwise continue on with the next line of code.&quot;</p>
<p>If you've got the right kind of program, it'll let you debug that code- so you can run the executable, and then when you get to the point where the &quot;ticket taker&quot; is asking for your &quot;ticket&quot; you can see where the execution is in the assembly code.  Then you can alter it so that, even if register A <em>doesn't equal</em> register B, the code jumps to the &quot;ticket accepted&quot; line anyways.  When you're done, you reassemble it back into machine code, and now you have a cracked EXE.</p>
<p>They make software that will even attempt to turn the assembly language into something more familiar, like C++, but in my experience this is never worth the effort- the garbage you get out of it is usually way harder to wade through than if you just went through the assembly code line by line.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ollydbg.de/" target="_blank">OllyDbg</a> is a common freeware disassembler/reassembler, if you're curious to see what one looks like, but it's got a bit of a steep learning curve, and if you're not familiar how assembly languages work it's even hard to use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, poster above you did a great ELI5 of HOW to crack, but didn't answer the question OP posted which was &quot;how do they get the game&quot;?</p>
<p>You have gotten closer to that in explaining how they take the game and get the code for the game and know what to change.</p>
<p>I could be wrong though, but it sounds like OP is asking far more simply, &quot;how does the hacker actually get a copy of the game&quot;?</p>
<p>I assume the answer is either 'the hacker bites the bullet and pays for the game in order to be the one to crack it which keeps them in the release group that allows them access to many other releases', or 'the hacker gets access to some sort of free promo copy of the game' or 'someone rips a copy of the disc and sends it to the hacker'.</p>
<p>These are just my assumptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that's not how I originally read it, but I could see that.</p>
<p>I'd assume most people get the &quot;starting&quot; version off of torrent sites from people who actually purchased it and then uploaded it.  Then they'll take the time to try and crack it, and re-upload the new version to whatever torrent sites (or maybe pay-sites or something).</p>
<p>Since it apparently won't work unless it's been paid for (utilizing some sort of registration key or serial or something), the company probably isn't going to put a whole lot of effort into making sure it gets taken down off torrent sites, which means it's easier for people who are willing to take the time to crack it to get a hold of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good lord as someone who has done a little programming with assembly language, that shit is so tedious to track when you've gotten used to modern programming languages. </p>
<p>Also, through this method wouldn't it be possible to completely add or modify or remove parts of the game? Like I know games that give players the tools to create stuff usually have the most mods and stuff but these conversion shenanigans means you could do this with almost any game and mess around with it right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whew, I mean, you could, but the amount of effort it would take to add or remove anything significant into something as complex as a game would be way more trouble than it's worth.</p>
<p>Most people who create unauthorized mods for games end up modifying external files that the game relies on- for instance:</p>
<p>Making one entire EXE that has gigabytes of 3D and graphics information in it would be extremely inefficient.  Instead, the developer would usually make a game that's a few hundred MB and reads the image data from specially-coded files to display it.  Someone can then go into those files and modify them so they look different, and now you've got Sims characters running around naked (for example).</p>
<p>But I suppose if you were really good at what you did, you might be able to change a specific function (something like altering didTheCharacterJustFireAWeapon so that it doesn't subtract 1 from the amount of ammo in your inventory).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>except that's not what the question was....  </p>
<p>The question was how do they GET the games.  &quot; How do people who crack games get the games before they crack them?  &quot;  </p>
<p>As in, how do they get the files to begin with. Which I believe the simple answer is someone either leaks it from the company, or someone buys a copy and uploads it online and cracker downloads it or is given it </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it gets easier if you explain it ELI12 or so.</p>
<p>A computer follows a set of instructions that resides in its memory, it is all stored in machine code. Those pieces of machine code are executed one after another. A cracker might snoop out the memory as the program runs, and most of the information will be undiscernible garbage. <em>But</em> the cracker is interested in one particular, easily (usually) noticeable thing: What is the machine doing <em>right before he gets kicked out</em> due to not having a valid copy?</p>
<p>And this is the simple case (read &quot;without further anti-tampering methods used by the game maker&quot;): now the cracker knows exactly where and when the game asks for a validation and he might just remove that particular instruction from the machine code (the cracker does not get the actual sourcecode), so that instruction checking for &quot;valid copy?&quot; is never properly executed and skipped. </p>
<p>As alternative, the cracker might try altering other sections of the code, for example find out what the code actually looks for and present that, find the part that checks for the validity of the key and convince it that any key is acceptable, or any kind of other way around &quot;the function as it was intended&quot;. </p>
<p>A bit more rooted in how it (also) works: The machine code I mentioned was created by a program from the original sourcecode (&quot;human readable instructions&quot; -&gt; &quot;strings of zeroes and ones that the hardware understands&quot;). There are programs that can translate machine code back into a very &quot;low-level but still human comprehensible language&quot; (assembly), and you can use that assembly-code to understand what the machine code does. Having a more or less rough idea what to look for helps a real lot (for example by snooping the memory as mentioned above). </p>
<p>Modern anti-tampering can try to snoop out such attempts and do some pretty elaborate things to complicate matters become actually near tamper-resistent.</p>
<hr />
<p>As for the literal questions added in OP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do people who crack games get the games before they crack them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They buy them or download a pirated, but still uncracked version. The cases where the full game is out before actual release are limited these days as that would require a leak somewhere. Sometimes they might get to &quot;know someone&quot; who works in a store that has games and that gives out or sells a copy before the official release dates (or outright steals it from storage). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do they get the source files on their pcs so they can crack them ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As explained above: they do not get the original sourcecode. They either work directly from what the code does in the memory or disassemble the machine code back into assembly and figure out from there what the machine code is doing. </p></div>		</li>
