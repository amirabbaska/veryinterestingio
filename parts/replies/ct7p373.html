<p>Actually when your body does something for some autonomous reason your brain will often &quot;make up&quot; a reason for you to have done it. You <em>think</em> you're making choices even when you're actually not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there are two separate things being discussed.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I would call twitching, which is more involuntary. Like when you are sleep then suddenly spasm. This sounds like your description.</p>
</li>
<li>Fidgeting to me sounds more like when you constantly move around continually trying to get comfortable. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only time you are paralysed during sleep is during REM sleep, known as muscle atonia. REM sleep usually first occurs about 90 minutes after initially falling asleep, you can still very much move throughout the process of falling asleep and whilst you dont remember, people are having small awakenings and rolling over all through there sleep, sometimes hundreds of times. </p>
<p>The 'chemical' you might be thinking of is GABA, a neurotransmitter which inhibits multiple brain areas during sleep, including possible motor function areas. Orexin also seems to play a role. </p></div>		</li>
