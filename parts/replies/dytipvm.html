<p>Companies that are more casual about your privacy will ask you to answer &quot;security questions&quot; — which are typically questions that anyone could guess after a thorough stalking of your Facebook account: Oh, there's a photo of you with your high school best friend. Oh, there's a status update with your &quot;porn star name,&quot; combining your first pet's name with the first street you lived on. (It's possible the NSA invented that game.) And oh, there's your mom commenting on everything you upload, and look, she's divorced and using her maiden name. Pwned.</p>

<p>It almost reads like a joke? If this has some basis in reality I’d be really curious to learn more about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to security back doors, there are enough weird confirmed NSA creations that something like this wouldn't be out of the question. In my completely unprofessional opinion, I don't think this specific one was created by the NSA. The much more innocuous &quot;first letter of your first name, first letter of your last name&quot; games have been around basically forever. These other games are just spinoffs of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an algorithm sort of game people play on social media to combine two unlikely or silly words. Generally the first word is chosen based on the month you are born in and the second word is based on the day you were born. From a predetermined list, you find the words correlated with your month and date and you get a new identity, nick name, Halloween costume, or... porn star name, which was referenced in one of the responses as a combination of your mother's maiden name and  ssn which would of course Result in all who see your Facebook post being privy to your previously private information.</p></div>		</li>
