			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently, bats recognize their own voice just like we do. And, like us, they simply scream louder and for longer when confronted with lots of interference, as we would do at a rock concert.</p>

<p>the bat itself needs to be the source of sound for echolocation to work</p>

<p>Hang on. If two bats are sitting near each other and one of them chirps, the other one will hear both the chirp and it's echos, so why would it not be able to make the same inferences that the other bat did? Seems like they could take turns being the &quot;lamp&quot; in the room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they're sitting near each other then, yes, the other bat will hear the original chirp as well as the return. The problem would be that you only hear the original chirp when it reaches you and you don't really have any idea of how far away it originated from, just the direction of the source.</p>
<p>If you didn't know the exact source of the first chirp then echolocation would be pretty difficult. If you're the source of the first chirp then you know exactly where it came from and you can echolocate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it like this, you have ten bats flying in a line wing to wing. The bats are all using echolocation as discussed. The bat on the far left emits a chirp that the bat on the far right recieves as the echo is bouncing of a wall to the far left bats side. That far right bat has no idea how far away that echo reflecting obstacle is because it doesn't know where the initial sound came from. Now imagine there are thousands of hundreds of thousands of these echoes. </p></div>		</li>
