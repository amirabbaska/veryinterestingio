			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US and other Western countries you can make and sell knock-off Lego blocks but you couldn't actually <em>call</em> them &quot;Lego.&quot;  If you tried that, the Lego company could get a court injunction blocking them from being sold for copyright infringement. EDIT: actually, <em>trademark</em> infringement.</p>
<p>China is not so concerned about the niceties of intellectual property law, so you could probably get away with it there.  This may change as China becomes more integrated into the world economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LEGO blocks are patented, there are strict rules on how long those are good for. LEGO brand is a trademark and is governed by a different set of rules, trademarks can be extended, same with copyrights. Trademarks, copyrights and parents sometimes you can sneak certain aspects into more than one thing. A a Coca Cola bottle might be copyrighted as an ‘industrial design’ copyright, the cocoa cola bottle might have a ‘design patent’ (a distinctive bottle shape that only Coca Cola can use) both prevent people from reproducing the specific shape of the bottle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While Lego cant stop someone making &quot;Lego bricks&quot; because the patent has run out lipen infringe on so many copyrights, design rights that they are completely breaking the law. Lego can't stop them because China's courts don't care. Why do you think you can't get Lipen from any proper retailer in the west. </p></div>		</li>
