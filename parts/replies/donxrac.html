<p>so when you listen to an audio book it is nearly as if not better than reading the book and handled almost identically in the mind.</p>

<p>Is this possibly because a lot of readers subvocalize, meaning that they are effectively creating their own audiobook as they read?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are there people who don't subvocalize? I figured that's how it's done by everyone!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe we aren't aware of any subvocalization(?) I would have said that I don't do that.</p>
<p>To me, listening to speech is in itself distracting, and I'm not free to linger, or re-read and I can make the speech sound like I imagine it it would sound.</p>
<p>Video versions of books are almost always inferior because they seem they seem 2 dimensional, like a moving painting that you are looking at. Whereas when you're lost in a book, the world recedes, and you seem to be within the story, in the room, in the field or wherever the action takes place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think what you're saying, specifically that audiobooks are &quot;as good if not better&quot; than reading, is supported by that article. While it does claim that reading and listening are mostly the same on a mental level, there are some key quotes such as:</p>
<p>&quot;The decoding process does become automatic once you’ve passed a certain level of reading proficiency, but you can become even better at this well into adulthood — and the only way to get better is by reading.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Comprehension, too, is something that improves the more you read.&quot;</p>
<p>Further, other studies show contradictory information. See this abstract from <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00892/full" target="_blank">a study published in Frontiers in Psychology</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We examined whether different encounters of reading material influence the likelihood of mind wandering, memory for the material, and the ratings of interest in the material. In a within-subjects design participants experienced three different reading encounters: (1) reading a passage aloud, (2) listening to a passage being read to them, and (3) reading a passage silently. Throughout each reading encounter probes were given in order to identify mind wandering. After finishing the passage participants also rated how interesting it was and completed a content recognition test. Results showed that reading aloud led to the least amount of mind wandering, while listening to the passage led to the most mind wandering. Listening to the passage was also associated with the poorest memory performance and the least interest in the material. Finally, within the silent reading and listening encounters we observed negative relations between mind wandering and both memory performance and interest in the material, replicating previous findings. Taken together, the present findings improve our understanding of the nature of mind wandering while reading, and have potentially important implications for readers seeking to take advantage of the convenience of audiobooks and podcasts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately I think we can only conclude that this area needs more research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's as clear open and shut case, still the thought has some merit. I generally both read books and listen to their audio counterpart and what I have found is that audiobooks are better in maintaining pace of the story and getting an overview of the book, it becomes a hassle when people like me who sometimes need to search words for meaning and focus on particular part have to rewind and listen again. Reading however becomes tedious, low light, can't read while  lying small things like that. Plus eye problems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use Immersion Reading quite a lot. The text is read to you as you read it. I find that it puts less strain on the eyes and probably part of the brain, perhaps as the subvocalisation function is carried out for you? </p>
<p>It seems that lots of people and indeed writers are sceptical about non-traditional formats for consuming fiction. Colm Toibín said that listening to books instead of reading them is “like the difference between running a marathon and watching a marathon on TV&quot;. Although I think he subsequently stepped back from that comment. I'm not sure what he might make of the combination of listening and reading simultaneously. </p>
<p>One thing about the process is that you're swept along and less likely to read over a certain sentence or passage repeatedly as you might do when just reading. </p>
<p>For the most part I think it's a great way to go and definitely makes the prospect of getting through a hefty tome much more palatable. I read Roberto Bolano's 2666 like this. A masterpiece but it would have been a lot tougher without the audio aid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I listen to podcasts (not so much audiobooks) all the time and I rewind them a lot.  I find it very similar to when I reread in a book. Sometimes it's me sort of daydreaming or imagining or getting distracted by other thoughts. Other times it's just something that's confusing or information dense and I have to listen twice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually misleading. There is a fairly comprehensive theory called the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning which has gathered substantial evidence for the idea of a dual processing model which states that visual and auditory information are processed i two separate ways, not directly interfering with each other (the exception veing when you are overloaded with information from one modality, preventing you from focusing on the other). The optimal way of learning is therefore by combining visual and auditory information and this has been backed up by several studies (im on mobile right now but google the theory for more indformation - key person behind it is Richard E. Mayer)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is not about audio and visual processing. this is about language processing.</p>
<p>both the audio and the visual are &quot;converted&quot; to &quot;language&quot; in your mind and this &quot;language data&quot; is processed similarly whether you get it from audio or visual.</p></div>		</li>
