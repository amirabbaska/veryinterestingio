			<div class="markdown"><p>Pluto got downgraded because there were lots of other planets near it, too many for them all to count as. So the scientists decided that planets only count if their orbit is mostly empty, which eliminated everything in the Kuiper Belt (that's where Pluto is).</p></div>		</li>
