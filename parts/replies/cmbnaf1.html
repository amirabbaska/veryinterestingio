<p>The singularity isn't necessarily a real, physical thing with zero volume and infinite density. The singualrity is just a solution to the general relativity equations in that scenario. Typically, this is interpreted as the breakdown of the assumptions of GR as quantum effects become dominant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, about the same size as a proton. Assuming there are 7 billion people that weigh 70 kg on average, it's about 85% the radius of a proton. So depending on the actual average weight and number of people, could be more or less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly unrelated question, do nucleons in a nucleus pack like rigid spheres (or rather do their quarks do so, if that's a better question) or do they sort of incorporate and fill a space closer to the volume of the constituent parts?  I guess I'm asking if they're &quot;squishy&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy here we go. So early models of the nucleus used the &quot;liquid drop model&quot; which basically described the nucleus and its energy levels by imagining the nucleus was a bunch of spheres packed together, like you said. It can be boiled down to 5 parameters: the surface energy, volume energy, Coulomb energy, assymetry/symmetry energy, and pairing. The wikipedia page describes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula#The_liquid_drop_model_and_its_analysis" target="_blank">Semi-Empirical Mass Formula quite well, and shows pictures of what I mean by those 5 interactions.</a> This is a very successful model and people still use it as the starting point for a lot of research today.</p>
<p>Nuclear matter can be pretty squishy, and finding out <em>how squishy</em> is the subject of research into the &quot;Nuclear equation of state.&quot; An equation of state is just an equation that tells you the pressure as a function of a bunch of other stuff, the most familiar is the ideal gas law: </p>
<pre><code>     P V = N k T</code></pre>
<p>So the pressure is related to the volume of the gas <em>V</em>, the number of particle in the gas <em>N</em>, some fundamental constant (k is the Boltzmann constant) and the temperature <em>T</em>. This is a sort of 'emergent' phenomena, rather than something fundamental like the equations for gravity, so there's a lot of room to tinker with your assumptions and come up with different equations of pressure which all more or less have the same form, but can differ considerably where it counts. </p>
<p>Anyway, recent experiments like <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/03/physicists-measure-skin-nucleus" target="_blank">PREX</a> try to narrow down the possible equations of state to give us a better idea about a whole lot of nuclear physics. Since heavy nuclei have more neutrons than protons, those neutrons form a sort of squishy <em>skin</em> around the rest of the nucleus where the protons live, so measuring the radius of this neutron skin can be greatly informative. Similarly, if we know an equation of state for nuclear matter at these really high densities then we know how big we expect neutron stars to get and we might be able to figure out what's going on inside them. I think this is one of the few pieces of subatomic physics that are actually informed both by terrestrial lab experiments and by astronomical observations. </p>
<p>Anyway, water (for example) is not very squishy. If you put a lot of pressure on water it doesn't compress- the density at the bottom of the oceans is basically the same as the top, despite having several times the pressure. Nuclear matter in neutron stars, on the other hand, is expected to be compressed up to several times the saturation density, which I think is pretty squishy. Imagine a foam pillow, how hard to do you have to squeeze it in order to reduce it's volume by a factor of 2 or 3? It's kinda like that for nuclear matter.</p></div>		</li>
