<p>Pretty much all shopping used to be &quot;over the counter.&quot; You went in and told an employee what you wanted and he got it for you. The first self-serve grocery store didn't open until 1916 (it was a Piggly Wiggly in Memphis)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interestingly, both of these pieces were part of my final paper for graduating grad school.  Can confirm.  And never thought I'd talk about Piggly Wiggly again, ha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggly Wiggly is the best store just because it's so much fun to say.</p>
<p>I wanna know what your graduate degree is in that you worked Mr. Pig into your thesis/capstone. </p>
<p>My final paper was so boring even I didn't read it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former cashier at the Pig here! Worked there in the 80s. It was the most upscale store in our area and the first one to be open 24-7.  At midnight the stock guys and a night manager were the only ones on duty - they would put dance music on the PA system, so from 12 to 6 am the store was officially “Le Club Oink.”  Fun times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was so surprised when I moved to London to find that some stores still operate that way.  I went into a produce place and touched an onion, and the man who was working there started yelling at me in the thickest northern accent, I couldn't understand a word.  By the time I finally figured out that he wanted to pick out my groceries for me neither of us was very pleased with the other.  I never went back, I don't trust produce that I can't inspect thoroughly before buying, it's weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They still do that in lots of places. Most pharmacies in Russia are like that, even though it's changing. However, you can buy some drugs &quot;over the counter&quot; (that are prescription only in the US), like some antibiotics, without a prescription. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah in japan it's like that at most places. You pick up an empty box on the shelf, and at the counter they exchange it for a real box. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the pharmacies that sell OTC medication and the ones that sell prescription medication are always separate. So the 'CVS's don't sell prescription medicine. It's usually a small shop near the hospital itself. And those dont sell OTC medicine. </p></div>		</li>
