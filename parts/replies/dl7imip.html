You can not even say, that one turbine blade design is good for all wind turbines, for the optimum efficiency the blade must be optimized e.g. regarding the diameter of the turbine, the nacelle height and the expected average wind speeds at the location where the wind turbine is built. Why that?</p>
<p>A wind turbine blade is kind of like an airplane wing. It creates &quot;lift&quot; which rotates the turbine. There are a few characteristics of the wing, that determine how much lift it creates. It is the shape of a specific cross section of the turbine blade, and it's angle of attack  to the wind. Now the wind blows straight onto the turbine at a certain speed. The turbines starts to rotate. Now, from the perspective of a blade the wind doesn't come from straight forward but from the side, because the rotation speed of the blade is adds together with the original wind speed. Because wind turbine blades are so big, the blade tips have a much higher speed than a inside section close to the nacelle. Remember, wind and rotational speed add together. So when you have a bigger blade, it has to be designed differently, because its blade tips will move even faster.</p>
<p>Of course they don't design special turbine blades for a single wind turbine, on a single location. There is a set of different blade types available and the best fit for all the other characteristics is chosen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to nitpick a little. You're right about rotational speeds, but tip speeds are roughly the same for all turbines. Optimal tip speed to wind ratio is somewhere around 9-10. And since most wind turbines are designed for 10 m/s rated wind speed, almost all wind turbine maximum tip speeds are around 90-100 m/s.</p>
<p>So a turbine with a larger diameter will have a slower rotational speed than a smaller turbine for a given wind speed, yet their tips will move roughly as fast. Either way, you're right that every turbine design needs a new blade design.</p>
<p>Conveniently this tip speed ratio is max at 9-10, because above 100 m/s tip speeds you are running into even bigger noise issues anyway, and even compressibility effects. However, as noise gets tackled the general trend is towards higher tip speed ratios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, you're right and I'm aware. Just didn't want to make it any more complicated to someone who's completely new to the matter.</p></div>		</li>
