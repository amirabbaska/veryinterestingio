			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone who has ever used a nice microsope: This difference in refractive indices is why they make oil immersion and water immersion objectives. Even the thin layer of air between a sample and an objective causes a refractive index mismatch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's more to due with the light scattering, light in water scatters far more than light in air, if the eye is submersed in water as in swimming, there is so much light coming into your eyes out of focus that everything is blurry.<br />
The pearl divers have learned a reflex (and it is present in all humans, just merely needs to be exercised) to constrict the pupils into nearly a pinprick. this allows less scattered light and allows for a clearer image, it's the same effect as making the aperture smaller on a dslr when taking HQ /r/EarthPorn/<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you saying pearl divers learn to control a completely involuntary reflex? Can we have a source for that?</p>
<p>Edit: I see it stated in the article that this is a conclusion of a certain researcher. TIL I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, essentially, the more exposed you are to looking around in deeper water at a young age, the more your eyes realise 'oh cool we can focus light better via pupil constriction also'</p></div>		</li>
