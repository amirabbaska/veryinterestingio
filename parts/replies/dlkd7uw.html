			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get mosquito bites that were very typical. Usually 5-8 mm size itchy welts. 2 years ago my body just completely stopped reacting to mosquito bites. They still bite, but there's not a trace left when they're done. I feel like I've been granted a divine miraculous super power. It's fucking <em>awesome</em>. Because of this, I no longer get worked up about minor amounts of mosuitoes, and usually don't notice when they bite.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my gf consistently gets fucking huge welts and basically hives. She tends to notice if there are mosquitoes around <em>way</em> faster than me, for understandable reasons...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happened to me for awhile as a kid, but eventually wore off.  </p>
<p>I got really bad poison ivy and had to get a cortisone shot.  Became immune to mosquito bites, poison ivy and most every other skin irritant for about 10 years after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I'm the unlucky bastard with o+ blood, who gets wrecked by mosquitos while everyone around me stays fine, and I'm severely allergic to every bug bite and sting. I remember one time I was bit on my elbow, and again halfway down my arm, the swelling was so bad that they joined up to create a second arm in mass just in the amount of swelling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah no one ever understands me when I start complaining about mosquitos and go inside. I always thought others just didn’t mind getting torn up, but it turns out they aren’t affected like I am. I also recently became super reactive to being stung.. in the last two years I’ve been stung twice on my ankle and both times it was swollen for days and I couldn’t walk. It was weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you my Mr. Glass? I'm O- and don't get bit often, but even when I do there is no reaction. I was camping with my ex-gf and we both got swarmed, but she looked like she had the chicken pox for 2 weeks, while I didn't even have a mark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep,  I came on here to say just that.  I have flicked bugs off me that I can see biting me and end up with no mark or itch at all. On the very rare occasion I do come up with a noticeable bite, it's tiny and disappears within an hour.  If I got bitten in the middle of the night, I wouldn't even know it in the morning. My sister comes up with massive red marks that apparently itch like crazy </p>
<p>The one exception to this was a bug I met in Byrons Bay, Queensland.  Damn was I allergic to that vicious little bastard </p></div>		</li>
