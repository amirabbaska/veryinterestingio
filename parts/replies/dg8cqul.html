			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. And in many cases, we're talking about the energy that should be plugged into a specific function that occurs deep within the &quot;bowels&quot; of the theory, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_constant#Running_coupling" target="_blank">running coupling</a>. This function controls the strength of individual interactions between fundamental particles. (Note: cars are not fundamental particles :-P)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So my understanding was that it doesn't make sense to say a single (non-accelerating) particle has energy besides mass-energy, because it makes just as much sense to put it in a reference frame where it's at rest. You have to have it as part of a system to have non-mass energy. So does it only make sense to talk about energy scales when they're interacting with something?</p></div>		</li>
