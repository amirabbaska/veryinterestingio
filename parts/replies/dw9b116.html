			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on one really cool thing. Humans have antagonistic muscles like the biceps and triceps muscles that act to return the limb back to its resting position after movement. In alot of inscect muscle systems they can  have an elastic like tissue that compresses upon the contraction of one muscle. The energy from the compression is then released in order to rextend that muscle. This eliminates the need for antagonistic muscles which can also contribute to the presetvation of low mass. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>As /u/Kiwiolo said, arachnid musculature is very different from insect musculature, the two branches having diverged over 400 million years ago. </p>
<p>Arachnids (or at least Aranea - the spiders) rely on flexor muscles in their legs to provide constant inward pressure, and use hydrostatic pressure to force the legs out. This is very efficient, and evolved widely for use on land. This is why their legs curl when they die - there is no hydrostatic pressure, and thus the flexors curl the legs in.</p>
<p>The downside to this is that if the spider's exoskeleton is damaged, they can lose the fluid and thus lose their hydrostatic pressure, and their limbs become useless. It is one of the reasons that spiders are <em>extremely</em> skittish - any damage can be lethal, whereas in other arthropods, their bodies are very compartmentalized. It is also why a spider's gait (the way they walk) <em>looks</em> so different from that of other invertebrates like, say, ants, and also tends to be why they look 'creepy'. That, and the fact that spiders have 7-jointed legs, whereas ants have three-jointed legs (which is also why insects in general have more complex leg musculature more akin to ours - fewer joints means they have better attachment points for muscles).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they curl up because of loss of pressure.  The spider's natural position without blood pressure is curled up, and their heart supplies blood pressure so they can move and stretch (their body is mostly hydraulic).  When they lose that pressure they curl up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another cool thing to add. Arthropods have mostly heterogeneous motor neurons, which means they can selectively recruit individual muscle fibers within a motor unit. Mammals mostly have homogenous motor neurons, meaning a motor neuron stimulating a muscle unit causes all muscle fibers in the unit to contract simultaneously and more or less identically.</p>
<p>This comes into play especially in fast, powerful movements. First thing to know: both inverts and verts have some muscle fibers which are slower, some which are faster. The slow muscle fibers of invertebrates are generally quite slow compared to ours. Fast movement can face residual tension from slow fibers in the antagonistic movement that don't relax quickly enough. To overcome this, in fast movement like an escape response, inhibitory neurons selectively reduce or abolish the recruitment of slow fibers and accelerate their relaxation. This allows unimpeded fast, powerful movement.</p></div>		</li>

Consider applying for flair for panelist flair <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7vek6d/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xviii/" target="_blank">here</a>. That way you don't have to start your comments with &quot;PhD student specializing in insect muscle physiology&quot; -- it'll just say that next to your name. Also, your coolness will increase by 34%.</p></div>		</li>
