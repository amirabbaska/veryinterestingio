			<div class="markdown"><p>His salary is relatively small. According to Google it's $81,840. I can't imagine that's enough to cover the lifestyle he no doubt has. </p>
<p>And I often see CEOs doing a salary of $1 a year, like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerburg, Eric Schmidt, etc. </p>
<p>It sounds like these people would be compensated alternatively though, like with stocks, and then are somehow liquidating that compensation. Several people have suggested dividends, and someone else mentioned borrowing against the stock's value, all of which are great answers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bezos owns about 17% of Amazon, that's almost 82 million shares. Their current stock price is ~$1,040...he sold a million shares back in May for about $671 million. So yes his compensation is primarily in stock. Btw amazon's share price dropped 1% today so pretty sure he is back to only being the second richest man in the world :P </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the $1/year gimmick is just a PR stunt. They get far more bang for their buck being compensated with stock and other perks. I believe those things are taxed at a lower rate than straight cash salary. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No, they're taxed the same as income when they're given to you. After that, only the gains are taxed separately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the above are indeed very possible, but in the case of Bezos he actually sells c.$1bn worth of shares (into the public market) each year in order to fund his other projects e.g. Blue Origin (Source: FT article from yesterday on this topic)</p>
<p>When CEO's have such low cash salaries, it's because the majority of their compensation comes in the form of (usually restricted) shares. These are shares that either a) the company purchases from the public market or b) creates anew (far less common with large, publicly traded companies due to the complexity of new share issuance) and gives to the CEO. These will often have a &quot;lock-up&quot; period where they cannot be sold for a period of time (can vary from 12 months to several years)</p>
<p>This is also a very common form of payment for junior employees' bonuses as well, especially in start ups and the tech sector</p></div>		</li>
