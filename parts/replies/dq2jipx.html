			<div class="markdown"><p>The beta cells don't forget how to make insulin.  They are destroyed by the immune system in T1D.  You could have them make more insulin but there might be so few cells left it won't work to regulate blood glucose and it might increase immune destruction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the insulin producing cells, it's the immune system that's the problem, which would be much harder to edit. There is someone working on a semi permeable membrane that would protect these cells, letting insulin out and also keeping it safe from your body. Nothing to do with CRISPR but pretty brilliant.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, this is similar (and arguably less impressive) than the kid who built an itty bitty fusion reactor in his garage that did an AMA. you can buy all of the stuff needed to do molecular biology/ bootleg gene &quot;therapy&quot; from a catalog, and all you need to do is follow the steps more or less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But in some instances (CF, Duchenne MD) a fix to a single locus in a small number of cells can mean a clinically relevant improvement. In Duchenne, I think they are modifying muscle stem cells and injecting them into the patient. The nice thing about muscle fibers is they are multinucleated cells. So you don't need every bad gene copy to be corrected, just a minority of them. </p></div>		</li>
