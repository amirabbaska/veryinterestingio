			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have ever worked with children or have a child you may have experienced the epic exhale wail on the initial cry of infants/toddlers in shock/pain. Some children will do this to such an extent, they will actually pass out due to lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>Source: worked with a child this would happen to</p>
<p>Edit: side note a way to mitigate this is to blow (exhale your breath short sharp/hard) on the face of a child this is happening to. This can initiate the mammalian reflex to make them gulp air. If a child does pass out from this put them in the recovery position and be ready to reassure them when they come round because they will be disoriented and scared. </p>
<p>2nd edit clarified you blow as in breathe out not clout the poor child in the face!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have to do this for my daughter from when she was 1ish until 5ish. Other adults tended to freak out (one even suggested smacking my kid in the face) when she would turn red or purple from crying so hard but that little trick, one quick blast of air to her face, was always effective at getting her to calm down and not pass out. She's still pretty emotional (just turned 13 whoohoo) but I haven't had to do that in years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did that when I was little! I fell as we were leaving daycare one day, and I was so angry at the pavement, I took in a huuuuuge breath, ready for the scream of my life, and then I passed out. My mom panicked, picked me up and ran back in to the daycare, and they laughed a little and said I'd wake up and be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Once i hit myself so hard that i passed out of crying. It happened before, but according to mom and aunt never for so long. The problem is that we were on a pretty remote area at the time. Blowing air didn’t work, tossing me in the air didn’t work and i started to get blue and still nothing. The dip me in the cold lake and i think that made the trick. Idk. I don’t remember this at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/10/03/dear-science-is-yawning-really-contagious/" target="_blank">the theory that yawning has to do with needing oxygen has been debunked:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a long time, the prevailing theory on yawning was that the deep, forceful breathing involved gave a boost of oxygen to your bloodstream, refreshing a tired brain. But this has been pretty thoroughly debunked.</p>
<p>&quot;Even when you do yawn, the amount of oxygen in your blood doesn't really go up,&quot; Barone said. &quot;And just think about it. If that's what yawning is for, why don't you yawn when you're exercising? That's when you need oxygen most.&quot;</p>

<p>So no.</p></div>		</li>
