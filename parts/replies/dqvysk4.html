			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that I really don't appreciate having to cycle through the other lighting functions just to turn the light off. I use bright most often, I can see how dim might be useful, but I will never ever use the strobe even for what it's meant for. I don't like having to switch through all of that just to turn off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the quality of the switch used. Better lights use better switches etc etc </p>
<p>Also, itâ€™s a fairly standard part and usually easy to replace, make a post on r/flashlight for a walkthrough </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to keep in mind is that it's often possible to drive LEDs harder than the datasheet specifies. Recent Nichia LEDs have an especially large disparity:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nichia.co.jp/specification/products/led_spec/NVSL219CT-E(3484E)R70%20R8000%20R9050.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet</a> maximum current: 1.8A</li>
<li><a href="http://budgetlightforum.com/node/51693" target="_blank">Test</a> maximum current before output starts to decrease: 6.5A</li>
</ul>
<p>So somebody claiming to make 1000 lumens with that emitter may well be telling the truth even though the datasheet doesn't say it can do that.</p>
<p>People telling lies about the flashlights they're selling don't usually use Nichia emitters though. Most often, they claim to use Cree and actually use Latticebright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the data sheets you will typically find a graph of lumens vs. current, as well as recommended maximum current settings. I wouldn't drive it much past the listed values. At some point you'll experience droop, and you're murdering your LEDs life cycle. Short bursts? Sure. That's what they use for strobes on airplanes, lifejackets, a school bus. But sustained high current will likely mess up your LED's chip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I replaced all the lights in my house to LEDs last year. No complaints. I expect to replace them in 3-5 years as they start to die. What do you foresee will the quality/energy improvements be in the typical 1000bulbs/HomeDepot unbranded LEDs in that time? Will it be more of the same with maybe slight price difference or will it be noticeable improvements? My electric bill went down by $100/mo. I spent $800 total on the lights so I am already ROI positive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3-5 years? Why? Do you never turn them off? </p>
<p>Most led bulbs for home use have lifetime expectancy of 20.000 hours. If you run them like 4 hours a day, they should last more than 13 years.</p>
<p>I remember a time when I had to replace my incandescent lights more than once per year. Sounds crazy when you think back to that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two quality concerns for LED bulbs are flicker, and color rendering index. Flicker is unpleasant for obvious reasons, and low-CRI light makes for colors that are dull and sometimes hard to distinguish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After efficiency, increasing the CRI was the next major focus of LED producers like Cree. This is still ongoing but has slowed recently (I think the market reached a level where they were content).</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DownvotesCatposts" target="_blank">DownvotesCatposts</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>So one of the major driving factors in the industry for the past few years was efficiency. Lumens Per Watt was the talk of the town. Since then the LED creators have moved on to other things, like getting that CRI value up closer to sunlight, making bigger LEDs, etc. That being said, since I'm on this side of the industry, I can't say for certain whether or not those efficiency improvements have fully translated to the Home Depot bulbs market. I realize up above I said I work with these companies directly, but more specifically, I'm involved at the conceptual stage, where components are being designed. I'm certain that those specific branches of Phillips and Sylvania and the like are concerned with the lifetime of their parts, but I don't see any major effiency improvements from the last few months that will translate to the light bulb market.</p></div>		</li>
