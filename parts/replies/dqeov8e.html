			<div class="markdown"><p>See lots of comments saying that it's because the light hasn't got here yet, wrong wavelength and others. They all seem to suggest that the light would be bright enough no matter the distance.</p>
<p>But when I look at the sky with the naked eye Vs a telescope or even binoculars I see alot more stars with the optics. Surely this means that they get dimmer the longer the distance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully you have a bit of knowledge of maths.</p>
<p>So one of the best ways to explain why the paradox exists is to imagine that stars are uniformly distributed in the whole of the universe. </p>
<p>If we take a series of shells surrounding the earth the the volume of each shell scares with the distance from Earth squared. (the volume is 4 pi <em> r^2 </em> dr). So if we double the distance from Earth then there is 4 times as much volume at that distance and therefore 4 times as many stars. </p>
<p>However, the light from each star is dimmer since they are further away. In fact the light from each star is reduced by the exact same factor as it spreads out in a sphere. We call this an inverse square law, a star twice as far away will have 4 times less light.</p>
<p>So hopefully you see where this is going. If we have 4 times as many stars and each has 1/4 of the light then each shell will have the same total light. Since the universe is infinite then there are infinite of these shells and if we calculate the total amount of light reaching the earth it comes to infinity * some number.</p>
<p>While there is stuff out there that isn't a star, interstellar dust really. The constant light from these shells of stars will heat it up till it is just as hot  (and as bright) as the stars themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only correct answer. It's so frustrating that every time Olber's paradox is brought up, people (even professionals) keep regurgitating the wrong explanations. You're a beacon of light in a sea of darkness.</p>
<p>Edit. Regarding the CMB, it's also worth pointing out that the number density of photons from the CMB is roughly 10^8 times higher than the number density of photons emitted by stars and gas clouds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct. The finite lives of stars does not resolve the paradox. If not for red shift and the edge of our visible universe, there would still be infinitely many light shells overlapping us at the same time. Infinity is really counterintuitive.</p></div>		</li>
