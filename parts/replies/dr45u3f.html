			<div class="markdown"><p>A hot air ballon does not work on lift. Lift is a result of Newton’s third law of motion e.g. air is pushed down by a helicopter’s blades and the air pushes the helicopter up as a result.</p>
<p>A hot air ballon works on buoyant force created by the displacement of air. The hot air inside the ballon is displacing colder air. This colder air is denser than the warm air hence the ballon will rise until the weight of the ballon+basket+contents+warm air inside ballon=cold air displaced by the ballon</p>
<p>Actually, if you really wanted to know the exact altitude the hot air ballon will rise you will also have to account for the volume of cold air displaced by everything being carried by the ballon like the basket, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Balloon pilots routinely use <em>lift</em> interchangeably with buoyancy. And sailplane pilots use it to mean the rising air encountered in thermals, which is actually another example of buoyancy (of the air, not the aircraft).</p></div>		</li>

<p>A balloon full of hot air produces lift than can carry the basket and its contents </p>
