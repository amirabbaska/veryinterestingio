			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty amazing that they can do that, I never realized it.  And now I realize that some of my favorite shows are all on Netflix, specifically the three you mentioned, OITNB, House of Cards, and Stranger Things.  I also dug The OA.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tough to tell.  Me and my wife loved the show, really got into it, and then after the ending of the season finale we looked at each other and said What The Fuck Was That?</p>
<p>On further reflection I don't think it &quot;ruined&quot; the show for me, it just gave it a different dimension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The OA is absolutely fantastic.  Its more like an eposodic movie than a TV  show.  The end is really fucking weird and doesn't answer any questions.  You should watch it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, I wouldn't say ruined. But they definitely fuck with you in the last episode. It's worth watching. Big ass cliffhanger. If cliffhangers and not much resolution bother you a lot, might want to avoid. I really loved it over all though. Like... a lot. Almost as much as Stranger Things.</p>
<p>The actor that played Hershel in the Walking Dead is amazing, I loved him. Was kind of awkward watching the actress who played Phyllis in The Office though but I loved it all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I am in the same boat as you. I watched the first two episodes and was pretty bored the entire time. The end of episode 2 was kind of cool, but I just didn't care enough about the character to want to see what happens to her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they care how much a movie will return?  I doubt it.  Movie studios have ludicrous charging plans.  Like you want our content, we want 20% of your revenue.  Not for their stuff, just your revenue.  Basically if you do anything else with the company beside deal with that studio, you hand over money for that too!    So you go to sign up the top 5 studios and suddenly you need to pay out over 100% of your revenue.</p>
<p>But they have the product and you need it.  What can you do?  </p>
<p>Make your own content so you can start proper negotiations or tell them to shove it.  They have been doing this for a long time.  </p>
<p>Even the entertainment photography business is insane.   I have seen the negotiations for getty images. We wanted to buy all their content.  They said OK, so like ,3 pictures from each set.  No all of it.  Ok like 4 then?  All of it.  OK so we will write it up as 3 images from each set of images then.  No all of it, every image.   OK so back to the 4?   It was wassurral.  Every 4 months they cut us off because we had retrieved all their images... It was insane.   I can only imagine the movie studio negotiation teams.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Netflix, unlike HBO, has an amazing capacity to see how viewership is affected by everything. They know how many people stopped at a specific episode, and often they know at what second they stopped.<br />
This data, combined with whether they came back can give them indicators into how people want to watch shows and what caused viewers to leave a series.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HBO has the exact same capacity. Being a premium cable channel means they collect that data for TV viewers, and they also collect it form their online viewers as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still baffled as to why HBO decided it needed two separate streaming services. I used to use HBO Go when I had HBO as part of a cable package. Then, when I cut cable, I picked up HBO Now as the standalone digital service. </p>
<p>But I was still trying to use my old HBO Go bookmark to watch, and it wasn't recognizing my subscription. It was only later that I realized I had to log in through a separate portal to access the service. Very strange execution.</p></div>		</li>
