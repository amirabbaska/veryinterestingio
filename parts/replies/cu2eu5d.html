			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how much of that is true, athletes could still try to predict the &quot;start!&quot; and move too soon.  At least with a rythimic countdown you know exactly when to start, its predictable (at least in my case when I used to be in my high school band). In any case we won't know for sure because it won't ever be applied to real track/swimming competitions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone in your band wanted to start together. Everyone in a foot race wants to start a millisecond before the next guy. Nothing completely eliminates false starts, but I can tell you from experience, a rhythmic countdown absolutely creates more false starts than a &quot;ready [pause] start&quot; command. There's a reason why the Olympics use the latter system.</p></div>		</li>
