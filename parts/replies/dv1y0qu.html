			<div class="markdown"><p>The terms of the peace treaty signed by the Nixon administration were violated almost immediately after Nixon scandal started and the verbiage was quite clear &quot;The US would respond with the full force of the US military if the treaty was violated&quot;. The north violated the treaty, buried people alive and put people who worked with or sympathized with the west in concentration camps. The US did not respond... At all. The Soviets and North Vietnamese essentially won that war -- Not before the treaty as the North definitely lost ground once the US entered but certainly post treaty the north and soviets out maneuvered the west. The Watergate scandal could not have come at a better time 1972 (when the treaty was signed).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The soviets weren't nearly as involved in the war as you might think.  North vietnam certainly directed a lot of the southern born insurgency, but it was mostly a vietnamese effort.  Diplomatic cables between china and the ussr later revealed that they had no interest in risking a ground war w/ the US in vietnam or escalation elsewhere, they were ok w/ north vietnam collapsing.</p>
<p>But more importantly it's not like this one misguided treaty was what lost the war.  The south was never able to form a popular government, it was one long succession of oppressive dictators the people hated.  The US made gains in terms of ground and body counts when they entered, yes, and they prolonged the regime's lifetime a decade longer than it would have lasted otherwise.  But with the possible exception of the peace talks the Nixon administration sabotaged there was never a time when it looked obvious that the war could end w/ the South in a favorable position.  And certainly by the time the US left, it wasn't like the north and the VC needed to do a lot of clever maneuvering, they were facing an absolutely devastated ARVN</p>

<p>If watergate had any impact, it was to accelerate trends that the american public and members of both parties had put in place to wind down US involvement for years.  Nixon's entire strategy of vietnamization was to get US troops out of there and leave a few in support roles, roughly akin to the obama administration's transition in afghanistan.</p>
<p>That treaty you mention was a paper tiger.  It wasn't what lost the war, it was how the US conceded they lost the war while saving a bit of face</p></div>		</li>

<p>The north viewed Nixon as crazy and did not move on Saigon until he was fully out of office and didn't make any significant moves until it was clear he was on his way out. The North most certainly believed Nixon would respond with the full might of the US military. The didn't just role in, they took small amounts of territory at a time to gauge the US response. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>I don't think I've revealed how much I think or don't think they were involved. I know that post WW2 the country was split into a democracy and communism with the soviets having the North as their project and the west having the south. I know the North was heavily armed by the soviets and the south was even more so by the US.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>I did not claim it was.</p>

<p>The south was in a fine position after the peace agreement in 1972. The North violated the agreement and murdered thousands of civilians in doing so. If the south was not in favorable position who was favored? The North? No, the North was losing land and people, it was just a very bloody war but they were losing.</p>

<p>I won't sign my name next to &quot;If watergate had any impact&quot; but I'll agree with the rest.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Basically agree.</p>

<p>It was not a paper tiger to Nixon, the timing was poor. The North believed the terms of the treaty when it was signed -- Nixon and the political climate changed that. </p></div>		</li>
