			<div class="markdown"><p>So when you say &quot;sea&quot;, are we talking a concrete number of particles? Like &quot;48&quot;? Like &quot;roughly 3 million&quot;? Or is it really just a noisy mess of an uncountable amount particles bouncing around randomly (aside from some rough clustering or something)? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every nucleus has a well-defined A (mass number). That’s the total number of nucleons that make it up. It’s not necessarily trivial to partition them into clusters. For example, certain states in carbon-12 are well-represented by clusters of three alpha particles. Other states in carbon-12 might be better described as 6 protons and 6 neutrons. In general, they’re somewhere in between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't an alpha particle a bundle of 2 protons and 2 neutrons? Is there something special about its structure that make it important here? Or is it more that sometimes the nucleons in a carbon atom will clump up into sets of 4?</p>
<p>Is it possible for quarks between nucleons to temporarily form particles with 2 and 4 quarks, or 6 quarks? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A proton is a sea of uncountable quark/antiquarks pairs with 3 more quarks than antiquarks.</p>
<p>Edit: here is a link and and little excerpt from such link. </p>
<p>&quot;You may have heard that a proton is made from three quarks... This is a lie — a white lie, but a big one.  In fact there are zillions of gluons, antiquarks, and quarks in a proton.... (zillions meaning “too many and too changeable to count usefully”) &quot;

<p>alpha clusters</p>

<p>To get a feel for what this looks like: <a href="http://www.clarifyscience.info/assets/2017-Atoms/assets0/wk/1406.2473-Be.png" target="_blank">Be</a> (2 alpha; centers are about 5 fm apart); <a href="http://www.clarifyscience.info/assets/2017-Atoms/assets0/wk/1406.2473-Ne.png" target="_blank">Ne</a> (5 alpha).  Both are ground state.  From <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2473" target="_blank">this paper</a> (pretty pictures on page 4).</p>
<p>Googling for &quot;Ikeda diagram&quot; might also be of interest.(<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Ikeda-diagram-7-The-threshold-energies-for-each-configuration-are-given-in-MeV_fig1_281963269" target="_blank">example</a>)</p>
<p>Basically, light nuclei are like clusters of nucleons, and heavy nuclei are like liquid drops (<a href="https://imgur.com/a/3OvsYJa" target="_blank">gif</a>) of nucleons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as I explain above, there aren’t really “quark lumps”. There are ”nucleon and quasiparticle lumps”. Different isotopes of the same element just have different N. Shell effects will influence cluster formation. For example, a state in carbon-12 may resemble a “molecule” of three alpha particles. But carbon-11 or carbon-13 won’t have such a state.</p></div>		</li>
