<p>Your other 2 points, however, are exactly why firing squad is not used very much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The quote that always got me was that the us is a lethal injection for humans that fails to meet the standards of the American veterinary college's standard for euthanasing dogs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. By a 9mm handgun (small caliber bullet, not nearly the size of a standard rifle round) and the bullet did not cross her corpus callosum. There are several examples of people surviving bullets, etc to the head when the bullet only impacts one hemisphere of the brain and leaves the other perfectly intact. Phineas P. Gage is an example.</p>
<p>This was still an amazing story though, as a lot of people who survive the actual shot either die from blood loss/ complications because EMTs aren't immediately on the scene or have significant long term complications. </p></div>		</li>

<p>WIRED: In the book you mention that there’s one method with no documented botched executions, but you don’t say much about it.</p>
<p>Sarat: The firing squad. We don’t talk much about it because in 120 years there were only 34 executions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite other methods being botched frequently, firing squad was reliable, in the US at least. Lethal injection is not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the introduction of lethal injection in 1980, just over 7 percent of lethal injections have been botched.</p>
