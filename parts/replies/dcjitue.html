			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there are lots of animals in the world that eat a very small number of foods. Giant Pandas are a great example, they eat almost entirely bamboo leaves. This is great if they have bamboo around, but not great if they can't find any. If they do have bamboo around, eating is very simple.</p>
<p>Humans can eat almost anything. We can eat meat, vegetables, fruit, even milk past infancy (which only humans can do!). Cooking has also helped us eat more foods. We've evolved to eat cooked food, though. Our jaws have shrunk and become weaker, our teeth smaller, our intestines shorter and our stomachs simpler. A human would have a very hard time living on fruits and vegetables in the wild, and it's hard for us to digest raw meat, too. Cooking food makes it easier to digest, and sometimes lets us eat food we couldn't eat raw at all, like wheat.</p>
<p>With such a variety of food that we can eat, it's very possible for a human to eat the wrong stuff.  Not poisonous, but bad for our long-term nutrition. The good news is it makes us much less likely to starve, since we can eat all sorts of food other animals can't. It's sort of a trade off humans make.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why? </p>
<p>In my mind the problem would be scarcity ... outside of a tropical environment I'm not sure I could scavenge enough to survive. You make it sound like a biological issue though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's always food anywhere there are plants, but whether or not we can eat it is the question. This is a question beyond being poisoned, but one of digestion.</p>
<p>Our jaws aren't strong enough anymore to effectively eat a lot of raw, wild foods. I'm sure in some sort of Garden of Eden scenario with the right mix of fruits and vegetables it would be ok, but humans have such a hard time chewing we can't handle really tough foods. On top of that, we have a pretty basic stomach and short intestines. These don't handle spoiled food well and can't extract as much nutrition. You'd spend so much time looking for food and chewing it that you'd slowly starve to death in all but the absolutely most productive wild places. Many animals, even those in seemingly lush places like the rain forests, spend a huge amount of their waking hours eating and looking for food. They have to, otherwise they'll starve. Virtually all of them have better jaws than humans, too. </p>
<p>Bear in mind too that we're a species of farmers now, and the produce we eat has been bred for thousands of years to be better than wild food. Bigger, more nutritious, more productive, easier to eat. You're not going to find apples in the wild that look anything like what you see in a grocery store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Digestion isn't automatic or effortless; it effectively costs calories.  Cooking helps to save some of that effort, which means cooked food effectively has more calories (this is one of the lesser understood reasons processed food is so bad for you, btw--junk food is usually extra easy to chew and digest).</p>
<p>Humans have evolved to have big, calorie hungry brains, and we're only able to meet the needs of it and the rest of our bodies through cooking.  Even the people who make raw diets work are usually just using other technologies, like blenders/juicers, to do the same sort of &quot;pre-digestion.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever seen those shows where they put people on a 100% natural raw diet? Most people end up with bad indigestion issues, weight loss, tiredness, constant diarrhea, etc. Humans evolved by learning to cook food and we lost abilities to efficiently absorb nutrients from raw foods. It's inefficient and you'll be tired as your body struggles to grab as much from the raw food as it can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be gross, but I've always kinda wondered what that high fat and protein, low fiber diet does to the gut. I know that indulging in a lot of meat and fat with no veggies does me no damn favors when it comes to bathroom time. Are their bodies just used to it and there is no problem, or are they a nation of farters?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problems at all.</p>
<p>I eat a ketogenic diet, which is mostly fat, some protein, and very little carbs. Even if I skip all the vegetables (which happens) I am absolutely fine.</p>
<p>In terms of gas, eating this way means almost none of it. The thing that makes most of the gas are stomach critters that primarily feed on starches. So, no starch is no gas!</p>
<p>An inuit would be eating something similar, but too high in protein to put them into the realm of ketogenics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When your forefathers have been doing it for literal ages, you're born with a particular digestive penchant. I'm sure if you have an Inuit, who eats nearly only meat, a bunch of high-fibre vegetables you'd have a messy situation, in much the same way you'd have troubles feeding a vegan nothing but steak. </p></div>		</li>
