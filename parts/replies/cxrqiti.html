			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. It is not faster, rather it is better. If you heal from the inside out, secondary intention, you won't have the formation of pus pockets. It prevent further complications. I have first hand experience with pilonidal cyst removal as well as being a nurse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily after mine was surgically removed, the wound healed perfectly. Maybe it was because I was only 14 when it happened? Either way, the more I read about them later in life, the more I realize how lucky I am because it sounds like they almost never heal that well. Plus, 11 years later I have yet to have another one <em>fingers crossed</em> it stays that way... That thing seriously sucked and really, no good way to explain that to people...</p></div>		</li>
