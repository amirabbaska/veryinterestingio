			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious, what exactly do you do to strengthen your back? I've always had pretty bad back pain when doing stuff like cooking for longer than 40 minutes and its gotten me really afraid to get a job that requires standing (which unfortunately is pretty much everything that's entry level). I've gotten suggestions to work out more but I'm not really sure where to start</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One simple way is to lie on your back on a flat surface (e.g. bed, floor), bend at your knees so your feet are flat on the surface, and elevate your hips off the surface until your upper legs and torso form a straight line (as observed from the side; your shoulder blades and feet will be in contact with the floor). You can hold this position for some duration, or you can lower yourself back down and repeat.</p>
<p>You'll likely feel it in your glutes and hamstrings, but that's pretty unavoidable when it comes to strengthening the back.</p>
<p>For the first time or two especially, I'd stop well before you wear yourself out, so you can get a sense of how the exercise will affect you over the following two or three days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strengthen your core! A lot of people have lower back pain, not because their lower back is weak, but because of anterior pelvic tilt. A strong core does wonders for your body.</p>
<p>Let me expand on this. Most people sit throughout the majority of the day, whether it be work, school, or driving. When people sit for long periods of time, certain muscles are shortened, quads and lower back, and others are lengthened, glutes and lower abs. Because our skeletal muscle system is interconnected, if the quads are constantly shortened and become tight while the glutes are lengthened and weak, the pelvis will tilt forward (similar to a see saw). Once the pelvis is tilted forward, the abodominal muscles will also become lengthened and weak while the lower back muscles are shortened and tight (once again like a see saw).</p>
<p>The muscle and skeletal system is like a system of pulleys and levers. The human body compensates when it finds a weakness.</p>
<p>I'm not a doctor or personal trainer. I suffered from anterior pelvic tilt and had to retrain my body to correct itself.</p></div>		</li>
