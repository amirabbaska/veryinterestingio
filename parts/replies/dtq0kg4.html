			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m sorry, but saying it’s because <em>some</em> military members may <em>some time</em> have to kill someone is why the military has a judicial system is just wrong. Police may have to kill. They don’t have a separate judicial system (I guess that’s arguable). </p>
<p>The other two paragraphs are correct (for the most part) though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Police aren't part of the military in the UK and US because people get very unconfortable with the idea of the military policing the civilian population. I'd argue though that if you're going to give the police military weaponry, they probably <em>should</em> be subject to military law.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A bunch of de-mil'd weapons in the hands of people who look tacti-cool does not make one a military, anymore than dudes who buy AR's are military.</p>
<p>Being in the military means you are sanctioned forces of the government, and not civilians. Military ID cards all comply with Geneva Conventions requirements on identification, for instance, and the Geneva Conventions protect the rights of soldiers around the world especially in regard to things like captivity.</p>
<p>There's more to it than just the weapons you have</p></div>		</li>
