			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s the electromagnet one others have described. Also known as a coilgun. Basically surround your barrel with spaced electromagnets, activate the magnets in (fast) sequence to draw the projectile forward but release it in time for it to keep moving to the next magnet, then you’ve got yourself some acceleration and a moving projectile. Think of it like a linear motor. I built a shitty one in high school that could pop balloons. Can be a fun little project,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gauss Guns drive a ferrous projectile by turning on and off electro magnets. Basically you line electro magnets around a barrel. The magnet pulls the projectile forward, when it passes the first magnet it turns off so it doesn't pull the projectile backwards, magnets in front of it either turn on or were already on. You cannot fire a non ferrous projectile as you need them to be strongly attracted to magnets.</p>
<p>Rail guns act like /u/ZX_ZX explains, it's two rails that an electrical current goes through. It does end up generating a magnetic field but I do not believe it's important to anything. It should be able to fire any conductive material. This is important because you might want to fire something like a rod of uranium for it's extra high density. Not that you couldn't dope it with iron to make a magnetic alloy for a gauss gun.</p>
<p>They're both considered high tech weapons that have their origin in popular culture in sci fi. They both require a tremendous amount of electricity and can theoretically fire ammunition with more force than conventional firearms (plus it's ammunition is caseless which has a bunch of advantages). Rail guns generally take more electricity and have a higher theoretical speed for their projectiles.</p>
<p>For fun, here's what is basically the principal of a gauss rifle you can make at home. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC7i4WJhRwI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC7i4WJhRwI</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is correct, but doesn't fully answer the question.  It just explains why there's no flames when the projectile leaves the barrel.</p>
<p>So, when the projectile hits the steel plates, some of it's energy is dispersed, and the projectile slows down.  Any time energy is dispersed, it turns into heat.  To see this yourself grab a paperclip and bend it back and forth until it breaks.  The part that bends is absorbing the energy you put into it, and will be noticeably hot to the touch.  In the case of the rail-gun, most of the energy is dispersed into the metal plate (and presumably the air around it)  The &quot;flames&quot; you're seeing coming off of the metal plates are most likely bits of molten metal and gas that have been heated by the impact.</p>
<p>As for why you don't see any flames while the projectile is flying through the air, there's simply nothing that would create such an effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not only the fact that some of the energy is converted into heat which melts the metal. Some metals can actually combust with a high enough surface area, when the projectile hits the metal plate, a lot of small particles are dispersed which light up in flames.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question: why are we assuming the projectile is hitting metal? OP said nothing about a metal target in their post. What if it hit, say, a pumpkin? Should we still expect an explosion then? </p>
<p>As a corollary, what surfaces would we not expect an explosion?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>though if the projectile was flying fast enough (very theoretical) it would eventually be able to set up a fusion reaction in front of it due to the amount of air being compressed and the force of that compression</p>

<p>probably not realistic, since the speed would have to be relativistic (I think?) - see xkcd What If? about <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/" target="_blank">baseball</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't actually need to be going that fast to get &quot;flames&quot; in mid air. In fact, the little bit of looking I did says that the projectiles actually are going fast enough to create the same atmospheric heating that re-entering spacecraft experience.  As for why you don't see that in this gif, I can only assume it's due to the projectile's aerodynamic shape or the short duration of it's flight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact:  I had a friend back in the 90s who worked on early railgun prototypes at a university physics lab.  He mentioned at the time that the biggest problem they were trying to overcome was that the friction from the projectile was so great that it would melt the rails after each test fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, the Lorentz force of the current in the rails forces them apart - the rails have to be rigid enough to not bend apart, have enough contact with the projectile to pass all the current without arcing that damages the rails, have low friction so that they (and the projectile) don't heat up and melt ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really <em>friction</em> -- that's pretty easy to solve.  You're dumping huge amounts of electricity through the connections between the projectile and the rails, and <em>that</em> is what's producing lots of heat.</p>
