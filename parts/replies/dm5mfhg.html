			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree about the effect of gravity. You initially argued that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rapid changes in momentum that would wreak havoc on a human body</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you're right. But later on you stated that a lower gravity would alter the effect of a change in momentum which is false. The weight changed because you're measuring the mass Ã— gravity but the mass is still constant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way. You take a ball on Earth, and you can throw it a certain distance, because gravity pulls it down to the ground.</p>
<p>You throw the same ball on Titan, and it will travel <em>about</em> 6.5 times further, because of the lower gravity. Plus, your arm will be able to apply just a little more force to the ball, propelling it faster.</p>
<p>As for the momentum changes, because the object travels farther with the same speed, a lower speed is necessary for forward travel (6G acceleration for the 30m jump), that means less force is required to change directions, and less damage would occur to the body for the rapid change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if i want to stop the ball while it's at the top of its arc (on titan the ball would fly higher too) I'd need the same force on both planets if i used the same force to throw them.</p>
<p>Your statement is true but logic flawed. Only reason it flys further is because it takes longer for it to fall down and not that the ball has less mass. You are confusing the two.</p>
<p>Imagine a car hitting a wall on earth and Titan. If the collision is perfectly horizontal and nothing moves vertically the results would be identical (near identical) since the car has the same mass on both bodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Accelerating 10kg from 10m/s in one direction to 10m/s in the other direction in 1 second of time takes 200 kgm/s^2 no matter what planet you are on or what the gravity is. It takes that much acceleration even in microgravity. </p>
<p>The force exerted on a body rapidly changing direction does not change. What you are thinking of is the force required to counter the effects of gravity, which is additional force on top of the base force needed to change direction, but the horizontal maneuvers in AoT are just as deadly and impossible as the vertical, and gravity's presence and magnitude does not affect those at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if your argument that the 3DMG wouldn't work because of the &quot;rapid changes to momentum&quot;, why would that be any different if gravity is less? Your <strong>weight</strong> is what changes on Titan, but mass is the same everywhere, which means so is momentum.</p></div>		</li>
