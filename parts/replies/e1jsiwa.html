			<div class="markdown"><p>Although strangely enough, you can say either &quot;I am not.&quot; or &quot;I'm not.&quot; as complete sentences.<br />
I think the convention has mostly to do with the fact that &quot;I'm&quot; is a single syllable.  Single syllables just don't work (feel right) as complete sentences, in English at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the operative word, which takes the stress for this reason, is the verb, so contracting it away misplaces the emphasis by putting them on an equal footing. You're already leaving out the rest of the arguments, to leave out some of the verb itself so no stress can fall on it is a problem. With &quot;I am not&quot; the stress falls on &quot;not&quot; - both phonetically and semantically this is the operative word (in many languages, e.g. Finnic Ines, &quot;not&quot; is a modal verb of its own rather than an adverb). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks - that makes sense, and explains why negative contractions can be exceptions.</p></div>		</li>
