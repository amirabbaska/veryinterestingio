<p>This is the correct answer. Only thing I would add is to google &quot;comparative method&quot;, which is the actual method linguists use to reconstruct languages that aren't around anymore.</p>
<p>Edit: by &quot;correct&quot; i mean correct for the general case. Obviously if there's written records those are helpful and could even give us information we wouldn't get otherwise, but the method used to decipher/interpret those records would vary by language, e.g., Chinese oracle bone inscriptions vs. Egyptian hieroglyphs, etc. In the specific case of Egyptian, the comparative method can't really help us much because (afaik) there's just one descendent (Coptic), and you need at least two languages to apply the comparative method (there's another method called internal reconstruction that you can use when you only have one language, but I don't know how useful that is for Coptic). That's where written records come in, and others have already mentioned the problems with determining vowels, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most historical linguists would date PIE to about 6000 years ago. As with any language you'd expect there to be dialectal variation, and you'd expect it to be surrounded by other, neighboring languages (some of which are no longer spoken, i.e., they have no descendant languages in use today).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well my training/specialization (in linguistics grad school) was historical linguistics. If you're lucky you get hired to be a professor at a university teaching historical linguistics, so it can be a profession. I was not lucky so my current job doesn't involve what i was trained for, but the field is specialized enough that even now i get requests to review articles as part of the peer review process (which i do for free lol).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the correction. My background is molecular genetics, so I know I don't have all the terms right. I was very struck, though, at the applicability of molecular evolution concepts and techniques to linguistics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer that isn't receiving the deserved attention. It's not only about having a direct way of deducing how they sounded (like informal writing), it's also about understanding the universal mechanics of phonological change, which is a very well-consolidated area within historical linguistics, and then finding your way up from modern languages into the classic ones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this puts it into perspective. With an individual sound there's no way to really know if you've tracked back the sound correctly even with corroborating sources. If you know where it ended up and how it's shifted then you can figure out where to look for where it came from. It's the same as when anthropologists find lost settlements. It's a lot easier to find if you have a good idea of where they left and what they were trying to reach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent book, though I found myself skimming through some of the archaeological bits as they tend to get a bit repetitive (here's another 17 pages talking about the kind of pots they found at sites associated with this particular culture).</p>
<p>Also it seems to have a bit of an 'angle' so I wouldn't take it entirely at its word without reading a couple of things from other archaeologists / linguists who disagree with it.</p>
<p>But some really enlightening stuff, both about language and other things (e.g. horses may have originally been domesticated for meat/milk because unlike cows and sheep, you can leave them out in a snowy pasture and they're smart enough to dig/stomp through the snow and not starve to death).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely has an angle. The author is an archaeologist who champions a southern Ukraine origin for Indo Europeans. Line you said, though, it has a lot of great info.</p></div>		</li>
