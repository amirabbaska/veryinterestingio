			<div class="markdown"><p>His explanation is wrong. Your body metabolises ethanol to ethanal which is evaporated from your lungs. Ethanal also gives you the hangover headache and is carcinogenic :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>:( breath faster to avoid cancer?</p>
<p>Edit: Also, does that mean simply being in a drinking environment, you're exposing yourself to carcogens? (Ethanal in air)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would having a larger surface area for your lungs help you get rid of the alcohol faster?</p>
<p>Also, I was under the impression that it was the acetaldhyde that leads to the hangover, not the alcohol directly, since the alcohol gets metabolized fairly quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If coke was more pungent it would easily be detected on peoples breath just as alcohol.</p>
<p>Now if the question was about a certain scent that appears long after drinking called ketoacidosis then it would be a different answer.  BTW that scent does not always limited to alcohol and does not always appear from consuming a beverage or two.</p></div>		</li>
