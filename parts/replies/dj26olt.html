			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be some differences. The sky would not be blue, instead it would be much more like the night sky. The shimmering you see near warm objects would disappear. You would also be able to see distant things more clearly, as they would be less distorted by small atmospheric fluctuations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe (but am not an expert on the subject ) that refraction is only an issue when transitioning mediums. When you are  above or below water, things look to be where they are unless you are looking at something on the other side of dividing line.</p>
<p>As for no air, look at pictures of taken in space. The only effect is the light is not diffused at all. So things in direct sunlight are super well lit, and shadowed areas are pitch black,  excepting when some reflected light, mostly from the Earth,  hits them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only because usually transitioning mediums also involves transitioning density. Water is more dense than air. So transitioning regions of air with different density has a similar effect</p></div>		</li>

<p>We CAN'T see the air!  We only &quot;see&quot; the refraction of light passing through it, distorting images of distant objects.</p></div>		</li>
