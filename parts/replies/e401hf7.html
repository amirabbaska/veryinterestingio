			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that actually works. It still takes energy (because you need to increase the speed), but it can make a significant saving to do this kind of transfer.</p>
<p>(If you're interested in what's happening to the energy, you would hit the surface of the Sun at a much higher speed if you did this. That's why it isn't particularly useful for say, landing somewhere.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These types of transfers are also useful for reversing the direction of your orbit. It takes a lot less energy to move to a higher orbit, cancel out all your velocity at the higher apoapsis and accelerate in the opposite direction, then return to a circular orbit at periapsis than it does to directly reverse your orbit from it's lower distance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This comparison isn't quite right. The spacecraft we sent to escape the solar system (one passing by Pluto) took a decade or two, but it was only that fast because they were travelling at tens of kilometers/second. </p>
<p>A bi-elliptic transfer of this type would need to end with the ship slowing down to almost stationary at its furthest point from the sun. As a result it would take considerably longer to pull off than it did to do the tremendously fast flyby of Pluto or escape the solar system. You're looking at something in the order of centuries.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To reach the Sun (or get very close), you have to cancel all this speed - accelerate backwards by nearly 30 km/s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm just being pedantic and elaborating your point.</p>
<p>If you performed this burn and didn't cancel all of your speed, you would be on a highly elliptical orbit with the periapsis (the lowest point) being within the sun and the apoapsis (the highest point) remaining at your current &quot;altitude&quot;. If you were a perfect spherical cow, and the tidal forces or the heat the sun wouldn't rip you apart, you would continue on this highly elliptical orbit forever until you performed the equivalent burn on your periapsis to bring your apoapsis down.</p>
<p>If you overshot by a little when making the burn, the same thing would happen but your elliptical orbit would be in reverse!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're being pedantic...</p>
<p>Even if you perform the burn and do cancel *all* your 30 km/s speed, you're going to wind up 1 AU away from the Sun at 0 km/s, which will *still* put you on a highly elliptical orbit, as you begin to fall straight toward the Sun.</p>
<p>And once your orbit starts passing through the Sun, the Sun stops behaving like a point mass (the shell of material outside the trajectory at any point exerts no force on the satellite at that point) and you also start having to consider &quot;aero&quot;dynamic forces. So your trajectory is not really an ellipse. And then there's the nuclear incineration....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely!</p>
<p>I should have mentioned my perfect spherical cow has a volume of zero and it's orbiting a point mass (quietly back-pedalling...). The point was that the perfect spherical cow would still have to shed a lot of energy, whether it's through a controlled burn or aerodynamic drag, to stay close to the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Believe it or not, this is the correct answer. It just takes a lot longer.</p>
<p>The lower your orbit, the faster you are going. Go faster, and the other side of your orbit gets larger, you go higher, but are slower when you get there. </p>
<p>Orbits trade kinetic and gravitational potential energy back and forth in a form of harmonic motion. So, the higher, the slower, the less velocity to cancel.</p>
<p>Longer journey, less fuel. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-elliptic_transfer" target="_blank">Bi-elliptic Transfer</a>. And, for a bonus, since there are large planets out there, you can use them to change direction via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist" target="_blank">gravity assist</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Correct answer&quot; might not be the term I'd use... It's one viable option, but it takes significantly longer, and the velocity near the sun is very high so observations are more difficult to make. If we want a low sun orbit to actually learn about the sun, then this is most certainly not the correct answer. </p></div>		</li>
