			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a teenager it made me giggly and it was fun but when I got a little older, no matter how much or how little or what kind of silly strain I try it gives me instant panic attacks and depressed anxiety for hours. It's even given me auditory hallucinations a couple times. My circle of friends pretty much all still use it recreationally but I just can't hang it is a horrible experience every time.</p>
<p>I've given it another shot here and there but it's always the same. I'm generally a pretty stable
mellow guy but it fucks me up big time and turns me into a wreck. Guess it doesn't like to bind to the good receptors in my brain.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! I remember one day seemingly out of the blue when I was 18 it no longer was fun and I would get this burning anxiety in the pit of my stomach when I smoked like some shit was about to go down.</p>
<p>I'm 27 now, and the only way I can enjoy weed is if I take a tiny tiny puff and not hold it in long. I get just enough of the right effects in a very very mild way and none of the anxiety but it's also only like a 15 minute feeling,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm chiller than a margarita slushie, but my friends that do suffer from anxiety have reported excellent experiences from high CBD strains.</p>
<p>I claim medical ignorance, so i can't properly discuss the sciece behund it, but perhaps some anxiety develops from the illegality of the drug? I'm sure people get anxious stealing a car, but does anyone go around saying &quot;stealing cars may cause anxiety, and in some cases, incarceration?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the high CBD strains, they're pretty good.</p>
<p>I'm sure the legal status/stigma introduces some amount of anxiety for the user but that's more circumstantial than based on the biochemistry of the drug.</p></div>		</li>
