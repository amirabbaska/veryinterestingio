			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this true though? The seven tone tempered scale and major and minor chords  aren’t naturally occurring.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as with fastfood and sugary foods. Cultures around the world are naturally drawn to these foods because hundreds of thousands of years ago these resources were scarce, and we never had an abumdance of these until only thousands of years ago, which is not long enough for the genes to adapt (also with healthcare for obese people there is no evolutionary filter, making it alnost impossible for our genes to ever adapt) the only cures are technology or artificial selection processes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s an obvious reason why people are driven to sugary foods, but I’m not sure what the obvious reason is that people not exposed to western chords would innately associate specific emotions by flatting a third in a chord. Thousands of years ago flat thirds were scarce resources?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Major chords <em>are</em> naturally occurring. They come from three notes in the [harmonic series](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music</a>), the 4th, 5th, &amp; 6th partials. The harmonic series is a result of physics. </p>

<p>It's true, they wouldn't. But stuff like that can be picked up really early, since things like relative pitch and intervals are part of language. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This still doesn’t address OP’s claim I’m asking about that the emotional associations to chords is innate. Westerners considered the third dissonant prior to the Renaissance. The minor third is not naturally occurring (nor is the major seven. The harmonic series has a minor/dominant seven).</p>
<p>If it were really innate I’m not sure why it wasn’t until around 1500 that the west began considering it acceptable to incorporate it in chords.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's surprising that the work was done on a single scale with no other reference notes (chords or harmonies). A single scale can be either major or minor based on context. For instance, the C Major scale and the A Minor scale are exactly the same notes. They become &quot;C Major&quot; or &quot;A Minor&quot; based on context. So what context would a single scale have? This may be why there was no correlation found. Subjects would either have no context, or create their own context, when hearing the scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without anything else, starting and/or ending on the root note gives enough context to interpret the scale as major/minor or whatever mode.</p></div>		</li>
