			<div class="markdown"><p>Even minor wounds actually take years to fully repair, they may appear to be gone and feel fine but the area is still damaged, healing wounds takes a lot of time and energy.</p>
<p>Scars are quite significant damage, which is why your body had to use the cheap and fast collagen method to repair it, but they're still healing for years after, as I was taught your body is breaking down the collagen it used to quickly repair the wound and replacing it with what was there before, which is why scars fade over time. There is a limit to how much it can fully repair though, but I don't know why that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just think of it like this:
As layers of your skin come off and regenerate it reduces the appearance of the scar. Stuff like Mederma and Neosporin help scars and stretch marks, not sure how. There's some scratches I have that have been there for... months, and I'm like, there's no way that will be a scar. I guess over time stiff just gets better; that's life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes however we can run longer, IIRC most predatory animals and quadriped prey do not have the ability to pant and sprint at the same time so humans with our superior endurance can essentially chase an animal to death.</p></div>		</li>
