<p>What are you basing this on? Literally anything other than anecdotal evidence? How do you know if someone has a medical condition or not? </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think that's the key.  It's nothing about optimum breathing techniques, it's that a person walking around with their mouth agape just seems to have no clue what is going on around them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure smiling and mouth agape can be compared. When someone is smiling, they are actually happy. There is a direct relationship between the emotion and action. This is more or less objectively true.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, mouth breathing doesn't <em>necessarily</em> mean anything and especially does not objectively correlate to dumb, slow, stupid as it is perceived by society. And therein lies the discrepancy - or more specifically, how this discrepancy came about - that OP is asking about.</p>
<p>Your explanation of stupefaction and the &quot;huh&quot; effect is a plausible one. I'd be willing to bet there is also more to it.</p></div>		</li>
