			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response.  In peds emergency, though, the answer these days is that largely there is no patient level benefit to the different opiates.  Many of us in this setting will use intranasal fentanyl because it works almost as quickly an IV without the poke trauma to small kids.  But aside from that it is morphine as the standard.  I really think the preference for other more expensive opiates (most of which have some negative side effect and addiction risk) is cultural ... Despite evidence to the contrary, doctors in my part of the world are still shy to write &quot;morphine&quot; on a script pad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From urological standpoint, I prefer dilaudid to morphine due to metabolic profile in patients with renal impairment.   However, agree no difference in pain control.  </p>
<p>The other thing I would like to point out is social/cultural.   I do medical mission work in Central America.  We will do a large flank incision for renal surgery.  Resources are limited, and so post op narcotics not as readily available.  Patients will tolerate quite a bit more pain than here in the states, and with less complaint.  It's quite remarkable.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Can or must? If they could take it I bet they would but if it's not available or out of your budget, you have to tolerate the pain. Not really optional then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To branch off of this, many people experience side effects compared to other opiates. Sweating, itching, and nausea are all more likely with morphine compared to oxy/hydrocodone, hydromorphone, fentayl, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain drugs come in certain dosage forms or combinations. Tussionex for cough, Fentayl patches, concentrated liquids for cancer/hospice care, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do people ever complain about patches in general? </p>
<p>They seem unreliable with dosing over extending periods and are hard to keep on for me. Not to mention the irritation they can cause. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I knew a few of those but over all that was informative. </p>
<p>Anyway 400mg of IV morphine? Jesus kill me now if that's the case. I'd think at that level the side effects would be too great. Really I'd have though 100mg would be the highest they'd allow. What does it take to get to 400mg? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Palliative care, usually for cancer related pain. It takes some time to get to that level of tolerance, but you usually do not expect to be able to reduce the dosage. </p>
<p>(And I realize now that I should have written parenterally as it is often given subcutaneously, but effective dosage is the same.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to think, morphine commonly come in 10mg vials, and usually 2.5-5mg is a sufficient enough for pain relief PRN for palliative care , the max dose I have seen is 120mg a day for malignant osteosarcoma. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a horrible disease.  It's nearly impossible to keep someone in that condition comfortable and conscious.  I remember one lady, we moved her, just shifted her weight <em>slightly</em> to prevent a compression sore and do some perineal care, and her femur broke.</p>
<p>It sounded sickening to us.  I can't imagine how it must have <em>felt</em> for her.</p>
<p>When she was conscious she hallucinated spiders everywhere.  We kept a can of weak air freshener by her bed side.  She would call us to come in, and we'd spray her room for spiders.</p>
<p>She had it rough.</p></div>		</li>
