<p>Support for this idea can be found as far back as in ancient Sparta; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Effect_in_politics" target="_blank">their women had a much greater influence in politics</a> than in &quot;democratic&quot; Athens, because unlike in Athens, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agoge#Education_of_girls" target="_blank">Spartan women were educated.</a>  Sure, the education focused on things that their society felt valuable (PhysEd, Writing, War Education, etc), but because they were brought up with what their society considered competency, they were allowed to participate in politics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love to, especially considering I only meant to use the rest as context for that answer. Thanks for asking.</p>
<p>I'll admit that I probably don't have the detailed knowledge to do a granular timeline on how women have been treated historically, or anything, so I hope you'll forgive me if I end up being somewhat vague or generalizing, or if I pull in examples of other forms of prejudice against different people or groups. Also, I'll freely admit that I'm going to write this almost entirely from memory and current knowledge, so if anyone reads this and has corrections, please, please, please provide them.</p>
<p>First, in a broad sense, prejudices are rarely without merit. There's very few historical examples of &quot;I hate women because they have ovaries&quot; or &quot;I hate black people because their skin is dark&quot;. Rather, these types of prejudices are generally heavily-boiled-down versions of real issues caused by very long-running issues.</p>
<p>Take the case of women's education. Until modern times (I suppose around 1600 will do, if you're looking for a date, but it really varies extremely greatly across different societies), the vast majority of people, regardless of gender, were only barely educated. A woman knew housework like cooking, knitting, weaving, etc., while a man knew trade work, like farming, cobbling, or whatever trade he practiced. There wasn't a hard line between the two (for example, women often helped out with the family trade, while men would probably know some cooking and such), but men and women largely had separate, but complimentary, skill sets. Both were absolutely essential to day-to-day life.</p>
<p>For nobles, this was very different. While male and female nobles would usually both receive educations in their youth, they would split later on. Given the widespread system of primogeniture (everything goes to the eldest son), there wasn't much need for teaching women how to run the barony, so once children were done with their basic education, formal education for women would often peter out. This isn't to say all noble women were uneducated after 10 or so, and in fact there's a lot of reasons to believe that many women were extremely competent power-behind-the-throne types, but in general, as noblewomen grew older, they would take more and more to courtly life and less to education.</p>
<p>(I just want to make an aside here for an interesting fact: The idea of arranged marriages were probably almost as strange to the common man and woman of 1300's Europe as they are to us today. Nobles viewed marriage as largely political, and lords and ladies both usually reserved love for extramarital affairs. Commoners, on the other hand, rarely had much of anything to gain from marrying this fellow commoner vs that one, so it was normal for them to marry for love, not political gain)</p>
<p>Of course, the education of commoners and nobles wasn't the only thing. Another key component was the Church. For most of the medieval period, and into the Renaissance, the most educated scholars and proto-scientists were either ordained members of the Catholic Church, or on their way to being ordained. As the Catholic Church (and most Protestant religions, until recently) didn't (and doesn't) ordain women, education by the Church was reserved entirely, or almost entirely, for men. This education was by far the closest thing to a modern education a person could receive. Despite the modern anti-religious arguments many people make that the Catholic Church has always been anti-science, they were in fact extremely well versed in the sciences, and many monks dedicated their lives to studying the sciences and researching and translating the works of the (at the time much more advanced) Arab scholars.</p>
<p>All in all, this created a world where, not necessarily intentionally, educated people were almost all men. This situation, where noblemen and members of the Church made up almost the entirety of the educated populace didn't really change until the 20th century. Chances are, you had a better education at 14 than your great great grandpa and grandma did in their entire life.</p>
<p>Property rights are a bit trickier, since they vary even more from place to place. In England, women couldn't own land until the early 1800s. In New Spain (the Spanish parts of the Americas), women have had full property rights since colonization began (as I recall). While I'm not sure on the specific whys and what-fors regarding women's property rights, it had to do a lot with education and primogeniture. Since all property passed on to the male heir, noblewomen would rarely have property anyway, and combined with their general lack of education, the views of the Church, etc., English (and perhaps other European, although I'm not sure on which countries) noble society eventually came to the conclusion that women needed to be protected by men, and should therefore be their property to be protected and cared for. While women are obviously more than capable of taking care of themselves, the general lack of education of noblewomen at the time probably created a significant number of situations where this actually was at least partially necessary. Not an ideal solution, obviously, but to a society that already had a very restricted view on who should be able to own what and do what, it's a much less dramatic change than it would be here. Even free noblemen were pretty heavily restricted in what they could and couldn't do, and when.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is interlaced with genuine bigotry. Just as today, people of the past would certainly have been extremely influenced by their own views, and most probably would never have dug very deep into WHY women's situations were like they were. Many noblemen certainly though women were less educated because they were less intelligent, for example, and many men would have had very self-interested reasons for wanting to keep 50% of the population officially below them.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what you get is a long history of society combining prejudices with legitimate situations. A legitimate situation creates a prejudice, which creates a legitimate situation, which creates a prejudice. This is why improving the situation for women today is so difficult. Even if people view women as perfectly equal to men in theory (something unfortunately still not true for huge numbers of people, but very definitely improving by leaps and bounds all the time), there's still the issue of the effects of women's treatment and opportunities in the past. Just because you think a woman could make just as capable a CEO as a man doesn't necessarily mean you can find a woman who is the most qualified candidate, for example.</p>
<p>I hope this has given you a little bit of a deeper answer, and that I answered the questions you were hoping to have answered. Again, there could be big chunks I'm wrong about here. If you have more questions or want more details, I'll try to provide what I can, although my knowledge of women's roles in history, in particular, isn't extremely vast or deep. It's mostly stuff I've learned while researching history in general. If there's anyone with more knowledge of this subject in particular, I welcome them to contribute and correct as much as they want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The part about arabic science is quite wrong. The arabic golden age lasted one century or two. Most of what they did was study Greek and Roman books that were forgotten. And most of the advances were made by Persian thinkers (Iran), not Arabs. As soon as the masses were converted to the mahometan religion, imams became all powerful and the intellectual boom ended.</p>
<p>There was intellectualism in the Spanish part of the mahometan world, because the culture and the people were very different from the obscurantism in the core of the empire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example is the disproportionate amount of minorities incarcerated and/or killed by cops.</p>
<p>It's not that the cop is thinking &quot;I'll just lock up/kill this <racial slur>,&quot; it's that they go where crime is.</p>
<ul>
<li>People are more likely to be incarcerated/killed when they live in high crime neighborhoods.</li>
<li>Crime happens in neighborhoods where people are desperate to get ahead.</li>
<li>People are desperate to get ahead when they're stuck in poor neighborhoods.</li>
<li>Many minority neighborhoods are poor as a direct result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining" target="_blank">racist policies</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot" target="_blank">racist actions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you look at the rates of crimes in bad neighborhoods, it is my understanding that people who live there are actually disproportionately <em>unlikely</em> to be incarcerated or killed, but because of <em>other</em> policies, those neighborhoods tend to be peopled with minorities to such an overwhelming degree as to completely overwhelm that disproportionality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why liberal policies bother me so much. The identity politics literally divide people up by race/gender/orientation and decide who needs what the most, this leads to them spreading everything so thin that the entire message is destroyed. Who is most oppressed and why? Who is the biggest victim? Why are white people so much better off? Etc.</p>
<p>Improve the economy, enough labor demand will be created where people are hired off the street and stop worrying so much about their victimhood. Rising tide raises all ships and all that.</p></div>		</li>
