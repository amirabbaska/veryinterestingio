			<div class="markdown"><p>A main reason why tall buildings are not designed with a large footprint that tapers upwards, as found with the shape of a mountain, is the issue of natural light; it would be pretty dark inside the mountain. Architects design floor space that circles cores in high-rise buildings with a certain depth in mind (somewhere between 25-50 ft) for which light coming from outside can penetrate the space. That's why the service functions where we don't spend much of our time are located in concrete cores in the central, dark areas of tall buildings; they don't need any windows. In the mountain building situation you would also want to have multiple cores throughout the building to allow for egress. Although this results in another big issue with this idea, because if the &quot;mountain-building&quot; caught on fire the travel distance to an exterior exit would be too long. </p>
<p>At a smaller scale, the &quot;mountain building&quot; could be built, but it probably wouldn't be taken for any kind of structural inspiration but more of just a formal concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Himalayan range is a hell of a lot more than Everest - removing it would obviously make a difference, but unless you're talking about leaving a gap down to sea-level, it's the range that has the impact, not Everest on it's lonesome.  The Himalayas are about 1,500 miles long (c.2,400km) - while Everest is tall and all, it's that huge ridge that has such an impact climactically, not a single mountain within that range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_shadow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_shadow</a> provides some information about the moisture blocking affects of the Himalayas. If this influences the weather in the area so greatly, it follows that the weather in the rest of the world would also be affected (to a smaller degree).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Western Tibet is one of the dustiest, driest places on earth. The Himalayas completely block the moisture from coming over from Nepal. People don't typically think of Tibet as a desert, but not far from Mt Everest you have sand dunes there at 16,000 ft. You have to wear scarves over your face to keep out the dust, it really feels like being in Mad Max. The last time I was there I got terrible nose bleeds because it was so dry. There's a pass to get across the Himalayas on the way to Zhangmu before crossing into Nepal. Within less than an hour's drive it goes from extreme desert to the wettest rainforest. You're driving through waterfalls gushing down over the road. The city of Zhangmu sits on a sheer cliff on the other side of the mountains and it gets the most rain I've ever seen in my life, within minutes the street was a river 2 feet deep. That's the power of the Himalayas shaping the climate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Himalayas block of a lot of rainfall and tropical air mass, which is why the Tibetan Plateau/ central Asia is so dry most of the year.</p>
<p>Also, anyone is free to correct me, that's all I know on the subject ^</p></div>		</li>
