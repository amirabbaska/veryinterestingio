			<div class="markdown"><p>It is quite common to find evidence of few or no cavities in ancient humans.  Many cultures had not developed dental hygiene until only the modern era, though some had rudimentary brushing.</p>
<p>The plaque which develops on one's teeth hardens and becomes tartar, which acts as a protective barrier against bacteria which eat through the enamel.  The teeth stay relatively protected in this manner.</p>
<p>However, the gums can easily develop gingivitis and eventually periodontal disease.  Destroy the connective tissue &amp; structural bone holding those teeth in place, and you can't eat, with a high chance of acute (and lethal) infection.  Also...stank breath.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seems the other ancient britons didn't appreciate his hygiene.</p></div>		</li>
