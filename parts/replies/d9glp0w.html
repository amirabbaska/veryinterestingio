			<div class="markdown"><p>For a neutron radiography movie of a running motor, see for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJ1yrRuorA" target="_blank">this video</a>. X-rays could not image the interior of a motor because the metal absorbs virtually all X-rays.</p>
<p>The neutrons were created not from Californium but from a spallation source (= particle accelerator pointed at a heavy metal target).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If Oak Ridge produces only a half gram a year, where did you even locate a price? It's not like it's for sale. Perhaps you saw something about the most expensive element or similar?</p>
<p>It's incredible that one of the most sophisticated labs ever can isolate just a half gram per year. That's some TRICKY refining.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US government <a href="https://www.isotopes.gov/catalog/product.php?element=Californium&amp;type=rad&amp;rad_product_index=13" target="_blank">actually has an online store for radioisotopes</a> (though it's a &quot;tell us what you want and we'll come back with a quote&quot; operation).  According to <a href="http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/15053#" target="_blank">this paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Historically, in the early days of the Californium Program (early 1970s), the price
of ^252 Cf was set at $10 per microgram.  That price increased to $27/µg in 1987, $50/µg in 1989,$55/µg
in 1994, $56/µg in 1998, and $60/µg in 1999.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They sell it by the millionth of a gram, so half a gram is still 500,000 &quot;units&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was very interesting! Posts like this is why I stay on Eli5! Great responses about something that I would never have learnt about if I weren't here. </p>
<p>A followup question to it; Is there an alternative that we could use instead? It seems like an awfully complicated process. I mean 20 grams from a ton?! That's a very poor exchange rate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except <a href="http://mnrc.ucdavis.edu/radiography.html" target="_blank">Neutron Radiography</a> isn't looking at the subject's radiation, it's looking at the neutrons that make it through the subject, exactly like an x-ray. Unlike x-rays, neutrons can go straight through dense materials (but are absorbed and/or deflected by lighter ones) because of how they interact with the nuclei.</p></div>		</li>
