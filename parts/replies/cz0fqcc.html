<p>EDIT: So now this has got me thinking, is it all physical, or is there a mental willpower change as well? I feel like this one might not be so easy to back up through science though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you try to take cold showers, when you first start, you'll feel like you're hyperventilating. After practice, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_shock_response" target="_blank">cold shock response</a> is decreased, and you can kind of jump right in with the cold directly in your face while mentally suppressing the urge to hyperventilate (concentrate on taking deep slow breaths while your body adjusts to the water). Your mind adapts to the fact that &quot;this isn't going to kill me.&quot; I guess it's the same idea with people suppressing their gag reflex. Actually, in my experience, it's easier to start with the water right in your face than to gradually dip your hands and feet in. This is due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_diving_reflex" target="_blank">mammalian diving reflex</a>, which decreases your heart rate and is triggered specifically by cold water contacting the face.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not 100% physical, but there is quite a bit of science behind how your body regulates your internal temp.  We are a very complex ecosystem.  </p>
<p>I'm a hunter so I've been in -20 degrees for 8+ hours at a time.  You can regulate your body temp pretty well by having a very solid mental state.  You are cold but your brain just tends to ignore it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, and the same applies to hot weather.
Your body knows what to do to keep you warm/cool. It's your mind's reaction to it that can adapt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for this? Saturated fats pack more densely than unsaturated fats, so I would think that this would give them a higher specific heat capacity, and therefore make them better at insulating your body. Although I could also believe that the kinks in the unsaturated fats provide them with more thermodynamic degrees of freedom, which give them a higher heat capacity. I could see it going either way, so I'd be curious as to which is the case. </p>
<p>Regardless, idk if you are providing the most correct answer here. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermogenesis#Non-shivering" target="_blank">Non-shivering thermogenesis</a> is almost certainly a much bigger contributor, as it increases the body's total heat production rather than just its ability to retain heat. Brown fat is literally adipose tissue thats designed to burn fat all the time, specifically for heat production. It has been shown in mice that exposure to cold temperature causes an increase in the amount of brown fat, so I would find it likely that this same process occurs in humans that are exposed to cold for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>Also, just cause I'm a stickler for chemistry, kinks in saturated fats are made by <em>dehydrogenation</em>, which is <em>removing</em> hydrogens. This produces an unsaturated fat, which as you mentioned have one or more kinks. Dehydrogenation is totally unrelated to hydrolysis, which is <em>adding</em> water to make two smaller products. Typically for fatty acids, hydrolysis occurs by a process called beta-oxidation which shaves off two carbons at a time from the fatty acid chain. Dehydrogenation on the other hand occurs via radical oxidation, and does not remove any carbons, only hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks, that was bothering me, too. Fewer hydrogen atoms = more double bonds between the carbons, causing the kinks.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is part of the reason I feel hungrier once the weather turns cold. It's not just that I'm burning more calories to stay warm - my body is also trying to pack on the brown fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brown adipose tissue is present in human infants but then goes away almost entirely as we mature. They used to think it went away entirely until recent (past decade) metabolic imaging showed that some folks retain some into adulthood (on their backs, iirc). Animals retain brown adipose tissue throughout their lives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Along those same lines, I recall reading several years ago about how swimmers often tend to store more fat compared to, say, runners. Even though they may be training at the same high levels, with similar demands on glycogen, stored fat, etc., the swimmers usually had higher levels of body fat. The theory was that the storage of fat was the body's response to being constantly exposed to the cold water, i.e., 78-79F, which most non-swimmers would consider cold, but is actually ideal for competitive swimmers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure it's not just correlation?  I would imagine people with a higher body fat to muscle ratio would make better swimmers overall.  </p>
<p>Most swimmers I see have little muscle (excepting the upper shoulders), and a bit of fat padding.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely part of the reason for more unsaturated fats in membranes at cold temperatures is the elasticity of the membrane. With a fully saturated membrane it becomes harder for transport of molecules throughout the body, this would be amplified at lower temperatures.</p>
<p>You'll notice for example that cold water fish generally have a higher amount of unsaturated fats (such as omega 3's) compared to warm water fish. This is because as said, you can't have an elastic membrane, which is necessary for a healthy life, when the membrane is made up of saturated fats.</p>
<p>Basically you need a fluid membrane to live, and with fully saturated fats at low temperatures, that membrane begins freezing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is this the top comment? You started out right and then snowballed into a shit post. Those kinks do not come about because of &quot;infused hydrogens&quot;. THEY ARE FROM A LACK OF TWO HYDROGENS. That's why they're called unsaturated. They don't necessarily help you contain heat, either. Unsaturated FAs help membranes stay more fluid instead of gelling at low temperatures. WHAT REALLY HAPPENS WHEN IT GETS COLD OUT: Your body has this thing called futile cycles where it breaks down macromolecules and then rebuilds them just to produce heat. Also, you start to accumulate more fat, which insulates you!</p>
<p>Edit 2: It's also important to note that unsaturated fatty acids can have two conformations (structures) called cis and trans. Trans fats do not help maintain fluidity of the plasma membrane at low temps because the angle of the tail is still pretty conducive to tight packing. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish the sub was &quot;explain like I'm five, and then like I'm twenty-five.&quot; Like if it's all scientific stuff written by people with graduate degrees in chemistry it'll be too dense that I don't want to put in the effort to understand it. But when it's just ELI5 then people make unsubstantiated claims that turn out to be bullshit. </p>
<p>Just start with a TL;DR telling me a summary of the scientific analysis that someone with a bachelor's in a non-science field can understand. Then follow it up with the analysis so other people educated on the topic can see if the summary is based on sound science and they can critique when necessary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's totally misleading, even after the edit. The brown fat definitely does help people stay warm, but that's more of a long term and subtle trait to adapting to the cold. The reason people aren't &quot;cold&quot; in cold weather has little to do with the amount of brown fat, and more about simple adaptation to the new environment. </p></div>		</li>
