			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, and distillation also cannot get rid of chemicals with a boiling point of water or lower because these chemicals will continue to stay with the water through the entire distillation process. </p>
<p>Reverse osmosis is amazing and can even take the salt out of sea water. This is the same process desalination plants and cruise ships use. The process requires a lot of energy though. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The lower part is incorrect, it just makes the process a two stage job; one distilation operation below waters boiling point to remove anything below, then one at waters boiling point to pull out the water.</p>
<p>While it would be hard to get rid of something else that boils at ~100 degrees, said chemical needs to be both toxic, reducing the probability; this isn't me saying they do exist, just that they are few and far between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would work to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>The practical way of doing that would be to heat your water to 100 degrees, wait a short while and then replace your destillate container (the container that you're catching the re-condensed liquids in). The first &quot;fraction&quot; would then contain most of the stuff that evaporates at 20-99 degrees and the second &quot;fraction&quot; would be mostly water.</p>
<p>There is one problem here though that not all of it will evaporate out before reaching 100 degrees. There are adhesive forces at work between the water and the other compounds (which is what causes them to dissolve in water in the first place) and these same forces will cause a fraction of your contaminants to evaporate together with the water rather than at its own boiling point.</p>
<p>To name an example, if you were to distill vodka (assuming an ideal mixture of methanol, ethanol and water):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The mixture would first heat up to 65 degrees. It will stay there for a while while the majority of the methanol evaporates out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will then heat up to 78 degrees, during which time a very small amount of methanol/ethanol mixture evaporates out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then at 78 degrees the temperature stays constant again while the majority of the ethanol evaporates, together with a very small amount of methanol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mixture then goes to 100 degrees. During this time some more small amounts of methanol and ethanol evaporate.</p>
</li>
<li>Once it reaches 100 degrees what evaporates out will be mostly water, but there will still be trace amounts of methanol/ethanol physically bonded to the water which will evaporate out together with it. (this bond is not chemical. It's more like the forces that cause water to attract to itself which is the cause of surface tension)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the last &quot;fraction&quot; that you catch at 100 degrees would be mostly water but would still contain trace amounts of ethanol and methanol. Definitely cleaner than catching the entire destilate in one container, but it's still in there.</p>
<p>Important notes here, the &quot;staying constant&quot; of the temperature is not because we tell it to. It will simply do that. As long as one major component is evaporating out this will draw all heat from the mixture so the temperature cannot rise further during this time</p>
<p>Second note is that the distillation curve I described here describes an ideal theoretical model. The physical attraction between methanol, ethanol and water will realistically make it a lot more complicated, but that doesn't really matter much until you start studying physical chemistry in detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water would still evaporate at 99 degrees. Not all of the toxins would evaporate at 99 degrees. Distillation is a long process and getting to 100% purity isn't realistic. I have managed to moonshine ~196 proof with considerable effort and attention. Alcohol still remains in the mulch and water still evaporates and dilutes the alcohol. So if you have a particular nasty toxin which will cause sickness at only a few micro grams, even distillation won't save you. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Lastly can centrifugal force push water at the top ? (assuming toxins are heavier of course)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Industrial distillation is actually a significantly more powerful separation tool than people in this thread are giving it credit for.  Probably because they're referring to home or makeshift distillation.  To clarify: </p>
<p>Distillation can absolutely remove light components - just keep the bottoms instead of the distillate.  This only works with continuous distillation where you're continuously drawing off the liquid at the bottom though.  For instance, you can remove benzene from water with continuous distillation no problem.  </p>
<p>If you have both heavy and light contaminants you need two columns: one for the heavy key, one for the light key.  Otherwise same deal.  </p>
<p>If you're worried about not losing any product (in this case, water) you can just recycle some of the waste streams back into the column, as long as you leave an exit path for the contaminants.  </p>
<p>The reason distillation is generally not used for water is money, plain and simple.  It's expensive to build and run compared to, say, slow sand filtration.  Reverse osmosis is also very expensive, though it's still better than distillation.  A good example of distillation at work is in the petrochemical industry, where you can get amazingly pure products from crude oil drilled out of the ground.  </p>
<p>Limitations for distillation columns do exist of course.  Some can be solved using a taller column.  An important limitation is azeotropic mixtures (another commenter here mentioned them somewhere), which are mixtures of two or more components with very similar boiling points.  Normally by making the column arbitrarily tall you can get close to pure product in one stream, and no product in the other, however with azeotropes even an infinitely tall column cannot do this.  </p>
<p>An example of an azeotrope is water and ethanol, which caps out at 96ish percent off the top of my head.  Azeotropes can be broken using pressure swing distillation (lots of expensive equipment) or more commonly by adding a third component, which I cannot explain in words but involves ternary phase diagrams.  That second one is why you should never ever drink analytical grade ethanol - that third component is a toxic organic compound.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the condensed steam would be free of any salts and many other, possibly toxic particulates in it. So the steam turned water after you caught it is quite cean and you can use that process to clean the water from things other than salt.</p></div>		</li>
