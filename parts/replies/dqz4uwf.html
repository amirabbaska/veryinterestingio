			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does uneven heating cause enough expansion to crack the shell violently, while even heating doesn't cause a significant amount? Does it just give the shell time to expand as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not necessarily that it's uneven, it's that it gets parts extremely hot which causes them to expand and emit steam, which causes the shell to break. It would happen whether the heating was even or not, it's really a function of how hot it gets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true, there's a simple experiment to prove that: put a bit of hard boiled yolk in a microwave and watch it explode spectacularly.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the really important thing that somehow there's no good nucleation centers in the yolk, so the water in it gets superheated (heated above the usual boiling point), which then allows it to evaporate all at once. Well, not all, but a lot of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would you think that the egg would get heated more towards the center? Microwaves, like all other sources of energy, heat from the outside in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s not true. Most microwaves heat in sections. You can see this using chocolate. The areas that get hot could be outside or inside, it all depends on where the waves areS</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that there are wave patterns in microwave ovens. That's beside the point. The heating occurs from the outside of the medium that's getting heated towards the center of it, because the microwaves are exiting the outer layer of molecules first, which then in turn heat the next layer and so on and so forth untill the middle of the medium is hot as well. </p>
<p>Heating does not occur from the middle of an object first and then propogate out. That simply does not happen. </p></div>		</li>
