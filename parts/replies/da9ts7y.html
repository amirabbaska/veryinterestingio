<p>Most dreams happen when you're lightly asleep, close to consciousness. Deep sleep (stage 3) is better for physical repair. Thats why short naps are better for giving you a mental boost, but you need a solid night's sleep to help ease a tired body</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so you know, NREM Stages 3 and 4 have been consolidated into N3 as of 2007 per AASM scoring criteria.  Now there is only REM, W, N1, N2, and N3.</p>
<p>Also, dreaming can occur during NREM sleep, but at lower frequency than in REM and it is typically not the vivid dreams that we can recall.  Parasomnias such as somnambulance and somniloquy have been observed during NREM sleep and are believed to be associated with NREM dreaming.</p></div>		</li>
