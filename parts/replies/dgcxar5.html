			<div class="markdown"><p>That is so 2009, lol. Something similar happened to me in a very expensive course. sadly, a lot of smoke sellers make a living off digital marketing education. I now do extensive research about the people who will talk in any event I am willing to attend. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't a social network but I use Simple, which is a Web 2.0 styled online-only banking service that used viral and social media marketing to become established, and it used the queue sign-up strategy to great affect, indeed being bought by BBVA a couple years ago, one of the largest banks in Spain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happened with Casey Neistat's Beme app. Limited # of users at first allowed to join (after test group) with an activation code the first 1-3 weeks which I think is what drew most of the users away (as well as the app)</p></div>		</li>

<p>How can you convince the first users to sign up when no one else is around? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are <em>plenty</em> of people who want to be early adopters for the bragging rights -- as long as the marketing can convince them that there will be bragging rights.</p></div>		</li>
