			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that exposure to sunlight plays a big part. When we are inside all day, our eyes get used to taking in less light than when we are outside. It's something like 100x brighter outside on a sunny day. Apparently this affects our vision because the more light your eye takes in, the better you can see? (Chime in if you know more about this than I do).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that this is the real reason. If you don't see near and far an equal amount, the lens of the eye probably starts to become stuck in one direction or the other.
