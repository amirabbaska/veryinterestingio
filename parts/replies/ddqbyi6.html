<p>If it were to happen, it would also be no big deal.</p>
<p>Incest is a problem more for the problems with the family power dynamic and social aspect and power dynamic than strictly the genetic aspect of it.  If you adopted a child as an infant and then had a relationship with them when they were an adult, that would still be morally horrible, even though genetically you were completely different.</p>
<p>That person isn't her father.  He was a sperm donor.  Her father is the man who raised her, if he exists. He shares some genes with her. </p>
<p>If they were to really hook up, and she were to start having his kids, the chance of problems is still pretty low, marginally higher than if they weren't related.  Significant problems start to show up after multiple generations of inbreeding as genetic diversity starts to decline. </p>
<p>So there's no moral/psychological impact since she's unaware that she's got anything more than superficial in common with him, and there's minimal impact to having children with him. </p>
<p>Really the only thing to be concerned about is the minimal issues that come from sharing some more recessive genes than other couples. But also take into consideration the astonishingly tiny possibility that this scenario would ever play out, and even that becomes negligible.  The woman is far more likely to have a condition herself that poses a risk to her offspring, or is far more likely to find a man that's not genetically related that has fertility issues, than she is to even dance with her father at a nightclub, let alone have his children and suffer any adverse affects from their genetic similarity. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Absolutely, categorically untrue; even a <em>very</em> cursory search reveals a large body of research agreeing that first degree incest is a coin flip for the offspring.</p>
<p>&quot;...the odds that a newborn child who is the product of brother-sister or father-daughter incest will suffer an early death, a severe birth defect or some mental deficiently approaches 50 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>Must be quiet on 4chan right now.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parent/child is actually pretty damn risky even 1st gen. You are doubling down on half your genes. It's not constant repeat offenses bad, but much higher than sibling and beyond.</p>
<p>On the other side, third cousins once a few gens is extremely low risk apart from broad racial defects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's a consideration because of the odds. </p>
<p>First you have to sample 18+ years olds hooking up with 36+ year olds. Nightclub would be 21. So 42+. </p>
<p>Then you have to look at 21+ &amp; 42+ year olds frequenting clubs</p>
<p>Look at data on the likelihood parent and progeny frequent the same area. </p>
<p>If you live in an area with nightclubs you probably live in an area that's fairly large. What is the likelihood two relatives meet?</p>
<p>What's the likelihood these two relatives would find each other generally attractive. </p>
<p>Any other dependent variables....</p></div>		</li>
