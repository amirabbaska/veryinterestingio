			<div class="markdown"><p>Bandwidth is like a road. You can send single cars down it easily, but try to send a hundred and they will get clogged up. You can either make the cars go faster (faster transfer speeds) or make the road wider (add more bandwidth). Usually more bandwidth means utilising multiple frequencies at the same time, kind of like using 4 cars at once to transport stuff instead of one big truck.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A better analogy for different frequencies would be different methods of transportation. Air, boat, bicycle, etc..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the internet is an &quot;information super highway&quot;...and we are talking broad, non technical, terms, think of things like this...</p>
<p><strong>The connection speed</strong>  is determined by</p>
<p>1) the speed limit, this is set by the router and it's specific capabilities and protocols. You can see this on the box of your router. There is wireless b/g/n/ac. Each one being faster then the last. (Your wireless card also determines this. If your router is AC but your computer is g, you will only get g speeds.)</p>
<p>2) how fast your cars can go (horsepower), this usually determined by your ISP (Comcast, Charter, Verizon). If you pay more money, they will &quot;upgrade your engine&quot; and give you more horsepower.</p>
<p>3) <strong>bandwidth</strong>. This is needed to avoid &quot;traffic jams&quot; This is basically how many lanes there are on the highway. If you are sending a ton of cars (data packets) the speed limit, and your horse power, won't matter much, because you can't go faster then the cars in front of you. When you add a second computer to the mix, not only do you double the amount of cars on the road, you also double the amount of destinations the cars are trying to get to. Many things go into how much bandwidth you have, and like any other system, there can be bottlenecks. If a 5 Lane super highway has a one lane construction zone for 10 miles (this can be thought of in terms of a crappy NIC, router, modem, or even a slow browser, CPU, or not enough RAM) it won't matter how fast traffic can move in other places. The system is only as fast as it's weakest link. If you pay for 100mbps internet, and you have a $20 wireless g router from walmart, you are never  going to get your advertised speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this great explanation: Imagine a radio show that allowed their users to call in, AND put everyone on the line to speak at the same time. Complete chaos. A cheap wifi access point will be clogged up after a few incoming connections, professional equipment can allow more connections before service starts deteriorating, but the limit is still out there.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The difference between 'cheap' and 'professional' is actually in actual hardware capability and feature sets.  </p>
<p>Your 'cheap' wifi access points don't support things like multiple SSID's, unique encryption keys per SSID, and VLAN tagging based on SSID.</p>
<p>On the more professional ones, you can generally push 300Mbit/s of small packets though, while the 'cheap' ones will drop to 2~3 mbit/s with small packet sizes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protip, if you want a really great business level wifi router for your company for free, go to Meraki and sign up for one of their business webinars.  I did that for my company and they sent me their lowest tier model router, which is a $500 router. All for free so I could see the benefits of their technology.  It's by far, the best business router I have ever come by and my company only needed one to cover the entire warehouse.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Do routers have a maximum number of connections?Are these mostly in the order of 3, 30 or 300? </p>
<p>Does an unused connection deteriorate the speed of other connections significantly, or is that &quot;are you still there? - Yup.&quot;-signal negligible? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically the connection doesn't care if packets collide with each other the network is still going to run. Even though you might have constant collisions slowing your network down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More importantly, a radio only RECEIVES the signal; it doesnt send anything <em>back</em> to the radio transmitter.</p>
<p>Wifi is different. Your laptop/phone/tablet/whatever is receiving the signal from the router AND <em>sending</em> a signal back.</p>
<p>Think of your router as a professor, standing in a lecture hall and writing on the chalkboard. He is the only one sending any information; you and the rest of the the students just have to read what he writes. He doesnt write slower the more people that watch, because all he has to do is write; it doesnt matter who is reading or if anyone is reading at all.</p>
<p>Now imagine that every time your professor wrote something on the board, you had to write your response on a little hand held dry-erase board and hold it up for him to see. Now, your professor is sending <em>and</em> receiving data. So its gonna take a second for him to read what you write before he continues writing on the board.</p>
<p>And then, if you add a second or third person writing <em>their</em> questions on dry erase boards, its going to slow things down even further. Now, your professor has to write on the board, look at the class and read your note, AND billy's note AND sarah's note, before going back to the board to write more.</p>
<p>Its naturally going to take longer to send a message, and read <em>three</em> responses, than it is to send a message and read <em>one</em> response, or JUST sending a message and not reading any responses.</p></div>		</li>
