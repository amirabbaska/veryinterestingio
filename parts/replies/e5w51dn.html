			<div class="markdown"><p>Well.... It's colder where it touches North America. The western Pacific is not. Ocean temps in Taiwan (23ºN) are very comparable to ocean temps in South Florida (25ºN). Both tend to vary around the low to mid 80s (Fahrenheit). What happens is that both oceans have clockwise currents (in the northern hemisphere). They travel north from the tropics in the west (so along an eastern coastline), and south from the arctic in the east (so along a western coastline).</p>
<p>In terms of U.S. coastal waters, yes, the Pacific is colder than the Atlantic. But on a global scale, they're very similar. And tropical cyclones (called hurricanes in the north Atlantic and typhoons in the north Pacific) happen along eastern Asia, just as they do along the eastern North America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(I can't believe I am doing this...)   Right.  Because the water off the West Coast is definitely colder, and while they may require wetsuits at the beach, at least they don't get hurricanes, which develop in the warmer waters of the east coast.   However, tropical regions in the pacific and atlantic are subject to frequent hurricanes as they are both warm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was quite surprised at how cold swimming in the Pacific was when I swam at Santa Monica last year. I've been surfing in Ireland multiple times and it felt even colder (even though it was a good 25 degrees celcius warmer out of the water). Thanks! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oceans are batteries for heat. Water off the coast of Africa gets cooked all summer, storing more, and more, and more heat, until enough heat builds up that it starts its own convection current in the atmosphere. Hit that with a bunch of hot, dry air moving east to west over the Sahara, add in rotation from the spinning of the earth, and that's a tropical storm. The storm will follow ocean and wind currents west at a tropical latitude, gathering more energy from the heat stored in those waters on the way. As it builds strength, it eventually becomes a hurricane. Hurricanes (or typhoons as they call them when they happen in the Pacific) are always about heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RAPID CRASH COURSE FROM SOMEONE WHO ISN'T A METEOROLOGIST AND SHOULD REALLY BE STUDYING FOR HIS ACTUAL EDUCATION</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC2x_RRnk8E" target="_blank">This explains clouds in general.</a>  Good starting point for understanding everything else meteorological. </p>
<p>Next step is understanding wind. Have you ever opened an oven and got blasted with a faceful of warm air? This is the principle of how wind works. Somewhere is hot, somewhere is cold. ignoring density, air molecules move to equalize the differences, but will never succeed because the sun is a constant source of heat.</p>
<p>So sure, but why are hurricanes all whirly? Despite our human frame of reference, <a href="https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/orthographic=-72.26,34.72,1286" target="_blank">wind isn't always a straight line</a> (it is at this moment I realized I would miss the storm chaser livestreams from the hurricane because of my tests today :c) Because the earth is rotating, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_36MiCUS1ro" target="_blank">the coriolis effect comes into play</a>, densities, geography, inertia all come into play creating a chaotic system with all sorts of fascinating variables.</p>
<p>How do we even manage to predict the weather with any level of accuracy? Meteorologists collect data from weather stations, radar, satellites etc., and feed it into an ever improving data analysis system. This would be timeconsuming by hand, sooooo... <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/supercomputers/new-supercomputer-extend-noaas-weather-predictions-six-days" target="_blank">supercomputers</a>.</p></div>		</li>
