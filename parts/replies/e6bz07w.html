<p>Adding to this: this is why accretion disks (like Saturn's rings) gather around the equator of a planet, rather than its poles. Most of the angular momentum in the system comes from the planet's mass and motion!
Fun fact: the sun also spins, and the planets in our solar system rotate around its equator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool thought. </p>
<p>Although the real question is why the solar system started with a non-zero angular momentum? The way I understand... it's because the odds of all angular momenta (&quot;momentus&quot; lol) or &quot;large number of random things&quot; precisely canceling each other out is essentially zero. For example, for 1,000,000 coin tosses, the odds of ending up with <em>exactly</em> 500,000 heads and 500,000 tails is only about 0.08 % [*]. </p>
<p>If the system really starts with zero angular momentum, and no forces are ever applied to it (away from the center of mass) it will <em>never</em> have any spin. I've no idea if you get any non-zero angular momentum even if you could add up every possible galaxy.</p>

<li>For math people, it's the peak of the Binomial distribution when p = 1/2, k = N/2, expanded for large N, and comes out about square root of (2 / N*pi).</li>
