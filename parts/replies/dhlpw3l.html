			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this have anything to do with the blood brain barrier? I know certain drugs (medications) don't cross it. I wonder if what we eat can make the sensation more intense? </p>
<p>Edit: Want to add, this was a very informative post, even to someone who thought they had a general understanding of this stuff. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I am not a medications expert, but I will try my best! Someone correct me if something is wrong!</p>
<p>Medications cross the BBB because we've either made them to sort of trick the brain into thinking the molecules should be let in or made the molecules able to diffuse and break in, basically. If something doesn't cross the BBB, there is probably a good reason. There are ways to manipulate it a bit--peptides, additional drugs that make the BBB more permeable, probably nanotechnology in the future--but there are also limits. The brain is pretty delicate, and altering what happens inside it can also increase the risk of overdose if too much gets in or harmful accumulation of a medication in the brain if it can't be cleared properly. I guess this is a long way to say I'm not certain! </p>
<p>In terms of improving antidepressants via the gut, one of the idea is that using neuropeptides can communicate messages much more widely that neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters play a less sketchy version of telephone, passing the message from one neuron to another neuron or a glad/muscle/etc. It's a very specific message. Medications like antidepressants work by increasing the odds that a message gets through, but they are still only acting on a relatively small part of what we think causes something like depression. Neuropeptides are a PSA or emergency broadcast. They have a huge reach and communicate with a huge number of parts and systems. The idea is that making conditions ideal for robust neuropeptides in the gut--such a healthy and diverse gut flora--will improve the quality of the messages that they can send out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any explanation for why different emotions can cause different sensations?</p>
<p>e.g. romantic &quot;butterflies in the chest&quot; feels similar to but distinctly different from the similar sensation from heartbreak.  Is this just a different perception or is there something actually different happening?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and it changes all the time! They have such a huge effect on behaviours and emotions. Some have proposed next-generation antidepressants that target neuropeptide receptors rather than neurotransmitter receptors. [Here is an interesting overview on neuropeptides and the gut-brain axis specifically] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4359909/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4359909/</a>) that is both full-text and free. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the link. I also remember watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awtmTJW9ic8" target="_blank">this Ted Talk</a> by a Fulbright scholar. He proposed the link between immunity, behavioural patterns and gut flora IIRC. You might enjoy it, if you haven't seen it already.</p></div>		</li>
