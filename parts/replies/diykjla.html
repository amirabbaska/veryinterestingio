			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what it is. Sleep apnea doesn't always mean you stop breathing entirely. It can just mean you're not breathing enough (hypopnea). It sounds just like snoring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would ask for a referral to a sleep specialist (or depending on your insurance, you might not even need a referral). The specialist will likely order a sleep study after meeting with you and discussing your symptoms. My sleep study ended up costing me about $1500, but most of that was my deductible. I also did the next-day test (called an MSLT) because my doc thought narcolepsy was a possibility. You can call your insurance ahead of time and ask them what the allowable rate (how much they've agreed with providers that it can cost) for a sleep study is, and how much you would likely owe (the coinsurance or if you haven't paid it, deductible/coinsurance combo). When I scheduled my sleep study, my sleep specialist made sure to order a prior authorization from my insurance to make sure it was going to be covered at the place I was getting it done. </p>
<p>That said, personally i wouldn't recommend staying up until you're very very tired on purpose if you're already sleep deprived. Just from my own experience, because when I do that I actually have a harder time falling asleep, I think because I'm running on adrenaline and it wont calm down and actually let me sleep. </p>
<p>The sleep technologist is the person who helps calibrate things and record the data while you're sleeping, so you don't arrange appointments with them directly. I think your next step is to get in with a sleep specialist who will likely order the sleep study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you'd benefit from an overnight sleep study. You can definitely see a Sleep Specialist, not sure if they require a referral from another doc or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you're a sleep technologist I hope you don't mind if I let you know that you're misspelling &quot;breathe&quot;. It seems like something you'd probably prefer to get right to avoid professional embarrassment.   </p>
<p>&quot;Breath&quot; rhymes with &quot;death&quot; and it's a thing- a puff of air. &quot;Breathe&quot; sounds like &quot;leave&quot; and it's the action.</p></div>		</li>
