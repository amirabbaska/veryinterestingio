<p>Yellowstone has erupted hundreds if not thousands of times over the last 2 million years or so. Three of those eruoptions have been 'supereruption', where in excess of 1000 cubic kilometers of magma has been ejected. These occurred 2.1, 1.2 and 0.6 million years ago. So the intervals are about 0.9 and 0.6 million years. Two intervals is not enough to say there is any trend, and the range is enormous. For comparison Humans migrated out of Africa somewhere between about 0.12 and 0.06 million years ago.</p>
<p>So we can't tell you when to expect a super eruption. Almost certainly not in the lifetime of anyone within a dozen generation of you.</p>
<p>Most eruptions from Yellowstone are in fact rather minor and not really something we need to worry about either. Lava domes mostly. </p>
<p>There is no way you can stop an eruption. The forces involved are simply far too huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If looking at VEI 8 eruptions - the ones that are considered &quot;supereruptions&quot; - there are only two known in Yellowstone's history.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lava Creek Tuff erupted 1,000 km3, 640,000 years ago</li>
<li>Mesa Falls Tuff erupted 280 km3, 1.3 million years ago</li>
<li>Huckleberry Ridge Tuff erupted 2,450 km3, 2.1 million years ago</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, there is only one known occurrence interval for supereruptions at Yellowstone, and that's certainly not a data set upon which to make any future conclusions. </p>
<p>We know that Yellowstone is an active system, but when or whether it erupts in the future is unknown. We are gaining a better understanding of the shape, depth, and make up of the magmatic system beneath the volcano.  When new research is published, the news tends to pick it up and put some doomsday headlines on it for click bait.  </p>
<p>The most likely type of eruption at Yellowstone is a hydrothermal explosion - one where the hot water system just beneath the surface of the crust becomes over-pressured to a point that it explodes and hurdles overlying rocks onto the nearby area. These are unexpected and would be a hyper-local hazard.</p>
<p>Yellowstone is a large magmatic system, and any sign of unrest would be detectable. With the amount of monitoring equipment and scientists watching over it, the subtle shifts away from background levels of activity would be analyzed and tracked closely. Hence, there'd be plenty (years or perhaps decades) of warning time before any magmatic eruption may occur.  The most recent magmatic eruption was a lava flow about 70,000 years ago...that's way more likely than a supereruption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I assumed as much, but nice to hear from an expert. I was watching a special on NOVA a few days ago about a supervolcano that erupted in 1258, causing the &quot;year without a summer.&quot; Volcanologists believe it took place in Indonesia. I don't really have a question, but wanted to let you know it was a television special. You might be interested.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So if we identified the areas where the magma domes are closest to the surface and drill 10,000 little holes down towards them (but at a safe distance), and start pumping down cool water and using the heat for energy, that couldn't arrest the progress towards eruption?  I thought that was theoretically possible.</p></div>		</li>
