			<div class="markdown"><p>Different languages make similar sounds using different shapes. I guess when you're struggling for a reasonable rate of communication, it's one of the more forgiving shortcuts to take and easiest to fall into. </p>
<p>Maybe speaking a language doesn't necessarily shape the palate, but from a neurological and musculoskeletal standpoint, the longer you spend making the same shapes with your face and mouth, the harder it is to &quot;correct&quot; those habits. A lot of learners are way more proficient in understanding than being understood, because they haven't approached from a mechanical level.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, mastering pronunciation just takes even further time and dedication, while most programs go over enough to hold a conversation or a job. </p></div>		</li>
