<p>Any journalist could at any time stop lying, and start questioning the things they really didn't understand, or thought were false. And if you're a journalist, I would recommend doing it! You'll find yourself in a very attractive niche very quickly.</p>

<p>the fact that questioning things that are false is a <em>niche</em> is extremely worrying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, it is worrying. </p>
<p>Though after meeting some people on the more extreme side of political spectrum (generally left), I can understand why it's a niche. </p>
<p>Both sides generally don't like being questioned and come up with excuse after excuse, never listening or even really looking at the other side. Course I'm being kinda general.... But that's been my experiences so far with the extreme sides of both right and left. People closer to the middle then being far on both sides, tend to be more reasonable and willing to question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. I'm personally far left, but only came to that conclusion after exploring many many different arguments. My friend however, is pretty centrist, but said that Nigel farage should be silenced cause his views are dangerous. I was gob smacked. Shutting out an argument means you can't defend your view point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well culture is different everywhere in the world, which would be a much larger discussion but is one that doesn't necessarily pinpoint a &quot;reason&quot;. Possible factors: Two party system, scale of US politics compared to EU politics, electoral college system, &quot;american culture&quot;. Also, I assume each political scene would naturally develop it's own &quot;meta&quot;, so sometimes the explanation is simply &quot;circumstance let to this form of political competition&quot;, but isn't necessarily caused by specific factors. While it'd be nice that there would be simple, easily fixable, underlying difference that caused this effect, that seems unlikely [to me]. </p>
<p>nate_rausch is explaining what the different are right now and how that affects the question asked. I don't think cultural differences between countries can be easily eli5:ed, but how that culture causes political differences can.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does this explain differences between the US and other countries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because the culture surrounding the political scene is different. Not perfectly satisfying, but it's still informative to hear what the specifics of the culture that cause this difference are (which also help understand and thus possibly combat said phenomenon).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's right. My impression is that whereas a person from the Uk will say 'I think you are wrong' and that is completely acceptable, a person from the USA would be far more tactful and careful about the other persons feelings, even going to the extent of saying, 'Sure, you can also look at it from this angle...' Overall it seems to be very good for team working and business building -at least that's my theory. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that while the UK &quot;meta&quot; is often vindicating. The sheer amount of adversarial interviews that take place have lead to an even more dysfunctional relationship between politics and media. Say what you want about the American system but it isn't one where a newspaper editor can demand favors from the met police.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, but from what I've gathered there's a big difference in extend. Of coarse, it's not fair to compare a country the size of Europe to say... Sweden, but that is what OP is doing. Even comparing Canada/UK and US I'd say that extend to which this happens is different, but I can't tell if that's simply my media caused bias as a European :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've lived in Europe, Canada and the US, it happens the same just about everywhere, the US is the best place ive ever lived, but liberal media(in canada and europe) loves to bash the US for whatever reason, so yeah probably media caused bias. </p></div>		</li>
