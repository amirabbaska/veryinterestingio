Arent they afraid of it being a trap? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are proud of what they do, especially if they do it well. It doesnt matter if what they are doing is illegal or not. Some people just want their exploits to be known. </p>
<p>Yes, they might be afraid of it being a trap. But the allure of fame and popularity clouds their judgement when they do it. Just look up people who snapchat rapes or facebook their murders. Look at all the illegal street racing videos online. Think of all the rappers who brag about selling drugs. Look up the Zodiac killer who taunted police. People like bragging. Criminals are people too. </p>
<hr />
<p>And when you say something like, &quot;free criminals,&quot; it suggests that at one point the criminal was not free. Your question would be better worded as, &quot;criminals who havent been caught.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true and there's a great number of awesome documentaries out there.</p>
<p>Still many of them (e.g. all of those National Geographic documentaries on &quot;Meth in Vegas&quot; or &quot;Party drugs in Cancun&quot; or whatever) are entirely staged. It's usually pretty obvious though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it was a documentary by VICE where they had to proof to a criminal that they actually are VICE prior to the interview by placing a specific hidden text on their website. So there is that..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty specticle about some of vice's interviews. Like the guy who admits on camera to doing acid attacks. They could have just paid some random to pretend to be a criminal and no one would know. Still love their docos, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those document makers have some of the best socializing skill ever. They befriend, gain the trust of the interviewees, then ask for a favor. Of course, there would be failed case here and there, but if the makers  try many times, eventually they would have enough material for a documentation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of “The act of killing”. The filmmaker is almost like a character in the movie, the subjects are so chummy with him. And he dares to say things to some really scary people(literally mass murderers) that you could only get away with if you had complete trust from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember watching a ross kemp documentary. The guy he was interviewing was like a kidnapper i think. He doesnt even speak the same language as this guy. So while socialising skills might be used by documentary makers, I dont think it is the reason criminals do interviews for documentaries. Maybe in some cases but not most. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered, if you are the person making the documentary and you find out who the criminal is and what he's doing and where he is, then can you get in trouble at all by not telling anyone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they never tell you their real name or where they operate then you're not withholding anything because you simply don't know. I assume that's why they'll often be wearing masks, rather than just having their face blurred. </p>
<p>Edit: also I know journalists get some leeway with their sources, as far as confidentiality goes. It seems logical that the same would apply to documentarians. </p></div>		</li>
