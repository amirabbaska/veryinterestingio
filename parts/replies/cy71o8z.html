			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish they all did. Hi. I have several old ladies constantly trying to bribe me for cigarettes on a daily basis. None of them have smoked in at least ten years, at most 30. They try to bum smokes off each other, staff, visitors. Two of them are roomates and sometimes they'll be screaming about one stealing the others last pack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. There's been some progress in the last few years in developing techniques to erase memories. If you could refine it to the point of being able to target specific memories, I guess you could treat addictions by erasing the memory of the substance they were addicted to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandfather forgot he was terrified of cats. He never had a cat attack him or anything but his mother hated them and put the fear of them into him from a young age. I can still remember our family's shock of seeing him smiling sitting in his recliner petting a cat in his lap some 5+ years into Alzheimer's.  </p></div>		</li>
