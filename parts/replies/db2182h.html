			<div class="markdown"><p>And as for your second question, I'd look into terms like &quot;apical meristem,&quot; and &quot;auxin&quot; if I were you. :) It takes a lot more than a few sentences to explain the process, so I hope google helps you out there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What, then, explains how they know to grow around certain objects?  Like power lines, etc, without touching them?  I always thought it was landscaping people who made tunnels for trucks out of branches, or pathways around power lines. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trees will grow through powerlines just fine--you're right, it takes a bunch of landscaping to keep branches away. Trucks, on the other hand, can rip the branches off of trees when they pass by; these branches are cut away either by landscaping or by tucks.</p></div>		</li>
