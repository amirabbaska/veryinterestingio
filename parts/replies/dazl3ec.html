			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it came from horse racing, where there is a post to mark the end.  The winning horse is the first one to go past the post.  </p>
<p>The winner is the first one to cross the finish line, no matter how slow (or unpopular) he or she is.</p>
<p>It's how we run most elections in the US.  The one with the most votes is the winner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My state has FPTP voting for electoral votes. I think the &quot;post&quot; is like the finish line of a race, kind of like &quot;first past the finish line.&quot; the so-called finish line in an election could be either a time and date (ie &quot;<em>whoever is in first place by the end of tuesday</em>&quot;) or some condition where one of the contestants has 51% of the total votes (for example in the US election where you need &gt;= 270 electoral votes, first past that 270-vote benchmark). </p>
<p>tl;dr pretty sure &quot;the post&quot; just means the finish line for whatever competition</p></div>		</li>
