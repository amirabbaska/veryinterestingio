			<div class="markdown"><p>As a military communications planner I don’t think this is correct at all.  We build radio relay towers in certain training areas for radio relay of our military frequencies.  We do not relay any civilian cellular signals.  The military does not relay in land we don’t control.  We only relay a few very specific FM frequencies and channels for the observation and control of training, personnel, and land.  We also have tactical radio relay teams who relay military band FM signals, not cell signals.  </p>
<p>Federal and state parks will do the same for their radio frequencies as well but not for cell phone signals.  </p>
<p>In fact, state and federal parks will publish their manned emergency radio frequencies in case you end up lost and in need of help.  You should carry a radio that supports contact within those network frequency ranges when you camp.  </p>
<p>TLDR:
Your cell phone is useless in remote areas.  Buy a 2-way radio. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again to add to this, phones tend to change how much power they use while connected to stronger or weaker signals. e.g. more power is used for a weaker signal (in the most basic explanation). Emergency calls will use the highest power setting for the antenna</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure about that?</p>
<p>Seems like this could actually lead to some huge problems.</p>
<p>I've had two phones in the past that once they reached a certain age, could potentially shutdown if overloaded because of too much power use.</p>
<p>Not a problem normally, but an emergency call might do it on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t have a source for you, but I have spent some time in very rural Nebraska and Viaero sets up mini “Call only” towers that you can stumble upon in the middle of nowhere. They have signs in-front of them explaining what they do. </p>
<p>Edit: I’m messing around on google maps trying to find an example. Here is the central hub for these towers in a Nebraska town, but it’s not a “Call only” tower </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Essentially. Its like forced roaming. Roaming only works on networks that your carrier has negotiated contracts with, for example, Sprint will pay T-Mobile $X for every Y number of minutes (same for data) that their customers use. But Sprint may not have that same deal with Verizon. But in the case of emergency calls, you can use any network. (And maybe some government frequencies too if that's a thing??)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. Roaming means that you're using a network outside of your home network. You could be roaming and be standing in your bedroom if you weren't using your home  network.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. this is very different from roaming.</p>
<p>You can call this &quot;camping&quot;.</p>
<p>Camping means your device is &quot;camped&quot; onto a cell. It's not registered to the system sitting behind the cell. Nobody in there knows who you are, what kind of contract you have. The only thing you're allowed to do, therefore is to make emergency calls. You can do this without a SIM. (If you are in a real emergency and your home network is congested or rejects your call for whatever reason, you may want to try removing your SIM and make emergency call that way. You may find a competing network that's not congested -- or your own network but now it doesn't know you.)</p>
<p>Roaming means your device is not only camped, it's also registered. It goes through the &quot;serving cell&quot; to talk to you home network, who sent over your subscriber information to the serving switching center (there's an entity in there called &quot;visitor registry&quot; that stores information of all the subscribers it serves), so that the serving network knows what service you have and how to charge you later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The UK has no fees for just about any &quot;real&quot; bank ATM, and hasn't had so since the 1990s. The only exceptions are the ATMs in pubs and bars, and only morons with poor planning skills use those. Besides, contactless payments are near-universal. </p>
<p>Some more fun facts from this &quot;magical land&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>I pay less than $20 a month for 12GB of 4G data with free roaming in over 70 countries (unlimited data would be $40).</li>
<li>My home broadband is 200Mbps, has unlimited usage like almost every other home broadband plan, and costs around $50 a month. There are ten other competitors I can choose from.</li>
<li>My healthcare premium and deductible are zero and zero respectively, regardless of my economic or health status.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes no sense. If everyone benefits, there's no reason for a telecom to work to improve service by investing in cellular infrastructure. Any improvements they make (and therefore any competitive advantage they gain) is squandered because they share the network with their competition so their investment is ultimately moot.</p>
<p>Additionally, building out networks is one of the major ways the mobile telecoms differentiate themselves. The better (cell) service Verizon's offers is why many people are willing to pay the higher service fees they charge.</p>
<p>And last of all, companies in the US often do share the physical towers. But because each carrier uses different bands and have no reason to share bandwidth, separate hardware installations are required to service their customers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not wrong though. Here in the UK there are two partnerships.</p>
<p>It's simply not efficient for everyone to do their own thing and you still differentiate on quality of service, as the network operators will hold different amounts of spectrum in different bands, along with pricing and addons</p>
<p>One partnership shares everything, including the base station equipment on 3G (sharing only antennas and backhaul for LTE), the other shares everything except antennas and base station equipment.</p>
<p>Works quite well.</p></div>		</li>
