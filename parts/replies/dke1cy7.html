<p>You are correct in saying that austenitic stainless is non magnetic. However, both ferritic and martensitic types are magnetic. </p>
<p>It is to do with crystal structure. Austenite forms a face centred cubic lattice. In steel an fcc lattice has spacing between atoms that are too far apart to allow for magnetic domains to form. Austenite is generally a high temperature form of steel but the high concentrations of nickel in austenitic stainless stop the steel from reverting back to its low temperature ferritic form. The nickel has the benefit of generating better corrosion resistance but (generally) results in a softer, less strong steel.</p>
<p>Martensite (body centred tetragonal) and ferrite (body centred cubic) have atoms that are much closer together thus allowing the magnetic domains to form. They are (again generally) harder and stronger but more prone to corrosion. </p>
<p>Edit: kitchen knives are generally made from martensitic steel (hardness). Counter tops are generally made from autensitic steel (corrosion resistance).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I learned about this when a doc asked me about a problem he was having with an MRI scan.</p>
<p>A patient had some spine surgery, and the surgeon had put screws in the back, supposedly made from surgical steel (which is usually something like 316 stainless, an austenitic steel, desirable due to its high corrosion resistance). Normally, this wouldn't be an issue - there would be some blurring and distortion of the images next to the screws, but the doc would be able to see most of the detail.</p>
<p>However, when trying to scan this patient, they just couldn't get an image. It was as if there was a football sized hole in the patient's lower back. The scanner just couldn't see anything; just a black hole. The surgeon was adamant that they'd used the same screws they'd always used, and was trying to blame the scanner. </p>
<p>After a lot of arguing between the docs, each blaming the other, eventually the surgeon admitted that he'd broken a tap off in the bone, and was unable to retrieve it.</p>
<p>The tap, being made from a hard tool stainless (I'm guessing something like 440c) was martensitic, and highly ferromagnetic, which explained the MRI scanner's major objection to its presence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you explain the magnetic properties by the &quot;spacing of the atoms&quot;? And would spacing in FCC be smaller than bcc as FCC is close packed? Wouldn't it be the electron configuration that determines the properties, and therefore not the spacing but the crystallography?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting tidbit is that while martensitic steels have very favorable properties for blade applications, e.g. spring steel is a common material for affordable high quality knives, its hardness makes them nigh-impossible to resharpen.</p>
<p>If you think about getting a knife, consider getting one made from softer steel for longer lifetime but higher care requirements.</p></div>		</li>
