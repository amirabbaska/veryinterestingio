			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question!  As long as the center of mass for the whole construct is over the equator, it would work <em>in theory</em>.  In reality, it would get pretty twisted up from being so huge and having two ends in nonviable orbits.  It's not really feasible using construction materials and physics we know today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could we build a really tall building, then have smaller rocket/boosters to launch something the rest of the way?</p>
<p>Less an elevator and more a really tall step later, and we just chuck people/items/whatever the rest of the way?</p></div>		</li>

<p>They have an extremely elliptical orbit, spending a long time slowly drifting through space way above the northern hemisphere, then whip around the southern hemisphere really quick and close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is really cool. dumb question - Do most satellites follow this figure 8 orbit? Also, I know the odds of two satellites hitting each other are slim because of the size of our atmosphere vs the size of the satellites but considering there are several hundreds (?) of them in orbit do scientists predict the path of each one to ensure it wont collide? Do they deliberately set them on certain paths to transmit info to certain ground locations? Are satellites ever effected to some extent by the ground weather like major hurricanes or something like a volcano going off that could disrupt the orbit patterns and create unpredictable trajectories? Couldn't that lead to more possible collision courses?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No they do not. These &quot;figure 8&quot; orbits only occur when your orbital period is exactly the same as the time it takes Earth to make one complete rotation, a &quot;sidereal day&quot;, which is 23 hours and 56 minutes.</p>

<p>A couple of things, there's actually tens of thousands of satellites depending on how you define it. Most of these satellites are actually pieces of man made space junk and are otherwise dead and uncontactable. Here's an interactive chart of every currently operating satellite currently orbiting the Earth. <a href="https://qz.com/296941/interactive-graphic-every-active-satellite-orbiting-earth/" target="_blank">https://qz.com/296941/interactive-graphic-every-active-satellite-orbiting-earth/</a> (Don't forget to keep scrolling)</p>
<p>Yes all of these are tracked by the US Air Force, not scientists. The US Air Force predicts the path of these and sends out warnings when satellites are predicted to path within certain distance of each other. Usually the companies that receive the notices will slightly maneuver them to move them out of the way of a possible collision even if no collision is likely to happen.</p>
<p>Satellites orbit in space, not within the atmosphere so the size of the atmosphere relative to the size of the spacecraft have nothing to do with each other.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes yes, but anyone on the entire side of the earth that the satellite can be seen from can transmit to them so this isn't that hard.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Nope, satellites are in space and weather has no effect on them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GEO satellites like this all technically trace a figure 8 of some kind, but most are much smaller figure 8s. The Sirius satellites in that animation are special in that they are highly inclined AND more highly eccentric than most satellites at GEO. </p>
<p>The JSpOC at Vandenberg AFB keeps track of the thousands of objects in orbit to predict where and when satellites are getting close to each other to prevent collisions.</p>
<p>Satellites would be technically affected by weather patterns on the earth, but it would not be noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because we live at the bottom of the atmosphere, we're tricked into thinking that it's full of clouds and wind and excitement. It mostly isn't. Nearly all of what you'd think of as weather - winds, rain, clouds, circulation of heat and moisture - occurs within the first 10-15 km, which we call the troposphere. As you can see in <a href="https://www.weatheronline.co.nz/reports/wxfacts/atmo200.jpg" target="_blank">this diagram</a>, changing temperature gradients section the atmosphere off after that point, with a layer of evenly-cold air called the tropopause. You know how a tall storm cloud kind of flattens out into an anvil shape at the top? That's because it's bumping against the tropopause and can't rise any higher. Above that height there's very little weather, which is why long-distance airliners spend most of their time up there. Go even higher, and there's even less going on.</p>
<p>By international agreement (because there is no actual firm border; the air just gets progressively thinner and weirder), the atmosphere ends (and space begins) at 100 km altitude. Take that diagram, stack four of them on top of one another, and you get the height at which the ISS orbits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because these orbit are highly eccentric (i.e. not circular), the higher the altitude of the satellite, the slower it's relative velocity to earth. When the satellite is at it's lowest point of the orbit, it is travelling much faster than when it is traveling at the furthest point of it's orbit, thus, due to the relative speed compared to earth, when the satellite is very high, the earth's rotation might be faster than the surface speed of the satellite, and when it is lower, it might have a surface speed that is higher than earth's rotation. For example, ISS travels with an orbital period of 1.5 hours, a GEO has a 24h orbital period. This would account for the forward backward movement. Add a little inclination to the orbit, and you are also adding some lateral movement in it's orbit (the figure of 8) (All relative to the speed of the earth of course). But yes, the relative speed changes because the higher the orbit, the slower it goes ( it losses relative speed as it rises, and gains speed as it descends). I am not great at explaining myself, but I hope this helps! I could link to an article explaining it if you so wish, it will surely be better than my explanation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the sattelite travels with a set speed, it's relative surface speed changes. </p>
<ul>
<li>A small circle with a circumference of 10km around a pole will make one revolution per day and thus move with a speed of 10 km/day.</li>
<li>The equator has a circumference of ~40,000 km but makes a revolution in the same time and thus moves with a speed of 4000 times that of the small circle.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why the sattelite seems to become slower (bowing towards the west) when it nears the equator and seems to become faster (making a bow towards the east) when it comes from the equator.</p>
<p>To make a straight line the sattelite would have to constantly change it's velocity to the velocity of earths surface at it's current latitude. Decelerating towards the poles and accelerating towards the equator.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The figure 8 orbits are super weird and an artifact of the fact that the satellite isn’t “really” travelling in that nearly geosynchronous frame of reference at all.   The geosynchronous frame of reference - where the camera or observer is locked to the earths rotation shows the figure 8 movement. </p>
<p>In a frame of reference where the earth is centred, but spinning on its axis at one rotation per day. Then you would observe the satellite moving in a sin wave pattern around the earth. </p>
<p>My descriptions of frames of reference are really bad because it’s been half a lifetime since I took those physics courses. </p></div>		</li>
