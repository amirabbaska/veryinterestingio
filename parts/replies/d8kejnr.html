			<div class="markdown"><p>Side question:</p>
<p>Obviously eating it is more damaging, but what about longer term exposure as your body incorporates the ^40 K into tissues?</p>
<p>As an external radiation source the radiation has to penetrate your skin before it can even have a chance at causing cancer or killing cells.  If you eat a contaminated source, it still has to penetrate the mucus linings of your system and outer layer of intestines before it can do damage.  But in the case of potassium it can get readily absorbed and utilized in the body all over and incorporated into cells.</p>
<p>Once inside the cells any decay seems like it would cause much greater (or easier) cell damage.  Not only by way of radiation but also by breaking up what ever molecule that was using the K at the time, disrupting its function.</p>
<p>So wouldn't eating the bananas pose a much greater risk?  How much greater of a threat is this particular potassium radiation than some other that would just be excreted from the body?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer regarding the biology of the question, I know nothing about that.</p>
<p>But in the <a href="https://xkcd.com/radiation/" target="_blank">XKCD chart</a> linked in the current top comment, they give an estimate for the dose you'd receive from eating a banana.</p>
<p>Some of the details of this estimation are stated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_equivalent_dose#Source_of_radioactivity" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>But yes, the dose you'd expect from eating a banana should be larger than the dose you'd expect from simply standing near a banana.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer all of that question. But ingesting a weak gamma source (especially when it is distributed through the body) poses only a tiny amount more of a threat. Gamma radiation has a low probability of interacting with matter. So external radiation stands a very good chance of getting through your protective skin layers, but also a very good chance of going straight through you completely as well. Internal radiation will in all likelihood get out of you before interacting. My understanding is that the biochemical effects of potassium ingestion will cause problems long before its radiation does.</p>
<p>To contrast, ingesting an alpha source would be significantly worse. Alpha radiation is normally all stopped by your skin because it is very likely to interact. This high interaction rate makes it very dangerous if it is emitted inside your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inside your body, the betas emitted by the ^(40)K become an issue. The gammas can escape, but the decay by internal conversion will lead to x-rays and Auger electrons as well. And the attenuation coefficient for photons depends strongly on their energy. X-rays are less penetrating than gammas due to the greatly increased probability of the photoelectric effect.</p></div>		</li>
