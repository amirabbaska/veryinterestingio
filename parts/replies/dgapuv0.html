<p>Edit: If so many of you guys want to die so much why don't you just kill each other? In fact, maybe you might discover something in common to keep you all living?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the toxin and application method. If it's a gell or powder you might be able to remove it just by washing or boiling. If the surface is pitted than a deeper clean may be required. Generally the rule is that when you coat something on lethal toxin the only thing you really am to remove the poison from it is the target during its administration. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you just making shit up cause it sounds like it makes sense or can you provide a source for this &quot;rule of thumb&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thick oils or resinous substances can be used too, or it can be bound in beeswax and tallow, that kind of thing. It's a really crazy thing to do though, unless you're suicidal; many <em>many</em> knife attacks involve the attacker cutting themselves on their own blade. It also means that if for some reason you're disarmed, a scratch could could kill you. </p>
<p>If you're not using a very potent, very fast poison, then frankly it's not going to help you in a knife fight, right? If you are using a potent fast-acting poison, then it's a risk to you, and frankly why not just dip a dart or arrow in the same poison and lose the personal risk?</p>
<p>You see a lot of poisoned projectile weapons over the years, but not a ton of poison close combat weapons. They do crop up, but not every day.</p></div>		</li>

Unfortunately that guy didn't finish the giant off immediately and the giant was able to trip the guy, pull him to the ground, and crush his skull barehanded. It was pretty brutal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...but why? You could coat an arrow or a small crossbow bolt, or dart and you don't have to get that close. Even a crude hand-thrown dart gives you a few few of distance between you and a target. I grant you, I'm not an assassin (or any of the usual internet profession... not a Navy SEAL etc), this is just me speculating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also suspect that in arrows the wood absorbs the poison too, also dipping arrows in fecal matter was a cheap and easy way to poison an arrow for battle type situations, enough would be in the wood to cause sepsis, as for daggers and what not, the original answer is correct, if you ever spilled a drink and let it sit it will turn gooey and be hard to remove, but if you soak it in liquid its easy to remove, kinda like it would in contact with blood</p></div>		</li>
