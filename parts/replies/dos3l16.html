<p>As for toothpaste, xylitol is a sugar alcohol and would give a refreshing mouthfeel, but I don’t know how it could be helpful beyond that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We in the USA have at least one big brand of chewing gum (that I know about) which contains xylitol--it's called Trident. I'm not sure if xylitol has much of a real effect but I prefer to buy Trident whenever I want gum
because of the xylitol in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Not sure if you are a shill for Trident; one can never be too careful these days...</del> All clear!</p>
<p>Anyway, while Trident may list xylitol in its ingredients, the quantity of xylitol used in their gum is almost inconsequential. Trident gum contains very little xylitol relative to other sweeteners, such as sorbitol, aspartame (which is a controversial ingredient), and acesulfame potassium.</p>
<p>Gum brands which actually use xylitol as the primary sweetener or in meaningful quantities include Spry, Xylichew, PÜR Gum, and CONFADENT.</p>
<p>Note: xylitol is just one of many other polyols (sugar alcohols) that are inert to your mouth microbes. What sweetener is in the gum doesn't matter much, if at all, because the mechanical act of chewing and secreting saliva is what really helps your teeth. As long as it is sugarfree, you can even chew on gum base with the same effects.</p>
<p>Finally, chewing gum does not clean your teeth like brushing and especially flossing. You can chew gum after a meal to freshen your breath or just for fun to keep you busy, but it is not a replacement for actual dental hygiene practices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, I'm definitely not a shill for Trident but I can see why you might think so due to my wording. I didn't realize there was so little xylitol actually in it! Thanks for letting me know about those other brands.</p>
<p>I'd never want to try and use chewing gum to replace brushing or flossing. I just like to have a piece after meals, like you mentioned. </p></div>		</li>
