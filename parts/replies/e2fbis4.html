			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, i would guess this depends on the medium used. I know that historically for example oil painting was done differently than it is now. because many paints chemically reacted with each other so they were isolated with layers of varnish.  I would also like to hear an proper answer to this :)
But it might be a transparent blue layer glazed over tonal painting, it might be a different mineral  like azurite. It really depends on the hue. U can quite easily distinguish if its ultramarine or smth else by the hue. Not so much by the tonality.
Oh, i lost the track. I doubt ultramarine would be mixed in - i think it would be glazed over because of the light reflecting qualities it has. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Most of the blue you can see in old paintings is actually black mixed with white (it looks like grayish blue and your eye perceives it as blue because the painter has surrounded it with warm tones)</p>
