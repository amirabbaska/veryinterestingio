			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the reason I was always given when I worked in a shop for not putting batteries on the floor.  The wood had to extend a few inches past the sides of the battery, too.</p>
<p>Considering a number of the batteries had visible leaks and I know what sulfuric acid can do to concrete, I never questioned it.  Didn't realize it was a weird myth about discharging until reading this thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would not be too surprising if the myth stems from the correlation. The batteries that leak and destroy the concrete are the ones that lose charge. Instead of blaming the battery someone might blame the concrete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is probably the most correct answer.</p>
<p>Lead acid batteries have been known to leak sulfuric acid. This was especially true before sealed batteries came into wide use.</p>
<p>Sulfuric acid attacks concrete. For the chemically inclined readers, it reacts with the calcium silicate, producing calcium sulfate, which is highly water soluble, and will leave craters in the floor where the concrete was eaten away.</p></div>		</li>
