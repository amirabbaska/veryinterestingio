<p>Good point, except that -1! isn't defined. 0 is the base case, and is not itself defined recursively. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>1! = 1 -  (That part seems intuitive to everyone)</p>
<p>1! = (1-1)! * 1 -  (Plug k=1 into the first equation)</p>
<p>1! = 0! <em> 1 = 0! - (1 - 1 is 0, and x </em> 1 = x for any x)</p>
<p>1 = 1! = 0! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought your written explanation made much more sense.</p>
<p>That circular equation just makes no sense to me.  The 1 rule of a definition is that a term cannot use itself in its definition.  So, f that noise, I found a better one on Wikipedia!</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/75LMn" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/75LMn</a></p>
<p>Which is equal to this Product when m=1</p>

<p>Which, when you finish, will lead back to your written statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when you multiply no numbers, you get 1, not 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's what it took for me to wrap my mind around it, anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One issue with your proof is that it relies on the assertion of </p>
<p>k! = (k-1)! * k</p>
<p>but then you say -1! is not defined, meaning that definition is not true for all values of k.  That and, as I've pointed out, if my assertion that </p>
<p>x * 0 = 0 </p>
<p>is true, the same equation tells us 0! = 0, so there appears to be some conflict.  And of course, then you get to the issue that if 0! = 0, that first equation tells us that 1! = 0, and thus if you follow it up the chain every factorial is 0, which is obviously false.  </p>
<p>I don't say this to say what 0! is or should be.  Just that the proof has holes.  If I were to say, I'd say the same thing you say about -1!, it is not defined.  But what do I know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could also think of it as how many ways you can arrange the numbers. </p>
<p>3! Contains a 1 a 2 and a 3 which you can arrange in 6 combinations: </p>
<p>123;132;213;231;321;312</p>
<p>0! only contains 0 so there is only 1 way to arrange it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the factorial only considers positive integers. If you threw the 0 in there, it would be useless as a mathematical function, since it would multiply everything else in the factorial by 0.</p></div>		</li>
