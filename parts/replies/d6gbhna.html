<p>A sneeze is an involuntary action but it is a semi-autonomous one, meaning you have some degree of control over it. Most of the time, though, you don't choose to exercise this control and resign yourself to the action.</p>

<p>I'm a big sneezer, and a joke at work is that I get the most 'Bless Yous' out of anybody else in the office. </p>
<p>One week I pulled a muscle in my back and we noticed that I didn't sneeze at all the entire week. When I first injured my back I did sneeze at home one time, it was quite possibly the most painful sneeze I've ever had, as an already tense muscle tightened up during the jolt.</p>
<p>After that, I became a lot more able to stifle a sneeze. As soon as my back got a bit better, I was sneezing again.</p>
<p>Not sure how much that adds to the discussion, but it's interesting to think about the way your brain decides it's better to let an irritant remain in the nose than risk the back pain. All those decisions in the background that I'm not really too aware of</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did the same thing after getting my wisdom teeth pulled. Once I realized that I was consciously stifling every sneeze, I tried to see how long I could go without ever sneezing, even after my mouth healed. </p>
<p>Eventually I completely forgot about it and continued sneezing like normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be some kind of connection between sneezing and the nerves in your spine. Sometimes when I sneeze very hard I get pains in one or both arms and sometimes my shoulder blades. </p>
<p>I read up on it and it's apparently not that uncommon. It seems to be connected to pinched nerves in your back causing a sort of &quot;phantom pain&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About a year ago I was in a pretty bad car accident and ended up breaking all my ribs. I did not sneeze the entire time they were healing. It wasn't like I had the urge and stopped it, it was almost like my body knew it would be extremely painful for me to sneeze and just refused to do it.</p></div>		</li>
