			<div class="markdown"><p>No, he said Bansky's real name was &quot;Robert&quot;. People already thought it was Robert Del Naja before this, so it was seen as confirmation.</p>

<p>Give me a bubble letter and put it on a T-shirt and write Banksy on it and we're sorted. We can sell it now... No disrespect to Robert, I think he is a brilliant artist.</p>

<p>But there's also <a href="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2016/10/robin-gunningham-1024x813.jpg" target="_blank">Robin Gunningham</a>, who was outed as Bansky in 2008.</p>

<p>Then 6 months later:</p>

<p>There's also a French graffiti artist from Exit Through The Giftshop that people claimed was Bnaksy after watching the doc.</p>
<p>There's too many contradictary stories to know for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently there's a correlation between where massive attack have toured and banksy's artwork has appeared. If anyone wants to listen to that interview for themselves it happened on scroobius pip's &quot;distraction peices&quot; podcast</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I saw that. People have geographically traced Bansky's work and it's usually not far from Massive Attack's gigs.</p>

<p><a href="http://people.com/music/banksy-identity-not-robert-del-naja-source/" target="_blank">Sorry Fans: Banksy Is Not Robert Del Naja from Massive Attack, Says Source</a></p>
<p>Then:</p>

<p>Personally, I subscribe to the idea that it's a group of people. And honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if people like Del Naja and Gunningham were part of that group along with a handful of other's whose name's have probably already been mentioned. That's what makes Banksy so intriguing to me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What a great movie/documentary. </p>
<p>To think that Banksy was essentially making it about <em>himself</em> makes it even sweeter. And actually kinda makes sense...that awareness of the hypocrisy of his situation seems befitting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, it's easy to miss if you don't actively search for it. The only reason it's fresh in my memory was there was a story on r/worldnews about 2 months ago claiming <a href="https://www.ncscooper.com/graffiti-artist-banksy-arrested-at-art-exhibit-in-palestine-identity-revealed/" target="_blank">he'd been caught and arrested.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.business2community.com/world-news/street-artist-banksy-arrested-unmasked-art-exhibit-palestine-hoax-01914657" target="_blank">Turned out it was a hoax</a> and the guy the article named as being Banksy was also the author of the article.</p></div>		</li>
