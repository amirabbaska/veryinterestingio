			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much my path to going from a depression to bipolar diagnosis too. Antidepressants trigger manias for bipolar and mood stabilisers level you out. Too many mood stabilisers make you deadpan or wanting to sleep all the time.</p>
<p>The worst manias are the ones where your mind is racing to the point you can't think, sleep or do anything. One antidepressant they tried me on even out me in a constant state of aggression. Lucky for me it only took a few different antidepressants and about 6 months before the doc caught on that it was bipolar. Switching between those antidepressants is hell though with the clean periods in between. Fine tuning mood stabilisers was a lot simpler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought I was depressed at one point as a teenager. Got prescribed antidepressants and for a week I was completely manic, while I was in school. I don't remember much of it except that I seemed to make a lot of friends those couple of days but I had to cut it off because I also had no filter and said a few stupid things. I'm probably more similar to bipolar to be honest, but not bad enough to take meds I guess. </p>
<p>SO yeah I think if you're not really depressed, it's probably not a good idea. I can't imagine what actually being depressed would be like. So depressed that happy pills just make you normal. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure if you meant this literally, but a lot of people misunderstand the goal of medication. All of this isn't aimed at you.</p>
<p>Anti-depressants (&quot;happy pills&quot;) aren't really intended to make depressed people &quot;happy&quot;. They should be prescribed to relieve symptoms of depression, giving the person more normal moods, so they can feel happiness, sadness, fear, and anger. </p>
<p>A lot of people, including people with mental illness, think happy is the opposite of depressed, but the opposite of depressed is actually manic. Being manic can feel great, but it's just as destructive to the person and those around them. </p>
<p>So basically, if taking anti-depressants actually makes someone super happy and energetic, that could be a bad sign.</p>
<p>Sorry for the lecture. It's a widespread myth that gets under my skin for two reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It gave me unrealistic expectations about my treatment, and I didn't understand this for over a decade because no one explained it well.</p>
</li>
<li>It leads some people to rail against psychiatry and those with mental illness, arguing that it's not normal to be happy all the time. They're right about that, because it's not. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was probably simplifying too much. I've read before that some times depressions is actually a chemical imbalance in your actual biology. And that's what I was finding hard to imagine, being messed up on a biological level so that the &quot;happy pills&quot; which would mess up a &quot;normal&quot; person just helps you balance out. </p>
<p>I didn't mind the lecture :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I had several psychiatrists who kept putting me on antidepressants and almost all of them would cause me to rapidly cycle, which made my life a living hell for the better part of 4 years. Not to sounds super sexist, but I had only had male psychiatrists who chalked up my &quot;moodiness&quot; to me being just a &quot;hormonal young woman&quot;. But then I found a psychiatrist who is a lady and after my first visit with her she decided to start treating me for bipolar disorder. Now I'm just on a mood stabilizer, although I might add in something for anxiety, however I have seen good results on a mood stabilizer alone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you mean about the man part. I'm a guy, and I actually prefer to go to female doctors and psychetrists. </p>
<p>as weird as it is to say, men just don't seem to give a fuck and will just try the easiest option and that's that... whereas the women have more patience and would rather get you to the proper stage of treatment you need... if you get me?</p>
<p>I also like how females feel more personal instead of just &quot;on to the next one&quot;. might just be because I've only met one good male doctor out of many... so who knows </p></div>		</li>
