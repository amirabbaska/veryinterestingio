I don't know if its only a local brand but it's pretty common here.</p>
<p>Pulling a bigger image from another local store page here <a href="https://www.makro.co.za/Images/Products/Large/MIN_10631_EAA.jpg?v=20180828" target="_blank">https://www.makro.co.za/Images/Products/Large/MIN_10631_EAA.jpg?v=20180828</a>, it shows the active ingredient as Trichloroisocyanuric acid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also possible that the Cal hypo product added with the small amount of water added a lot of the heat too. I worked for a pool company and the first thing they explained was how if you add small amounts of water to Cal hypo products they have a nasty tendency of catching on fire or exploding. Since I'm not the smartest of people a couple of the other employees and me tested this and it quite violently set on fire I'm sure with the other product it just made it more violent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is what I originally thought was the case for the OP. It sounds like the OP added a whole load of undissolved hypochlorite which while dissolving will produce loads of heat. It's the first error made in any chem lab. People forget - dissolving substances (edit) can be very exothermic.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The majority of dissolution reactions are exothermic, but not all of them. <a href="https://sciencing.com/two-examples-endothermic-processes-spontaneous-21061.html" target="_blank">Ammonium nitrate</a> is just one example of an endothermic dissolution. Another one is acetonitrile in water. In this class of reactions, the actual delta-H is positive, but because the increase in entropy is so large, the overall Gibb's Free Energy is still negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment made me remember that I had a rag soaked in a stout calcium hypochlorite solution catch fire. Was disinfecting a well pump line which had some oxidized iron on it. Was a really hot day, 34Â°C or something and I thought the pipe was just warm. Nope, the rag was starting to smoulder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not 100% sure it was Clarity, or if that's even the correct name, it just stood out in my mind/memory. I tried searching, but didn't come up with anything, maybe they went out of business? I have no idea.</p>
<p>What you described seems pretty accurate, so whatever it was, it must have contained dichlor or maybe trichlor. It was definitely a powdered chlorine-containing pool-cleaning agent :)</p></div>		</li>
