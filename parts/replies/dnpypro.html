<p>but above that and you end up with low-enough contamination that it's not a big deal</p>

<p>Don't forget the political and psychological aspects. A 0.001% higher chance to get cancer is not a big deal, but try to explain to people that it is saver for them to stay in the region with a small plutonium concentration than it is to move elsewhere. It didn't work with Fukushima, where the evacuation killed more people than the radiation would have killed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eating a diet rich in meat and lacking vegetables, being overweight, drinking excess alcohol, smoking, exposure to common viruses, a sedentary lifestyle, exposure to normal levels of background radiation, can combine to increase your risk of cancer by almost 40%. So it's quite clear people expose themselves to greater risks they ignore, maybe because radiation doesn't taste so nice.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Older people, especially those in nursing homes or hospitals definitely should have stayed.  An increase in background level radiation is the sort of thing which might give you a small increase in cancer risk over the next 20 years or so, and frankly many of them wouldn't live long enough to ever see negative effects and just moving them is dangerous.  This is the same reason wildlife is doing fine at Chernobyl, they don't live long enough for cancer to be a big problem in their populations.</p>
<p>Children on the other hand are both more susceptible to DNA damage since they have more cells dividing and will live a lot longer, so it makes sense to evacuate them immediately from an area you suspect to have high radiation until you know it's safe.</p></div>		</li>
