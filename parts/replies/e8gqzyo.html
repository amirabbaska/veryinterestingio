			<div class="markdown"><p>This is misleading. Absorption and emission can slow the effective speed of light in a medium, but photon re-emission is a random process which does not generally preserve the direction of the original photon. If this was the only reason that light traveled slower in a material than a vacuum, there would be no transparent materials, since the light would scatter internally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is referred to as diffuse transmission, in analogy with specular reflection (mirror-like) and diffuse reflection (random). It is rare to find materials with ideal diffuse transmission (with no light is absorbed during the transmission/scattering process), but fog and liquid suspensions are examples of what diffuse transmission looks like - they scatter light while transmitting it.</p></div>		</li>
