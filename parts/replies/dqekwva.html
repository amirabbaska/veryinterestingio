			<div class="markdown"><p>It took a couple of minutes after watching the video but it just clicked in my head - we humans cannot see in infrared. If we could, then the night sky (rather, just the sky) wouldnâ€™t stop us from seeing things. </p>
<p>But the light scatter from the atmosphere would blind us when our half of the earth faced the sun - much like trying to use night vision goggles in the day time.</p>
<p>So, I guess the evolutionary path our eyes took was to see really well when the sun light was scattered by the atmosphere (day time) and not so well when there is no light scatter (night time). Had it been reversed, we would consider night time our day and have to rush to darkness at sunrise because it would blind us. The current way is much better for survival, it seems.</p>
<p>Am I overthinking this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the visible light spectrum is the only wavelengths that can effectively penetrate liquid water and as our ancestors first developed eyes in water we are stuck with eyes that can only see in those wavelengths.</p>
<p>Also only average stars output light in the visible spectrum. Larger stars output in the upper em bandwidth and small stars output mostly radio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a class of stars that has its peak in the infra-red or UV regions; is it possible an alien species developed around one of these stars and so they can't see our spectrum and we can't see theirs? It'd be weird for sure. Maybe a bit like Predator</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of true, but not quite. Whilst we are adapted to the visible spectrum we also are specifically adapted against seeing the main wavelengths of light coming from the sun.</p>
<p>Whilst solar output is fairly consistent across those wavelengths, atmospheric filtering of the shorter wavelength colours means that our sun appears decidedly yellow, and yet we have no capacity to detect yellow light in our eyes, instead having cones for red, green, and blue. In fact yellow light tends to excite our red and green cones pretty equally.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that if we were adapted to see the wavelength of light from the sun that reached our eyes the most of that is all we would see. All the other colours would just be overwhelmed with how much yellow light there is.</p>
<p>So how do we see yellow? Well we don't - what we see is light combined with an absence of other colours, specifically blue, which our brain interprets as yellow. Basically if we are seeing light and it's not exciting red or green, and it is not exciting blue, then we say it must be yellow.</p>
<p>In the retina there are cells called bipolar cells that detect the presence of absence of colour. So one set of bipolar cells see red and anti-red and green and anti-green. Blue ones see blue and anti-blue. Red and green are opposing, so anti-red we see as green and anti-green we see as red. That's what gives us such strong red/green sensitivity... well some of us anyway.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are a little off in your assumptions. The night sky is much dimmer than the day sky at all wavelengths. That is because hotter objects emit <a href="http://quantumfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/black-body-radiation-curves.png" target="_blank">more light at all wavelengths</a>, even as the peak intensity shifts to shorter wavelengths with temperature. So the sun is emitting in those wavelengths, and the sun is so much closer than any other stars.</p>
<p>Also, distant galaxies are shifted to the infrared, but they are very dim compared to the stars in our own galaxy. They would hardly blind you even if you could see IR. </p>
<p>Side note: Sunlight intensity <a href="http://www.sunlightinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Sunlight_spectrum_Fiji_July.jpg" target="_blank">peaks in the visible wavelengths</a>, and water is transparent in the visible wavelengths but <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/images/water_spectrum_2.gif" target="_blank">gets opaque outside of that window</a>. Those two facts make visible light the default for vision in squishy, water-filled animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's a follow up question. If I pointed a machine that collects all photons of any wavelength at a random batch of the sky, what would the spectrogram look like, and what would the intensity level be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think infrared seeing would blind you in daytime. <a href="https://www.google.se/search?q=sun+irradiance&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjosdfhjd_XAhVBG5oKHdNXDRQQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=759#imgrc=nZPQWcmcfvv7rM:" target="_blank">The Solar irradiance is strongest at about 500nm (cyan).</a></p>
<p>I think infrared vision would work about as good during the day time as the night. Snakes for example are active in any lighting condition and uses the infrared heat signature to see pray. </p>
<p>The disadvantage of not seeing the visual spectrum is that you are not able to see colors and determine for example if a fruit is ripe or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colors are not an intrinsic property of the visible wavelengths. They're a sensory effect created in the brain based on which cells in your eyeball were activated. If we could see infrared, I'd imagine we'd have evolved a type of cell tuned to those wavelengths, and that would induce perception of an entirely new colour.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problems with conservation of energy. The light is shifted because it is stretched by the expansion, space is stretching so the light travelling is stretched too, this increases the wavelength of the light. Same amount of energy being transferred, it's just been stretched out a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true. Light is quantized. When a photon is red shifted it doesn't take up more space, that photon has less energy. You can't &quot;stretch out&quot; a photon to make it redder and the same amount of energy, because a photons energy is entirely determined by its wavelength. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you tried to capture the light energy you'd get less energy per second, but you'd also receive the energy for more seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that so? It was my understanding that energy is not conserved in an expanding universe, but that's okay, because energy is only conserved in inertial frames of reference. And when you generalize to non-inertial frames of reference, such as expanding universes, the generalized conservation law holds just fine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing about photons is that they redshift, losing energy as space expands. If we keep track of a certain fixed number of photons, the number stays constant while the energy per photon decreases, so the total energy decreases.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't. Energy is only conserved locally, not globally. In a specific interaction, it will be conserved, but looking at the universe as a whole, it won't necessarily. Check <a href="https://motls.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/why-and-how-energy-is-not-conserved-in.html" target="_blank">this</a>. Also bear in mind that while the CMB is losing energy due to redshift, energy is also being created in the form of dark energy. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not necessarily how infinity works. You can have infinite terms adding up to an arbitrary small finite quantity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But, the light from a start t at distance r ~ 1/r^2 , while the number of stars between r and (r + dr) ~ r^2 dr, so you're effectively integrates 1 dr, from 0 to infinity. That's gonna give you an infinite intensity - it diverges and the existence of convergent sums doesn't really matter.</p></div>		</li>
