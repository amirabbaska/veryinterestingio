			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite the same, but you can always change the alarm setting on your phone so that it gets louder over the course of a minute or two. That's what I do, and now I tend to naturally wake up right when the first faint sounds start rather than having an alarm blare in my ear, but on the off chance I'm out cold and don't hear it start up, it'll still eventually get loud enough and wake me in a minute or two. 10/10 would recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is sleep as an android (obviously for android) which has a wide variety of settings, the way i have set it up it plays very faint sounds at first, like leaves rustiling in the wind, for a minute or two and then after that the regular alarm kicks in and gradually gets louder. </p>
<p>It also tries to shift the alarm time around to catch you in a light sleep phase.</p></div>		</li>
