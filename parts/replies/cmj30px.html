<p>But, the gravity of the decision reached is staggering. If you reach the conclusion that nothing improper occurred and you are wrong, you have crushed confidence in the university believing sexual misconduct allegations. Additionally, if someone at DOJ thinks you didn't take enough time or effort in reaching a conclusion, bad things may happen to the university. But, if you reach the conclusion that there was sexual misconduct and there wasn't, you have probably ended a student's academic career unfairly and unjustly. But more than that, probably put the university in the sights of a multimillion dollar lawsuit. Even more, as much as I like the University I teach at, I am unsure the university system lawyers would protect me. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, you have to reach a conclusion faster than the traditional justice system, have less training than the police investigators have, less investigatory powers, and are in an actionable position if/when you get a decision wrong, unlike the traditional justice system.  Sounds about right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought about writing more about this and since the issue came up: when one case went up, I asked if I could speak, without disclosing privacy information, to my colleagues. I am close with several Criminal Justice faculty and I was told it was improper. So, it is improper to get more context on situations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recent lawsuits have set the precedent that if you are found to violate a students rights while serving in the role of a &quot;hearing officer&quot;, as your school titles it, the student in question can seek civil and potential criminal damages from not only the university, but the individuals involved as well.</p>
<p>If I were you I would stay away from any involvement</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You point is incredibly valid. But remember, faculty are evaluated on a yearly basis for research, teaching, and service. The university service requirement includes this type of service. At my prior university (close to 30k students), it was almost all research and some teaching (basically don't do anything extremely unethical) for yearly merit, promotion, and tenure. But smaller schools require much more service. And usually when asked if you will serve in this capacity, it comes from a Dean or higher. So, there is pressure to serve. </p></div>		</li>

I was involved with the Honor Code proceedings at a small institution that took integrity very seriously, so I know just how much stress and work goes into doing it properly. Fortunately I never had to worry about the a Title IX hammer dropping on me.</p></div>		</li>
