			<div class="markdown"><p>Why then does Jesus constantly refer to the &quot;Father&quot; as if a different person, in the scripture? There's a lot of examples of him speaking to &quot;God&quot; as if in a conversation or asking a rhetorical question. If they're the same being, wouldn't they share the same thoughts and existence? (ie: &quot;Forgive them father, they know not what they do&quot; or &quot;my god, why have you forsaken me?&quot; or &quot;Father, into your hands I place my spirit.&quot;) It seems redundant for him to say these things. How can he forsake himself? How can he give his spirit to himself? It seems very strange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jesus is the Incarnation of the Second Person of the Trinity, the Only Begotten Son of the Father. So his Father is the First Person of the Trinity, the Father.</p>
<p>Also, the writers of the Gospel wrote the Gospels before the Doctrine of the Trinity (and thus, the specific understanding and language) was established.</p>
<p>Also, Jesus was quoting Psalms when he said &quot;My God, why have you forsaken me.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there's arguments and then there's arguments.</p>
<p>If the question is &quot;What is the Holy Spirit REALLY like?&quot; the right answer is &quot;we don't know.&quot; Even &quot;no such thing&quot; is a supposition.</p>
<p>But if the question is, &quot;What have Christians believed and taught about the Holy Spirit?&quot; - Well, there is an answer to that, and it isn't whatever bullshit people half-remember from Sunday School Amateur Hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't feel indignance.  If anything, the other response to me certainly seemed indignant: </p>
<p>&quot;[the truth] isn't whatever bullshit people half-remember from Sunday School Amateur Hour&quot;</p>
<p>I don't agree about the value of the ideas or argument, or about the relatability, but that's okay.</p></div>		</li>
