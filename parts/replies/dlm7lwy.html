			<div class="markdown"><p>It still makes sense though, you're most likely to be eating in a restaurant or family home. If someone ate something bad there, odds are good your meal came from the same batch and needs to be, um, ejected. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It made sense then, but it most definitely doesn't now. We have studied food poisoning it is not an instantaneous reaction. If you see someone vomiting, it is almost certainly the food they at yesterday or the day before that.</p>
<p>&quot;The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within one to two days after eating contaminated food, although they may start at any point between a few hours and several weeks later.&quot;</p>
