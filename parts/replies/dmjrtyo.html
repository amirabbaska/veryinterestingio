			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting a sensory aid is a really emotional experience. My vision had slowly become worse, but not enough to notice things had become blurred. I still remember the disbelief and excitement at how putting my first pair of glasses on suddenly made the world more vivid.</p>
<p>Glasses are just a small augmentation and I'm quite happy we've entered an era where those who've permanently lost vision or hearing can be given it back almost entirely. Sharp senses and good health are gifts many of us take for granted. Take care of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate earbuds.  They're uncomfortable. When I sweat (Such as during exercise.) they don't stay put.  So I was super excited to find bone conduction headphones.  Bluetooth headphones that rest on your temples, not in your ears.  They sound pretty good, all things considered. (Plugging your ears actually make them sound better!)  Also if I'm riding my bike I can still hear if I'm about to be hit by a truck, so that's good.</p>
