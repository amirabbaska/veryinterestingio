			<div class="markdown"><p>Its actually even better than that.. things dont have to be 'lopsided' so to speak, because the net perturbation for any set of secondaries is always going to be in the direction of the plane of 'net' angular momentum. So unless there was perfectly zero angular momentum (in which case, if not for ejection, they would all fall into the center and not be left rotating) they will immediately start being 'squashed' towards the net ang. mom. plane, thus first being 'lopsided' as you say and eventually over time decaying into a plane.</p></div>		</li>
