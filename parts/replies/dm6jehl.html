<p>Cortisol (also known as the stress hormone) and Melatonin are actually the hormones that regulate your sleep pattern and biological clock (circadian rhythm). Cortisol shoots up, giving you the rush and boot of energy to wake up. Cortisol is primarily used for the individuals excitatory behaviors, such as alerting the body to a stressor, challenging a stressor, or even just waking up.</p>
<p>Long periods of exposure of cortisol for the body is toxic, and is the biggest reason why people under chronic stress experience negative physical and mental side effects. It's a steroid hormone, which effectively gives it easy access to your whole body and  brain, running everything on overdrive for the duration. This also makes it easier to test cortisol levels using a simple saliva sample or blood test. Cortisol levels are often taken in hand-in-icewater studies to measure biological stress levels. </p>
<p>People with depression tend to have muted, lowered, or delayed cortisol responses, meaning they often do not get the energy needed to challenge stressors.</p>
<p>Serotonin probably plays a role, but simply because it plays a role in a shit ton of things anyway. But it isn't primarily known as the staple for sleep regulation like cortisol and melatonin are. </p>

<p>Edited in a lot more info on cortisol. I'm surprised I remember so much about this topic, given its not my main realm of study.      </p></div>		</li>

<p>Suspect they mixed their terms. Even then they massively oversimplified a complex issue. Thanks for the insight.</p></div>		</li>
