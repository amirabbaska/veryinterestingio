<p>How big chunk of a penny does it differ if you take into account g varying along the height of the stack?</p>
<p>g = G<em>M / (r^2</em>(1+R/r))^2</p>
<p>Where M is the mass of the Earth, r is the radius of Earth and R is the varying height.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because copper is more dense than zinc. It would be taller if it was just zinc and it would be taller if it was just copper. </p></div>		</li>
