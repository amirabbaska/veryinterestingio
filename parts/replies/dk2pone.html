			<div class="markdown"><p>Alternatively, start with 1 low energy neutron, 1 Deuterium, and 1 Tritium. Fuse the Deuterium and Tritium and absorb the initial neutron with neutron absorbing powder from fission reactors. </p>
<p>BAM! You started with a neutron at rest and &quot;accelerated&quot; it to 14 MeV!</p>
<p>All tongue in cheek, of course. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point! This method only works for atoms. Even neutral mesons could not be accelerated this way since we can't isolate quarks and then recombine them. They'd recombine as soon as we pulled them apart. And of course you're right too about non-composite particles. To accelerate those I think the only methods would be gravitational slingshots/etc, which would be pretty infeasible to set up. </p></div>		</li>
