			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a saying &quot;X is like an albatross around my neck&quot;, based on the poem /u/tincanmonkeyman mentioned, which means something like &quot;I'm being forced to carry this burden as a sign of the poor choices I've made in my life.&quot;</p>
<p>So it could be ironic from that respect, depending on how you view marriage/monogamy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was watching a documentary on Smithsonian (last year mind you) that said that if the relationship didn't work after the initial get together (like not producing offspring or not being able to raise them to adulthood I think it even mentioned one bird annoying the other too much and parenting styles), they would split and try again with other partners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok but from what I understand albatrosses never mate until they are thoroughly pair-bonded via this famously elaborate and complicated ritual that takes a very long time, so I really don't see how any mating could take place without them being solid-as-a-rock pair bonding first, so that could be I suppose it's possible but I frankly don't see how.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you an albatross expert? Unless you are I'm going to stick to the documentary. Like I noted above, it said that if they don't produce offspring or they can't seem to raise one to the point it can leave the nest. Or parenting styles which isn't part of the 'long complicated mating ritual' which is a dance and get a more or less complicated on the type of albatross.</p></div>		</li>
