			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully not. We understand volcanic risk a huge amount more than we did in the 60's. Indonesian authorities have put exclusion zones in place which should hopefully mitigate the risk for most lahaar and pyroclastic density currents, as well as the ballistics that a big explosive eruption can throw out. The real trick is whether the people in the region keep to the advice; so far there has been some evidence of people ignoring the exclusion zones, which obviously is a bad idea.</p>
<p>The real change in risk factors are how explosive an eruption is, how much material is produced, and where that material goes; if it interferes with infrastructure, for example, it can have a far greater impact than if it just runs over wilderness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, what determines the explosiveness of an eruption? I dimly recall something about silica content of lava in a plume from the only course I took on volcanology some twenty five years ago. The spatial distribution of flows and impacts “downwind” (down-eruption?) makes sense to me: despite my training, I now work in the risk mitigation field as a systems scientist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, so most magma generated down in the mantle has a mafic composition like basalt; lots of iron and magnesium, not a great deal of silica.</p>
<p>As the magma rises up through the crust it cools down, leading to crystallisation of some of these elements into things like olivene and pyroxene which don't take up much silica at all. The melt residue you are left with is then slightly enriched in silica by comparison. In addition, it's possible for this magma to melt silicate rocks from around it leading to further silica enrichment. </p>
<p>This chemical change is paired with a viscosity change, leading to evolved melts with much more viscous characteristics. This process also tends to charge the magma with significant amounts of volatiles; chemical which tend toward gas phase at atmospheric pressures. That means that when the magma is decompressed it's a bit like dropping mentoes into coke; the gas comes out of solution as lots of bubbles, which forces the viscous magma out in an explosive eruption with it. In a low viscosity magma there is much more opportunity for these gases to escape without driving enormous 20-30km plumes of fragmented rock glass into the atmosphere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about impacts to us over here in North America?</p>
<p>The whole selfish &quot;how does it affect me&quot; aspect.</p>
<p>For example, will we see/smell smoke (like there is with forest fires)? Giant plumes of lava erupting into the air so high that it lights up the planet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this I vaguely remember a volcano shutting down flights over like half of Europe once, any similar risks?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's close to the equator so we could expect ash dispersal into both hemispheres.  The biggest impact on the US is likely to be air traffic interference.  That's assuming a large scale explosive event. </p></div>		</li>
