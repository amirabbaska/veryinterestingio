			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I've been to Colombia! It is such a beautiful country and is so very much worth visiting (especially Cartagena!). I can't wait to go back and see more of it someday. </p>
<p>EDIT: Alright, fascinating Cartagena story: Because Cartagena is on the coast, it became the main port where Spain would export all the gold, silver, gems, etc from their inner territory in the Americas. Basically the capital of Spanish America. So during a war between Britain and Spain, the British came a-callin' in 1741. It was a <em>massive</em> fleet of 124 ships going against one of the most extensive and impressive fortifications in the Americas. </p>
<p>The fleet was led by Vice Admiral Edward Vernon. The battle did not go well for the British. It was basically a disaster and they ended up losing. BUT, one of the men who survived was Lawrence Washington, the half-brother of soon to be leader of the American Revolution George Washington. Lawrence, serving under Vice Admiral Vernon, was so moved and impressed by the admiral's leadership that, upon returning to his Virginia plantation, he renamed it. It was henceforth known as... Mount Vernon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't go as far as to call it safe. It's a beautiful city and I highly recommend visiting it, specially in march during the Film Festival, but you still have to be careful where you go. This holds true with every major city here. Bogotá, Cali, Medellín, Cartagena, Santa Marta, Villavicencio et al. are much safer now than in the 90s, but we still have a long way to go. As long as my country has the &quot;No dar papaya&quot; mentality in which the victim is always deserving of being robbed or murdered because they had their phone out in public, we're never going to change completely.</p>
<p>Come visit. We're warm, welcoming and love tourists. A lot of us suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malinchism" target="_blank">Malinchism</a>, myself included, so you'll have a great time here. But always be careful and don't take security for granted just because cartels aren't a thing anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>eta: sorry, I see you were just sharing history, I meant to respond to those who professed love for Cartagena</p>
<p>I loved Bogota and Cali, but Cartagena? It's pretty, but one of the most annoying places I've ever been (at least the walled Old Town.) Constant harassment by vendors (every 25 feet? maybe less), people pushing carts with loud bells, and the place is like a giant themed shopping mall. </p>
<p>I admit I didn't spend enough time there to venture out to the islands, which I heard were not so bad. Perhaps that is my key mistake.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I thought it was one of the most touristy places I've ever seen, like Disney Land or Honolulu and I can't understand how people like that. </p>
<p>Like I said though, Cali and Bogota I'm in love with and can't wait to return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. Sorry you had a bad experience! I didn't really notice much of that, or maybe I just turned it off? Or maybe it's gotten more touristy in recent years. If you really want an experience, take a boat from Turbo to Capurganá or Sapzurro. No roads there so no cars. Sleepy little towns.</p>
<p>Then... there's a trail from Sapzurro across the Panama border to one of the most beautiful little beaches in the world called La Miel. If you're there at the right time of day, a little shack will be selling beer, and that's it. No shops, no vendors, nothing. Just a little slice of heaven, friend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m from Bogotá and I have to say that it’s a hard acquired taste, like aguardiente.
Love Cali though, lived a couple of years there and seems like a pretty attractive place to spend my last days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm born &amp; raised in the US and am headed to Medellín for my fourth trip next week. Colombia has become a much, much safer country but Colombians still always tell me to be extremely careful. I think the progress is easier to see from a foreigner's point of view than from a Colombian's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you say is true. The thing is, we're all so used to our cities not being safe, that we always have this sort of chip at the back of our heads, reminding us that threats could be anywhere. </p>
<p>Better safe than sorry, I guess.</p>
<p>Edit: have a nice time visiting Medallo!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think some Colombians do see the progress, they're pretty proud of their country (example: my mother) </p>
<p>As to why they still tell you to watch out, my parents would warn me not to speak English in Colombia because it marked you as an American, and it gives off the image that you're rich and gullible so you're easy to rob or swindle. So if you don't speak Spanish, or speak it with an American accent, yeah, hold on to your pocket.But la guerrilla isn't gonna kidnap you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am from Colombia, let me tell you once I was in the literal jungle with some friends doing a camping trip and I saw a couple people from the states there wasn't even cellphone service. And they made it safe to town, I think that, except the areas that are still in dispute between drug traffickers, rural areas are safe but as always you have to be very cautious, is more of a behavior thing than being a foreigner because bad thing happens to locals that wander too. </p></div>		</li>
