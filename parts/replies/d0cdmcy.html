			<div class="markdown"><p>So the difference here is that Ryden is talking about stars instead of a nebula. In general, nebulae are resolved objects (larger than the smallest thing you can see), while stars are still unresolved points - and that difference is very important here.</p>
<p>In both cases, the total number of photons you see will increase as you get closer. However, in the case of a resolved nebulae, it also grows in size, so all that extra light is spread over an equivalently larger area of the sky. The net result is that the surface brightness (which is just brightness per square degree) stays exactly the same, and a small faint nebula becomes a big faint nebula.</p>
<p>Stars, on the other hand, are unresolved objects. Unless you're very, <em>very</em> close to one (roughly 30 AU for a Sun-sized star, or about 0.0005 light-years), it's still going to appear as a single unresolved point. As you start moving closer to a distant star, you now have more photons coming from something that stays a point source, and so it appears brighter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I see a lot of folks in this thread who are under the assumption that nebulae shine because of reflected light. </p>
<p>While faint reflection nebulae do exist (such as the gas surrounding the Pleiades), they're not all that common. By far, the brightest nebulae emit their own light. They absorb hard UV from nearby stars, which ionizes the gas. As the electrons in the gas then recombine with nuclei and work their way back down to the ground state, they emit various colors, many in the visible range of wavelengths.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought nebulae were diffuse/molecular? </p>
<p>Edit: does this also mean nebula brightness would stay constant as you passed through one? Would this much light spread over the whole sky add considerably to nighttime light levels?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, they are. &quot;Resolved&quot; in this context is an optical term which is to say that the extent of the nebulae is usually larger than the resolution limit of your eye, which is why it appears as a blob rather than a single point.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Possibly - this depends on the &quot;optical thickness&quot; of the entire nebula. As seen from outside, you're adding up all the light emitted from the entire column of gas along your line of sight. Once you're inside, though, that column is now partially ahead of you and partially behind you, so it may dim a bit in any given direction. It really depends on the geometry and density of the gas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would this much light spread over the whole sky add considerably to nighttime light levels?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It could, if you were properly dark-adapted. I've almost been able to read star maps just by the of the Milky Way as seen from the top of the mountain at a dark-sky observatory. If you imagine that same surface brightness spread across the sky rather than just a band, that could be enough.</p></div>		</li>
