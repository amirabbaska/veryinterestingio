			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose if you were to think of it as more conceptual...people are generally afraid of the dark because one of your primary senses is no longer accurately able to keep you safe.  If you were to remove/impair the sight of any animal that relies on sight, they would probably freak out.  But more to op's question, what we consider dark, is not the same as most animals.  </p>
<p>I also expect this has something to do with what we are used to.  If you take an animal from a zoo that is well lit at night and toss them into the jungle, I expect they would get scared.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are asking if we know how the animals feel relative to human emotions. Such answers are always difficult, if not impossible</p>

<p>Neuroscientist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65e2qScV_K8" target="_blank">Jaak Panksepp</a> has done significant work in this arena. He says that we have feelings because they tell us what supports our survival, and what detracts from our survival. We can look at the similarities between our neurology and other animals’ neurology and draw inferences about similar feelings we share.</p>
<p>There are plenty of videos with him lecturing on the topic, or one could read his book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/334755.Affective_Neuroscience" target="_blank">Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions</a>. I’m not a scholar on his work, but I have enough familiarity that I could probably answer some questions if anyone has them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't describe fear as a &quot;human emotion&quot;. It's one of the most basic responses that exists, across many different types of animals, and it's very simple - meaning very easy to recognize as well, since the symptoms are physical.</p></div>		</li>
