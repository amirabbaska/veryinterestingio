			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to see a show about evolution where each episode tracks a single species (or even a broader category) evolution like you just did. I’d even put up with cheap quality CGI reenactments of prehistoric animals because I think the science would be really interesting. The show could talk about how and why each transition could have taken place, what was going on in the animal kingdom at the time to make it happen, etc. I think that’d be mad cool.</p>
<p>Update: looks like I’m going to be reading Ancestors Tale!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA" target="_blank">PBS Eons</a> on YouTube and it has quite a few episodes on how this or that animal evolved. </p></div>		</li>

<Shakes fist> Damn you /u/Pixuli you just cost me two hours watching different videos on that channel.

			<div class="markdown"><p>BBCs Walking with Monsters does a half decent job at showing a visual representation of the progression of evolving species. CGI isn't even that bad, and you have the beautiful voice of Kenneth Branagh narrating.</p>
<p>Either that or episode 2 of COSMOS: A Spacetime Odyssey, which has similar themes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other great thing about <em>Walking with Monsters</em> is that every episode tells the story of some plucky prehistoric fish or reptile or hominid trying to survive in the harsh environment of that era. Since this is a British show rather than an American show, it has an unhappy ending: the animal gets eaten, or starves to death, or suffocates from toxic fumes.</p></div>		</li>

<p><del>This is an example of convergent evolution, so it's not the the same &quot;lungs&quot; as land-dwellers had, but they are most definitely lungs. They breathe through their nostrils.</del></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not an example of convergent evolution as our ancestors and the lungfish ancestors had the same lungs.  An example of convergent evolution is when two species separately arrive at the same structure.  For example, bat wings and bird wings evolved separately but they do the same thing.</p>
<p>Structures that are the result of convergent evolution are  analogous structures or homoplasies.  Structures with a common origin are homologous structures.</p>
<p>Putting this here from my reply below:</p>
<p><a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/fishtree_09" target="_blank">https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/fishtree_09</a>. Humans are tetrapods: we are 4 limbed vertebrates. We share a more recent common ancestor with the coelacanth and lungfish than we do with ray finned fish. </p>
<p>&quot; In the lobefins, lungs stuck around, and tetrapods, coelacanths, and (duh) lungfish, all inherited them and use them to obtain oxygen. Coelacanths and lungfish also retained their gills. Modern tetrapods, on the other hand, bear evidence indicating that we once had gills but that these were lost in the course of our early evolution. The ray-finned fishes retained gills, and some of them (e.g., the bichirs, BYK-heerz) also retained lungs for the long haul. But in the lineage that wound up spawning most ray-fins (and in at least one other lineage), lungs evolved into the swimbladder — a gas-filled organ that helps the fish control its buoyancy. &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mh, the ancestors of whales are weird folk. They have the same ancestors as modern deer, so their earliest ancestors were deer-like. An in-between version ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakicetus" target="_blank">Pakicetus</a> ) looked like a deer with wolf teeth and probably hunted, so that's were your &quot;wolf-like&quot; probably comes from. </p>
<p><a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_03" target="_blank">This page</a> gives a nice overview over the evolution of whales and how we assume their early ancestors looked like. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most depictions look like crossovers between a wolf and a hippo. I think it's been shown through analyzing jaws of the ancestors that they ate small animals and retained that consumption after evolving to sea-based creatures too. They shared a lot of traits with hippo's, the lighter bone density for aquatic adaptation, where they eyes were located, the same type of thick skin. Maybe a way to envision them is like thinner hippo-wolfs that eventually leaned towards looking more like crocodiles until eventually they had fins instead. They've been depicted with fur but it's pretty likely that the body hair was sparse. Here's an article on it: <a href="http://stories.anmm.gov.au/whale-evolution/" target="_blank"><a href="http://stories.anmm.gov.au/whale-evolution/" target="_blank">http://stories.anmm.gov.au/whale-evolution/</a></a>.</p>
<p>Note that it says whale but orcas and dolphins are believed to share many of these ancestors.</p></div>		</li>
