			<div class="markdown"><p>So, is there some unwritten rule that the bad guys won't hurt the documentary makers? Sorta like how it used to be with journalists imbedding themselves in foreign wars? Of course, all bets are off now in that arena. :-(  Hang on to your head, FootageChaser. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha thanks, as far as the unwritten rule, yes for the most part that still does exist. We are supposed to be the unbiased storytellers, and storytelling is as old as humanity so something about it seems to resonate with people, even with the growing distrust for the media.</p>
<p>There are plenty of incidents where journalists and filmmakers have gotten into trouble, but that's part of the gig. War time journalists like Hemingway, Pyle and Murrow (brag time I have his award they give to journalists) were amazingly brave and dedicated storytellers who got themselves into some really hairy situations. Some days I play the part of small time storyteller, some days I whip out my &quot;big name credentials&quot; if I think it's the right call, but thankfully it's all worked out amicably so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh one more question: So why doesn't the law, assuming they're actively pursuing these bad guys, go after you for info and evidence and stuff? (I see it a lot on the reality shows and think, &quot;WTF there's footage right there of Joebob Moonshinemaker building the still in his basement,&quot; etc.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a way to do this without college degree or something. I'm &quot;in&quot; with some sketchy folks and would love to get their story out. A local member has been dropping some serious knowledge on me and I'd love to document it. I haven't graduated college yet though. Is there a chance for me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I've never seen a documentary where they're interviewing a Manson or Gacy type, except in prison. Generally they're just businesspeople who operate outside the law. They can be brutal, but not for no reason. If they invite a filmmaker for an interview it would be crazy for them to then attack the interviewer for no reason. </p>
<p>Edit: also this is the perfect situation to employ private security. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the interviewees concerned about the way the film will be edited? Journalists can slant their work many different ways regardless of what the interviewee said. Do you allow the interviewee to look at the product before it's finished? Has anyone expressed concerns like this with you before?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This concern is becoming more prevalent as more and more people commonly understand how the filmmaking and editing process works. This is what makes landing bigger interviews hard, they have to agree to let us tell their story on our terms, and no, they don't get to weigh in before it's done. They might get to see it before other people, but only once we are 100% finished and sent off for distribution/air.</p>
<p>Some filmmakers do take the subjects opinion on the film into consideration. I worked with one once who had an early screening for them, but he wasn't interested in changing how the general audience will view them, more with how they ended up viewing themselves. The crime had happened several decades ago though so it wasn't an ongoing thing. I thought that was really interesting and part of what made that Director who he was.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, any professional out to tell a story does so with as little influence as possible. Does that always happen? Realistically no, but our credibility depends on it so we take it very seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost never. The only time we actually uncovered something the law enforcement didn't already know in a case (murder show) we did turn it into them. We have a slew of lawyers who handle this stuff and review the docs before they go out to protect us legally.</p>
<p>As far as &quot;unarrested criminals&quot; Usually the law enforcement can contact these people easier than we could (usually). Sometimes we expose <strong>stories</strong> they didn't know about, but almost never do we expose <strong>hard evidence</strong> that can convict someone.</p></div>		</li>
