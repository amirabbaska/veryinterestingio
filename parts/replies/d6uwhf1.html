			<div class="markdown"><p>We have no direct way of direct measuring the magnetic field of Proxima b, but in a companion study of the habitability of Proxima b two different assumptions a
re taken: the easiest one is that the intensity of Proxima b's magnetic field is the same as Earth (~1Gauss, 1 Tesla = 10000 G), a second one agrees more with dynamo generation of mag
netic field in planets and corresponds to a field of 0.2 G. This second assumption takes into account the fact that Proxima b is likely tidally locked, meaning
that its rotation period is equal to its orbital period of 11.2d, this rather slow rotation would prevent it from generating a field as strong as the Earth.

<p>Do we know much about Proxima's solar activity (plasma and EM radiation)? Would a magnetic field that weak be able to protect life on the surface from harmful solar radiation? Approximately much more radiation would reach the surface?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know for sure that Proxima is much more active than the Sun, on average it has about the same X-ray luminosity as the Sun whereas its overall luminosity is only 0.16% that of the Sun!</p>
<p>Taking into account the fact that Proxima b orbits very close to its star, it ensues that Proxima b receives 60 times more X-ray and extreme/far UV flux than Earth. The amount reaching the surface depends on the putative atmosphere of Proxima b, which we don't know at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth's magnetic field is produced by a combination of our relatively fast rotation speed and our molten iron planet core. As it spins, it creates a magnetic field.</p>
<p>Mars doesn't have a spinning molten core and has no consistent, strong magnetic field. Jupiter spins so fast and has such a large magnetic core that its field stretches out to the orbit of Saturn.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pressure exerted by the stellar wind of Proxima (magnetic pressure + ram pressure of the flow of particles) competes with the magnetic field of the planet Proxima b to set the size of the planetary magnetosphere (ie the region in which the atmosphere is protected from erosion by the stellar wind). In the companion study (<a href="http://www.ice.cat/personal/iribas/Proxima_b/" target="_blank">http://www.ice.cat/personal/iribas/Proxima_b/</a>) we compute that in all the scenarios we consider the magnetosphere of Proxima b is much smaller than that of the Earth. The atmosphere of the planet can be completely stripped away or not depending on the initial conditions (water content of Proxima b).</p></div>		</li>
