			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.  Fission encompasses both processes (spontaneous decay ^* and chain reaction).  But u/BenjaminGamepedia said &quot;controlled fission&quot;.  The fission in an RTG just happens at its own rate; you have no control over it.  The term <em>nuclear reactor</em> technically only applies to devices with controlled chain reactions.</p>
<hr />
<p>At a more fundamental level, the isotopes in a nuclear reactor undergo fission when they capture a neutron, while the isotopes in a RTG undergo fission ^* whenever they feel like it.  So there's a pretty fundamental difference in both the amount of power produced and in the control you have over that production.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>* As u/Furious_Scientist pointed out, alpha decay is more important / common in RTGs than proper spontaneous fission.  Both processes are similar in that they are spontaneous and they transform a large nucleus into smaller nucleus / nuclei.  But alpha decay is not really considered to count as fission (it results in one smaller nucleus and radiation, rather than two smaller nuclei).</p>
<p>So while <em>technically</em> true, my comment is a bit misleading.  It would be better to simply say <strong>RTGs generate heat via alpha decay (which is not fission), while nuclear reactors generate heat via neutron-induced fission.</strong>  But it's still correct to say that alpha decay is not a controlled process while neutron-induced fission is a controlled process (hopefully).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The heat comes from regular old radioactive decay, no fissioning going on. </p>
<p>Edit: to be clear, there's a very small amount of spontaneous fission going on, but the vast majority of the heat that actually powers the thing is just plain old radioactivity. In Pu-239, there's about four instances of spontaneous fission for every trillion regular decays. So, you know, not a whole bunch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear reactors use controlled fission to generate heat which is used to heat water to steam (usually) and then running the steam through a turbine. RTGs use radiocative decay (most energy comes from alpha decay), which generates heat, which then gets converted to electricity by thermocouples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most laymen would think of a &quot;radioactive decay&quot; as a &quot;nuclear reaction&quot; and therefore anywhere where decays are happening as a &quot;reactor.&quot; </p>
<p>Really, there is nothing about a radioactive decay that could be called a &quot;<strong>RE</strong>action&quot; since it is not caused by another action.  In fact, a radioactive decay is one of the few &quot;actions&quot; I can think of that seems to be entirely spontaneous, and seemingly not due to any external chain of causality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In this instance of radioactive decay, there's a <em>very tiny</em> bit of mass that is converted to energy during the decay process. Not the whole atom, and not even a whole proton/neutron, but a very small amount of mass is converted to energy as heat, which generates the electricity necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same is true of chemical reactions! The products of gasoline combustion weigh less than the gasoline and oxygen. The Energy of a reaction comes directly from the change in mass of the chemicals involved, with bonding energies storing/releasing that energy as they are formed and broken. Of course the change in mass is immeasurably small so chemists can (pretty much) justifiably say mass is conserved. </p></div>		</li>
