			<div class="markdown"><p>The flag does have a left and a right, and the U.S. Flag Code dictates putting the blue field on the (viewer's) left.  So calling the reverse of that &quot;backwards&quot; is very reasonable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ยง175. (i) When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left. When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, I didn't say it had no left or right, I said it has no defined front or back (some flags do). That passage merely defines the norms for display, which as I mentioned derive from heraldic tradition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes you say this? They're the youngest service and kind of adhere to their own history. They're not based as much off the customs of the other branches. Fucked up? I don't think so, I'd just call it different. </p>
<p>Our blues were fucking ugly though. Let's take a business suit and put ranks on it. Maybe you're right, some of our uniforms were fucked. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The uniform design pays homage to authentic WWII era paratrooper jump suits with division patch, oversized 48-star American flag patch, player name tapes, full-color historical unit patches and an improvised camo base layer.</p>
