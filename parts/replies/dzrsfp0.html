<p>Actually, at idle and low load (cruising, for instance), the ECU/PCM monitors the output of air/fuel and tunes for a stoichiometric ratio of 14.6:1 (for gasoline).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite. It's varied over time because modern (late 80's/90's onward) catalytic converters need a mixture of lean and rich running to 'load' and 'clear' the catalyst of different exhaust components. Such converters are called &quot;three way&quot; converters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If an engine gets too hot, for instance (not enough coolant, thermostat funky, +100F temps, etc), the knock sensor will detect even the lowest pings occurring in the engine before they get bad, then pull electronic timing/advance so that the detonation events stop (due to cooler combustion temps).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Timing is altered based on engine temperature for various reasons including mixture and performance, separately from knock control; one is prevention/optimization, the other is reactionary. Knocking can have many causes, among them <em>intake air</em> which is too hot, not necessarily too hot an engine. When engines get too hot, they go into &quot;limp home&quot; mode where power is greatly reduced, at least partially as a signal to the driver that something is very wrong, but also to prevent further damage. Turbocharged engines will dial back boost and alter timing to prevent knocking, mostly as a function of charge (post turbo) air temperature, which is much hotter from being compressed (and friction from the extremely fast spinning turbine.)</p>
<p>Also, detonation is not knocking. Knocking is when combustion is triggered early, but progresses with a normal flame front/speed and thus combustion chamber temperature and pressure is normal, just not when the ECU intended via spark. Detonation is near-simultaneous burning of the fuel-air mixture, and causes extremely high pressure and temperature; it literally melts holes in things (most commonly, pistons around the gap in the rings where the superheated gasses act like a cutting torch.)</p>
<p>For anyone wondering what &quot;flame front&quot; means: gasoline is designed to burn at a particular speed when at a particular mixture ratio and pressure. Just as if you spilled some gasoline in a line on the ground and lit it on fire, it will &quot;travel&quot; at a certain speed, the fuel inside your engine's cylinders doesn't ignite all at once. It's a complex relationship between the properties of the fuel mixture and how close the molecules of fuel are to each other, to simplify a bunch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for direct injection/dual injection, it is all about making a burn cleaner. Having the injectors <em>inside</em> the combustion chamber and controlled per-cylinder is much more desirable than having the mixture of fuel/air occur outside the chamber. I honestly don't know what the benefit of having both is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Direct injection separates timing of fuel injection from air intake. This allows for a lot of tricks, and such engines have several 'modes'. For example, Audi has a mode called &quot;stratified injection.&quot; They use a flap in the intake runner to change how air flows into the cylinder. Combined with the shape of the piston head which has a special indent, and injecting fuel very late (ie when the piston is very close to the injector), they can inject a very small amount of fuel that forms a small 'pocket' of ideal-mixture air which stays together until the ideal time for ignition. This is as opposed to injecting the fuel from the intake runner, having it dispersed across the entire volume of the cylinder, and be far too lean a mixture (and either burn too hot, or not at all.) Another mode causes injection to happen during the intake stroke when there is maximum airflow/turbulence in the cylinder, thus giving the best mixing of fuel and air. It allows a large displacement engine to effectively behave as a much smaller engine (although you still have the greater friction and thermodynamic losses of the larger engine.)</p>
<p>The major downside is that many/most direct injection gasoline engines suffer from build-up in the intake system, and the only way to 'fix' it is a very labor-intensive manual cleaning; chemical treatments sorta work but not that well. It's exactly like arterial plaque, clogging things up; causes performance loss, poor mileage, etc. But it only starts to really manifest itself in symptoms around 30,000 miles - several years into ownership, so most people don't notice, or if they're leasing, they don't care. It's also right around when some warranties run out. And the &quot;nice&quot; benefit for car companies is that someone goes car shopping and test drives a new car which doesn't have the buildup but may have the same HP/torque numbers, and it feels much faster...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Knocking is a descriptive term for severe detonation as far as aftermarket tuning is concerned anyway. I have read that detonation melts things because it disturbs the thin insulating layer of air that normally &quot;sticks&quot; to things like the piston and so the crown of the piston starts to absorb a lot more of the heat of combustion and it can soften then blow holes in them. Much more common symptoms are cracked ring lands from the impact of detonation on cast pistons. </p></div>		</li>
