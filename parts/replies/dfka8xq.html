			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately yes. Ad earnings aren't too great and it's getting worse as time goes on. This is why many YouTubers post videos longer than 10 minutes so they can put midroll ads in, to increase the ratio of monetized views to video views. Many YouTubers open patreon pages or merch shops, stream on twitch, etc. and it works out relatively well. It's really not too bad.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that CPM increases as we get closer to the holiday season. In November you can expect a video with 100k views to earn more around $250.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a lot of Youtuber's take Sponsorship's as well. (The big sponsors being Lootcrate, Audible, etc.) If you've ever taken a Sponsor before, how does the pay for that hold up to ad revenue?</p>
<p>Something I've also seen thrown around recently is that likes, shares and comments effect how much a Youtuber will earn. Is this true, false or a negligible amount?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YouTube puts better paying ads and gives higher priority to videos that are watched more, they track this by minutes watched.</p>
<p>When ranking which of your videos are doing best they ranked them by which ones have actually been watched the most. </p>
<p>They switched to this when people were spamming videos with bots or would just go to a video and click back instantly to add to the view count. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't heard of minutes watched affecting CPM. I've personally increased my minutes watched per video by roughly 20% but CPMs have been roughly the same. The game changer for me was targeting high bid and competitive keywords more often to increase CPM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm - just had a video get more than half a million views in a week and ad rev was just over $500 - brutal.  Thankfully I have sponsors and crowd funding via Patreon to cover costs or I'd have hung it up a long time ago... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: is CPM what the advertisers are paying YouTube or the money you get from YouTube? (basically are you making $6.09 from each thousand monetized views or you only making 55% of that $6.09 since YouTube takes out 45%)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, yes. CPM is what the advertisers are paying. This is sort of implied in step 3, where the monetized views and CPM are combined and YouTube's cut is taken out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So at minimum you've made $45,000 off those monetizable views. Accounting for November and December pay spikes, you probably easily cleared over $60,000.</p>
<p>Now my question, assuming the above is basically correct, is how that income is actually calculated throughout the year? Is that $60k just from this year? Last year? Total?</p>
<p>To clarify: Is $60k all you've ever made combined, total, from all those views since you started your channel? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're spot on. Lifetime earnings are $59,480.62. Nice work! That is everything since the beginning of my channel to today, over 4 years. It's technically an average of 15k or so a year, which is quite terrible, though a considerable chunk of the lifetime total <a href="https://imgur.com/a/0CLkn" target="_blank">was from the past 365 days.</a> A moderately livable income.</p></div>		</li>
