<p>I think this is more saying that they don't think it's a classical aurora, that is that it's not excited by particle precipitation directly.  Certainly, many/most phenomenon in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere are driven by solar wind energy inputs, but I think the discrepancy in the article here is largely just semantics (which are important!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100km is a pretty low line to draw for 'where auroras are'. The 557nm green oxygen emissions - the brightest one - peak at around 110-120km, and when we do 2 dimensional analysis of green aurora we generally assume the auroras are at 110-120km. The 630nm red oxygen emissions don't even start to dominate until 150+km, peaking around 200-250km, and these red emissions would be the relevant emissions for a reddish phenomenon like 'steve'. Aurora below 85-90km is nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Fun fact: The atomic transitions leading to the 557 and 630nm emissions are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_mechanism" target="_blank">forbidden transitions</a> and actually <em>require</em> a thin enough atmosphere that collisions are rare. For 557nm, the excited oxygen atom must remain in its excited state for about 2 seconds without colliding with anything and losing its energy. For 630nm, the excited oxygen atom takes about 2 <em>minutes</em> to emit light, and has to be in a thin enough atmosphere that no collisions are likely to occur in that time period.</p>
<p>Edit: Well since I was almost immediately downvoted for this, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pxXoZ38.png" target="_blank">here's a figure I made a few years ago</a> when I was working on this problem of auroral altitudes, that shows the emission profile for auroras of various characteristic energies. This is for 428nm emissions, which we use because it's a 'prompt' emission rather than a forbidden transition, so it's better for timing purposes. 428nm occurs at roughly the same altitudes as the 557nm, except it can extend a few km lower because it doesn't have to worry about collisions in the same way as 557nm. You can see that although the peak emissions are around 110km, the profile has a long 'upwards' tail and a sharply truncated 'downwards' tail, leading to the bulk of the emissions being above 110km. 557nm - the bright green that is most easily visually observed - has a sharper lower border cutoff, ending at around 95km.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude or lady I am impressed. Very few people understand Aurora activities. Coupled with the knowledge of energy levels AND density. If you don't mind me asking, is this a hobby of yours or dedicated field of study? I am fascinated by the energy interactions between solar energy and planets. My background is nuclear power it was all eV and fuel-moderator density. So many parallels I see in other fields, but I'm looking at it through my field of limited understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blueish color makes me think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation" target="_blank">Cherenkov radiation</a>.  Also if the particles are moving at large fractions of the speed of light it makes since for it to be a &quot;straight&quot; line.  However I don't think the typical energy out put of Cherenkov radiation can be as bright as descried.  A photographer said it was easer to capture 'Steve' on camera than the aurora.  I also think it would be difficult to produce Cherenkov radiation in very thin atmosphere. </p>
