<p>Conclusion: if someone is high and their pupils are dilated, it could be one of many, many things. But if they have pinpoint pupils, it's opioids almost for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really cool! I definitely believe it too - when you try on someone else's glasses for the first time (with a different prescription than your own), you will probably find that you can control the &quot;blurriness&quot; to sharpen the image...allowing your eyes to adapt to this new medium the longer you are exposed to it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's exactly the same. If you increase the amount of light, your eyes close their pupils in stronger light. The narrowed aperture gives greater depth of field, making it easier to focus. Strong light may also allow you to focus on something that might be outside your focal range in dim light (e.g. model/serial numbers behind electrical equipment).</p></div>		</li>
