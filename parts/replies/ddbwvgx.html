			<div class="markdown"><p>Your very article says that the patient wasn't starved, Doctors gave him all vitamins and minerals he needed to live, which are normally obtained from eating.</p>
<p>That is an important distinction.</p>
<p>So yes, overweight people can starve to death before they become skinny, because not eating deprives them important vitamins and minerals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Starved of nutrients, not of calories.  </p>
<p>I guess it comes down to the basic, starved of _____  </p>
<p>Skinny dead people most likely starved to death from both nutrients and calories.<br />
Fat dead people most likely starved to death from organ failure due to a missing nutrient or vitamin.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does  not say however those vitamins were actually necessary.</p>
<p>Your fat cells actually store vitamins.</p>
<p>A yway most people would say eating nothing except a vitamin counts as fasting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this. So why isn't it done more ofte? This was 1965, and I imagine finding a doctor to supervise today is a bit easier than complicated surgery. </p>
<p>Also, was he feeling hungry those 382 days? You know, that feeling of wanting to eat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is done more and more.</p>
<p>The food industry ...especially sugar.. pays doctors and researchers to suppress this successful weigjtloss technique and of course so does the &quot;fitness&quot; exercise industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glycogen should not be described as 'a bunch of glucose molecules loosely stuck together.' They are covalently bound together in neat smoothly branched structures. So they're very ordered, and also strongly bound. It requires an enzyme to build and remove glucose molecules from glycogen, and some serious diseases lead to abnormalities of those enzymes. Including von Gierke's disease, Pompe's disease, Forbes-Cori disease, Hers' disease, and more. </p></div>		</li>
