			<div class="markdown"><p>Wonder if career is going to be the next thing to do this? Some people are lucky to just survive financially if that. But in some circles the whole idea of a job is to &quot;follow your passion&quot; as if you just do that and everything else will line up perfectly. If you are in it for the money, or forgo what you &quot;truly love&quot; to pursue something that makes more financial sense, it's as if you have sold out or settled for a life less lived.</p>
<p>The whole shift in how some view work, reminds me a bit of the shift in how marriage is viewed. Formerly it was a means of insuring support, but now marriage has become more about where people look for passion and personal fulfillment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel this way! (33f) Like, I have interests but not really hobbies or passions. And I don't really have interests that can make a career. I enjoy certain things and activities , but they aren't things I can't live without. Sometimes I think it could be mild depression, but it comes and goes and it doesn't really affect my daily life, so I don't think treatment is necessary . </p>
<p>I look at it this way: am I happy? Are those around me happy and am I fulfilling my duties as a spouse/daughter/sister/co worker/etc? Are my material needs being met? Are my emotional needs being met? If I can assure that all these areas of my life are acceptable, it really doesn't matter if I have a passion or if I'm finding my grand purpose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, and I'm not sure what age group you fall in, judging from many people I've encountered age 21-35, you sound pretty normal. More often than not I feel like a weirdo for being the opposite, having known what I wanted to do since I was young and actually pursuing it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Love is something most people need to nurture and grow. It's a fire, but for many people it starts as a mere spark - it needs the ground to be prepped, a warm bed to nestle in and warm, and then to be fed and protected from being snuffed until it grows strong.</p>
<p>Once it grows strong, it spreads and grows and fuels itself with little caretaking, and for some people they can skip all that hard work because it starts with the equivalent of a lightning strike.</p>
<p>But for the rest of us &quot;love&quot; isn't generally something that happens in a moment, it's something that is built over time by thinking about and approaching things in the right way.</p>
<p>Or at least that's how I feel about the things I love the most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting idea. For sure, it would be impractical to pursue a career of passion if the individual's current job is just enough to meet basic needs. Of course, considering goal frustration, it's quite feasible to see how those in that position come to feel disenfranchised and end up falling for politicians who promise them better jobs, better wages, i.e. a step up to the next level. Just a note, this isn't a dig at Trump in particular as most politicians look to take advantage of this need.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed in the workplace is, that with technology, more opportunities seem to exist to do more fulfilling work outside of the regular job. A few examples I've personally witnessed are one guy who DJs on the side, another guy who does butchering of game, another guy helps his wife with some kind of online selling thing like an Etsy type business, and one guy writes and self publishes. I do some writing and computer repair on the side. We all work in the automotive business, but when the day is done, we have other things that we find rewarding. 20 years ago, when I started working professionally, it just wasn't like that. Everybody worked and went home, and that was that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the keys to Maslow's is that the &quot;higher&quot; needs are not as stable. Feelings of belongingness, self-esteem, and self-actualization can fluctuate more than need for food, etc. This is because higher needs are more subject to individual personality and cultural context (e.g. age).  </p>
<p>So while people might strive for having high self-esteem, they can also strive to make self-esteem more stable. Different types of partners/ relationship solutions would be better for each of these. One could make similar arguments about self-actualization. </p>
<p>Ultimately though, I most people would say it is unlikely that someone has high, stable self-actualization. Others would probably see that person as manic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Limiting it to marriage is wrong in my opinion. My parents have been together for 25+ years. </p>
<p>Technically they are engaged but they are not yet married. </p>
<p>In my opinion being married these days is more about the legal or religious/tradition side of things than the love side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, although the original comment above me was the reasons people people get together throughout history, which, due to history being a little less liberal, meant getting married. That is why my question was phrased that way, and truly I was asking about partnership in general rather than strictly marriage. I'd still be interested in knowing the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a gay man, marriage is crucial for several reasons. Straight people, even not married, had/have far more rights when it comes to their partners and estates than gays. So, no, it shouldn't be about being married, but it can mean the difference between seeing your partner in the hospital on their deathbed and protecting the home (and family) you built together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your parents have lived together for all that time, many countries, including the US, would consider your parents to have a &quot;common law marriage.&quot; Which basically means any Court would recognize their relationship as a marriage, even without the actual paperwork being filed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why couldn't it be that this theory is correct up until the 1950's and then start to break down.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense that people would get married hundreds of yeas ago for simple material need, and then started to marry for social position (when possible due to a satisfaction of material need), and then eventually started to marry for love as those first two were satisfied.  </p>
<p>But it could well be the case that while those broad strokes were true, people still married for love (or self-esteem) in the 1400's, and people still marry for shelter and food today, but the trendline is still on marriage for love today (though we can see the median starting to shift with more people marrying for self-esteem than in past).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whether it was typical in reality or not, the concept of marrying for love absolutely existed in the middle ages. Romances were a popular literary genre, most noteworthy being Lancelot and Guinevere, and Tristan and Isolde. Beyond that there are plenty of poems about midnight rendezvous at all social levels, and the letters of Abelard and Heloise are well known also.</p>
<p>Marriage for love actually seems to have been more common among the lower classes for the simple reason that people didn't have enough to make land or wealth significant deciding factors in choosing a partner.</p>
<p>So yes, I think there's absolutely merit to the theory in the broad strokes sense but of course there are and always have been exceptions.</p></div>		</li>
