Furthermore, unnecessary antibacterial agents just promote resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like a good thread to post this. Just in case people were unaware, basically all antibacterial soaps will be considered misbranded or new drugs and will require new drug applications starting in September 2017. Anyone selling them will be subject to enforcement by the FDA. This was discussed in the federal register final rule September 2016 issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd use normal soap and be thorough. Maybe a brush of some kind too. I'd probably then go over with TCP.<br />
All the evidence says that biocides do not make soap any more effective.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soap is a surfactant which acts as a super slick medium that gets between the bacteria/dirt/grime and whatever it sticks to (your skin). One side of soap molecules sticks to the oily dirt and grime and the other attaches to a water molecule. That's what makes it easy for water to wash it off of you. It doesn't kill anything, just removes it from a zone where it can be harmful to you.</p></div>		</li>
