			<div class="markdown"><p>This is, IMO, the reason bodyweight and freeweight exercises methodologies (ie CrossFit, P90X) provide a much more natural athletic physique than gym rat routines using excessive weights on machines. The more stability muscle groups you engage, the more you developed the well rounded strengths </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. A healthy mix (mostly freeweights) will provide the <em>sculpting</em> aesthetic you want to achieve. Total body workouts using free weights and calisthenics will make you strong and toned, but maybe you want those sick tricep lines, or extra bulge to your bicep, or maybe you wanna be yoked like an ox? That's where machines come in. Give extra boosts to major areas with the isolated machines to make them pop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I am mainly interested in training my lower back muscles, to alleviate the constant incomfort ( &lt; pain generally, but some days are weird :) ) I feel. What machines would you recommend? Our city has some open air fitness machines, will try and find a pic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with bodyweight exercises is they are difficult and eventually impossible to progressively overload, which is the main driver of muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p>At some point, and it may not be that far in for some people where you cant physically add anymore weight to bodyweight style movements.</p>
<p>And I wouldnt say most true gym rats arent using machines, they'll focus their training around heavy compound lifts. Which are the best way to build size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the exercise. </p>
<p>For instance an Overhead Press with cables can be just as good as a barbell press because you still very much have to stabilise the otherwise shaky cables. On the other hand - a barbell overhead press is doable with more overall load. </p>
<p>However something like the row is the same as the answer above. Cable row involved less overall muscle groups than a standing back row. </p>
<p>Cables are great for another reason - depending on the exercise they provide a better, more continuous load and time under tension</p></div>		</li>
