			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some background that might be worth giving though.</p>
<p>Food manufacturers have stringent policies that are supposed to stop cross contamination.  Typically this includes things like obvious and colour-coded labels on sacks/drums/pallets of ingredients indicating what allergens they contain.  Scoops, buckets, etc, used for handling ingredients will be similarly coded and can only be used for the ingredient they're coded for, never anything else.  Ingredients are barcoded and batch numbered and this data is normally entered into a computer system which will throw a warning if the wrong ingredient is about to be added.  At the very least, there will be documentation of what ingredients were added to enable tracking individual ingredients right through to their final products and where they were distributed to (this is how they know which stores and which areas to target when recalling a product).</p>
<p>Beyond that, there's careful arrangement of ingredients in storage so that no allergen ingredient can fall onto a non-allergen ingredient.  For example, peanuts or anything containing peanuts will only ever be stored on the lowest shelf or above other items that contain peanuts.  When you consider that ingredients may contain multiple allergens, this can get quite complicated very quickly.  </p>
<p>Samples are regularly taken off production lines for allergen and other testing to ensure that cross contamination or bacterial contamination hasn't occurred.  </p>
<p>Between batches of different lines, the pipe work, mixing/storage tanks, and such are flushed clean (normally known as CIP - <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=clean+in+place+food+industry" target="_blank">clean in place</a> sanitisation).  The main reason for this is to prevent build up of food in the piping that may lead to bacteria growth but it also stops allergens present in a previous batch from getting into the next.</p>
<p>Violating these rules (or others, like <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/CGMP/" target="_blank">GMP</a>) can result in an entire batch in production being trashed and the employee(s) responsible looking for new jobs.  It's taken seriously.  </p>
<p>In the (almost) worst case scenario, if product gets out to distribution and is identified in later testing as containing an unmarked allergen, the entire batch will be recalled.  </p>
<p>The 'may contain X' warning is ass covering for the absolute worst case scenario, when all these things fail and nobody notices until somebody ends up in the hospital or dead.  And in that case, it's not gonna help them - the company is still gonna get sued (and will often end up settling the case to keep it out of court).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't just cover your arse stuff, although probably the primary motivation.  People with known severe allergies actually pay attention to those labels.  They avoid the allergen as if their life depends on it because it does.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sued for... what, exactly? For the product containing something it specifically said it might contain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some good stuff here, but just want to mention that every place doesn't do everything you list. Size of production has a lot to do with it. I've literally never tested a product for allergen contamination, but I've also always worked for small or very small establishments.</p>
<p>(Also, thanks to you I finally learned what &quot;CIP&quot; stands for. Been wondering. Thanks.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is the general FDA regulations on this kind of cross contamination? Like do they have to thoroughly wash the equipment between uses or do they just kind of make one thing after another? I ask because I am gluten sensitive but not severely so I stay away from anything with gluten-containing ingredients but I'm not strict about things that &quot;may contain traces of gluten.&quot; Should the &quot;may contain traces of <em>&quot; be interpreted as &quot;almost definitely contains traces of </em>&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different companies, different methods of production. Larger companies usually have seperate lines of production for their various products, this means that the cross contamination is a small possibility but still a risk.
With smaller companies who use the same lines of production for for example different flavours, have to implement special procedures for this.
So to answer your question, risk of the product containing gluten for example is usually small, but there is a possibility. You should interpret it as &quot; it probably doesnt contain traces of _&quot; Of course this varies per company/product/allergen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think if &quot;may&quot; is used then gluten is not present in any of the ingredients.</p>
<p>&quot;May&quot; indicates CYA, so your gluten intolerant ass should be fine. :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The FDA says that if it's on the label it's not cross contamination. That's why they put it on there, if someone finds a peanut in their almonds chocolate bar because a peanut spilled into the almond bag it's ok.</p>
<p>The bigger companies know that people with allergies won't eat those may contain things so if they can afford it they'll often use different factories entirely. They'll have a peanut containing factory and a factory that doesn't have peanuts. Then the no peanut factory gets a policy that no peanuts are allowed in the building ever. Doing it this way the person who makes Hershey's bars never touches a peanut at work. They might do kisses and kitkats though. The employee who makes Reese's might work on Reese's bites and peanut M&amp;Ms. Hershey has enough volume to split their products up by allergens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about when I buy gasoline at Chevron and it says &quot;May contain up to 10% ethanol&quot;.</p>
<p>10% is a LOT - that can't be from cross-contamination.  I find it odd that they can't just state how much ethanol is in it  And the phrase &quot;may contain&quot; suggests that it may not contain any. Seems like poor quality control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely because they buy from different sources with varying amounts of ethanol. They're not going to update signage with each delivery, so they just set a max.</p></div>		</li>
