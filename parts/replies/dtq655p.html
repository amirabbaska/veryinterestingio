			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually when objects cool down they do not emit visible light at all, because of the quantization of energy. </p>
<p>The energy of a photon depends on its frequency. So because you can't divide the energy in infinitely small parts, you are also limited in the amount of wavelengths you can emit.</p>
<p>This was actually a big mystery in science, because before quantum mechanics it was believed that any body should instantly lose all of its energy by emitting high frequency radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're <em>partly</em> right. Light emitted by electrons in ordinary matter is indeed quantized, because electrons can only exist in discrete states. But <em>light itself</em> is not actually quantized. A single photon can have any energy you want it to have. All you have to do is move either toward or away from the source of the light at the right speed, and you can make the light have any energy you want.</p>
<p>Put another way, E = hν, yes, but ν is not confined to being an integer. It can be any number.</p></div>		</li>

But light itself <em>is</em> actually quantized. It's not the energy of a photon that is quantized, like the energy of electrons in atoms are quantized into levels, but the light energy is quantized into photons. That's what was shown with the photoelectric effect.  </p></div>		</li>
