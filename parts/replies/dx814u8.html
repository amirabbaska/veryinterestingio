			<div class="markdown"><p>Most towns will have a part where there are lots of furniture/home goods/mattress stores.` They may have a mattress row, of a street with 5-6 different stores within a few blocks. If you want to take the time, educate yourself on brands and features (memory/visco foam, latex foam, coil count, coil type of either bonnell or pocketed, or coil less like solid foam, air or water mattresses) then make the stores cut each other's throats to earn your business. Take a day and visit each one, wear down the sales guy, fight tooth and claw for extras like free delivery, bedframes, pillows, mattress pads, whatever.  If you have more patience than the sales folks, they'll eventually cut their own throats to make you go away.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly you can go on Amazon and get quality beds. I bought a memory foam queen mattress online for $300 shipped. I worked as a delivery driver for a mattress company for 2 years, and I can verify that this mattress is on par with the quality of our supposed &quot;$2000&quot; memory foam mattresses. Mark ups are INSANE. My boss would spend around 2k for a delivery from the manufacturer, which would contain something like 6-8 full beds (mattress, boxspring, frame). Each of these would sell for between 1k and 4k with delivery, varying only somewhat in quality. Only the really low end &quot;discount&quot; beds were noticeably less comfortable. The one I picked up online stands up to many of the luxury beds I've worked with, its the best mattress I've ever slept on. 10/10 would buy a bed from Amazon any day and probably from here on out.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is going to sound bad but as-is deals from retailers or 3rd party sellers are probably the best bets, the only downside is no 20 year warranty, which is why most beds are marked up so high. And honestly a lot of the online exclusive beds similar to something like the Purple Mattress are really hurting retail bed stores, so I say more power to them. I think average mark up at a bed store is around 1000% to 1500% from what they pay the manufacturers. If you do buy retail, I would say go with the higher end beds at Sam's Club or Big Lots, the mark-up is much lower for essentially the same mattress, the cheaper sets are cheaper for a reason. General rule of thumb that I go by, if you can feel the springs by running your hand along the sides, don't buy it.</p>
<p>Edit since people don't believe the mark up: $300 for a $4500 retail bed is 1500% and yeah, it is insane.</p></div>		</li>
