			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, memory works by association. If I say &quot;what color is an apple,&quot; many people will say red before they even conjure the image of an apple in their head. This is because the concept of apple has been strongly linked to the concept of red—likely due to childhood learning. This kind of information is directly linked and so easy to access. </p>
<p>On the other hand if I ask you want you had for dinner 3 nights ago, things get a little more tricky. Likely you'll have to think &quot;what day was 3 nights ago? Tuesday, so I had come home from work and all I could find in the fridge was... ah&quot; and then you remember. That took a few &quot;hops&quot; between associated concepts to access the memory. The more obscure the memory, the more associative hops it takes and the longer it takes to remember. Sometimes the links are broken entirely and you fail to remember at all.</p>
<p>When trying to remember something less episodic such as an actors name, we often don't seem to be thinking at all. In fact, the name may come to us minutes or hours later. What's going on is your brain is subconsciously exploring related pathways from different angles, trying to locate the information. Once the information is found the pathway is reinforced and it should be a little quicker to remember next time, assuming you are coming at the question from the same angle. </p>
<p>This is also why it is easy to get stuck on word puzzles. If your brain goes looking for information down the wrong meaning, it may take a long time to switch tact if you don't consciously intervene.</p>

<p>Could you explain what this looks like on a chemical/cellular level? How can cells that can't move around &quot;explore?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means that other pathways are triggered. It is not that every cell in the brain is firing - that would rather result in epilepsy.</p>
<p>You can think of it as the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory" target="_blank">central executive</a>' which distributes attention for memory directs its focus to different &quot;memory areas&quot; to &quot;search&quot; in different pathways for the stored information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pathways that I describe are connections between neurons, or more holistically, connections between groups of related neurons. These are traversed by running electrical signals along the neuron until it reaches a connection with another neuron called a synapse. In most cases this is a chemical synapse which releases neurotransmitters that bind to the receiving side of the connection and induce a voltage in the receiving neuron. There's a bit of complicated electro-chemical machinery that goes on here to decide whether the receiving neuron should then fire based on its inputs, including signals from other neurons. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7jv0dj/what_is_happening_in_the_brain_when_you_are/drahu0a/" target="_blank">chzyken's answer</a> for a more detailed explanation. </p>
<p>When we talk about exploring, we mean the brain is firing signals down related pathways, probing for the related links it expects to be there. For example, if someone says the name &quot;Harrison Ford&quot; I immediately remember what he looks like and the movies he is in. If someone on the other hand says &quot;who played Han Solo in Star Wars?&quot; I have to search for the name. Once I find it, I also find all the links to Star Wars and his face, and the other movies he starred in, confirming the end of the search. The brain will traverse the strongest links first, which can lead to the &quot;getting stuck&quot; that I mentioned.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is  great question; it doesn't. The other day I was trying to remember the name of a comedian on QI. I knew his first name was Bill, and because I had recently seen a lot of people talking about Bill Burr, I came to the conclusion that his name was Bill Burr. It was of course, Bill Bailey not Bill Burr. The thing is, I knew nothing about Bill Burr other than he was a comedian. I didn't even know what he looked like. My brain took the strongest route from &quot;Bill&quot; that satisfied the criteria &quot;Comedian.&quot; Because I knew nothing about Bill burr, there was no contradicting information, and so my brain decided it was what I was looking for and went no further.</p>
<p>Your brain decides if it is correct by checking the answer against the search criteria. If my brain had have reached Bill Bailey before Bill Burr, it would have then found all the links to what I know Bill Bailey looks like and his voice and manner and so on, confirming with greater certainty that the answer is correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With short term memory, especially involving the minutiae of everyday life, does the brain just reset those areas after a certain period of time? It would seem inefficient to try and store everything we process in our lives for any length of time. For that matter, is there a cranial terabyte maximum that we can allocate for storing information?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To also add to this, look into the roles of AP5 and glutamate at the level of the NMDA receptors. AP5 is an NMDA receptor antagonist and competes with glutamate at the NMDA receptor. When AP5 is injected into rats, it impairs the memory process. When glutamate is injected, it enhances the memory and learning processes. Just an interesting tidbit.</p></div>		</li>
