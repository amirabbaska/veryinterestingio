			<p>I've been meaning to get this checked out but I don't know who to see or how to describe it. Maybe you could help. This doesn't happen with food, but rather when I swallow my own saliva, sometimes it &quot;goes down the wrong pipe&quot; and I start a coughing fit and can't talk properly for 5 minutes. It's annoying as hell, and it sometimes happens at inconvenient times, like when I have to speak to a group or when I'm in a quiet situation where a coughing fit means I need to excuse myself. And once it's down the wrong pipe, trying to suppress it just makes it worse. <br>Is that aspiration, is it a common occurrence, and who do I see? An ENT?</p>		</li>

			<p>You can definitely aspirate on your own saliva. Some people tend to have more difficulty with secretion management. An ENT is the perfect place to start!</p>		</li>
