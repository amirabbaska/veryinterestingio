<p>The extinction coefficient varies with colors (wavelength) with the blues penetrating the deepest to a few hundred meters.</p>

<p>I must add for science that <em>this</em> is why water is blue.  It is blue because by definition, it absorbs other colors more and blue least.  A glass of water may not appear to have any color, but that is because the rate of absorption of other colors is low enough that the water is <em>pale</em> blue, unless there is a great amount/distance to look at/through it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The general sentiment is right but &quot;by definition&quot; doesn't seem to make any sense there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blue color in the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering, not absorbance/reflection.  More air = more scattering, hence why the sky gets darker at higher altitudes, and why a bluer sky may actually mean there is <em>less</em> water overhead.  More water in the air increases the scattering very substantially, making the sky actually <em>paler</em>.  The amount of light that actually would gain a blue tint due to the water content is not as significant because of the water being vapor (this is my best guesstimate since I don't know the total water content in very humid air, but I also understand that very humid air would also have more scattering).  You need a large quantity of liquid water to observe the substantial blue tint, so vapor would not have the same effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By definition of absorbance and reflection. Light that is not absorbed through a medium is reflected back. When you look at a leaf, it isn't green just because it's green; it's green because the cholorophyll in plants absorb the red and blue spectrum of light, but sucks at absorbing the green spectrum so that gets reflected back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of the people responding to you seem to understand how definitions work. Including the guy that claims to teach chemistry. I think he just thinks adding &quot;by definition&quot; is a way to sound smarter.</p>
<p>Water is not blue <em>by definition</em>. We cannot define the spectra that water reflects/absorbs. We <em>can</em> define what the word &quot;blue&quot; means, but the word &quot;blue&quot; is <em>not</em> defined to mean &quot;the color of water&quot;.</p>
<p>And the people suggesting that it's the definition of &quot;reflection&quot; and &quot;absorption&quot; seem to be even more confused about how words work. A physical process is not a definition. It exists independent of words or whether there is any life to use language. Definitions don't contain information about the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason is due to the increase of productivity in coastal waters associated with increased total suspended solids, dissolved particulates, nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, among more. There are also rivers/streams running off into the coast, creating estuaries which are quite dynamic.</p>
<p>Light attenuates faster in areas with lots of particles in them. If you've ever seen a lake in Florida (lots of green, lots of plants, nutrient-rich) and compared it with a lake in Minnesota (very blue, not many plants, nutrient-poor), you'll see the how different trophic states (that is productivity levels) cause differences in visibility.</p>
<p>Back to coastlines: Western coasts of continents in the Northern Hemisphere have tremendous upwelling due to the Coriolis effect (which is a rightward deflection as an object travels long distances; this includes wind currents and ocean currents, as well as ships, rockets, and planes). Inversely, objects in the Southern Hemisphere deflect left. Downwelling occurs on the East coast in the Northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Upwelling is when the coastal water on the surface moves away from shore (via Ekman transport) and is replaced by cooler water from the deep. The cool, deep water carries a lot of nutrients (first, because things fall down there, and second because colder water holds dissolved oxygen and many other molecules better than warmer water). So coastal upwelling zones are quite dynamic ecotones, and as such, they carry a lot of nutrients which increases ecosystem production.</p>
<p>Downwelling is when the coastal water on the surfaces moves toward shore (via Ekman transport), and the warm water along the coast is forced downward into cooler deep waters. This is not as productive for the coastal waters, but still causes the coasts to shift in productivity quite a bit. Compare the beaches of California to North Carolina. California is cold, but dynamic and filled with tidal pools and kelp forests and reefs. North Carolina is warmer, sandier, and clearer. While not the only reason (that has to due with larger Coriolis effects of the rotating Earth), a big reason is the difference in upwelling (in California) v. downwelling (in North Carolina).</p></div>		</li>

<p>YOu can see that optical light actually penetrates the most of all the electomagnetic spectrum, but even the best still means intensity is devided by e every 50 meters.</p>
<p>Mariana tranch means e^-(10994/50) =10^-96 ,well yeah. You could have a supernova and no light would end up down there until the water is evaporated.</p></div>		</li>
