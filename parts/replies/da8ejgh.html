			<div class="markdown"><p>This is crucial to understand the issue. There is a crap load of oil left, but it is just not worth going for. Similar as to gold, as our oceans are full of gold but the concentrations are simply too low to make it financially viable to extract it. Renewable sources are already getting close to the breaking point when it comes to competing with fossil fuels in terms of stationary energy (primarily electricity). However, the main challenge is how to store this energy efficiently. Biofuels are semi-viable options, but most sources of biofuel still require large amounts of energy to grow and compete with food (as has been stated by others here). Hydrogen gas and fuel cells is another option, but you have losses in conversion. Thus, a mix of sources will be the future, where we probably will see a much more decentralised energy sources. This will overall be good, as it builds resilience both in terms of reliability and price, but also makes us less dependent upon oil producing countries and avoids losses in electricity grids (can be up to 20% in some countries). I really look forward to this future...</p></div>		</li>

<p>We (metallurgists) can extract desired metal from almost any ore source, it is just the economics that limits us - the moment when it is just to costly to rafine metal from poor or on the other hand hard to mine or hard to work with ore sources.</p>
<p>This is reason why Ti did not yet replaced steel and it will not for long: there are enourmous quantities of it (Ti is very common in Earth crust by weight), but the processes to convert it into metal are energy hungry, toxic - expensive. With good steels and Al/Mg alloys we can achive much of desired properties with way less expense.</p>
<p>Exceptions IMHO are perhaps only U235 &amp; Pu239 : they are of such </p></div>		</li>
