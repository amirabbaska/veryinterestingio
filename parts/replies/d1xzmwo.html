<p>Right now the top answer is just a rephrasing of the question, which is kind of sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try taking something like a buzzer (my teacher used one from a &quot;Taboo&quot; game) and try to play iconic songs on it so people can guess what they are. It's surprisingly hard. He was doing Christmas songs too, so they're really simple and there's not that many to choose from.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My first wife, who was a musician, would tap song rhythms on my back as we lay in bed before dozing off, and she would rarely stump me.</p></div>		</li>
