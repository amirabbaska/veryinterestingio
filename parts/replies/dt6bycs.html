<p>Kerim Kerimov, chair of the State Commission, recalled: &quot;Outwardly, there was no damage whatsoever. They knocked on the side, but there was no response from within. On opening the hatch, they found all three men in their couches, motionless, with dark-blue patches on their faces and trails of blood from their noses and ears. They removed them from the descent module. Dobrovolsky was still warm. The doctors gave artificial respiration. Based on their reports, the cause of death was suffocation.&quot;[15]</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that they had asphyxiated. The fault was traced to a breathing ventilation valve, located between the orbital module and the descent module, that had been jolted open as the descent module separated from the service module, 12m 3s after retrofire.[16][17] The two were held together by explosive bolts designed to fire sequentially; in fact, they had fired simultaneously.[16] The explosive force of the simultaneous bolt firing caused the internal mechanism of the pressure equalization valve to loosen a seal that was usually discarded later and which normally allowed for automatic adjustment of the cabin pressure.[16] The valve opened at an altitude of 168 kilometres (104 mi), and the resultant loss of pressure was fatal within seconds.[16][18] The valve was located beneath the seats and was impossible to find and block before the air was lost. Flight recorder data from the single cosmonaut outfitted with biomedical sensors showed cardiac arrest occurred within 40 seconds of pressure loss. By 15m 35s after the retrofire, the cabin pressure was zero, and remained there until the capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere.[16] Patsayev's body was found positioned near the valve, and he may have been attempting to close or block the valve at the time he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>An extensive investigation was conducted to study all components and systems of Soyuz 11 that could have caused the accident, although doctors quickly concluded that the cosmonauts had died of asphyxiation. Examination of the descent module showed that it was in excellent condition and there was no damage to it in the forms of cracks or ruptures of the hull.</p>
<p>The autopsies took place at Burdenko Military Hospital and found that the cause of death proper for the cosmonauts was hemorrhaging of the blood vessels in the brain, with lesser amounts of bleeding under their skin, in the inner ear, and in the nasal cavity, all of which occurred as exposure to a vacuum environment caused the oxygen and nitrogen in their bloodstreams to bubble and rupture vessels. Their blood was also found to contain heavy concentrations of lactic acid, a sign of extreme physiologic stress. Although they could have remained conscious for almost a minute after decompression began, less than 20 seconds would have passed before the effects of oxygen starvation made it impossible for them to function.</p>
<p>Alexei Leonov, who would have originally commanded Soyuz 11, had advised the cosmonauts before the flight that they should manually close the valves between the orbital and descent modules as he did not trust them to shut automatically, a procedure he thought up during extensive time in the Soyuz simulator. However, Dobrovolsky, Volkov, and Patsayev either chose to disregard his warnings or else forgot about them during the lengthy mission. After the flight, Leonov went back and tried closing one of the valves himself and found that it took nearly a minute to do, too long in an emergency situation with the spacecraft's atmosphere escaping fast.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no joy in being right in that situation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. And no question that that was the last thought of the guy found near the valve. &quot;Leonov was right.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Mission Control</em> is a great new documentary on Netflix right now. Features a lot of the early Apollo engineers. I was taken away by their describing of the Apollo 1 test, where 3 astronauts died in a test simulation due to fire. The engineering director basically sat everyone down and said &quot;This is entirely your fault. Anyone one of you at anytime could've said that you didn't feel ready for this test and no one would've died&quot;.</p>
<p>Basically all of the engineers agreed that they never would've made it to the moon if that test didn't fail. Because from then on out, everything down to the tiniest transistors had to be absolutely <em>perfect</em>, if there was ever the slightest bit of doubt in system design, then the mission would be aborted. </p>
<p>Phenomenal documentary 10/10</p></div>		</li>

<p>And we still have such a long way until anyone THINKS about sending people to Mars. The projection miscalculation possibilities (although that has already been determined) to these minor but deadly possibilities leaves so much to be considered before sending people across the vast emptiness of space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn that's a sucky way to go, the only thing they could have done to prevent it was based off a recommendation from someone who was supposed to be on the craft but wasn't, and even had they correctly diagnosed the problem and immediately they had 20 seconds of usable consciousness to close a valve that took a minute under the best circumstances. </p>
