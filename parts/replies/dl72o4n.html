<p>But doing it a few thousand times makes it no big deal.  </p>
<p>At this point in my career I get to care about exactly where I set the wheels down.  For instance, I don't like to set the nose wheel down right on top of the runway lights, because they protrude ever so slightly from the runway surface, and make a &quot;bump&quot; that annoys me, so I set the nose wheel down an inch or two to the side of the runway lights (incidentally, the runway stripes are usually offset from the lights).</p>
<p>The point is that when I was an 800 hour wonder, I wouldn't even have noticed nuances like that.  But now with many times that experience I've gained the experience and insight to care about such silly things.</p>
<p>All the discussion about ILS systems and autopilots and lighting....  I don't know why /u/allemande isn't the top comment, because it's the most correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are margins of course, but you're obviously aiming for something, so as you steer off from what you want you make corrections and get yourself on the right path. </p>
<p>If at a certain point in your approach you're X amount off it usually means you don't land or trying to land is a risky judgement call. </p>
<p>By the time you get to let's say 5-10 seconds of landing and you know you're landing it's because you've worked your way well withing the margins of what's considered safe and acceptable. </p></div>		</li>
