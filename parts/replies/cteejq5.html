			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's down to the fact that this planet has many of the features similar to Earth.  Distance from star, age, size, temperature of star etc... Many have been found that have some of these, this has most.  It's the closest to looking like earth we've found.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive my ignorance, wouldn't there be planets in correct proportions and distances from other stars (I.e. The habitable zone of  hotter or colder star) discovered that would fall into the same category? Or is the main significance how comparable to Earth it is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are.  It's just that this one is a similar size to earth, the star is a similar age, temperature and size to the sun and the orbit is right to give 452b a similar temperature to earth.  I think this is getting extra coverage as it's got most of the boxes ticked rather than just a few.</p>
<p>Also never apologize for ignorance when you are asking questions.  “Real knowledge is to know the extent of one’s ignorance.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being in the habitable zone of a colder star means being much closer to it, which likely means a tidally locked planet with the same face always facing the star (like our moon faces us), which wouldn't bode well for life being always boiling on one half and always freezing on the other.  Hotter stars usually mean older stars or bigger stars.  Much bigger and we can't detect earth size planets, there is not enough dip in brightness during a transit for Kepler to see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually we will find others that are as similar as this one, or maybe even more so, but space is very, very, very big so it takes a while. The ones we have found have been sort of similar in some respects, this one is a lot more similar. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what bothers me about the hype. So far the characteristics described are not anything to get excited for. It's the chemical composition and level of geological and atmsopheric activity that would actually deserve hype and excitement. The ages, distance and placement in the habitable zone are great, but as OP said, there wwre others discovered, and there are probably <em>many</em> planets that fall under these descriptions.  Right now, the planet is merely interesting. Worthy of further study, as many planets are, but not for the excitement.</p>
<p>I am honestly more excited about Pluto and Charon. There is much we are learning about our distant neighbor - the evidence of recent (and possibly ongoing) geological activity is exciting. Pluto is a lot more interesting that we previously thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So hype is always going to be around these sorts of things.  You have to remember that it's not the scientists that spread this around, it's the media.  They see something that'll make a story and they'll run with it.  They aren't interested in being as accurate as a peer reviewed paper, they just want a story.  Then people's imaginations run wild, things get posted all over Facebook with random opinions of people with no knowledge on the subject.</p>
<p>You could see it as a bad thing but I don't.  As space is flavour of the month at the moment it's getting a lot of coverage and sparking people's imaginations. If all the hype as got one kid to want to be a scientist then it's worth it.  If it means people will be more sympathetic towards funding of NASA or the the ESA or big science, then it's worth it.  Hey, the first person on another world may have just seen that story at age 7 and decided to study hard so they can go visit!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the other planets have been orbiting red dwarfs, which emit mainly in the infrared spectrum, but are cooler than a main sequence star like the sun. Hence, the planets orbit close and are not that similar to earth, despite the ability to hold liquid water.</p>
<p>This planet orbits round a yellow star similar to the sun, which emits in the visible light part of the spectrum. If you planted yourself down on this planet, things would not be too disimilar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is emitting in the infrared spectrum actually something we consider detrimental to life? There are plenty of examples of life that don't or hardly use light at all, and it seems like life on that planet could just evolve whatever is their eyeball equivalent to be sensitive to a lower portion of the spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Astronomers use a chart called the H-R Diagram to classify stars.</p>
<p>Google image &quot;H-R Diagram&quot; before reading further.</p>
<p>For the most part, the &quot;variety&quot; of star types isn't different kinds of star; it is different AGES of star. </p>
<p>A red dwarf isn't a different type of star from our Sun; it's just a different age.</p>
<p>If our Sun is a 40 year old white guy; then a red dwarf is an 85 year old white guy.</p>
<p>Keeping the metaphor, a Supergiant is like a 40 year old Asian.</p>
<p>So the H-R Diagram describes both how stars change as they age AND different star types.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that Kepler cannot detect true Earth sized planets. It is not sensitive enough to detect a planet of Earth's mass. This means it is significantly underestimating the amount of Earth-like planets because it is blind to ALL of them except the very largest. For instance, Kepler 452-b is 5 times Earth's mass.</p>
<p>We need the Terrestrial Planet Finder to launch before we can ever get a true concept of how common Earth homologs are.</p>
<p>Even with Kepler's significant constraints its data yields an estimate that there are 52 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone. And again, it must be stressed, that estimate is based only on Earth-like planets it is not &quot;blind&quot; to the upper end of the scale.</p>
<p>Our Sun is the most common type of star, and our data is telling us our planetary configuration is the norm, not the exception. </p>
<p>This is the frontier of science, but every new piece of data we get confirms that our solar system, our star, and our planet are the norm. </p>
<p>Not only are there 200 billion stars in our galaxy, and hundreds of billions of galaxies, but our solar system, the only one we know of to contain life, is plainly average and normal. </p>
<p>It's funny really; the most amazing thing we've discovered is how non-amazing our solar system is. Don't get me wrong, there's a LOT of variability between star systems, but the fundamentals  of composition and structure are very consistent, and we fit smack dab in the middle of that consistent theme.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know enough to state this with authority, but I'd guess that photosynthesis would be rougher/not chemically viable underneath a certain light intensity. At that point you'd need some form of energy storage mechanism that utilizes ambient temperature to store energy to be released when ambient temperature later reduces. Sounds like it would be more complicated.</p></div>		</li>
