			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea the OP is talking about is the idea that too much close work causes nearsightedness. This idea has been replaced pretty recently by evidence that it is actually a lack of sunlight exposure that is causing more nearsightedness. (Less sunlight = wrong shaped eyeballs.) Since you were getting more sunlight while your eyes finished growing in your later teen years, your eyeball shape got a little correction.

<p>As an anecdotal exception to the &quot;rule&quot;, my whole family needs glasses, I'm the one that spent the most time reading or on the computer by far, and I still don't need glasses in my early 20s.  I guess it's not necessarily a direct cause and effect or maybe I just got lucky?  Good explanation though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My eyesight seemed to be fine and I spend a lot of time at the computer/reading/etc. My whole family needs glasses and my mom is legally blind.</p>
<p>Then I decided to get my eyes checked out of curiosity and found out that my vision past 50 feet was shit. I think over time I had just adapted to deal with it and never really noticed it getting worse.</p>
<p>TL;DR it might be worth it to go get your eyes checked. If for no other reason than to have a baseline to work from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My long distance is actually actually bit fuzzy, so I went to the optometrist expecting to need glasses.  They told me my vision is just over 19/20  and very strongly recommended not wasting the money on glasses, despite being the ones selling them to me.</p>
<p>I've tried other people's glasses too, 0.25 prescription is too strong for me, I figure I'd need about 0.15 if anything.</p></div>		</li>

<p>TLDR: It's not the screen/TV itself, but the fact that you are always focusing your eyes on an object that is the same distance away from your eyes, not giving it the proper amount of exercise. Also kids eyesight will often change as a result of their eyes growing and not have anything to do with their behaviour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also true for reading a lot. The stereotype of the nerd wearing glasses actually makes sense. </p></div>		</li>
