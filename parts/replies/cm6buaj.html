<p>Also, the mediocrity principle tells us that other comets should be similar, but there's no proof either that this is not the only comet in the entire universe to have organic molecules.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most likely they were created during the formation of the solar system. They're pretty common throughout it.</p>

<p>There is plenty of proof, we already knew that comets have organic materials on their surface. See my comment below for one example</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the molecules come from the formation of the solar system itself, it stands to reason that any and all bodies could have them. The Earth was once just dust and rocks colliding, why is it that we think the building blocks weren't already here? I think finding proof of the building blocks to life elsewhere is more of a proof that life isn't only on Earth, not that it came for somewhere else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Organic&quot; doesn't mean that they were produced by life. These are just basic carbon chains and hydrocarbons that were forged in the heat of the baby solar system. They were present on earth before life came about and &quot;the primordial&quot; soup that the first single celled organisms came about in was likely composed of similar carbon molecules</p></div>		</li>
