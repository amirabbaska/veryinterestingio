			<div class="markdown"><p>So the rate of evaporation might explain the difference between tobacco and marijuana smoke? I have rental property and don't mind my renters smoking weed inside because it doesn't seem to leave residual odor when they move out. Contrasted with tobacco smoking renters who even if they only smoke outdoors, they still leave a residual odor. It's odd because during combustion weed smells equally if not more pungent than cigarettes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can some release a longer time though? Do they physically have more smell compounds or do they just release them extremely slowly? Something releasing smell for decades seems crazy if it's just a light covering on a wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned these odor compounds will, over the course of years of exposure, be absorbed deep into the dry wall and other wood structures. Since this process occurs over years of exposure it only makes sense that the reverse process (smelly chemicals leaving the dry wall and wood supports) would also take years. It's a basic osmotic process when it comes down to it. </p></div>		</li>
