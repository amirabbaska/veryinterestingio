			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember those days. Back when Ocarina of Time dropped, I remember my father taking me to store after store to look for the game only to be disappointed when I found out they were sold out. By sheer luck I happened to find a last copy in the last store we went to go check. But this problem no longer occurs anymore and stores are adequately stocked. There is no need to pre order games anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beyond the stores being adequately stocked, if you play PC there is literally no way for the game to be sold out.... copies are made instantly and delivered right to your eyeballs.</p>
<p>So now pre-orders (for PC) only advantage is the ability to preinstall the game, so you can be online at 12:01 am. Even then that is of questionable value unless it's an xpack for WOW or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wow xpac did things right. If you preorder you got your lvl 90 character to gear up and get ready for the expansion. A month before the expansion they released some teaser quests with new really good gear that everyone could do that really set the theme for the expansion. Granted the launch wasn't a good experience, wod has been my favorite expansion since BC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pretty much the only games I pre-order these days are Bliz CEs for the box of extra goodies, generally these aren't available other than pre-orders as they don't print more than they need. Would still like to find CEs for vanilla and TBC WoW, but not prepared to pay for the exorbitant prices they are likely to attract at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the thing that was great about old preorders: There was no reason to believe that the &quot;bonus&quot; was something just left out of the game. It was actually a bonus that was either to show it being limited or just extra little items that didn't affect the game at all.</p>
<p>Now you get entire characters or in-game items that do affect the game and those who buy the game miss out on content that has already been prepared because they limit access to it to convince people to dedicate to buying the game before knowing if it's any good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All Ocarina of Time 1.0 carts are gold. I had a gold cart and I got the game used. Later updates to Ocarina of Time (in subsequent printings that had some bug fixes and other small changes in them, mostly relevant to speedrunners) were gray, IIRC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you still play on Nintendo consoles. They're terrible at producing an adequate amount of stock on launch day. </p>
<p>Then again Nintendo produces thoroughly finished product and have only just recently started adding DLC. Mario kart 8 DLC? 2 packs with lots more maps, characters and vehicles that they worked on for months after the initial release. How much? Well at one point it was bundled for $12. Pre order away! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>So then the question becomes why do pre orders still exist? You mention bonus content but is it really?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's kind of looking at it backwards, though.</p>
<p>Preorders don't continue to exist in order to allow bonus content. Rather, exclusive bonus content is used to justify the continued existence of preorders.</p>
<p>Preordering digitally-delivered products is solely for the benefit of the publisher, for cashflow and deceptive marketing potential. It offers no innate benefit to the consumer.  (Other than <em>possibly</em> preloading a couple of days ahead.) At the point of preordering you're parting with your money for a promise, not a product. </p>
<p>So exclusive preorder bonus content is there solely to make an otherwise completely undesirable transaction appear appealing to the customer. And, as you pointed out, it's all too often simply regular content clipped from the main game anyway.</p></div>		</li>
