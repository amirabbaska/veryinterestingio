<p>The heat wave last week consisted of several days with highs over 85-90 °F and night-time lows above 75 °F. This week the temperatures dropped to highs around 75 °F and lows under 60 °F. </p>
<p>In this new photo you can see that the oil partially melted again after a high over 80 °F yesterday. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  I have coconut oil in a large(r) plastic tub and have never seen this despite repeated melting and cooling.  I wonder if it's related to the thermal conductivity of the glass, or the radius of the jar?  Or perhaps it's the ratio of different fats in the brand I buy (Nutiva) vs. the 365 brand?</p>
<p>Or I might just not have noticed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had several different jars of coconut oil in my cabinet over a span of a few years. During the summer months, I've seen them melt and solidify many times. This is the first time I have ever seen any sort of pattern like this. Normally it forms a solid block. </p>
<p>Some conditions must have been just right to produce this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing happened to my jar of coconut oil and it's the same brand, coincidence? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My coconut oil showed the same pattern when I last checked about a month ago. We had similar local temps but it's a different brand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Devils post pile looks like this.</p>
<p>And when I looked up that feature and oil columns, turns out oil experiments was one of the ways they modeled it. Might be able to look up how they did those experiments:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I and at least one other poster in the thread have seen the effect in coconut oil, so it should be reproducible. I suggest that the key variable would be rate and temperature of cooling, more than peak temperature or duration? If you do it, please post!</p></div>		</li>
