<p>This is not true.  Multiple studies have confirmed an innate component:  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blind humans acting similarly could be a result of positive reinforcement and associations of the act of 'smiling' and their parents being happy about that and acting as though the child is happy as a result of that facial expression. </p>
<p>It's possible it's an innate behaviour and link, but I'm not sure that study does more than suggest it might be a possibility. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A smile may show affection, convey politeness, or disguise true feelings. For example many people in Russia consider smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even suspicious behavior. Yet many Americans smile freely at strangers in public places (although this is less common in big cities). Some Russians believe that Americans smile in the wrong places; some Americans believe that Russians don't smile enough. In Southeast Asian cultures, a smile is frequently used to cover emotional pain or embarrassment. Vietnamese people may tell the sad story of how they had to leave their country but end the story with a smile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relies on there being an innate meaning. Different cultures can put their own spin on it, such as Russians finding it creepy or suspicious to smile at strangers or Vietnamese thinking you're doing it to hide pain, but all of them rely on the fact that a smile shows happiness. </p></div>		</li>
