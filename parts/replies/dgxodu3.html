			<div class="markdown"><p>Your question assumes that color is an inherent property. Things we usually deal with have color because a photon excites an electron bound to an atom, and when that electron returns to its unexcited state it emits a photon at a particular energy level. Asking the color of a neutron is to ask about what kind a photon an electron bound to that neutron emits after being excited ... but there are no such electrons.</p>
<p>Put another way, shining a flashlight at a neutron star does not result in the absorbtion and re-emission of photons in the same way as shining a flashlight at the wall. A cold neutron star would react in some way--all the quarks from which a neutron is composed interact with the electromagnetic force--but it wouldn't be like shining a flashlight on a cold, otherwise unlit disco ball, so it doesn't make sense to ask what color that ball would be.</p>
<p>Except that it would be groovy. Very groovy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that, but it would look like <em>something</em>! The light would interact with it in some way and I have never ever gotten a straight answer of what the various types of degenerate matter would look like.  Everybody <strong>always</strong> evades the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess the answer depends on if the photons can couple to the charged quarks inside the neutrons or not. If they don't, then I don't see why the (pure) degenerate matter wouldn't be transparent. As its so dense, you might get some weird gravitational lensing effect that would distort the background starfield.</p>
<p>However, I don't know if the photons couple or not. That's a very hard problem.</p>
<p>Also, the edge of the degenerate matter would certainly look like an explosion*, because it wouldn't be under enough pressure to remain degenerate.</p>
<p>* Because it would be exploding.</p>
<p>PS: I'll also add to cutelyaware's explanation. The thing you're asking about, as far as we know, cannot exist. May physicists are used to taking the philosophical position that only things that are amiable to experiments are worth thinking about. This means that they can avoid being kept awake all night by questions like: &quot;what is going on with event horizons&quot;, and &quot;quantum mechanics: what does it really all mean?&quot; Its not like they aren't curious, its just that most of the time you just need a good night's sleep and to get your actual research project done.</p>
<p>Imagine asking a biologist the question &quot;if unicorns existed, would their fats smell of roses?&quot;. How do you proceed like that?</p>
<p>However, I think there are valid ways to ask your question through mathematics. You could say &quot;according to the standard model, if you had an infinite square well full of neutrons at neutrons star densities, would photons propagate in it or be absorbed?&quot; You might get better answers because you are emphasising you are interested in what the well defined maths would predict.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that you're catching physicists off-guard because they realize there is an answer to the question, and it's in their field, but they simply don't know the answer. Of course the best answer in that situation is simply &quot;I don't know&quot;, but that's difficult for a lot of people to admit. It's a fine question and I encourage you to persist.</p></div>		</li>
