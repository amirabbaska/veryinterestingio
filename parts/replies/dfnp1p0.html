			<div class="markdown"><p>Just furthering whats already been said. Whrn classifying intel. The s.o.p. Is to be overly cautious you're concerned with COULD this be used against the Country not WILL. Further what may seem benign to rhe average person may be a &quot;picture is worth a  thousand words&quot; situation for subject matter experts. The amount of data that can be gathered from even the smallest bits of information. Hell even not classifying information is informative to the right people. I won't say that every thing the gov does is to protect yhe interest of the avg. American , but remember there's a LOT of humans still involved not just computer algorithms and i dont mean senators and dept. Heads i mean tons of 40-70k yr military, contractors, gov employees, etc and vast conspiracies require a LOT of ppl to turn blind eyes and actively work against public interest.
Are there shitty people using government assets for personal gain? Prob a damn safe bet,  but people see unicorns instead of horses... Or jackasses far too often. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An example of innocuous information leading to a big change is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet" target="_blank">Stuxnet</a>.  Using publicly available photos of the president of Iran visiting a nuclear facility, the CIA and/or Israel was able to determine what type of nuclear enrichment equipment was being used, in particular the control system that managed how fast the enrichment equipment would spin.  A worm was written to infect computers, spread and look for that type of equipment attached to the computer (SCADA &amp; Step7).  If the control system was found, the malware would infect the control system so that it would spin too fast and eventually break while reporting that everything was fine.   </p>
<p>Iran's nuclear program was set back by years.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't remember the full story but there was a physicist who analysed the famous photo of the trinity test (the first nuclear explosion). He was able to calculate all sorts of things about the bomb and I think published it before getting into trouble with the military.  </p></div>		</li>
