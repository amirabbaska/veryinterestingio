<p>Red, blue and yellow are the reductive primaries; they are based on absorption of light.</p>

<p>And to be more precise, the subtractive colors are not actually red, blue, and yellow.  They're magenta, cyan, and yellow.</p>
<p>You can get the additive colors (red, blue, and green) by combining the subtractive colors, and vice versa.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is subtractive versus additive.</p>
<p>If you add blue and yellow in a subtractive setting, you get green like you experience with the paint. </p>
<p>If you do the same with blue and green (we don't do yellow here) in additive settings, you get cyan. </p>
<p>In both cases does the result work out to the same thing: an absence of all colours that don't make up the final result. In the first case, they were absorbed by the paint (white light - (all but blue and yellow) = green). In the second case, there was no light, other than the blue and green light. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5exc95/eli5_if_red_blue_and_yellow_are_the_primary/dafvgwb/" target="_blank">this post just above you</a>, there are two diagrams. They show that additive colour and subtractive colour are exact opposites: to get the primary subtractive colours, you need to add two additive colours to each other, and vice versa for the additive colours. It also shows what you get when you add all three: white in the case of additive and black in the case of subtractive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>With computer screens the light is being pushed out from the screen. It's not absorbing light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With paint, if you add all the colors of paint together, you'd get black paint.  That's &quot;additive&quot; color mixing.  (Color 1 + color 2 = color 3)</p>
<p>With light, all the colors in the light spectrum together gives us white light.  It helps me to picture <a href="https://goo.gl/images/Uw8KuI" target="_blank">sunlight being split by a prism</a>, showing us the full range of available colors inside white light.  That's &quot;subtractive&quot; color mixing.  (White - color 2 = color 3)</p>
<p>With paint, you'd <em>add</em> a color to another to get a color variation.  With light, you'd <em>subtract</em> a color from white light to get a color variation.  </p>
<p>Red Blue Green together makes white light.  To get yellow light, you'd <em>subtract</em> blue from the white light and be left with yellow.</p></div>		</li>
