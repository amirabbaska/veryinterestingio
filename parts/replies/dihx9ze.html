			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes though, it's caused by medications you might take, and there isn't really anything you can do to counter it. That's where I am right now. It's not just after sitting a while, it's anytime I stand up, even if I only sat a few minutes. Some meds really do a whammy on you. I just grab something steady and put my head down a moment. It usually passes fairly quickly. It can be anything from just tingly and dizzy to full on blackness/loss of vision. I agree if your Dr hasn't warned you that meds they have given will cause this, you should schedule an appointment to be checked.  It can be caused from many things. Some benign,  some are serious.  Stay healthy. </p></div>		</li>
