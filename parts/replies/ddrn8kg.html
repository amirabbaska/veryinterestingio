			<div class="markdown"><p>500F is on the very low end, something you can accomplish at home. At my job we try to keep to oven around 650F. It's a good temp for us because any higher and we risk burning it while multitasking. We've cooked pizzas at 700-800F, you just can't even think about looking away or it'll burn before you reach the of your train of thought. </p>
<p>Pizzas lend well to this because they are flat and the raw element, dough, goes directly into the heat of the oven, making it immediately. The toppings are exposed to the hot open air and roast quickly as a result</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As /u/TheHamfish stated, your meat temperatures are off.</p>
<p>105 is probably closer to a 'blue' steak
120-127 is rare
128-134 is medium rare
134+ is overdone (sorry, don't know the values for about MR)</p>
<p>Something many people do not realize is that the commonly-seen USDA recommendations are for <em>instantaneous</em> readings. As in, if your meat hits that temperature for 0.00001 seconds, it will kill enough bacteria to be safe for consumption. The reality is that you can kill the same amount of bacteria at a lower temperature for increasingly longer periods of time!</p>
<p>You can cook beef as low as 130F for 121 minutes to be safe for consumption! NOTE: <em>This refers to the internal, coldest region of the beef being kept at at</em> <strong>least</strong> <em>130F for 121 minutes.</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it makes you feel (edit: and u/thehamfish) any better these are just the numbers they taught me back in the day  so it doesn't surprise me if they're wrong. Maybe I forgot what the numbers really were or maybe they taught me wrong. USDA also thinks hollandaise needs to be cooked to 160 and until recently believed all pork should be well done lol. </p>
<p>For what it's worth, I don't really temp steaks, I grill them by eye and I do pretty well. :) </p>
<p>Thanks for the literature, I'll make sure to update my information. </p></div>		</li>
