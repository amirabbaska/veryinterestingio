			<div class="markdown"><p>An electric current is a flow of electric charge. And since Ions are electric charged and move, this should be called the electric current.
So, to get to the ampere value, you just have to measure the amount of Ions (weighted with charge), which flow through one point during signal propagation in one second.
Since I have no clue about this Ion amount I can`t answer the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is a movement of charged particles, however they do not travel along the length of the axon. They move across the cell membrane in and out of the cell. So there is a &quot;wave of depolarization&quot; moving down the length of the axon, but there are no charged particles moving in that direction. Instead, the electrical potential of the cell membrane increases in a wave. This is why I said that the action potential propagation is not an electrical current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure if the depolarization propagation could also be classified as a current. Actually i think the propagation mechanism requires charged particles moving so that technically makes a current. Also there are neurons in the central nervous system that do not have a real axon and that do not use action potential spikes. These of course have to be very short distance transmissions.</p>
<p>however you are right in principle in that the axon is not really a passive conductor. When we measure the electric currents in the brain (for example in MEG) those currents are quite specifically the ion currents in the dendrites where we can actually get real ion currents to consistent directions.</p>
<p>Anyways to answer the original question, the currents are so small we cannot even measure them. MEG relies on large number of cells firing at the same time. And the information processing is not actually affected by the size of the current (as long as it does not burn you or something).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the major concerns is not that the K+ channels will remain open, but that the cell will not be able to repolarize. Somatic neurons generally repolarize by opening potassium channels to allow potassium efflux from the cell. If the extracellular potassium concentration is too high to favor passive potassium efflux, the cell will not be able to repolarize, and will no longer be able to fire properly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I had never thought about how that worked, thanks for the explanation! May I also ask what are the physiological consequences of having all your neurons shut up at once? I mean, do some organs keep working? </p></div>		</li>
