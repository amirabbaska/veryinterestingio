			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any way to fix someone's reliance on one eye if they're already an adult? I'm 22 and recently realized that I heavily favour my right eye, to the point that closing my left eye does nothing to change what I'm seeing other than adding in what my right eye literally can't see. My prescription is -10.25 in each eye, and I've been wearing glasses since I was about two.</p>
<p>I'm booking an optometrist appointment soon, so I'm curious if it's something I should bring up. I function just fine, other than having absolutely terrible depth perception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pediatric ophthalmic tech here. To put it bluntly: no, after a certain age, techniques like patching and surgery do nothing to correct amblyopic vision. Should your eye ever deviate, we can fix the misaligned eye but not the vision in it. </p>
<p>Someone mentioned vision therapy; I work with some of the best pediatric ophthalmologists in my part of the US (very well researched and published on amblyopic and Strabismic issues) and they are adamant that vision therapy does not work. We sometimes have patients that spend thousands of dollars on vision therapy only to come back to us with the same vision (with a placebic effect). In my opinion, if you feel better than more power to you! But it usually just doesn't work.</p>
<p>I'm talking specifically amblyopic conditions.( However, I've known a couple optometrists That recommend vision therapy. everyone has a different viewpoint)</p>
<p>(*amblyopia - &quot;lazy eye&quot; ; basically different conditions can force the brain to use one eye and stop using the other eye. conditions can be things like a right eye that crossing (brain begins to favor left eye) or a left cataract (brain favors right eye) or a large prescription difference. Etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I would have the audacity to say that I would know more than someone who is in the field of optometry but I can lend you that in my experience it is possible to train my eye to switch dominance for certain tasks. Aiming down the sights of a handgun or aligning couplers and fittings I find that when I use my left eye &quot;I used my left eye to do this for a long time&quot; that I have issues but when I fire a handgun and use my left eye I do not have issues. I switched over to aligning couplers with my right eye and now I don't have issues but still use my left for handguns &quot;I'm right handed&quot; just an idea. I'm not sure if this covers the scope of what you are speaking to specifically however</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is a lazy eye and a squint basically the same thing? I have a severe left eye dependency, 70% of my vision is with my left eye, because of lazy eye as above, but I also have a controllable squint. Are the two connected? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a similar sounding circumstance. I had a few eye surgeries and did eye patches as a kid. I'm heavily right eye dominant. The vision in my left eye is considerably worse than my right. I've ask about it and the answer from u/promptly is what I've been told. I don't find the right eye dominance to be much of a problem. And since I never had normal vision I don't know if it's that different. I think most people do have a dominant eye though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totorood I'm curious, the original post is talking about giving eyeglasses to people who are literally a baby. I can't think of any need to give glasses to infants or even toddlers before they begin to read and it seems to me that giving someone under the age of 4 something with small parts they can choke on and chew on is a recipe for disaster. </p>
<p>How young do you usually fit children with glasses? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on every case, I typically fit a child with moderate prescription at around 3 years of age. If there's other vision issues, I will fit earlier. </p>
<p>Some infants/toddlers are born sooo far-sighted that they're at a high risk of developing amblyopia. Even though their visual demands aren't high (they don't need to read), most of their world is up close  i.e. toys, bottles and because they're far-sighted, objects close to them are blurry. </p>
<p>More commonly, toddlers will have glasses to prevent an eye turn. As someone mentioned, accommodative esotropia is an eyeturn due to a high amount of far-sightedness, and if we correct that prescription their eyes can be aligned. </p>
<p>Miraflex glasses are amazing, they're a single piece so no small parts. It's flexible, hard to break and easy to keep on their smaller faces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter was diagnosed with accommodative esotropia at 1 1/2 years old and put in glasses. Her left eye was turning in. Her dr uses the method described above and it's interesting to see the tricks they come up with to keep her looking where they need to get the prescription measured. My daughter has a massive fear of eye drops now from all of the dialations she's had. </p>
<p>My daughter is almost 4 now and has been through at least 10 prescription changes, patching (tho, she now switches eyes so it's not only her left that turns in), prisms, vision therapy, and this morning she had her second surgery. It still amazes me how little we are able to guarantee on treatments.
Also, f*^+% insurance companies for not covering vision therapy. At $200/wk, it's a huge burden :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason insurance doesn't cover vision therapy is because there is no scientific evidence that it works.  Ophthalmologists as a whole do not believe it works at all.</p>
<p>It is still widely offered though because it provides optoms with nice cash payments $$</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a little oversimplified. It's hardly a settled issue in the field and it's an active research area. There are very view studies that have been completed so of course it isn't recommended until results emerge (if they emerge). Orthopic VT has been shown to be effective for certain conditions, and can help patients with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16044063?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank">convergence insufficiency</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fixing-My-Gaze-Scientists-Dimensions/dp/0465020739" target="_blank">strabismus</a>, diplopia, and with rehab after brain disease or injury. Behavioral VT is where the kool aid gets drunk. Some places claim they can cure dislexia, adhd, etc. with VT.</p>
<p>Edit: I see that you have quite a history of crusading against VT in /r/optometry. I don't think I will be able to change your perspective no matter what I say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what we have been told by several doctors. I finally found one that gets it. The reason the eyes turn in is because the brain is unable to align the eyes and use them in unison.</p>
<p>We did vision therapy and almost achieved binocular vision for my daughter. But I still wasn't sure if it worked. So we stopped doing it. My daughter's eyes regressed and reverted back to pre-surgical condition. She just had her second surgery. Her dr said she will continue to need corrective surgery unless her brain is trained to align the eyes properly, which can only be done with vision therapy.</p>
<p>In Europe, vision therapy is a more accepted treatment for esotropia and straumbismus. In the US we focus on surgeries to correct this issue that have no guarantee of correction. I know someone who's five year old has had seven eye muscle surgeries, and her eyes still turn in. </p></div>		</li>
