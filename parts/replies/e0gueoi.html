<blockquote>
<p>Acetone, commonly found in nail polish remover, is a widely available solvent capable of softening cured cyanoacrylate.[29] Other solvents include nitromethane, dimethyl sulfoxide, and methylene chloride.[30] gamma-Butyrolactone may also be used to remove cured cyanoacrylate.[31] Commercial debonders are also available.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once got super glue all over my plastic eye glasses trying to fix something. </p>
<p>I read that acetone in nail varnish remover worked to easily remove the glue, what I did not read was that it obliterated plastic. So I dumped it in a small bowl of nail varnish remover abd went to school with my spare pair. </p>
<p>I came back to dust</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The remarkable thing about methylene chloride (or dichloromethane as us old farts call it) is that considering it's a methyl and has halogens on, it's hardly toxic at all.  You need to breathe quite a lot of it for it to be fatal, and it mostly acts as an intoxicant that breaks down to carbon monoxide.  So, exposure gives you a splitting headache followed by a roaring case of CO poisoning.</p>
<p>Considering what similar chemicals are like, it's as safe as milk.</p></div>		</li>
