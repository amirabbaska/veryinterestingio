			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree.  I do business analysis, and we never represent percent change on percents.  It can be highly misleading.  That's the kind of shit Newsweek does.  PSYCHOPATH DECAPITATION MURDER DEATH CRIME RATE UP 50% IN UNITED STATES!!!!! (from 0.00000001% to 0.000000015%).  Gotta provide context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'm really interested about that topic (business analysis). I have a working math understanding and want to know more about it. Would you mind sharing a book or two that you think are good for someone otherwise ignorant about it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For finance stuff, honestly the Investopedia finance course is pretty good.  If you can do basic math, corporate accounting is very very simple.  The key is really just understanding the concepts of how all the numbers tie together.</p>
<p>For supply chain, I really liked The Machine That Changed the World.  Zero technical information, but an amazing introduction to how an efficient supply chain runs.  (The Toyota Way is also good).</p>
<p>Other than that, I mostly just learned on the job (I'm a business consultant).  Most analytics questions are going to be subject-dependent: elasticity and cross-elasticity for pricing optimization, cycle/safety stock levels for inventory management, etc.  I've read other subject-matter books like Essentials of Supply Chain Optimization, but they're only useful if you're solving a specific problem.</p>
<p>The key thing to remember in all business analytics is that, while the numbers don't lie, there is usually some fundamental concept that needs to be figured out before you start any analysis.  For instance, let's say I'm trying to figure out my inventory policy.  I can't do that until I understand my segmentation of product - how do I group my products in such a way that I can make inventory policies for them?  What service levels do I need to achieve with each project group?  Those are not straightforward questions, and involve marketing information, product information, financial information, etc.  So you really need to ask yourself - what am I trying to solve here?  before diving into any analysis.</p>
<p>Like everything, critical thinking is much more important than technical prowess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this.  Even better would be to state the actual beginning value, end value and dollar amount of growth.</p>
<p>I hate hearing about the &quot;fastest growing companies around&quot; the quadrupled in size last year 400% growth! Wow!, ....from 2 people to 8!  Where the 1000 person company next door merely added 2% more workers, what slackers....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you I just asked someone else this exact question. So 1% off, 25% off, and 33% off are all technically correct in their own context but each can also be misleading depending on usage. Right?</p>
<p>In a recent real world situation with this I saw providing both as the least misleading and have been wondering ever since.</p></div>		</li>
