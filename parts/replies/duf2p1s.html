			<div class="markdown"><p>Why did no empire before the 19th century conquer/colonize (large) parts of Africa? The Romans only conquered the very northernmost part. Did the Saharan desert prevent travel further south and ships were not advanced enough for the sea route? Why did no tribe ever start to conquer neighboring tribes on a large scale and maybe establish a “civilization” with written records in the process?</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_I_of_Mali" target="_blank">Mansa Musa</a> had an Empire which conquered large parts of Western and Central Africa and had trade routes that crossed the Sahara.   He is considered the richest man to have ever lived.<br />
He did commission some ocean exploration but nothing ever came of it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The desserts and mountain ranges south of them were major barriers that stopped a lot of travel, but there were colonies and conquests in Africa throughout the middle ages. </p>
<p>China had some trade outposts in the 1400s and earlier but then their Emperors almost randomly decided to stop major trade and long distance voyages at sea, even going so far as to destroy much of their fleets. </p>
<p>India had a few colonial port cities in the 1600s. </p>
<p>There were several Caliphates that formed and died throughout Easter and Central Africa throughout the middle ages period. </p>
<p>And tribes warred with each other all the time. Simply subjecting a neighboring tribe does not mean you will invent writing, or agriculture both of which are necessary to build &quot;civilization&quot; as we understand it. Despite what you and many think human development is not linear. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, there's an entire microbial history to empires conquering distant lands. European conquest of Africa arrived pretty late on the scene relative to European conquest elsewhere. The reason is that every time Europeans tried marching into the inland of sub-Saharan Africa, they caught malaria and died. Turns out the microbes of Africa are dead set against the microbes of Europe.</p>
<p>Similarly, the microbes of Europe are dead set against the microbes of the Americas. As I understand it, by the time large swaths of European colonialists arrived in the Americas, huge numbers of native Americans had died from diseases (mostly) unintentionally introduced by the original small groups of European travelers.</p>
<p>All that to say, we have to pay attention to the microbes. The historians of the day, however, didn't understand them, so it's not a part of recorded history. Still, it plays a huge part in an accurate understanding of something like the relationship between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's estimated that up to 90% of indigenous people in the Americas died of disease before the end of the 1600s. Most died before ever seeing a white person. Smallpox, the flu and measles were the biggest killers. History would be remarkably different if those people had a resistance to the same microbes Europeans did. There was an estimated 50 million people in North and South America in 1492, with some estimates climbing towards 100 million (though not likely that high).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To counter this, most people also don't learn about Canadian history if they don't live in Canada. There's only so much time to devote in school to general world history, and usually it is spent on historical events and groups that had an impact on the country or society of the student. </p>
<p>The early kingdoms/nations of central and southern Africa unfortunately did not have a huge impact on many other areas of the world, at least compared to, say, Rome or the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>A good comparison would be the history of the Indigenous people of North and South America. We don't hear a lot about them, even in North America. If you lived in Asia or Africa you probably wouldn't hear about them at all.</p></div>		</li>
