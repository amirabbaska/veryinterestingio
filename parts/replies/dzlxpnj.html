			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible, yes – and no, it doesn’t necessarily sound operatic, unless you sustain the words in such a way as to sound like singing.</p>
<p>Opera singers leverage acoustics (that is, resonance) to amplify their voices – they manipulate the space in their mouths and throats (pharyngeal space) to boost frequencies rather than using brute force (shouting). This boost also avoids pain because they can speak on a pitch comfortable to them rather than elevating the pitch to cut through noise.</p>
<p>This is a topic that probably warrants a YouTube video by a speech pathologist or voice teacher. Demonstrations really help get the point across in a way that words on a page won’t.</p></div>		</li>
