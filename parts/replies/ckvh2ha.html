I remembered it as a speck of dust being halfway between, but looking up references, I see one article saying the grain of sand is halfway between a <em>neutrino</em> and the Earth.</p>
<p>Atom: 10^-9 m (10 angstroms) wide<br />
Apple: 10^-1 m (10 cm) wide<br />
Earth: 10^7 m (10,000 km) wide  </p>
<p>So 10^8 between each step.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen Ångström being used as units in one of my classes, but never understood why it was used, as it's simply 10^-10 m, so to me it's just one more unit to remember. Is there any practical reasons to use it, or is it just easier when you don't have to deal with all the orders of magnitude? (I would usually write 1 nm rather than 10 Å).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like it was just convenient (slightly easier to write than 0.1nm), and although it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angstrom" target="_blank">was supposed to be 10^-10 m</a> it got its own definition, then was reabsorbed into 10^-10 and is now 'officially discouraged' from use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's all of it. Makes for easy calculations, without having to convert back and forth to nm. It's also convenient when you find that you often care about the first decimal place of the nm number but never really the second. It's easier to say 2883 Å than to say 288.3 nm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a nice presentation, but their math seems to be off by a factor of 10. The &quot;size&quot; of a hydrogen atom is more like half an Angström to an Angström, not ten Angström. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=atomic%20diameter%20of%20hydrogen&amp;lk=2" target="_blank">Source</a> </p>
<p>This means that Feynman's approximation is a rather rough approximation. In addition, most of that volume is empty space and the size of the nucleus is only in the range of 10^-15 metres. Which means that, in comparison to the Earth, the apple would actually be something 100 nanometres wide (approximately 1000 times the diameter of an atom), with an &quot;electron&quot; probably somewhere in that 10cm sphere.</p></div>		</li>
