			<div class="markdown"><p>Upon death, the body is unable to produce more ATP, which is necessary to 'undo' the muscle contraction motion between the myosin and actin filments. So, the muscles remain in a contracted state, rigor mortis. Beyond this, I don't know why they remain open vs closed, perhaps the levator muscle is stronger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't quite stay &quot;contracted&quot;, they stay firm. The difference is that, in contraction, they are producing an active force. In rigor mortis, they just stay in whatever position they were, and it's difficult to move them passively.</p></div>		</li>

It’s kinda hard because they don’t stay closed. Both muscles relax on death, so there’s nothing pulling the eyelid either way. The natural relaxed state of the eyes is half open. Also, the lower eyelid normally covers the eye too, so it’s not as simple as running your hand over their face like they do in movies. It helps if they were sedated before euthanasia, since they don’t tend to blink much when under sedation and their eyes dry out. Dry eyes are sticky, so the eyelids are more likely to stick shut.
It still can be hard, and obviously the family doesn’t want to gaze into the lifeless eyes of their late pet. It takes a bit of experience dealing with dead things to get used to. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Dunno if you still talk with any of your old co-workers, but the should consider talking to a local funeral home about &quot;eye caps&quot;.</p>
<p>They are simple to use, but make a big difference for some cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former funeral director / embalmer, to close the eyelids we do three things: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Moisturizing cream - provides elasticity to the eyelid </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gentle massage - breaks rigor</p>
</li>
<li>&quot;Eye caps&quot; - pretty much small pieces of plastic that are used like contacts but they have texture on the exterior. This helps the eyelids resist opening</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so I have a question about this (note: this is not asking for medical advice of any kind). I had surgery a little while ago and long story short, it didn't go well and half my face got paralyzed. Three (and almost 4) of the 5 major facial nerves that come in near my ear and under my temple got severed. From my upper lip to above my eyebrow on my left side, I have no ability to move (although the lip is very very slowly regaining little movement). I even had to have a weight installed in my eyelid to help it close all the way. But I can open it just fine. And I can open it independently of the right eye. What I absolutely cannot do is keep my left eye closed while opening my right eye. Is this because only the orbicularis occuli is paralyzed, while the other is somehow not?</p></div>		</li>
