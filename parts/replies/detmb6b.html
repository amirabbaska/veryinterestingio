			<div class="markdown"><p>So you would stay there and administer as much care as possible to the two patients rather than say leave a paramedic there and rush the patient that was already in the ambulance to the hospital? Also, under certain circumstances could you try and get <em>two</em> patients in the ambulance? Or are ambulances designed to treat only one critical-condition patient? </p></div>		</li>

<p>I can treat more than one patient in my ambulance, but no more than two, and only if one does not have an immediately life-threatening injury/illness</p>
<p>In your scenario, I would practically be legally required to remain on scene due to the incident and to provide care to all involved (provided that I'm not incapacitated due to injury) while waiting for additional resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to point out is called transfer of care. You can't abandon a patient, and you can only transfer a patient to someone of equal or higher training. (A paramedic treating a patient who needs paramedic-level interventions cannot transfer the patient to an EMT-Basic. He can transfer to another paramedic, a nurse or doctor.)</p>
<p>They can especially never abandon care (refusals are different). So in your scenario,the medic can't simply drive to the hospital,since there would be no-one in the back taking care of the patient.</p>
<p>In theory, a firefighter could drive while one medic stays in the back and another stays at the scene, but that's usually not protocol. At the service I worked, the partners weren't allowed to be separated to avoid logistical issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a random question, but military person here.  We generally train for a lot of different &quot;person is hurt in this way, do this&quot; scenarios, but hopefully don't ever have to actually practice that scenario.  Because we don't generally have to render first aid that often, we have recurring training.  Is there regular recurring training for paramedics, or is the everyday job considered to be enough to maintain your learned skills and procedures (including some perhaps more rare situations)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for commenting late but further question, if the person you are transporting has a high chance to be saved if taken immediately, and the other has a mediocre to low chance of survival(the one that is hit) but both are serious enough that waiting for the backup ambulances and transports means certain death or extensive brain damage, are you still required to stay and sacrifice both good chances according to protocol? Also, thank you so much for what you do, if human life wasn't priceless(aka worthless) maybe you saints would get paid properly for what you do! Every day you feel is just a normal day is a day you're a hero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was kinda what I was getting at. At a certain point, it seems immoral to stay at the scene based solely on 'protocol', but choosing one person over the other because they have a better Chance of surviving also seems immoral. </p></div>		</li>
