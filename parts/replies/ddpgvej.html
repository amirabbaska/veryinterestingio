			<div class="markdown"><p>No way. Any democrat would oppose a national sales tax hugely. It would purely shift the tax burden from the rich to the poor. It is a textbook example of a regressive tax plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the answer. The lobby funded by tax preparation companies and software have pushed for legislators to prevent the irs from implementing the easy tax system that would send you a form to sign to confirm if you are just filling standard deduction forms...like the majority of people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the IRS budget: In 2015 I needed to get a particular report from the IRS for a loan application. The online system, which was the 'recommended method' for obtaining this doc was down, and I had only 2-3 days to obtain the document. I spent two entire 10 hour days either on hold, or hanging up and redialing through the phone tree to get to the 'speak to a person' option. Around 4pm on the second day I finally got a person on the phone. I was literally waiting on hold for like 4 hours at a time. She emailed me the doc in about 1 minute. When I described the efforts I went through to finally get her on the line, she was very apologetic but said, &quot;There are only a few of us here and we have to go home at some time&quot;.</p>
<p>The IRS was fucked up before Trump. Now, I can only imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have this in Finland. Works great. I can during they year login and change my tax%. I just add in earned so far, taxes payed so far and estimated earnings to come. Then after the year, around February March I get a paper that is prefilled, if I want to change anything or claim something different I return it. Otherwise it's OK. At the end of the paper my exact tax% is noted and if I'm about to get a tax return or pay extra. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't have socialized medicine and let people die for no other reason than a lack of money, we don't have mandatory maternity leave, we have a shit minimum wage and huge college debt for anyone who doesn't want to make minimum wage, we don't have mandatory vacation days for most workers, we perpetuate a failed drug war and incarcerate more citizens than any other country, we're quickly falling behind in education and literacy, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the developed world, we don't have many unions left and lose more and more workers' rights over time, our wealth divide is at an historic high and our middle class is disappearing, and for the first time in American history us millenials will be less educated and make less money than our parents. Oh and we have an entire political party with the support of half of our country that, for some reason, oppose making any of those things better, are strongly religious, and also oppose education, climate change action, women's reproductive healthcare, and science.</p>
<p>We're very quickly becoming something other than the first world. </p></div>		</li>
