			<div class="markdown"><p>This was much &quot;easier&quot; to do before the advent of Check 21. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_21_Act" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_21_Act</a>)</p>
<p>Pre-Check 21, all banks had to actually send the paper checks from depositor/casher to originating bank. This float period would allow someone the ability to write multiple kite checks and abscond with much monies before getting caught. </p>
<p>Now most banks electronically clear all accounts every day at midnight by submitting an electronic version of each check to the originating bank to receive credit which reduces the float period down to the same day before midnight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  I use to be a master check floater.  I was poor.  I could write a check at the store for groceries, then 3 days later write another check at the store for cash, put the cash in the bank to cover the first check and thus buy myself a few days until payday.</p>
<p>I was doing that well into the 90's.  I don't think it would work today because of Check 21.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A legal(ish) way of doing this is to mail a &quot;hot&quot; check in for a bill.  Many companies will accept the postmark date as the time of payment.  You can delay your payment 2-3 days to have time to deposit money to cover your check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, banks caught on and for a new customer they'll almost certainly put at least a 3 day hold on any funds deposited via check over a certain amount. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! Banker here. The ACH (Automated Clearing House) will get back to us that day in some cases. I've deposited checks at 9am and had an alert at 2pm saying they were going to bounce.</p>
<p>Edit: not for me. I've done deposits for customers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The caveat however is that some banks (my bank) won't cash a check for more than the amount you have in your account that day. </p>
<p>For example, If I have a check for 100$ I want to cash, but I only have 20$ in my account, they will only let me cash 20$... And they'll put the other 80$ in the bank (basically, you can't take out what you don't already have, you have to wait a few days for it to clear) </p></div>		</li>
