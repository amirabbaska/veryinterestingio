			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they absolutely have. Like I noted if you control both the entry &amp; exit node used by a client, you have a <em>MUCH</em> easier time compromising their data.</p>
<p>It still isn't easy &amp; requires a good deal of time, expertise, and money. But those are not things the U.S. government is hurting for.</p>
<p>This is why you don't want to just use TOR. You want to use TOR over a VPN, and ideally some more obfuscation such as VPN&amp;TOR chains. </p>
<p>What I mean by this is you VPN, then TOR to another VPN, then TOR again to another VPN, then TOR to your destination. So they need your 1^^st, your 2^^nd, and your 3^^rd entrance and exit nodes, and they need to be able to break all those VPNs.</p>
<p>Security is about layers &amp; making it more hassle than it is worth to break your security. And why if you have a dedicated attacker ,such as a government, going after you it's not really a matter of <em>IF</em> so much as <strong>when</strong> they get to you.</p>
<p>The trick is to constantly be on your toes, and upgrading your security. It's basically a cat and mouse game.</p>
<p>Also to know what your use-case is.</p>
<p>For me it's my torrenting (Of 100% free and open source software I swear....), my browsing habits, and circumventing region-locks. So for me a single VPN suffices, because I'm really only up against small time, passive monitoring.</p>
<p>For someone consistently releasing node-0 torrents (The first person to put up a new movie), dealing in illicit materials, or doing other things, they may come against more active attackers &amp; would need more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that great explanation. I think I now understand VPN better and see its value in this scenario. However, the ISP provides a service to its customer. As you analogized with regard to FB, going forward, the ISP's product will now be us - our data. The customer will be the aggregators and advertisers. We will be the farm. So, with that in mind, I'm pretty certain that an ISP will easily be able to legally add to their ToS that anything we do to prevent their tracking us and pushing ads in front of our reception will be a violation, and they will simply be able to either push generic geographically-based ads in front of each page request or even restrict packets from downloading. </p>
<p>That is, in practical application, if we attempt to avoid being tracked or fed ads, the ISP can legally push a page into our browser that say's something like, &quot;Want to visit that site you just typed in? No problem - just disable your VPN and ad-blocker, then refresh.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>And if they get compromised other people may be able to view your data. </p>

<p>So if it's possible to buy individuals' data, can we buy the data of congresspeople?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming they did not exempt themselves from the law, possibly. Though I do not know how much the ISP would charge, or if they would sell individual non-anonimized data.</p>
<p>The ISP may simply sell package deals like &quot;Data from Users in <Zip code> and it might be anonymized to User1, User2, User3, etc.</p>
<p>If you had the manpower &amp; skill, such as that used by 4-chan &amp; The_Donald when digging through wikileaks or hunting down the HWNDU flag, you could likely figure out who is who.</p>
<p>But there are too many factors for me to give a definitive answer.</p></div>		</li>
