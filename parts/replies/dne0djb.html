			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The change in the amount of O2 in your breath has as much to do with your lungs <em>adding</em> CO2 as it does <em>removing</em> O2. This is why you can breathe just fine at different altitudes, even though the absolute quantity of oxygen in each lungful is very different. Breathing air with a lot of CO2 is actually much more unpleasant than breathing air with not enough oxygen. CO2 in the air makes it harder for your blood to ditch the CO2 it is carrying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More on CO2:</p>
<p>The sensation to breathe is <em>mostly</em> triggered by rising CO2 levels, not low O2 levels.</p>
<p>In the case of hyperventilation (from panic attacks) you have plenty of O2 and are actually to blowing off too much CO2.</p>
<p>The classic “breathe into a paper bag”, or holding your breath, is intended to get the person to retain CO2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rapid breathing during diabetic ketoacidosis is called kussmaul breathing and it looks like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/raEKXVfuWTo" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/raEKXVfuWTo</a> if you see a kid doing this call EMS. It's likely that they have developed type 1 diabetes. </p></div>		</li>
