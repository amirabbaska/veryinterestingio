			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like you can combine two or more audio signals into one. The only important part is that both signals are synchronized, so that both start drawing the screen top to bottom at exactly the same time. This was often done manually at first with knobs on mixing consoles (with small monitors you see in the console), later on they invented autosync. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a broadcast engineer with many years experience. In the early days, cameras were fed the same sync pulses to keep them synchronized. They needed sync, blanking, H drive, V drive, and (for color) burst gate and subcarrier. Later cameras used genlock which enabled them to use a composite video signal as its sync reference. </p>
<p>I've never heard of the method you describe which used knobs. I don't see how it would work because the frequency has to be stable as well as the phase. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>trying to remember this right - every video source in our machine room had a special input called the timesync or black burst or something.  to set up the video signals of a new tape, we used a vectorscope to set the chroma level, hue and timebase correction.  the waveform monitor was used to set the luminance- the black level, peak level and baseline.</p>
<p>i am butchering the concepts, but this thread gave me a rush of memories - i was a master control operator at the local fox affiliate throughout the 90s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure why you're not being told about film stacking. You can stack a bit of film with titles on it on top of the show reel and super-impose the title over the footage that way. You connect the two with actual tape. The little holes at the top of both strips of film help you correctly align the two parts. </p>
<p>This is how it was done in the 80s for TV.</p>
<p>Cite: I spent the 80s in a national broadcaster's editing room.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because doing it on film is kind of intuitive, but on video is totally different. But yeah, it's worth mentioning that prior to computers being everywhere, a lot was filmed on actual film.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Early computers and electronics are great learning tools for technology, as our modern systems are smaller versions of these old mechanical solutions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With film, they also did some &quot;insane&quot; amount of work... The equivalent of green screen but man, the process was way harder: film your actor on a black background, duplicate the movie by overexposing it, which leave you a white mask of the actor, invert the film, then you can do &quot;easy&quot; superposition... Use the black mask and one roll to expose one film, then redo with the other mask and a second roll on the same film, and you mixed the two.</p>
<p>Expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a TV station as a Chyron operator.  This was about 10 years ago, but it was at an older TV station so we still had old stuff.</p>
<p>The Chyron would kinda be between modern day computer overlays and old school actual physical overlays.  It's known as the 'lower third'.</p>
<p>The Chyron was a like very basic word processing machine, I'm not even sure if it counts as a computer.  It looked like a TV with a built in keyboard.  The way it worked was I would go in 90 minutes before a show started and be given the script for the news show with all the titles and you would build your 'screens' in the same order as the show and prepare them all ahead of time, and then during the news you just advance through them.  </p>
<p>Think of it kinda like transparent powerpoint slides that you would get ready ahead of time to be overlayed on the news, except the machine your are typing them up on is only capable of basic text and image overlays.</p>
<p>Sometimes you would miss a title or something and that's how the wrong name comes up on the news for the wrong person.  You would advance to the next title and it wouldn't be there and it would show the one after it.  The Chyron was also used to show lottery numbers and stuff at our station, it was pretty old.  If the Technical Director wanted a new title or something on the fly he would yell it out and you'd have to type it up real fast.</p></div>		</li>
