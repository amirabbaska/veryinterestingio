<p>perhaps more importantly [this] means we are prepared to pay more for the convenience of having them this way.</p>

<p>The price of manufacture is often only a small part of what goes into pricing a product. The price which the public are willing to pay for it is usually far more significant, and I suspect that might be a large part of the answer in this case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that means your answer is simply supposing that they cost this much because the public is willing to pay this much. Basic capitalism says that if another company can make the peanuts for less, they will do so, and then the public will be much more willing to buy their product.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Oddfellow's point seems a lot more reasonable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buying unshelled peanuts means you need labor or machines to shell them. Assuming you can shell enough in an hour to make a jar, that act alone means your jars cost is <em>at least</em> an hour of minimum wage (or your hourly wage, if higher). </p></div>		</li>
