They just kind of hover around but when I come outside, they definitely dart towards my head. What gives? I feel like the insects have become meaner since I put up this sticky thing that attracts them and holds their carcasses. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wasps in your backyard have a high probability of being yellow jackets, which mean they're out to get everything</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often thought yellow jackets need to evolve to stop bothering humans.  Big dumb woodland creature gets near your nest? Sting it, because it'll leave the area.  Big dumb human creature gets near your nest?  If you sting it, it's going &quot;scorched earth&quot; on you, and will destroy you and your entire colony.  Better off just leaving it be, and it'll probably leave you be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may sound weird to ask, but do they hump when they mate? I saw a big one take down another bee and they ended up on the grass. I swear they started humping and making crazy bee noises. </p>

Wasps and hornets actually spread out of the nest for long distances, you'll only see one or four of the whole nest of 50 at a time.</p></div>		</li>

The flies then go batshit crazy, bouncing on walls, doing flips and going round in circles before getting exhausted and kicking it. I think it messes with their nervous system. It's really cool to watch.</p></div>		</li>
