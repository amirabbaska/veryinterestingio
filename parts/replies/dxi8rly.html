<p>The dust we know doesnt exist inside ISS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect.  The dust that you know isn't comprised of just soil.  Household dust is made up of pollen, cloth fibers, dead skin, pet dander, and all manner of other tiny particles.</p>
<p>Given the daily activities on ISS, there are all kinds of particulates in the air.  Every time an astronaut pulls apart Velcro, shuffles paper, or scratches their head <a href="https://youtu.be/akw6XBjD5ho" target="_blank">it creates dust particles</a>.  Keeping the ISS clean is a weekly activity, and it includes cleaning and changing air filters and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZiwtJDSizns" target="_blank">vacuuming the modules</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much.  I suppose my list was technically redundant, but I separated pet dander from human skin particles because not everybody has pets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, smells. Since the place is so closed up, they are very careful about how things smell. There is a guy who specializes in how things smell when they go to the ISS. <a href="https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/support/people/galdrich.html" target="_blank">https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/support/people/galdrich.html</a></p></div>		</li>
