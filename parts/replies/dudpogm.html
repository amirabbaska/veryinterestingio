			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you see the experiments they did on people that had this done? Give some crazy insight to how our minds work. One half of the brain can only describe things a specific way. They gave someone a ball and covered up one eye and they could not tell what it was but could describe its details. They covered the other eye and gave them the same ball they could describe its color and features but couldn’t tell what it did. Brains are weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've shown other oddities, my personal favourite was asking a patient to choose which colour they like most from say 5 different coloured balls laid out in front of them. Some patients would pick two balls simultaneously, suggesting each side of the brain had its own distinct preference and that one was usually overriding the other. </p>
<p>Oliver Sacks' 'the man who mistook his wife for a hat' has some other weird things the brain does, I'd suggest anyone that has an interest in the brain reads that book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! There is a test where one side could speak and the other could not defeating we may silence half our mind this has so many implications for psychological research. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The eyes are separated in more interesting way than this. Imagine you retinas as being the bit that is sensitive to light and imagine it being concave, because they are. When you focus on an object, the left half of the focal point and the rest of the image (periphery) in the same direction projects onto both eyes on the right half of both retinas. Think pinhole camera... The optic nerves converge at a trading point called the optic chiasma where what used to be traveling together as information from one eye becomes information traveling together from the right half of both retinas and is routed to the right hemisphere. So the visual space left of focal point goes to the right hemisphere, and interestingly enough the right hemisphere can’t do a whole bunch with language, especially not speaking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Language comprehension is highly specific and localised in the ATL in the left hemisphere.</p>
<p>Edit:
Expanding: This is part of the reason why split-brain patients can be manipulated to read a word in their right visual  field (contralaterally represented in the left hemisphere) and then be able to point at a proper picture of the term‘s object with their right hand only. If you then switch the visual field, they‘ll be able to identify words, but won’t be able to demonstrate understanding of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stories of split-brain patients have always had a strong impact on me. This kind of evidence provides such a powerful, raw, mechanical view into who/what we are as human beings. In particular, see this quote from <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain</a></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When one split-brain patient dressed himself, he sometimes pulled his pants up with one hand (that side of his brain wanted to get dressed) and down with the other (this side didn't). Also, once he grabbed his wife with his left hand and shook her violently, so his right hand came to her aid and grabbed the aggressive left hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is so bizarre. I still can't fully comprehend it.</p></div>		</li>
