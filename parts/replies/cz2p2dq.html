			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I would say smaller animals are less affected by G-forces, just as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/258cze/do_ants_die_if_they_fall_from_a_high_height/" target="_blank">ants don't die when they fall</a>. The bad news is that we may never have horses in space, or any other animal that is bigger than humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if i'm wrong, but I don't see any reason why a young horse could not be transported to space. Those things only weigh about 60kg. It is still very unpractical to have a horse on board though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>food supply provided was inadequate</p>

<p>I interpreted this to mean &quot;insufficient&quot; to the metabolic needs of the bees.   So they grew exhausted from the lack of food.   Not exactly lazy, and definitely not fat. </p></div>		</li>
