<p>Well file that under &quot;things I have never heard, ever.&quot; Huh!</p>
<p>Although, my mom's 67 and keeps getting things removed by a dermatologist. I thought they were moles, because she mentioned getting them biopsied. Is that abnormal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's something that's generally said among dermatopathologists, so it's hardly common knowledge.</p>
<p>'Mole' is actually not a very scientific term, it's just a generic one used by physicians. The broad term for what people are referring to in this thread is 'melanocytic naevus', but that's not likely to be what your mum has. Older people get cumulative skin damage due to sun exposure, which results in a variety of lesions, most of which you don't have to worry about. Pretty much any growing skin lesion will be biopsied, because it's easily done and there's always a chance it's one of the few types of skin cancer that might actually be harmful (i.e. Merkel Cell Carcinoma or Melanoma, plus a few other very rare ones).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also very skeptical of this. My small moles have noticeably grown over the last 10-20 years (childhood through young adulthood) and I also have some new ones. Not sun spots; moles. I've never heard or met anyone whose moles disappear.</p>
<p>Edit: noticeable <em>to me</em>. It's not as if my mole grew from 2mm to 5mm. There are a couple moles on my body and face that the derm. would likely want to take (<em>for science!!</em>), but the they don't fit the danger profile of moles. Yes, yes, any change in a mole can be dangerous but I've learned to take interweb medical diagnosis with a grain of salt. I see my primary physician and gyno every year. Perfect health. I have, however, been planning to see a derm to just map out all my moles. I have a lot of tiny ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moles can definitely grow and still be considered normal- a growing mole does not automatically indicate cancer. Yes- see a dermatologist to get them mapped and evaluated, and continue seeing a doctor annually to check for any changes that could indicate cancer. But just the fact that a mole is growing does not mean it's cancerous. Also, when you get them mapped, make sure to take off socks and show doc any that might be on ankles and feet. Most melanoma occurs in this area of the body.</p>
<p>Source: Have lots of moles, including some that have grown larger over time are still just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, Dermatologist here. What your 90+ year old woman more likely has are benign skin growths called Seborrheic keratosis and solar lentigines. These are, in fact, not &quot;moles&quot;, but are harmless growths that develop with age and a life time of sun exposure. It would be quite unusual for someone that old to actually have moles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is that why I have several moles that everyone say are &quot;birth marks&quot;/&quot;you've always had them&quot; but they arent in my baby pictures and they seem to have just appeared in my early years? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The truthful answer to that is that we're not really sure. You can get something called a congenital naevus which usually develops before birth. The other thing is that they might be naevi you were born with that have grown over time.
Something I didn't phrase very well in the above post is that the moles you have are normally visible throughout your life, but they aren't raised until people's mid-twenties when they migrate deeper into the skin, becoming what's called an intradermal naevus. They typically regress in older age, becoming flat and sometimes disappearing.
All I can say is that it's likely you had those moles since you were born, but they've become more prominent as you got older, and eventually they will disappear. But of course everyone is different, and if you truly think you have moles that have changed as you got older, you should see a dermatologist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people believe birth marks are marks of cause-of-death in an earlier life. (Not saying I believe that) I had a birth mark on my lower abdomine and a &quot;mirror&quot; mark on my lower back (not mole-like, just a darker area), like as if I had suffered a blow through those points in a previous life. I had the irregular moley mark removed for fear it would become cancerous, and the mirror mark disappeared on its own almost immediately afterward. Weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool. I keep an eye on the, one in particular but I talked to a doc appt it a few years ago because it stayed getting a bit darkest amd raised,they said it was fine as long as it didn't change drastically, so I'm just watching them for now, not to worried about it :)</p></div>		</li>
