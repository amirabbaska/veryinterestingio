			<div class="markdown"><p>You could argue against most of these yet you:
•hadn't given your own answer as to show you even have any knowledge in the matter
•hadn't depreciated any answer even though all of these are apparently arguable for your knowledge of the subject
•want to argue something that everyone has already generally agreed on hasn't even been answered anyways, not by themselves nor scientists, because it's the mind and we don't know much of it </p>
<p>I can argue shit too. Look at me Reddit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a response to the top comment, there I propose a different answer to OP's question. I graduated recently with a B.S in Neuroscience and I didn't want to write argument to each one because I'd be here all day.
Anyways, the purpose of my comment was not to say &quot;I can argue shit&quot; but to say that most of these answers that I read vary enough that OP should tread cautiously when taking these ELI5 responses in. I agree the brain has much to be discovered which is why the explanations vary from dendritic spines to spreading activation theory to latent learning and thus I warn OP to not take these responses as correct as they may seem. </p></div>		</li>
