			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have a &quot;window&quot;.  One time I started getting aura in a class, and (stupidly) decided I needed to get as close to home as possible before the pain hit.  I made it about 1/2 way.  I managed to get out of my car as my left arm went numb.  Sat there in tears trying to see my phone well enough to call my parents.</p>
<p>They are amazing.  They dropped everything and came and got me.  I was sitting in the empty field next to a building where they have a sort of farmer's market on the weekends.</p>
<p>I laid down in the back of the van and wished I was dead until we got home.  Then I wished I was dead in the comfort of my bed until it was time to vomit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry you have them so frequently. That must be so debilitating. I get them every few years and have literally dropped everything and left work, the gym, stores, etc to get home before that 30 minute period ends and I know the headache will start with a vengeance. The aura is actually pretty terrifying since you know what comes next. Best wishes. Hope they find something to help you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got mine around 21 then skips some years then got another. First 2 did have migraine headache after it but the other one that followed didn’t. Had surgery for kidney stones then the week I was recovering I was so sensitive to light for some reason and got a few of those visual auras in both eyes. Haven’t gotten them anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow this is so weird. I think I just started getting these (25). Have had 3 or so the last months and have scared the shit out of me. Seeing an eye doc to make sure but terrified when it kept happening with no other migraine symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>> The first thing is not everyone who has a visual aura has migraine pain and vice versa</p>
<p>I get the visual aura and hyper sensitivity to sound, but no pain other than extreme discomfort from the medium to loud sounds. </p>
<p>One trigger for my visual aura migraines was CRT flicker.</p>
<p>Taking magnesium daily reduces the frequency and intensity of my migraines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little jealous that there are non-pain migraines. I don't get auras, but I can feel a migraine coming on for hours or more. Sometimes (like now, in fact) I can feel it just hovering in the background delivering an occasional mild twinge. Monday I woke up and could tell I had one coming on. So I took a migraine pill (rizatriptan) and went to work. And it continued to slowly come on throughout the day until my eye was watering and I couldn't do anything but lay down when I got home at 7. I took another rizatriptan and a handful of ibuprofen and it went away. Woke up this morning and I could feel it on the other side of my head. Took another pill and it went away. Now it's back on the first side again, lurking. Maybe it'll go away, maybe it'll shock me out of bed at 2AM in extreme pain. Good times.</p>
<p>Oh and I only get 12 rizatriptan a month. Fuck migraines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get similar migraines every month or so. I started rounds of acupuncture and it helped so much! One round of acupuncture (6-8 sessions, depending) will significantly reduce my migraines for about 4-5 years. Once I start noticing my migraines coming more frequently, I know it’s time for an acupuncture “tune-up”. I highly recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My neurologist actually told me about magnesium. Said it doesnt help everyone, but those it does help it tends to be a significant amount. </p>
<p>Tips? It can cause stomach issues...but for me, the pain difference is worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure where I heard about the magnesium. Might have been my wife, who is a nurse practitioner. I take magnesium oxide. I also now make an effort to eat a banana or some citrus daily for the potassium. That seems to help keep my leg cramps at bay. Given how our body uses all these minerals for nerve and muscle function eating a balanced diet seems prudent, and can't hurt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s weird for me to read this on today of all days. I usually get about one migraine a month, and I have for 25 years or so now. Today when I woke up, I had the auras and hypersensitivity, but no actual pain. First time that’s EVER happened to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens to me all the time . I average a couple times a month . Sometime I get pain sometimes I don't. My migraines a precluded by at least a day of frequent urination . That's how I know they are coming . Then I can get nausea with the auras and hypersensitivity. It sucks. If I get the pain also, it double sucks .</p></div>		</li>
