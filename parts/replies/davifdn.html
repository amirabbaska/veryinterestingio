<p>Stars and solar systems in a galaxy aren't interacting much</p>

<p>That goes against why spiral galaxies have arms, and why these arms change over time. I think the explanation for OP's question is that the trajectories of individual stars is still unpredictable... because of the n-body problem, however when dealing with such huge numbers of stars, statistical approximations are good enough to model galaxies without being too faithful to how each individual star moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't interacting much as individual systems. </p>
<p>The distances involved are too large for most stars</p>
<p>However, each one feels the combined effect of the rest.</p>
<p>After some calculations, the radial acceleration of the Sun towards the center of the Milky Way:</p>
<p>2.16 x 10^-10 m/s^2</p>
<p>While the acceleration felt by the Sun from the Alpha Centauri system is: </p>
<p>7.76 x 10^-14 m/s^2</p>
<p>This acceleration due to the closest neighboring star system is 2780 times smaller than the combined effects of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>In essence most stars' motion around the Milky Way will be under the influence of mainly the galaxy as a <del>hole</del> <strong>whole</strong> with a small adjustment for limited local interactions.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>To get the radial acceleration towards center of Milky Way:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Speed of the Sun around the Milky Way =  average of the values in <a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/AngelaChan.shtml" target="_blank">here</a> - 230 km/s (converted to meters per second)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distance to the center of the Milky Way = average of the values in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center#Distance_to_the_Galactic_Center" target="_blank">here</a> - 7.95 kpc (converted to meters)</p>
</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_motion" target="_blank">circular motion formula</a> to get the radial velocity</li>
</ol>
<p>To get the acceleration due to the Alpha Centauri system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mass of the 3 stars from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" target="_blank">here</a> - 2.12 solar masses (converted to kg)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distance between the Sun and Centauri from the same link = 4.37 light years (converted to meters)</p>
</li>
<li>Use the equation for gravitational acceleration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration#For_point_masses" target="_blank">here</a></li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spiral galaxies have arms due to density waves in the plane of the galaxy. These density waves are due to coherent perturbation in the orbits of individual stars. Due to the coherence of the perturbation, they are assumed to be due to some object outside the galaxy, typically assumed to be a dwarf galaxy. Interactions between stars are not considered in the most basic form theory. Interactions between stars may be important as second order effects in areas of extreme density, meaning the galactic core, but to first order density wave theory does not depend on interactions between stars. </p></div>		</li>
