			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  I wonder whether the shift to rectangular was based on the precedent of paintings, or based on ultilization of a strip of film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rectangles just make more sense in most practical applications. Most of the circle pictures were already mounted on square paper, so you might as well fill out the whole square instead, and if you want a circle you can just cut it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely the production of film. Rectangular production wastes a lot less material than cutting out circles. Mix in film movie cameras needing the film to be locked together to move through the camera, circles just wouldn’t make sense. When movie theaters came to be, that’s when rectangle were likely solidified as the main shape for film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the only reason (as others have pointed out), but rectangular sensors also make sense for a purely economic level. </p>
<p>Camera sensors are cut out from larger sheets of silicon. If one cuts circular shapes, there's a large amount of waste silicon left on each sheet — it isn't like baking where one can just roll the scraps together and have them become a new sheet (at least, not without involving an expensive process).</p>
<p>The issue is compounded by the fact that due to the complex manufacturing process involved, sections of the sheet will be deemed unfit for camera technology (often resold/reused for different, less exact purposes). You can minimize waste again if you're able to section off the sheet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also make sense because displays, paper, books, etc, are all rectangular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention that wafer dicing is generally done with a circular saw. If you want anything other than straight lines through the whole wafer, you've got to use more expensive processes.</p></div>		</li>
