			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm! I have really watery eyes and I'm constantly having to clean specs of eye juice off my glasses. I at least have to use a microfiber cloth, as a regular t shirt or something just smears the juice around and leaves them blurry. I clean them with an alcohol wipe at least once a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the freezing point of water completely saturated in salt is still only around -21 degrees Celsius. Does this still work because of the time it would take to freeze the eyes? If the eyes were kept open long enough could they still freeze?</p>
<p>Edit: a number</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be misinformed but i thought salt works by binding to the h2o molecules and reducing their ability to connect to each other so it prevents large sheets of ice from forming? What does heat matter? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt plus snow makes salt water, which has a freezing temperature of 0°F instead of 32°F. </p>
<p>So there will be water, not ice, (assuming enough salt) until a colder temperature. </p>
<p>If the temperature is below 0°F salting the roads doesn't work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt does prevent ice from forming, but it also prevents sheets from <em>remaining as</em> ice. Even frozen, those molecules are still moving, and salt dissolves into the ice, and ice dissolves into the salt. In this process, the salt's atoms invade through the ice, destabilizing it. Then when any of the water molecules strike each other, instead of that energy transferring as heat (sending the molecule into a neighbor, which then smacks <em>its</em> neighbor), the energy breaks the electromagnetic grasp it has on its friends, and it is no longer kinetic energy at that point: the overall temperature decreases.</p></div>		</li>
