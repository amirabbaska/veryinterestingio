			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to the waste:</p>
<p>It's also way more tangible, alas less dangerous, than coal for example. Coal just produces smoke that poisons the air and releases more radioactivity than nuclear waste. But it's smoke. You can't really point at it.</p>
<p>You can point at barrels! </p>
<p>It's basically the choice between a bad idea and a worse idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not trying to be a jerk, but why don't you think barrels of nuclear waste are a big deal? Maybe it's because I live not far from the INL in Southern Idaho, but I worry about it a lot. There doesn't seem to be a good way to deal with the stuff. Nobody wants it in their state, so it ends up here- sitting on top of a giant aquifer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because with a little more funding there are already options to reduce the toxic elements of the waste that could be upsized to help if nuclear energy is used even more.</p>
<p>Toxic nuclear waste is also fairly well understood with how to contain it, the issue mainly is how do we deal with existing and future waste for 100k years. But if we put into place the toxic waste management programs that take the toxicity from 100k years to as little as 400 years then it becomes manageable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the issue - no one wants it for political reasons. If the political issue went away, there are plenty of safe ways to store it long term. </p>
<p>But because no one wants it long term, it end up in a worse place short term... forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair there are designs for coal plants that are much more efficient at complete combustion, sadly they're rarely used cause of cost to install without much real payback. Floating bed combustion comes to mind, I'd have to crack open an old text book to start naming other options though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The statistical danger isn't really the problem. It's that when something does go wrong it can destroy a city. I could understand if the chances were really low but there have been 99 notable failures for 450 plants worldwide. Sure not all of them end in tragedy but the risks aren't low enough to convince me nuclear is the way to go. If a windmill falls over the most damage it will do is property damage of maybe 2 acres. Solar/thermal/tidal have even less danger and I would even be in support of fission technology development because if it fails I am lead to believe the worst case scenario would be the plant collapsing but leaving the surrounding land unharmed. Even carbon neutral energy is better to me such as the algae scrubbing. </p>
<p>I would be more behind nuclear if the proponents for it didn't try to simply dismiss the failures. Humans are notorious for being imperfect and tbh having only a handful of failures is to be congratulated but risk vs reward isn't high enough for me to put the majority of chips on nuclear.</p>
<p>My current position is to update nuclear plants in the short run and maybe build a few more in order to support renewables as we develop the technology and then slowly phase it out and keep it as a backup technology connected to the grid in case of disaster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's the position of everyone who is pro-nuclear.  I've never met anyone who says nuclear is the long-term, permanent solution. It's a bridge technology that works now, and works economically, to immediately replace fossil fuels. That gives us more time to develop true (and cheap) renewables. </p>
<p>As much as people want it to be true, solar and wind are not economically competitive with fossils today. Americans are not willing to absorb the price increase to switch entirely to renewables, and developing countries are simply not capable of paying for it. </p>
<p>Nuclear is viable to replace fossil fuels entirely. Right now. And then it buys us 10, 50, 100 years to develop renewables to replace them long-term. That means at some point we need to deal with 100 years worth of nuclear waste, but I truly believe by then it will be cheap to just toss it into space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Too many people are completely mislead by the cold, &quot;rational&quot; thinking of &quot;statistical unlikeliness&quot;, as if the world works like that. It doesn't.</p>
<p>Of course the fears are mostly blown out of proportions, but that doesn't change the actual reality of what happens when shit happens. &quot;Statistics&quot; are irrelevant compared to actual reality ... and actual reality is all which that matters, because when shit happens it's going to stay that way for far longer than anyone's lifetime.</p>
<p>You'll realize that as soon as something &quot;statistically unlikely&quot; hits you personally. Then suddenly, that cold &quot;rational&quot; thinking exposes itself as what it really was: A disconnection from reality.</p></div>		</li>
