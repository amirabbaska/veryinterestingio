<p>Thousands and thousands of these tiny cracks will scatter light as it passes through or reflects off the surface, giving it a milky white colour.</p>

<p>This sounds a lot like Mie scattering, you know if that's the reason?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thought Mie scattering was just light that got roughly scattered 90 ish degrees, while Rayleigh and Dubai scattering have little or no 90 degree scattering, this allows you to target a particle size using a wavelength that gets you mie scatter and the amount of Mie scatter correlates to a concentration. This method of determing concentration through mie scatter is called nephelometry. The particles are often increased in size using antibodies and depending on where they fall in the zone of equivalence has some effect on calculating concentration as well but I've forgotten</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Mie scattering is especially strong in forward scattering, at 90Â° you'll mostly get Raighley scattered light.
However that's not the point here. The important thing is that Mie scattering is nearly independent of wavelength, that means that mie scattering will lead to a white color. It's the reason why clouds are white, same for milk or ice (if we're,re talking about the kind of ice on the north and south pole with lot's of bubbles and not some perfect crystal).
I can't really comment on your measurement technique as I'm a physicist and not a biologist/chemist and thus have little experience with those kind of measurements. Mie scattering shows resonances in terms of particle size vs wavelength though, you could surely use that to determine the size of your particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue it's actually due to stress crystallization of the polymer. The stress forces the molecules into alignment which changes their refractive index relative to the amorphous phase. The mismatched indexes cause scattering. The reason I support this explanation rather than the air pocket one is that reversing the stress usually reverts the polymer to mostly transparent, except in a few spots where it's been permanently crystallized. </p>
<p>A further test would be to anneal the sample at it's glass transition temperature and see if the cloudiness disappears. You might have to go hotter to reach the melting point of the crystalline phase, but it should relax back to its lowest energy state. In something like polystyrene where this phenomenon is commonly observed, annealing should cause a return to amorphous material which can even be seen on a DSC trace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Id also like to point out that adding heat often minimizes these white marks. Learned on google because i own a 4 wheeler with blue plastics that were covered in white marks a hair dryer and some time minimized those marks i was impressed </p></div>		</li>
