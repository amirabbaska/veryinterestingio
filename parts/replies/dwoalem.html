			<div class="markdown"><p>Color isn’t the only indicator of what a mold is. We know what molds are incredibly common or are used in production of specific products. In the case of blue cheese, the producer inoculated it with a mold culture. There if a mold other than blue develops they will have a problem. If it’s blue they are sure it’s the one they put in the product. </p></div>		</li>
