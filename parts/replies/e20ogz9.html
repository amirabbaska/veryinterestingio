			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume the moon would not be salty <em>because</em> it has no rain. Kind of.</p>
<p>Rain is slightly acidic due to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. When it falls onto rocks that are basic (as in opposite of acidic, not that it listens to Ed Shareen), a chemical reaction occurs that results in salts.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the moon is made of, but its lack of gases and water would prevent any reactions from occuring.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why was the ground salty?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both sodium and chlorine are fairly abundant elements in the universe, created when stars explode (supernova). The earth's crust and mantle has plenty of these elements too. River &amp; ocean water has filtered repeatedly through the earth and ended up collecting all the loose minerals over billions of years. Sodium and chlorine bond to form sodium-chloride (i.e. salt). </p>
<p>It may <em>seem</em> like there is a lot of salt in the ocean, the actual salt content only makes up 3.5% of all ocean water...and the oceans themselves barely make up 0.1% of the earth's total volume. As far as the planet is concerned, our oceans (and all the salt in them) are just a few drops in the bucket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And is the Moon salty, since it doesn't have rain?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moon most likely does have a small amount of sodium and chlorine locked-up in it's crust. However salt is best formed as a result of flowing water (or some other liquid) that goes through a cycle of evaporation and condensation. So <em>technically</em> the moon has the elements to create salt, but it's lacking the active processes to &quot;free&quot; it from the rock. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you go to a river, you'll notice that a lot of the rocks have been worn smooth. Rocks are made up of various minerals, and the river and rainwater eats away at them over time. </p>
<p>Over the millions of years that our water cycle has been going, these rocks have been being dissolved, and the minerals end up in the ocean. When water from the ocean evaporates, it leaves all these minerals and salts behind, to which makes the ocean have more Parts of salt per Parts of water. </p>
<p>I'm sure there's a little more to it than that, but if you take the water away, the salt is left behind is the basis of it. The salt came from somewhere, and that somewhere is everywhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. There is only a certain amount of salt that can be dissolved in water, this changes depending on things like temperature and pressure.</p>
<p>I think under standard condition the most salt you can dissolve in water is 26.54g (73.46g of water) in 100.00ml solution alternatively you could say 36.13% salt in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. And sea creatures will adapt to it because it only took a few 100 million years to reach 35g of salt per liter of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The majority of our salt comes from salt mines. undoubtedly, salt would have leeched in underground water supplies leading out to the ocean. Still bothers me that our salt is mined rather than a hydropowered distillery(though we'd eventually throw off the salt balance of the ocean)</p></div>		</li>
