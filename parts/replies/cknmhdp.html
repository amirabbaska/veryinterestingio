			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with everything you said, but there's a slight typo. You said 'A normally open relay, one that requires power to keep the circuit open rather than closed'. A NO relay is open while de-energized, a NC relay is closed while de-energized. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't more dummy circuits and detection circuits make the bomb easier to diffuse in some manner or another. All the circuits would have to communicate with a common device that is responsible for the explosion. So it would be a matter of finding the device everything else points to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're going to build a hard-to-defuse bomb, put it in a big box with a false bottom that hides an actual triggering mechanism that's underneath the bomb. Then pack the box full of crap that looks like something but (maybe) really isn't. You can make multiple independent circuits that either do nothing or set off the bomb - there's no rule that says you can only have one trigger or one detonator on a single bomb.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a cellphone, a battery, a wind-up alarm clock and a Tickle-Me-Elmo doll all wired together with a capacitor, some blinking lights, a couple of relays, the ignition switch off a 1978 Chrysler and about 85 different wires. All of these things do absolutely nothing but disguise the few real wires that go from a different battery through a time-delay relay and a couple of little black plastic boxes that have 8 or 10 different wires coming in and out of them (so you can't easily tell which wire is the live wire) and all of the wires then go to several little black plastic boxes stuck on the side of the bomb. </p>
<p>One of the boxes stuck on the side of the bomb might be a blasting cap and just needs to be removed to defuse the bomb, except that it's holding in a pressure switch buried inside the bomb with the wires running down through the bottom so removing it sends current straight to the real detonator underneath. The Tickle-Me-Elmo doll may also have a mercury switch inside him that will set off the bomb if you try moving it and one of the little black plastic boxes may be a photocell that closes a circuit if the box is opened and light gets to it. </p>
<p>Or maybe the &quot;bomb&quot; is just a box full of balloons that when the timer goes off a solenoid pushes out a pin that pops the balloons with a loud but harmless &quot;Bang!&quot; to scare everybody. The balloons are filled with the Ebola virus.</p></div>		</li>
