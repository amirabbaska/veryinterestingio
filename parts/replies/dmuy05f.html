			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is one that I was given IRL, which drove me to ask Reddit. instead...
Where do you get food for <em>Martians?</em>  Where do you get trees to build <em>Martian</em> houses?  We're running out of resources - wouldn't sending them to another planet just catalyze the loss of this one?
I do actually think population control needs to be better handled, but people have feelings &amp; want families, myself included.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I waited until I was 30 before having a child.. and had only one.</p>
<p>If people would put off having kids, and limit themselves to one or two.. we &quot;could&quot; be sustainable.  The problem is that some people have kids very young and have lots of kids.. since we are living longer than ever before this means that we have several generations alive at the same time which is really the bulk of the problem.  </p>
<p>Our birth rate is going down, but as we live longer over population is a huge issue.  So.. have a family, but have a small family, and don't start your family when you are young.  It's better to save up some money anyhow first, at least buy a house with a low mortgage!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I certainly agree with a lot of what you say, I'm a believer in good parents having more kids to offset the idiot parents who are having kids at the pace of rabbits.</p>
<p>Reason: I've watched the movie Idiocracy.</p>
<p>On a serious note, waiting too long can make pregnancy riskier for both the mom and baby.  But obviously having kids too young is also a problem for some people who aren't ready to be good parents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the idea is that both making inhabitable place habitable within our own atmosphere and on another planet have the same fundamental problems, like you mentioned (how to get food etc) research is focusing on doing this for space more than within our own atmosphere because the payoff is far greater. The research is going to be almost the same (If we can achieve one we should theoretically quite easily apply it out doing the other without much further work), but the reward difference is massive. Between placing more people in (even a large dessert) which resources we have already have some understanding of, compared to a whole planet worth of space (multiple times larger than the ocean and desserts) with the additional whole planet worth of space to either obtain more resources or even discover new resources. </p>
<p>I'd liken it to learning to drive stick / manual (colonising another planet) vs learning automatic (making inhabitable place within our our atmosphere habitable. The difficulty of actually learning both is quite similar but by doing stick (another planet) we have a much greater understanding and actually will allow us to do both while doing automatic (own atmosphere) its not as easy to transfer to the other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't true at all. There is a <em>lot</em> of empty space here. Like you could literally fit the entire human population into Rhode Island, standing room only.</p>
<p>The problem is resources. We need to develop technology to better harvest the Earth's resources in a sustainable manner, and better harvest the Sun's energy, and we're working on both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about you.. but I don't see any empty space here.  I see forests, fields, swamps.. space for deer, fish, lizards.  The only empty space I see is when I look skyward.  The ground is full of something, even if it's not full of humans, it's full of something. </p>
<p>The idea of fitting all the people into Rhode Island is stupid.  Who wants to live there standing up only?  And would we be cannibals with no roofs over our heads in case of rain?  I mean we would  have to eat each other since this idea allows no room for farm land.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not saying we literally should all fill RI. It's an illustration of just how huge Earth is compared to humanity. The more technology allows us to use the available resources efficiently, the less &quot;Earth&quot; we need to support us, and the more is available for nature. Populations growth tends to level out and even decline as nations develop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, though you didn't mention the bigger reason for over-population. It is health care that has more impact; life expectancy has risen dramatically over the last few hundred years. Birth rates are going down the world over, especially in developed nations. </p></div>		</li>
