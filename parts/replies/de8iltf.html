			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you've got a source, I'd be more inclined to believe that the effect of contracted vs. relaxed neck musculature has an insignificant, if at all, effect on cerebral perfusion. Furthermore, increased cerebral perfusion is not synonymous with &quot;better thinking&quot; unless your brain isn't getting enough blood to begin with, which is not the case with simply an &quot;unsupported&quot; chin. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Update: Speaking from experience, not research based</p>

<p>Which basically means &quot;this is probably bullshit cause I have no idea what I am talking about&quot;. This sub should have stricter moderation, because otherwise it is a breeding ground for misinformation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that this sub should have a little better moderation, but with this particular answer I feel it's like when someone posts that Navy Seal copypasta: it's not a big deal because no one actually believes it. I think most users reading this answer laughs at it.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>It's a lot easier to think when body is in relaxed state and the more upward blood flow goes to brain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm a little skeptical of this point. I can see more extreme edge cases affecting neural blood flow but most of the time you should have pretty consistent blood flow within the brain. The body knows that your brain is very important so it works very hard to keep it supplied with blood. In fact, it goes so far as to decouple the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular dynamics (i.e. blood flow in the body is not necessarily a good predictor of blood flow in the brain). I don't have the sources for that on hand but I can dig them up if you like, I read a number of papers related to that during my master's thesis</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree body has protective mechanism for critical organs, but I doubt there is hard switch from &quot;regular&quot; case like feeling dizzy (sometimes) when standing-up versus &quot;edge&quot; case like g-loc. As always body is complex, and could be a affected by blood oxygen level, load on nervous system, etc.</p></div>		</li>
