			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a good Mighty Car Mods episode, called &quot;Turbocharged vs Supercharged&quot;.</p>
<p>They found that the Super creates an additional few percent of power over the complete rev range.</p>
<p>The Turbo created no boost for the early part of the rev range, but then a high degree of power over the remaining rev range. </p>
<p>They concluded that for the cars and engines that they work with most, the Turbo is the more flexible option. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats one of the big dangers of Turbochargers btw. You will often read &quot;and then the Turbocharger kicks in....&quot; in a video about driving cars with one.</p>
<p>The problem is, if you dont anticipate that sudden boost, you might crash the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty simplistic and also outdated.  Variable vein turbos and positive displacement superchargers largely contradict this.</p>
<p>Also, the whole lower RPM or &quot;instant&quot; power idea is actually because superchargers are tied directly to engine RPM and respond immediately to throttle changes.  But variable vein turbos and bi-turbo systems a very comparable to superchargers at low RPM's these days due to advances in materials used to make them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All things being equal, yes.  But there are many different designs.  Twin turbos, for example, use two smaller turbos.  They have less mass to move so require less exhaust gas buildup, so you get power sooner.  </p>
<p>Modern superchargers engage when you need power but, simply speaking, &quot;go freewheel&quot; when you don't, making the car drive more tame and improving fuel economy when power isn't needed.  </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Most use a &quot;sequential&quot; system which utilizes a smaller and larger turbo. The smaller spools quickly to help low end power until the larger turbo can get spun up to speed, at which point the smaller turbo is bypassed.</p>
<p>Here is a good overview of all the different ways you can twin turbocharge.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most superchargers (roots-style) sit on top of the engine, not all. Those that do, usually have an integral intake manifold to mate to the engine block and heads. They also usually have a mounting flange for carburetor(s) or fuel injection plate/throttle body.</p>
<p>There are other superchargers of the dynamic nature, such as centrifugal design, that are pretty similar in design to a turbo, but are belt-driven instead of by the exhaust gas. These are well suited for fuel injection applications where modification of the intake is not desirable. </p></div>		</li>
