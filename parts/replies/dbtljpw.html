			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not about conservation of energy, it's not about being hot. It's about something else which I will try to explain here.</p>
<p>Imagine a laser beam, nice and parallel. It's has a certain width (i.e. position spread) which is non-zero / finite / 'large w.r.t. the focus we will introduce later', and also a certain angular spread which is zero as the beam is parallel.</p>
<p>Next, with a lens, you (try to) focus the laser beam into a 'point'. Now, the position spread is very small. This must mean, due to conservation of etendue, that the angular spread has increased. Now, how smaller you want the focus to be, the larger the angular spread you need the beam to have.</p>
<p>If you imagine a laser being focused with a lens, the angular spread is geometrically determined by the width of the laser beam and the focal point of the lens (distance between the lens and the focus). Therefore, to decrease the size of the focus, you need to increase the width of the laser beam and decrease the focal length of the lens.</p>
<p>Note: In microscopy, by the way, this is called NA, numerical aperture: instead of focusing light into a small point, the light emerging from one small point must be distinct from the light from a small point nearby. I.e. to get a good magnification and to see small things, you need a high NA. This is why the lens in a microscope has to be very close to the sample.</p>

<p>Another important point, which was first here, I moved to a new comment up in the tree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easiest way to understand that is fundamental thermodynamics.  Heat always moves to equilibrium, so the only way to heat something up is to expose it to something hotter.</p>
<p>The best you can achieve with an optical system (in theory) is to effectively surround an object with the surface of the sun, so that a line at every angle from it ends at the sun, in which case it will heat to that same temperature, as if it were literally <em>at</em> the sun.  (well, photons lose energy climbing out of the sun's gravity well, but close)</p>
<p>The key is that an optical system is reversible.  If you could take light from two points on the sun and focus them onto the same point, then a photon travelling the other way would have to split in half, which isn't allowed.  So two points on the sun have to end up at two separate locations in the focused image, closer together but arriving in less-parallel rays.</p>
<p>So a lens can never focus light into a point except light from a point source, it can only make a smaller image than you would normally see, and it has to take up a larger part of the field of view to do that.</p></div>		</li>
