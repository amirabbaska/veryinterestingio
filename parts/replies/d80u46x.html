			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be controversial within academic linguistics, but it's slightly less controversial within the field of cognitive linguistics. Most laymen (and researchers) think about complexity in terms of minimal information required to form a grammatical sentence. For instance, some Turkish verbs require a special suffix, called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidentiality#Indirectivity_.28type_I.29" target="_blank">evidential</a>, which marks whether a source of information is known directly or indirectly. In English it is enough to say &quot;I came home&quot;, whereas in Turkish you are required to say something like &quot;It is obvious that I came home.&quot; In other words, Turkish is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=iEff_YCrGpgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=overspecification+grammar&amp;ots=4rHe2zQKur&amp;sig=NSVfGMLULohV637pYAq0JVhjgUY#v=onepage&amp;q=overspecification%20grammar&amp;f=false" target="_blank">overspecified</a> when compared to English. <a href="http://wals.info/" target="_blank">WALS</a> is a database of language structures.</p>
<p>Now that we have a way of measuring complexity, we can begin making comparisons. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008559" target="_blank">Some researches have found</a> that languages with larger numbers of speakers tend to have lower levels of grammatical complexity (e.g., less obligatory information: you can talk about coming home without the need of an evidential marker, as above). This is probably because languages with lots of speakers tend to be culturally dominant languages that are learned by many non-native speakers. Adults are bad at learning language, and when they encounter complicated linguistic structures, they often deal with this by simplifying those structures, in a way similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creolization" target="_blank">creolization</a>. Another way of thinking about this is that children are excellent language learners, capable of learning extremely complicated languages, whereas adults are less competent. Languages evolve to fit the social structures of their speakers, so languages that are frequently learned by adults tend to evolve simpler structures.</p>
<p>It's easy to see how this might be interesting in a historical context: as political, economic, and cultural units have grown larger and <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6951/abs/424900a.html" target="_blank">the rate of language death has increased</a>, there are more languages like English, spoken by many people as a second language all around the world, and fewer languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadza_language" target="_blank">Hadza</a>, which is learned only by children in a small and homogeneous community.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're only measuring complexity on one dimension and ignoring a multitude of factors that could be said to make a language more complex.  For example: the size of the phonemic inventory, the 'markedness' of phonemes in the inventory (this one is a bit controversial), the presence or absence of phonemic voice quality or tone, the allowance or disallowance of complex syllable structure, the presence or absence of underlying foot structure etc...  </p>
<p>You are only arguing that semantically Turkish is more complex than English, but the question is about the language as a whole and is relatable to a much more complex question which is problematic exactly because there are so many levels on which to measure complexity and it is very difficult or impossible to compare across levels without assigning arbitrary weights to the different levels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The study that's most relevant is the Lupyan and Dale paper that I linked above. They used mostly grammatical features found in WALS, but I believe they might have also recently done another analysis that included phonemic features as well, but I'll have to check up on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a linguist in my former life, I like your argument but I don't know that I agree with the part about widely-spoken languages becoming simpler as a result if having many speakers who need to learn it after the sensitive period.</p>
<p>Take for example French and English. In many ways, French syntax can be said to be more complex than English: grammatical gender, moderate use of inflected verbs, etc. It appears to be more challenging to learn than English, for adults and children alike (source: have been research coordinator on a study focusing on this; it was ran by psychologists though, so meh. Also have extensive experience dealing with immigrant communities in Quebec where you must learn both to get permanent residence)</p>
<p>Now, English is a dominant language nowadays, which would seem to land credence to your argument. But it has been gradually losing its complexity for hundreds of years, with most inflexions disappearing from usage centuries ago when it was only spoken locally and had no international value.</p>
<p>French (or to be exact the many regional patois it was based on), on the other hand has been roughly as complex as it is now for a long time. And in that time, it was able to serve as the language of international diplomacy for a few hundred years, bolstered not by its simplicity or ongoing simplification, but by the sheer prestige that France carried around the world as a dominant economic force at the time.</p>
<p>So I would argue &quot;wide-spreadedness&quot; has more to do with the social pressures to learn a specific language, by virtue of the importance of its home country. I will concede though, that <em>all other things being equal</em>, people are likely to be drawn to a language that has a reputation for being &quot;easier&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't the point that languages become widespread because they are easier, rather that they become easier as they are widespread. French, on the other hand, was widespread as a diplomatic language - an elite language - therefore wouldn't have the same pressures to reduce completely as English, which, for example was adopted by millions of common immigrants to the US</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you limit your analysis to, say, inflected languages, does that make any difference? I got my bachelors in Latin and Greek a lifetime ago (okay, about half a decade, but I've forgotten everything), and there seems to be a qualitative difference in the rigid declension and conjugation system of Latin and the looser, more irregular systems of French, Spanish, and Italian (I know absolutely nothing about Romanian). I don't know whether a language with more irregularity is more or less &quot;complex,&quot; but is there a commonly accepted reason for why case seems to exist only vestigially in pronouns in most of the modern Romance languages?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People seem to assume that inflections are the be all and end all of linguistic complexity. As if the only way to judge how complex a language is has to be via inflections. But that's completely misguided. A language such as Malay is not super complex in terms of inflections but has a syntax and system of reduplication that is absolutely sublime. And Cantonese with all is tones that make inflections irrelevant when it comes to this very same &quot;complexity&quot;. </p>
<p>So my point is just because a language is morphologically complex don't mean a goddamn thing in this department. Even the daughter languages of Latin made it up in other areas when they lost their morphological complexity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure why you mention reduplication. I don't know what reduplication is used for in Malay, but reduplication is often inflectional (indicating things like plural in nouns, habitual or iterative in verbs, etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To the extent that you're taking an enormous domain (entire languages) and picking out a part of them (their inflectional systems), it makes the problem of quantifying complexity more doable. I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/52ybq0/could_neanderthals_speak/d7psp3y?context=3" target="_blank">wrote about</a> one of the more important papers on quantifying morphological complexity on /r/AskAnthropology about a week ago. A big take-away from that research is that while there seems to be no bound on the number of word-forms a language might have for a lexeme (e.g. Archi has half-a-million verb forms for every verb), systems are organized so that the more forms of a lexeme there are, the easier they are to predict from each other and this appears to produce an upper bound on the entropy/uncertainty of inflectional systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to add that in many languages (most?), even if there are a half-million possible inflected forms, large scale corpora only show a very small subset of those forms actually occuring (see Karlsson 1986; Arppe 2003 for a discussion of this with Finnish nouns and verbs (respectively), which have thousands of possible inflections)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about stuff that doesn't really carry information, like noun genders? All other things being equal, a language with more genders (and thus more declensions) would be comparatively more complex than a language with fewer genders, wouldn't it? (Okay, so sometimes noun genders do convey meaning, but mostly they're just grammatical artifacts, as for as I know.)</p></div>		</li>
