			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, although I have to admit, if I was 5 I would probably lose focus somewhere along the bomp bah bomp bah bomp. Then  briefly resurface when you talk about pie, only to be further confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The word &quot;pie&quot; <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pie" target="_blank">comes from &quot;pīca&quot;, the Latin name of the bird &quot;magpie&quot;</a>, as it was an unpredictable collection of ingredients and a magpie &quot;will eat almost anything&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Pīca&quot; derives from the Proto-Indo-European word &quot;<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/(s\)peyk-" target="_blank">speyk</a>&quot;, which describes the same bird.</p>
<p>If there were an early Indo-European nation named for pie, it would be &quot;<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Uzbekistan" target="_blank">Speykistan</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>(Note: The nation of Uzbekistan actually got its name from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbeks#Rule_of_Mongols_and_Timurids" target="_blank">Uzbek tribe</a> which conquered the region in the early 16th century.  The true origins of the tribe's name are lost to history, but &quot;Uzbek&quot; may derive from the Turkish words &quot;<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/uz#Turkish" target="_blank">uz</a> <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bek" target="_blank">bek</a>&quot;, meaning &quot;proficient governor&quot;.)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To further elaborate, what you're referring to with the Indus River was called the Sindhus River which runs through the Himalayas mostly through modern day Pakistan, India and China. It was the name given to people in the Indian subcontinent region from centuries back by Persians, and over time the term became Hindus, which further got applied to the spiritual side of things as the British colonialists came over and tried to distinguish the people from the lifestyle and religious practices.</p></div>		</li>
