			<div class="markdown"><p>Not trying to undermine the spirit of this comment since I generally agree, but if we are splitting hairs, a methodologically sound anecdote is actually sufficient to definitively answer a question of the form &quot;is it possible for <em>x</em> to happen&quot;?</p>
<p>EDIT: This is particularly worth mentioning for an experiment that would necessarily involve human subjects experiencing permanent trauma. It's extremely unlikely that we would ever really have anything other than anecdotal evidence if we are using ethical science.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But as a practical matter, this is /r/askscience and I think it's clear what we're admonishing. We simply don't want the waters muddied with hundreds of &quot;I had a nightmare and...&quot; comments. </p></div>		</li>
