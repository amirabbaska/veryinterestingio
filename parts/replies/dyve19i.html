			<div class="markdown"><p>are you suggesting police officers appointed with a duty to uphold the law “suddenly remember” and “suddenly forget” key statements regarding the prosecution of a suspect, with enough influence to sway the case, in regards to their professional relationship with other legal enforcement teams?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is exactly what I’m saying (not suggesting). I have personally witnessed it on multiple occasions. </p>
<p>Between my career and dating a sergeant for a couple years, I am convinced that police break the law more often than the average person. Soooo....uphold the law? Selectively at best. </p>
<p>Edit: I should add that this is department-based. With over 18,000 LEOs and no effective universal regulations or standards, practice varies significantly from department to department. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is that not a crime.   Take a written statement at the time of arrest/whatever and if the cup changes his story he's now charged with perjury. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed his first point, it's irrelevant if it's a crime.  Prosecutors have to PROSECUTE a crime, they don't get prosecuted by magic.  Prosecutors WON'T prosecute a cop unless overwhelming public pressure and then, because they don't want to burn those relationships, will intentionally throw the case.</p>
<p>The fact it's a crime is irrelevant, crimes don't mean shit without anybody to enforce them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If nobody has any interest in arresting you, nor in charging you, nor in convicting you or punishing you in any way, is it still a crime?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah of course... but Therein lies the problem: We say perjury, they say &quot;testilying is a tried and true standard operating procedure that helps guarantee a conviction&quot; and keep doing it. We say &quot;you ran over a pedestrian for no reason&quot;, they say &quot;he was resisting cardiac arrest and that's a crime so we were in the right&quot;. We say 'torture and execution of an innocent', they say &quot;delete the video or else you're next&quot; and then do even worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do that all the time, I have seen it with my own eyes as party to criminal cases.  Hell you ever wonder how prosecutor gets people out of trouble when there is still public pressure to prosecute them, they simply ask the cops to &quot;forget&quot; or hell not even show up.  Hell my boss for example is a well respective local figure but there was public pressure to see him prosecuted after a highly visible DUI and an election was coming up.  Magically all the arresting police failed to show up all three trials and the case was dismissed.  The public &quot;won&quot; because he was prosecuted, the politicals &quot;won&quot; because he didn't actually get in trouble.  Cops are political creatures, don't pretend they aren't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I wrong to say it’s not evidence if it’s not recorded? You can’t tamper with if it was never created. Now if it was recorded and the officer deleted it that’s a different story. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a good point. So if the recording is just willfully turned off, it could be charged out as obstruction of justice, I suppose. </p>
<p>I had a case with four cops. You hear one say “bodycams off,” but one of the four didn’t get the message and continued to record, while they all discuss how to pin drugs on someone. I think that certainly could have been charged out as obstruction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That also happens. There are videos of cops raiding houses and destroying all the cameras in the house, then they destroy the hard drive they were connected to. The only reason we know about it is because the cameras were uploading the footage live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i think any police related investigation shouldn't be an &quot;internal affairs&quot; matter, rather an outside (far away) law enforcement agency comes in to investigate.
