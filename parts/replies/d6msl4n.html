			<div class="markdown"><p>Survival instinct. They are tired and resting. When bugs are incapable of righting themselves up they tend to give up after a while. So, they rest and try again after resting. Some bugs will play dead as well if unable to right themselves up, but you flip them over, they can and will scurry away. Basic survival instinct.</p></div>		</li>
