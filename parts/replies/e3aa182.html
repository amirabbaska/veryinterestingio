<p>You're probably correct..but on a similar note, I think you'd like <a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/" target="_blank">this map</a>.</p>
<p>Search for 'Gadget' in the drop down to see the effects of the Trinity test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He’s not talking about photos of the bombs explosion—he’s talking about the footage you see where the camera is 20-30ft (seemingly) away from trees, houses, and cars that have their branches, siding, paint, etc, stripped and blasted away like dust, all while the camera doesn’t so much as shake or vibrate in the least...</p>
<p>The photos are easy, he’s talking about the actual destructive explosion footage, that tends to look sort of like scaled down models being destroyed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah thats a possibility.  I would have thought the camera would be affected in SOME way though, especially back then, not being all that advanced and all compared to today.  Even the cameras that are there at some rocket launches get messed up pretty good, and thats even with the cameras set up on a tripod, far away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In such cases the cameras would again be in heavy bunkers, facing away from the blast, sometimes built into the side of a little hill. So the blast and whatnot is flowing over the camera, not into it. </p>
<p>It is far easier to protect a small camera from an atomic blast than a house; it's just about hardening the area around it from the effects of the bomb, but making sure it can still see whatever it needs to see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the Trinity test, yes, they sent out a lead-lined tank. It had a hook on it, and could drag the photo cameras out of their &quot;sled&quot; into a non-contaminated area. It was a clever setup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At a certain point, those won't cut it. They'll prevent you from inhaling or ingesting radioactive particles/fallout, which is great, and is sufficient for most real-world nuclear incidents... but they won't stop you from being exposed to the actual <em>radiation</em> which is being emitted by the fallout. Gamma rays will go through your hazmat suit.</p>
<p>You'd need some kind of lead-covered suit to actually block the radiation itself, but those are too heavy to be practical, from what I've read.</p>
