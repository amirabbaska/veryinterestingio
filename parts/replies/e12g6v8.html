			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for the US, but in Europe the delay is real - you can see it if you are in the stadium and watch the TV as well (available in the bars in the stadium).</p>
<p>Interestingly, radio has 0 delay: you can watch the match while listening to the live commentary and there is no noticeable delay. </p></div>		</li>
