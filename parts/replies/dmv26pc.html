<p>I'm intrigued. What is this formula? Does it have a name? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Liquid water can only reach 100C at ambient pressure (liquids are really really really hard to compress, you usually can't). Gaseous water (steam) can reach any temperature you set your heating element to. Containing it in a fixed volume will be hard tho as gases like to expand when heated, thus why it's &quot;put under pressure&quot;. The pressure has to go up in order to have the volume to stay constant (remember high school chemistry PV=nrT). Steam sanitation is safer because steam goes to higher temperatures, iz all.</p></div>		</li>
