<p>Yes... because it breaks easily. So its actually being used for the opposite of structural integrity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's completely unrelated. The question was about using it in a structural application. This is essentially the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are mistaken. </p>
<p>Its use in spacecraft going to the moon proves that it can be used in space.  No one had done their research and just made stuff up to say it could not be used. It was used as a component of at least 3 spacecraft that went to the moon- so it did not disintegrate in space like some people mentioned, and it did have structural properties that where desired and could last long enough to make the Journey to the moon and do its job. Most of the structures on the moon do not hold a vacuum so what makes it unsuitable? Do you have a source, or are you just making things up like the other guys?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why did they use balsa wood instead of aluminum? I know balsa wood made some amazing fighters during ww2, but surely space is a different beast entirely? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They used it because it was lightweight, <del>strung</del>  strong and crushes absorbing energy. Think of it like Styrofoam but more structurally sound and resistant to UV.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Balsa wood has a greatly superior strength to weight ratio compared to aluminum, so that is one reason.</p></div>		</li>
