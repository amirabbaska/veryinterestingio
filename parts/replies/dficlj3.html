			<div class="markdown"><p>if this tech comes to fruition, it will not be used to connect minds to
a kind of &quot;mental internet&quot; on a large scale. if that use is ever perfected, it will be used by scientists to combine their knowledge and intelligence agencies to ensure a spy has no secrets. it is my assumption that most people will fear and not use that aspect of this technology. as with it they can hold no more secrets. if you had a secret, it might become possible for someone to interface with your brain and tear out that secret, maybe even without you knowing about it. </p>
<p>if we ever get this tech into large scale production, it might be possible to erase individuality, to turn everyone connected to this &quot;neruanet&quot; into mindless slaves. </p>
<p>we might also become essentially immortal gods on another level of intelligence where there is no room for petty human emotions like hatred. becoming a empire spanning the entire galaxy. </p>
<p>personally i would not hesitate to take this risk. as the only other alternative is the eventual extinction of our race. this is a tech that can bring immortality. either that or extreme long life is required for humanity to survive. at the moment our lives are too fleeting to do much to change what those before us have done. as a result, nature outside humanity is in turmoil. eventually we will create a situation which we cannot recover from without simply more intelligence. </p>
<p>this tech might lead to immortality. not for an individual, but for his mind. the man will die, but his knowledge will live on in others. personally i think i will be long, looong dead before any of this happens. i think he might be able to get to the point of a human mind giving robots remote commands within his lifetime. but nothing like i have just described is likely to be possible for a long time, if it is even possible at all.</p></div>		</li>
