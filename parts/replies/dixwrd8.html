			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a remarkably cogent answer for this particular question. OP's question and the ensuing math would be better suited to deep-space travel, maybe for reading a printed page outside Pluto's atmosphere or for seeing debris in the Kuiper belt or the tail of a comet at its aphelion. (EDIT: comets have little if any tail of debris at aphelion, but seeing a steam jet in a crevice on the surface would suffice.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the part of OP's question that needs some math is the &quot;colourful&quot;. I have a typical amateur telescope (8&quot; diameter) and can see rings fine but no colour at all for saturn (or jupiter). The colour shots we see from NASA are often &quot;adjusted&quot;. </p>
<p>OK the light has to go there and back so the distance is doubled (so one quarter the intensity) but my light bucket (scope) diameter is (at a guess) 15 to 20 times the size of my pupil. </p>
<p>So would I see colour up close?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this question is quite on-point. I think the idea being asked is &quot;do particular colors fade and become less visible as light travels long distances&quot;. I.E., would red Mars appear less brilliantly red if it were moved out to Neptune's orbit? Human retinas do perceive less color at lower levels of illumination; we see red and blue cars as brown and grey after sunset. But that's not a property of photons. To my knowledge, specific colors don't fade faster than others in space like they do in atmospheres. We still pick up infrared and gamma from all over the universe, so red and blue should travel.</p>
<p>Asking the questions of sheer distance, Mars is visibly pink and Saturn is visibly gold/amber to the naked eye, from Earth. The &quot;pale blue dot&quot; photo was taken from beyond Pluto, and the Earth is visibly blue. That's red, yellow, and blue, traveling great distance. If it was too DARK for us is a separate question. <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/space/sun-looks-like-every-planet-solar-system/" target="_blank">This site</a> has artist renderings of what we calculate would be the level of daytime light on other planets. Pluto's midday is about like Earth's twilight. We would probably see colors like we see colored cars on the road after sunset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The maximum brightness you can get from looking through a telescope is exactly the same as the brightness you'd see in person. This is a consequence of the optical set-up required to have the image correctly in-focus for your level of magnification. The limiting factor is the size of the final aperture - your pupil - which has a limited maximum size. You can change the magnification using the eye-piece, but that reduces the brightness of the image. Using a bigger primary mirror allows you to reach maximum brightness at a higher level of magnification, but it doesn't increase what this maximum brightness actually is.</p>
<p>To take very bright images, there are two things you can do. One is to have a larger &quot;eyeball&quot; at the end - not a larger telescope, but a larger light sensor. CCD chips for collecting light can be quite big - bigger than the human eye - so digital cameras on telescopes can take brighter pictures. The other thing you can do is to just take a longer exposure, or taking multiple exposures and stacking them. That's how even amateur astronomers are able to take beautiful bright &amp; colourful images of planets and galaxies.</p>
<p>This is also true of distance - brightness does not depend on distance. A wall does not become incredibly bright when you put your face right up against it.</p>
<p>Note by brightness, I'm talking about the brightness <em>per square degree of vision</em>. The <em>total</em> light you get from Jupiter (or a wall) changes as you increase the magnification, but that's just because it covers more of your vision - each &quot;bit&quot; of Jupiter (or the wall) doesn't get brighter.</p>
<p>So, in short, Jupiter as seen by looking through a good telescope that's set up well will look exactly as bright as it would up close, even if you were <em>very</em> up close. It just might take up a larger fraction of your vision if you're really close to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this answer so much!  While other people are trying to theorycraft optics, the reality is that even with a children's telescope (which is comparatively better than the telescopes of the 1600s, when Saturn and Jupiter were discovered) you can make them out clearly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not trying to be rude but you know Jupiter is one of the brightest things (brighter than any star) in the night sky? It's been discovered since the beginning of humanity. You might be referring to it's moons </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No offense taken, yes, Jupiter was well known all the way back to the BC times.  I was more of making a point that we need some sort of optics to discern that Jupiter is a planet and not just another point of light in the sky.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a great discussion in Maxwell's E&amp;M textbook dealing with electromagnetic waves.  There's a lot of math and calculations for waves interacting with metal surfaces and then he poses a question: Prove that electromagnetic waves can propagate down a hollow metal cylinder.  The answer: pick up a metal pipe and look through it.</p></div>		</li>
