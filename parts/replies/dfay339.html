			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually geographic tongue is totally different and kinda cool. It's actual definition is &quot;a psoriasiform mucositis of the tongue characterized by constantly changing serpingous lines surrounded by a erythematic border.&quot; In other words, it basically looks like white raised lines on the tongue which are constantly changing over time. Its also called Benign Migratory Glossitis. The reason it's called Geographic tongue is that the pattern resembles a map somewhat. There are no grooves.
Nothing like fissured tongue.
And then there's bifid tongue, tongue-tied (ankyloglossia) thyroid nodule, macroglossia, median rhomboid glossitis, HAIRY TONGUE( it's not actual hair. The taste buds are just longer than normal)</p>
