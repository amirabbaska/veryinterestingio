			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're in a car going 50 MPH and you throw a ball in front of you at 10 MPH, the total speed of the ball is 60 MPH (50 + 10). If you threw it behind you, the total speed would be 40 MPH (50 - 10). </p>
<p><del>Light is different.</del> For things traveling very very fast, like light, it is different. If you're in the car and shine a flashlight in front of you, the light is only going to go light speed (not light speed + 50 mph). And if you shine it behind you, it still goes light speed (not light speed - 50 MPH).</p>
<p>So when a rocket ship shines a light out of the back of their ship, the light will go at light speed no matter how fast the rocket ship was going. Since the other ship in the scenario is only traveling at half of light speed, the light will catch up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I get that you're trying to simply things, but it might be more productive to give the (<em>more</em> accurate) description that &quot;high velocities are different&quot; rather than &quot;light is different&quot;.  This has the benefit, at least, of not setting up some notion that light is somehow special in this regard, because it sort of misleads that perhaps what makes Special Relativity interesting is that <em>light behaves strangely</em>, rather than the reality that <em>everything behaves strangely</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>eh.. I'm gonna abuse the fact that you seem to know what you talk about...  can you help me wrap my head around this?</p>
<p>From the reference frame of ship A, traveling at v^1, light traveling to the fore of the ship speeds away at C, and so does light leaving the ship to the aft.</p>
<p>To an observer then, the light should naively be seen to travel at c+v^1 and c-v^1 respectively, and here the model breaks down for me, since both beams of light should be seen by the observer as traveling at c.  Time dilation/compression is, as I understand it, usually the answer to these matters, but I can't make it cover for both an increase AND a decrease of observed lightspeed.</p>
<p>Where are my assumptions wrong and/or what part of this didn't I get?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole point of relativity is that <strong>everyone will measure the speed of light as the speed of light no matter what speed they are going.</strong> So even if two ships were going at 99.9999999% of C away from each other they will still be able to see each other (but they'd have to use a microwave band telescope). This was the strange thing that was discovered by some light experiments around the 1900s and lead Einstein to show that time, space and mass can change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>following this, in one of the moving ships frame of ref., what would the effect of its speed have on its perception of the light from the other ship?
having trouble wrapping my head around it, but I'd think there would be some reduction or countering of the red shift due to time dilation at such high speed. way off?</p></div>		</li>

<p>How far would a spaceship have to be from a mirror, such that a light shone onto that mirror from the spaceship while moving at a relativistic speed would not return to the spaceship?  In other words, if I am in a spaceship traveling away from a mirror at 0.999<em>c</em>, how far will I need to be from the mirror before the expansion of the universe is a concern in receiving the light back from the mirror?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>19 billion parsecs is the starting distance between points A and B from which light emitted from A would never reach B. So it depends on how fast the ship is moving, but the ship needs to be 19bp away when the light hits the mirror. Assuming I'm not oversimplifying the relativistic parts, my math says the original distance of the ship would be 19/(1+v/c) billion parsecs, where v is the velocity of the ship (and a stationary mirror).</p>
<p>Edit: upon further research, I found some contradictory information. I don't remember where I had gotten the 19bp number, but some googling suggests it is only 4.2 bp, which is much, <em>much</em> smaller.</p>
<p>If I can verify this, then the guy who responded is correct, the observable universe is &quot;shrinking&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
