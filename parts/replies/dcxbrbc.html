			<div class="markdown"><p>So the newer standards are dependent on more processing - and by extension - software capabilities? I can see how that would help in compression and speed, but how about standards which are coming out today in support of IoT applications? Those are focused on transmission efficiency and power draw. Surely, it would have been &quot;easy&quot; to adapt technologies to send less data a few years ago..?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's more to conserving power than just how often you send data. Other than the information the device wants to send somewhere, it also needs to spend power on managing the connection to the other device, before and after the data is being sent. It needs to figure out what sort of device it is connecting to and the capabilities of the device. If the wireless connection uses encryption, it also needs to encrypt and decrypt all the data that is being transmitted, and this also consumes power. Less data sent will mean less data to encrypt, but a more efficient encryption method would also help, for example.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to process data with an electronic circuit. One is to make a complex circuit that can do &quot;anything&quot;, as long as you write the right program for it, another is to make a much simpler circuit that is very limited in what it can do, but does what it can do a lot better. </p>
<p>The main processor in a phone is an example of the former. It can calculate anything, as long as someone makes a program for it, but it uses a lot of power and depending on the task, it can be very slow. </p>
<p>The circuits that control the bluetooth functionality in your phone is of the latter kind. It is a much simpler, and smaller circuit that can do BT signal processing extremely well and while consuming very little power. However, it can't change its programming, because the &quot;program&quot; isn't just software, the program is (at least partially) the actual physical layout of the conductors and transistors in the chip. </p>
<p>To let a BT 2 chip process BT 4 signals would require you to physically rearrange the microscopic circuits in the chip, and this is practically impossible. The alternative would be to make a more general purpose chip that could potentially do more things, but that would also likely increase its power consumption and size, something you can't always afford in a phone that already needs to be charged every day.</p>
<p>Kind of tangential: If you see a device advertised to have &quot;hardware decoding&quot; of a specific format, that's a separate set of physical circuitry made exclusively to decode that specific format, and allows it to decode this format with ease, even though the main cpu (which also takes up many times the size of the specialized circuits) would choke trying to do the same task. For example, a raspberry pi has hardware decoding of the video format h.264 and can play that back flawlessly, but it lacks hardware decoding support for h.265 and therefore has to resort to software decoding on the main cpu for that, and that cpu is way too weak for that task. the BT circuits in your phone is sort of like a &quot;hardware decoder/encoder&quot; for BT signals.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a specialized chip can be improved by a &quot;firmware  update&quot;, but the improvements gained by firmware updates are usually not very jaw dropping. They're usually bug fixes, or adding support for things that are very similar to what the chip already is designed for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can always adapt to send less data, but the issue is in supporting much, much more data.  This is in terms of spectral efficiency (bits per second per hertz of bandwidth) and traffic density (number of users per square km).   </p>
<p>IoT presents challenges more to traffic density, i.e. a massive number of connected users, sending relatively small amounts of data, but at the same time there is a huge increase in the number of users with devices who want to use very high data rate applications which rely on low latency.  </p>
<p>3,4 &amp; 5G and 802.11 amendments are are incremental improvements to meet the changing needs of users and the networks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the natural progression is to be able to do the same shit on cheaper and less powerful hardware. A radio transmitter doesn't really change but the processor behind it shrinks, gets cheaper and draws less power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall that when WEP was already broken the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced WPA with TKIP as a stopgap solution to replace WEP without requiring to replace old hardware. It took some time before WPA2 was adopted.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of hardware vendors who still have a backlog of legacy devices. :-)</p></div>		</li>
