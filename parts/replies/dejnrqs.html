			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with you here.  I'm quite along with the romantics in believing that lyrics detract from musical messages.  I used to think I just hated the sound of the voice, but I've found that I love non-lyrical vocal singing (vowels and consonant sounds, super elongated words and melisma).  I'd rather the voice be treated without lyrics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are exceptions, like DSOTM where lyrics are huge part of it. But.. it does have slooow words. That might be one factor, having clear vocals and good pronunciation. I'm fast reader, reading since i was 4-5y and decent writer, played music since i was 5.. But music and words at the same time? Does not compute... hmm, i did not get evening stories so much, i got evening music, dad playing guitar... nah, that has nothing to do with it. But something in our brains is a bit different, i think. Some connection is missing and some are then stronger. Also, i'm not native english speaker but it is not much better in my native language, the words are there but there is no narrative..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a balance. There's some music that seem to combine with their words to make something greater than the two parts. However, there are also times I feel like the words don't fit a particular song well or the song doesn't fit the words well. However, depending on what you compose I can definitely see why you view lyrics as such.  Certain styles and arrangements would definitely be ruined if you tried adding lyrics to the music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh for sure. Hate to bring out a cliche but 'dark side of the moon' is one of those that has all elements; lyrics are poems in themselves, the music is brilliant and together they work seamlessly to bring something more than the sum of the two. There are lot of albums where lyrics are almost as important... But there are songs i know the words inside out but the sentences have no meaning. Mostly i see it on my part as defect, i wish i could take more in thru lyrics. And i'm not a poor writer (this is pure egoboosting but i got laid twice for writing one essee), which makes this really puzzling. I can't also play bass and sing a single note.. and my mouth opens up when playing it making me look really stupid :) Don't have such troubles with any other instrument but bass in any form, stringed or not.. it's weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm more like you. The thing is I might get real hung up on one lyric lines because I like the sound, not because I care about the meaning of the words. I never even noticed I did this until one time I was listening to one of my favorite songs back in high school, &quot;1979&quot; by the Smashing Pumpkins and my friend was like &quot;What is this song even about?&quot; I thought about it and then said, &quot;You know, I have no idea.&quot; Actually, I think I replied &quot;The year 1979&quot; to be a smart ass, but he knew I meant I didn't know. It had never occurred to me until that moment that I had never even though about what the song as a whole meant even though I'd listened to it hundreds of times. That's part of the reason I always roll my eyes when I hear people complain about song lyrics being violent or misogynistic. Because I usually don't pay attention to them much unless it's something I'm specifically listening to for that reason, like Bob Dylan.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An article similar to this caught my attention when it first hit the news because I have almost no interest in music. Every once in a very long while I'll hear something that interests me, but even then I'm over it after a few repetitions.   Lyrics and a well turned phrase in a book seem to have taken the place of music in my life. </p></div>		</li>
