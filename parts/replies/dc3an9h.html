			<div class="markdown"><p>All ACNE is bacterial. However, there are hormones that can make it easier for the bacteria to spread and become worse.</p>
<p>Hormones are natural chemicals our bodies produce for various reasons. Some of these hormones can cause the skin to produce a lot of extra oil, which is what ACNE bacteria eat. &quot;Hormonal acne&quot; is just a way of saying that the reason your acne has gotten really bad is because your body is reacting to one or more hormones.</p>
<p>For example, during  certain phases of our development our bodies produce lots of the sexual hormones &quot;estrogen&quot; (girls) and &quot;testosterone&quot; (boys). Both of these cause the skin to produce lots of oil which is one reason that ACNE tends to appear around the same time as puberty. As we get older our bodies produce less of these hormones and the ACNE tends to reduce which is why acne tends to clear up as we become adults.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble with ACNE here are some tips that helped me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>wash your face with hot (but not burning hot) water and soap every morning and night. The hot water opens up the places in your skin where oil builds up and the soap washes it away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wash and change your pillow cover every few days. While you're sleeping your face still produces oil and your pillow cover soaks it up. If you don't wash your cover regularly then your face is rolling in oil every night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>don't touch your face all the time. Your hands produce more oil than most parts of your body. Touching your face a lot will put oil from your hands on your face. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wash your hands several times a day. This helps to prevent a lot of oil from your hands from getting to your face. </p>
</li>
<li>do not wear a lot of makeup. Some is ok, but if you wear a lot then the makeup will prevent the oil under it from evaporating and so it will build up more. </li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>
