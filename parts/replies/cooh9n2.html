			<p>Try scratching glass with a knife.  It's very difficult. A razor blade can.  A screwdriver probably can't.  A rock usually can.  A diamond, piece of carbide, or broken ceramic spark plug certainly can.<br><br>Would a large diamond break a car window?  Probably, but why bother breaking into a car when in possession of a huge diamond?</p>		</li>

You must save them and repay the debt you have to the family.<br><br>Just a few scenarios in which you need to use a diamond to get into a car.</p>		</li>

Start with the little ones and work up to my larger ones.<br><br>Just don't want to do it on my car/window.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; It's more brittle, but that doesn't matter here.<br><br>It sort of helps, since, when smashed, the ceramic tends to form very sharp fragments.</p>		</li>
