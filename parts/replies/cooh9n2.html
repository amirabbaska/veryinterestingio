			<div class="markdown"><p>Try scratching glass with a knife.  It's very difficult. A razor blade can.  A screwdriver probably can't.  A rock usually can.  A diamond, piece of carbide, or broken ceramic spark plug certainly can.</p>
<p>Would a large diamond break a car window?  Probably, but why bother breaking into a car when in possession of a huge diamond?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're in Africa. The family that nursed you back to health is in the back seat of a greedy diamond lord's gang's car awaiting execution for housing a foreigner. You must save them and repay the debt you have to the family.</p>
<p>Just a few scenarios in which you need to use a diamond to get into a car.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Take my hammers I use for work and give it a go. Start with the little ones and work up to my larger ones.</p>
<p>Just don't want to do it on my car/window.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could just carve a nice arrowhead out of fine grained wood, then take a ceramics class, in which you make molds with your wooden arrowhead(s). Then cast a bunch of ceramic heads and fire them.</p>
<p>Actually someone should try that...</p></div>		</li>
