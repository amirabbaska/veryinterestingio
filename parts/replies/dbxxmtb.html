			<div class="markdown"><p>That's most likely due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force" target="_blank">Tidal Forces</a>, which is the same reason the Earth's moon's rotation has slowed down so that the same side always faces the Earth. </p>
<p>The side of Venus that is closest to the Sun experiences slightly more gravity than the furthest side, causing Venus to slightly bulge towards and away from the sun (the same reason we have tides on Earth). This bulging causes friction as Venus rotates through the bulge and the bulge gets dragged around the planet as it spins, slowing its rotation down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neil DeGrasse Tyson, on Startalk, once said that everything in the universe rotates counter-clockwise. This struck me as unbelievable since one, being above or below a planet, let's say, changes the perceived direction. (I.e., clockwise or counterclockwise is merely perception and not physical.) Two, a meteorite massive enough could change the rotation of a planet if it hits at the right velocity. So where does he get off making that claim?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure he didn't say &quot;everything in the solar system&quot;, not universe? Because that's basically true, with a few exceptions. Here's an article about it: <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/10/07/counterclockwise-but-there-are/" target="_blank">Counterclockwise, but there are exceptions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>one, being above or below a planet, let's say, changes the perceived direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct. The statement depends on a context, which is mentioned in the article I linked: &quot;If you rose up, above the Earth’s North Pole, and looked down at the Earth as it revolved around the Sun...&quot; Almost all objects in the solar system appear to orbit and to rotate counterclockwise from that perspective, due to the conserved angular momentum of the original gas cloud that formed the solar system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two, a meteorite massive enough could change the rotation of a planet if it hits at the right velocity.</p>

<p>Yes, and these kinds of events explain the exceptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually starts out as a giant cloud orbiting the centre in all directions at the same time.  In a system as massively complex as this there will always be a single plane that is slightly dominant.  Over time and millions of collisions all of the elements in the cloud eventually fall into the form of the dominant plane which over time becomes increasingly dominant and speeds up the process.  </p>

<p>And it's worth pointing out, the Oort cloud essentially still is this, where the objects are just too far apart and moving too slowly to be able to collide to exchange their angular momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original cloud had no one axis of rotation, it was a cloud of dust and gas moving in generally random chaotic ways. Gravity compresses this cloud and averages out its angular momentum. It's the exact same process by which you get rings around Saturn. How does gravity average out angular momentum of a cloud of debris? It all smashes into itself over and over until you get a disk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if all the matter was perfectly distributed in a spherical cloud with zero initial motion. Theoretically, it should all collapse straight into the center of the cloud. </p>
<p>Real gas clouds aren't evenly distributed though, with certain areas of the cloud having more mass than others. </p>
<p>Now, imagine tossing a steel ball between two magnets floating in space, with the magnet on the left being maybe 3 times the size of the magnet on the right. If there was only one magnet, the ball would simply fly straight to it and stick, right? (maybe not perfectly, but I digress) But because there's a second magnet pulling the ball a little away from the larger one, the ball will pass between them, while still angling toward the left. Now what happens? Well, the ball pulls on both magnets as it passes between them, while the magnets simultaneously pull each other and also pull the ball back toward them. Because the ball also had an angular velocity to the Left as it passed between them, when the ball rebounds it will want to continue circling around to the Left, forming an elliptical orbit around the two magnets. </p>
<p>This is a very simplistic explanation of how rotation initiates due to uneven distribution of mass creating non-uniform angular momentum (if that's the correct terminology). In a real gas cloud there are trillions of points of mass all pulling on each other while also being influenced by very weak gravitational forces from other stellar bodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make that sound as if uneven distribution of mass would cause momentum to appear. The isolated system either rotated as a whole from the start, or it didn't. It could create rotation inside, but only in pairs that cancel each other out.</p>
<p>I don't really like to dissect that weird explanation with the magnets, but if the &quot;final stage&quot; is two masses orbiting each other, then because you sent it in with momentum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we are being pedantic, OP's answer isn't entirely correct. Angular momentum doesn't typically align with the axis of rotation; only for principal axes. The eventual rotation of the system will generally not be the same as the initial rotation of the cloud. Interestingly, due to internal damping, the system loses rotational kinetic energy until it bottoms out and rotates around its axis of maximum inertia. So the system's eventual rotation axis does align with the cloud's angular momentum. Also, by nature of the maximum inertia axis we have that the distribution of mass bulges on the equatorial plane (forming a disk in the extreme case). </p>
<p>Perhaps the real question is, &quot;what determined the original angular <em>momentum</em> of the cloud?&quot; The best I can say is that it depends on the larger picture (in an averaging sense). If we are looking at a planet then we should consider its solar system. If we are looking at a solar system we should consider its galaxy, and so forth.</p></div>		</li>
