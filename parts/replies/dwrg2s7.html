			<div class="markdown"><p>The really interesting thing to watch is the way Guinness settles. The nitrogen bubbles are a lot smaller than the CO2 bubbles. As the CO2 bubbles rise up in the middle, the beer is pushed downward along the outside of the glass like a convection current. The small nitrogen bubbles go for the ride which makes it look like the are falling down because they are denser than beer. Then once settled, you get to drink it and do it all over again! It's brilliant! :)</p></div>		</li>
