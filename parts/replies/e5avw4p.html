<p>Dr Lisa Geneva, an American scientist who taught Neuroanatomy at Harvard, wrote a (fiction) book from the perspective of someone with this condition. It's called 'Left Neglected'. She wrote 'Still Alice', too, which was really good and got made into a film (the book was written from the perspective of a professor diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease).</p>
<p>If you're interested, it might be worth taking a look! Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes...also occurs in stroke affected patients...they will completely ignore their affected side...to the point of turning their head and looking the opposite way all the time.</p>
<p>..Nurses have to place all items of use i.e.bedside locker, table etc over to the affected side to re-orientate  them.They will use a mirror too to help.</p>
<p>I have also seen a meal been eaten completely in half....definite line...and only half the plate of food actually eaten...like the other side simply doesnt exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So interesting! I figured clanging would still occur, but I was trying to think what that would look like, so thank you for your input. I was assuming it could either be words that look the same on paper that might get signed, but signing words that use similar movements makes much more sense.  </p>
<p>If you could elaborate more on people who are deaf having auditory hallucinations I would love to know more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They experience auditory hallucinations the same way hearing people do. I’ve had patients tell me they are really loud or they have multiple different voices (male, female, adult, child voices). Most of the time, just as with hearing people, they aren’t exactly pleasant. Telling them to hurt people, throw knives, hurt themselves, or just cussing/saying scary things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say &quot;slurring&quot;, does that equate to a physically looser style of signing or leaving out certain  letters/words? This is endlessly fascinating to me, thanks for sharing! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looser style of signing. Not forming signs all the way, same way we don’t speak words fully when we are slurring. Sometimes the movement can be smaller or bigger. If it’s from something like anesthesia, it’s usually smaller and/or only one handed. If it’s something like being drunk, it may be bigger and more exaggerated. Of course this is variable from person to person, just like hearing people.</p></div>		</li>
