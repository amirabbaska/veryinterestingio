			<div class="markdown"><p>ya I mean, I'm in California, so I'm ignorant about this but I fail to see any upside to the UK bailing from what I've read. It sounds like the &quot;Brexit&quot; campaign played a lot on people's fears &amp; emotions. Like what Trump is trying to do here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For all the criticism America gets for supporting Trump this far, it equally applies in Europe as well.  There's a lot of politicians playing with people's emotions and the challenges of rapid cultural change to drive conservative agendas.  It's neither unique to the UK nor the US, and it seems all nations should be circumspect these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree, I think that a lot of the older folk have probably had many reasons to dislike or distrust the EU over the decades. I do not agree with this characterisation over facebook that it's all racism and xenophobia. Not even 90%. The leaders of UKIP definitely played the xeniphobia card but what percentage of people voted for UKIP?</p>
<p>Facebook is annoying the shit out of me because everyone is screaming about betrayal and xenophobia and no one will allow that there were real good reasons to think about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it does. The 'took our jerbs' type have always been around, but never in strong enough numbers. They were generally BNP voters. Many jumped on the bandwagon when UKIP were running for GE the other year, but still not a large enough percentage.</p>
<p>The difference between then and now, in my opinion, is the mass waves of migrants from non-EU countries (Syria etc).</p>
<p>This refugee crisis has hit home for a lot more of the general public, much more than the usual 'bloody pakis takin our jobs,' demographic.</p>
<p>I've seen people saying 'leaving won't stop non-EU migrants entering the UK'. Well, it will and it won't. As I understand it, in the EU we were obliged to accept EU migration, and this was common across all EU members are part of the Union's rules. The recent migrant crisis of non-EU people has been a different kettle of fish. </p>
<p>I think the perception, rightly or wrongly, has been that Merkel and the EU parliament have taken an 'open door' approach to this new wave of migration, and the wealthier and more attractive of EU states (such as the UK) end up being the final destination for this migrants.</p>
<p>Of course there's a level of xenophobia within some voters, that exists in all countries, but the claims of some Remainers that all 15 million plus Leave voters must be poor, uneducated racists is frankly quite pathetic.</p>
<p>I respect both sides of the argument to different degrees and I think it was a tough decision for a lot of voters. But I do find it depressing how negative the Remainers are being. Fair enough, you felt strongly about your side and you 'lost', I sympathise with that. But all I'm really seeing is accusations of racism, claims that our country is going to collapse into a black hole without the might of the EU to prop it up.. Just a load of pesimism.</p>
<p>This wasn't a live or die decision. It was a choice A vs choice B vote. We live with our decision, democracy has and will be respected. We're a damn strong economy and nation whether in or out. The EU knows that, America and the rest of the world know that. It's time our own people start realising it too.</p></div>		</li>
