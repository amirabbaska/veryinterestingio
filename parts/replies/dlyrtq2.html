			<div class="markdown"><p>Roughly, yes, although there are ways to get around this &quot;diffraction limit&quot;. RF/microwave are still useful for imaging large objects, so you can see these types of images used frequently in geophysics and astronomy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. When s/he says FM, they mean the frequency range of EM emission in the 100MHz band. Frequency modulation (FM) is a way of adding lower frequency (audio/music/speech) information to that high frequency &quot;carrier&quot;. Pixels are a digital imaging concept related to sampling light on a sensor of a given size and density of measuring elements. I guess the equivalent of a CCD or CMOS sensor for FM radio would be having a bunch of FM antennas spread out over a large area receiving whatever channels or signals they can and each giving an average &quot;value&quot; of those signals at specific time intervals... Sort of like phased-array radar perhaps.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at it in the light spectrum would be an FM antenna/receiver is a single &quot;pixel&quot; changing color ever so slightly with the waveform of the music. An AM antenna/receiver would be a single &quot;pixel&quot; changing in brightness with the waveform of the audio.    </p></div>		</li>

X-ray machines measure what gets through you, not what is reflected. (X-rays don't really reflect off most materials, they get either absorbed, scattered, or pass straight through.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although X-ray backscatter imaging is a thing, which measures reflected X-rays. They are used for surface/low-penetration imaging, so you typically see them at airports where they want to see if you're concealing something but don't need to penetrate deep into tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Radio waves in the FM band have a roughly 3 meter wavelength so they can't be used to image things of that size or smaller. AM radio waves are around 300 meters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you tried to take an &quot;FM-Ray&quot; of a large object such as a building you could do so, but your resolution would be in 3 meter steps? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The resolution limit wouldn't be in steps. The contrast of an image decreases as the limit is approached. Also, the distance from camera to building is important. Angular resolution is proportional to wavelength/aperture. For microscopes, the smallest resolvable item is limited to about half the wavelength.</p>
<p>At FM frequencies, you would need a huge dish (or phased array) which would have to be far from the building and that would limit the smallest resolvable item to something over 3 m.  </p>
