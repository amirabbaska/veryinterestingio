			<div class="markdown"><p>The pound sign (and blast it that's £; # is a hash, not a pound, but I digress) still <em>is</em> derived from Roman units, albeit ones of weight rather than currency (the <em>libra</em>, to be precise; they used the same name for the scales as for the basic weight used upon them).  The new penny gets abbreviated from its actual name, though, rather than d for <em>denarius</em> as with the predecimal one.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...arguably, yes, although I imagine that'd be an incredibly good bargain.</p>
<p>That being said we tend to write out &quot;lbs&quot; rather than using #, even though at least one origin of the latter symbol is as a derivative of an L-B ligature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it interesting that in Europe there's 2 ways of doing almost everything, the UK way, that UK and Ireland follow, and then there's the French/Napoleonic way, which the rest of the continent follows.</p>
<p>The reason is fairly understandable. Nothing could stop the French besides the rotten English (or maybe it's the puddle)</p></div>		</li>
