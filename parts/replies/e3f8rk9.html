			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wait until you play winter with your white balls. Which I recommend, by the way, if you live near a golf course that has winter greens (the course is open, but the greens are closed and instead of a hole there is a small designated area somewhere else than the regular green that you need to get your ball to).  </p>
<p>Nothing like using your wedge to lob the ball in a high arc halfway to the green area, only for it to bounce and slide right past it on the ice patches. Super fun, and good for practicing coming up with creative solutions to various situations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Horrible choice, but at least I learned a lesson that day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually found a yellow ball is easier to find in the fall than a white ball. Sun reflecting off leaves looks white, the yellow actually stands out. It's really counterintuitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On good courses I use white, on bad courses I use white.  Mainly because don’t matter what color it is when you hit it into the woods or brush or water, as I usually do.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could do like I do, and just hit the ball a little ways. Easier to track and find. Makes for a hell of a long game, though, if you're stopping every twenty feet to swing again.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I have the complete opposite experience. I've gotten to a point where I won't even buy white balls anymore because I might as well walk out of the store and pour them in the nearest storm drain because it would just save me time.</p>
<p>I played a game the other day with neon matte red balls and didn't lose a single one in 18 holes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just some baked wikipedia geometry, but green is directly across from red on the color wheel, which may or may not mean they're the most contrasting colors of each other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% agree, when I started playing pretty often I was using orange balls because I was losing them a lot (all distance, no accuracy).  I figured orange would contrast the green and stand out more....definitely not the case.  Didn't help one bit, I just stick to white now.</p></div>		</li>
