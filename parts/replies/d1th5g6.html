			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, it's funny. I'm trying to imagine riding a bike that's all one solid piece, as in the handlebars are locked straight, and when I try to ride it in my head, it seems terribly unstable. </p>
<p>That thought never would have occurred to me. Good answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motorcycles typically have a smaller turning radius than bicycles, yet they stay up pretty well while still going slow. I wonder what forces are primarily holding them up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motorcycle are a lot harder to keep stable when they are moving slowly. It all depends on how heavy the bike is, but when 500 pounds or so starts to tip, it can be hard to stop it. I've dumped mine a few times over the years and it's always been a parking lot or driveway when I'm barely moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motorcycles normally have a really low center of gravity, with the engine mounted below the rider, so that probably helps with the slow speed balance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motorcycles have a much much lower center of gravity.  A bicycle usually weighs less than 30lbs, with some as low as 13lbs.  If you put a 160lb rider on the seat, it is really top heavy.  That same 160lbs rider on a motorcycle has a much smaller influence on the motorcycles center of gravity, especially once it is moving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense if you think about gliding on one foot on ice skates.  The blade is all one fixed piece, no wheels, no steering, yet it still much easier to balance on one foot while gliding than while standing in place on the blade.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the reason motorcycles have angled forks. Used to be vertical and much faster than a walking over and the bike became unstable and the wheel would shake back and forth terribly. Angling the forks outward stopped this. </p>
<p>Pedal bike don't have nearly the same amounts of angle, but the concept is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The conclusion of that video is completely wrong, the stability of the bike design is both intentional and the reason for it a standard example of control theory. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what he was getting at. He was saying that thanks to control theory, we understand how to make bikes that are extremely stable because we understand how changing variables affects the overall system enough to make it close to optimal. However, we don't fully understand how each of the variables interact with each other, what the ratios are and how to theorise the perfect bike from scratch without an iterative process. It's like theoretical physics: We understand how to use General Relativity and Quantum Theory to predict results, but we still don't have a General Universal Theory. The whole system can't be predicted with a single equation.</p></div>		</li>
