			<div class="markdown"><p>136 outdoor rinks in Sweden seems veeeeeery low to me. I guess there is a problem with collecting data in cases like this.</p>
<p>Edit: Hard to find good data, even in swedish. I guess the outdoor number does not include the &quot;village rinks&quot; scattered over pretty much every square meter in the country side. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in Norway, schoolyard football fields would usually be used as skating/hockey rinks during the winter years. They're far from the scale of US school sports, but there's often a big open area used.</p></div>		</li>
