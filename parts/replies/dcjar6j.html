			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be any number of things ranging from the firmness of your mattress to simply habit.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is lie on your back and when it gets uncomfortable try to figure out exactly <em>what</em> is uncomfortable about it. Then try to fix it while still lying on your back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I back sleep now more than I did before; but, it's honestly like this inner urge to turn over (haha). Not that back sleep hurts necessarily... Maybe this is a habit thing though like you said b/c I did it more when I was a kid and didn't know better </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find lying on my back = too much pull/pressure on the lower spine.  So once I elevate my feet--with a pillow or the arm of a couch--then it feels right, becomes comfortable to lie on my back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Life pro tip: Google these terms &quot;anterior pelvic tilt&quot; and &quot;psoas muscle&quot;. Educating yourself about how these two things work together will have a domino effect with most of the other muscles in your body.</p>
<p>Sitting and forward movements when not balanced out with things like exercise, stretching etc will create a tilt causing other muscles to compensate. This tilt is the major cause of lower back pain because the muscles become disengaged. </p>
<p>Sitting is now the new smoking.</p>
<p>Stand up more. Do a few light back bends ever hour or so.</p>
<p>Being on your stomach shifts your pelvis and gives your lower back relief.</p>
<p>And who says stomach sleeping is bad for you? I can't remember where I read this from (probably Mark Sisson) but look at babies. We start life sleeping on our belly's. We are in perfect alignment, flexible and we can practically sleep in any position.</p>
<p>The minute I started sleeping on floors and I relearned how to sleep on my stomach, well my posture improved. It's sitting that still is a battle (I work a desk a job).</p>
<p>It's things like shoes (which I still do wear shoes) that create overpronation /under pronation, sitting, wrong technique in working out (i.e. don't do crunches. youtube this) based on old perpetuated  gimmicky exercise concepts and a whole other range of things that we do that put us out of alignment over periods of time. Like years and years of wrong movement.</p>
<p>But the current exercise science that is out is quickly correcting this. Some good info on what I stated earlier go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g70Jq2NjQwY" target="_blank">Jeff Cavelier's</a> youtube channel and go from there.</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, toddlers do a perfect squat when they pick something up off the ground. </p>
<p>I'm not a body scientist, but it that musculoskeletal pain and discomfort has less to do with biological shortcomings in a healthy human than the relatively new environment we have entered into, in which people today are required to spend a lot of time sitting. </p>
<p>And without practice, almost all of us can easily develop habits which limit our range of motion, and then we have to struggle to get it back </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any sleeping position is potentially fine provided you make allowances for putting your spine in a neutral (balanced) position. Proper posture is 'proper' because it's the position where all 4 curves of your spine are balanced.  When balanced it's very easy for your postural muscles to support the spine.  When unbalanced some muscles work harder and other work less. The muscles that work harder wear out before the end of the day and can't continue to support the spine.  As a result the strain of gravity is on the joints and ligaments as opposed to the muscles.</p>
<p>When sleeping your core muscles aren't engaged and so your sleeping position should be one that puts the spine in a neutral position. Which is possible in any position provided you use appropriate supports. When sleeping on your stomach in order to put your spine in a neutral position you need pillows under your ankles and hips as well as a hole in your mattress so that you don't have to turn your head to breathe. That's why if you look at a chiropractor or massage therapists table they all have headrests for when you lie facedown. The pillow at your ankles is to raise your ankles so that your feet don't turn out thus relieving strain on your ankles knees and hips. The pillow under your hips is to accommodate a shortened hip flexor so as to alleviate strain on your lumbar spine. Most people sadly have a shortened hip flexor to some degree due to prolonged sitting/poor posture. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why workspace ergonomic optimization is a thing in a lot of bigger organizations.  It's money upfront but saves on health insurance fees/time off for various issues.</p>
<p>Works great until some fuckwit doesn't check the monitor order, orders a shit ton of non-height adjustable monitors. </p></div>		</li>
