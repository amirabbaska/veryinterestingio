			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fairly good broad-strokes summary, but a few minor points I'd add:</p>
<p>1) a big part of postmodern is arguably the collapse of 'low culture' and 'high culture'; you'll often see deliberately jarring mish-mashes of trashy pop and old, vaunted works, for example. This is in part a reaction against the modernist instinct towards making everything very Serious and Difficult and Meaningful (postmodernism, in a word, is <em>playful</em>.)</p>
<p>2) Your explanation of the term 'deconstruction' is true in the sense that postmodern works often do this, but I would argue that it's not really in line with what Jacques Derrida was saying when he promoted the term. In fairness, it's never exactly easy to figure out what he <em>is</em> saying, but my take on it is this:</p>
<p>Every text (a piece of fiction, or architecture, or dance, or hand-gesture, or whatever) is fraught with tensions and self-contradictions. When you examine it closely enough, any text will self-implode into meaninglessness, deconstructing itself. As such, anyone telling you that the meaning of Moby-Dick is so-and-so is entirely wrong, because Moby-Dick doesn't have 'a' meaning. It either has no meaning at all, or it has a hundred meanings, a thousand, an infinite shards of fractured meaning, all jutting against each other and not fitting into one cohesive whole. I hope this makes some sense. Peter Barry's book &quot;Beginner Theory&quot; is the best way to get a clear and accurate understanding of Derridean deconstruction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent break down of the differences. Just hope my students don't find this post and use it in any future essays in Art History.</p></div>		</li>
