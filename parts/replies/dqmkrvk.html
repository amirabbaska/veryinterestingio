			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand, they describe mechanisms, that seem to be scientifically proven. Noone seems to know the abstract or underlying reason to 100% certainty or even close. So the question &quot;Why sleep has to occur and why can't those process run during day?&quot; and &quot;How does sleep occur and what is going on while you sleep?&quot; are 2 different question with related but not entirely overlapping answers.</p>
<p>Dolphins for example never sleep 100%, only one half of their brain is asleep at any given moment, and overall each half only sleeps for 4 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One theory, and I think the best, is to avoid injury during evolution. Being out in pitch black wasn't  good for a lot of animals. Easy to fall and step on something danergous. Also difficult to get stuff done in pitch black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Olms(Proteus anguinus) seem to defy that theory. They're blind and live in pitch black caves. Yet they still sleep.</p>
<p>It could be an evolutionary remnant, but that's speculation at best.</p></div>		</li>
