<p>That said, they probably did have a satellite phone, but those are typically used only for emergencies, and I suspect the people back on shore were a wee bit busy to call a ship that was safely out at sea.</p></div>		</li>

Not many people actually read the navtex as it comes through if it's even on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If he tells the truth, a research ship would be warned by the GMDSS equipment onboard. There is no way they wouldn't have recieved the warning unless his friend was like a messman onboard or something and no one from bridge bothered to tell him. </p></div>		</li>
