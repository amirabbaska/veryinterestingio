			<div class="markdown"><p>A tangential question:  when I've read about red giants, I usually see references to a diameter on the order of light-minutes.  How does the collapse happen an order of magnitude faster than the diameter / c?  Or is only the very core of the star collapsing?</p></div>		</li>

<p>using the word massive in this case is massively confusing, even though I understand what you're getting it.  &quot;has much more mass&quot; would be ok.  &quot;Is much more dense&quot; would have done it too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a difference between an object moving at c and a process appearing to move faster. If I point a laser at a far away point, and sligthly move the laser on my end, the dot may appear to move faster than c. But since it's just the spot were the laser shines at, nothing is really moving faster than c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never understood this example. Theoretically if i point a laser at a far away point, the light of the laser has to travel there. Then i move the laser to another point and light has to travel there in c again. There is just light arriving at a former point while i adjust the laser to  another point. Do i totally get this wrong? Why would it seem faster to me?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all your answers people. :) I think i somehow understand it now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really answer his question though. The collapse of a star isn't an 'apparent' thing, it's a physical process happening to the star, and it can't happen faster than the diameter of the star divided by c. So the answer of 20 seconds is still puzzling.</p>
<p>However, since it's only core collapse, and the core is pretty small, it does indeed take seconds, not minutes, but it'd all be hidden behind the outer layers of the star.
Most of the hot gas surrounding the core gets blasted off by the core going supernova, but again, that can't happen faster than a couple of minutes because of its sheer size.</p>
<p>Tl;dr looking at it from afar, it'd take minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there a subtle problem with talking about a laser dot at these ranges?</p>
<p>If I shine a laser at an object 1 light year away, I won't see the dot appear on that object for two years of my time.</p>
<p>So, yes, I can sweep my laser across the sky, but actually I won't see a dot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this interesting. According to a couple sources a red giant can be up to 621,000,000,000 miles in diameter. At this distance, it would take light 3338.7 seconds to get from one side to the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick google tells me when the sun becomes a red giant its radius will be about equal to its distance from the earth now. That means its diameter will be about 16 light minutes. How can something happen across an object that large that fast when something that happens on one end takes at least 16 minutes to affect the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That number seems quite incredible to me for anything to happen to an entire star. The sun (which is smaller than stars going supernova) is already <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=diameter+of+the+sun+in+light+seconds" target="_blank">5 light seconds across</a>. Are you saying that the degeneracy collapse is entirely propagated by photons/EM/gravity waves/fields, and has nothing to do with the internal pressure supporting the star? Because pressure waves would be bound by the speed of sound, or at least relativity, and should be substantially slower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The collapse happens in the core of the star, and it's caused by gravity, which is in an unstable equilibrium with internal pressure.  The core itself reaches a large fraction of the speed of light as it falls inward, and the rebound happens when it reaches neutron star densities.  The rebound is what causes the actual explosion throughout the rest of the star.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Approximately 70% of the inner portion of the core collapses homologously and subsonically. The outer core collapses at supersonic speeds [71, 170]. The maximum velocity of the outer regions of the core reaches ∼ 7×10^4 km s−1. It takes just 1 s for an earth-sized core to collapse to a radius of 50 km [8].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the main event: &quot;The core overshoots its equilibrium position and bounces. A shock wave is formed when the supersonically infalling outer layers hit the rebounding inner core&quot;</p></div>		</li>
