<p>You will sometimes hear a page somewhere like an airport of &quot;Bill W. please report to gate B 7&quot;. That refers to someone who is at gate B 7 that is looking for a fellow member for support. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL that AA and Al-Anon are two different things.  I knew about ACA/ACoA but for some reason I thought Al-Anon was just another way of saying AA, and any time I heard Al-Anon recommended for friends/family of alcoholics, I always just assumed they were being recommended to attend AA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it? I mean in AA, it's about addicts confronting their addiction and there can be very real professional / personal stigma attached to being an addict. (even though really being an addict actively confronting and trying to control addiction is something that should be commended)</p>
<p>But Al-Anon isn't for the addict who will/won't/is failing at getting help. It's about the family members doing what's best for themselves and realizing they can't take charge for someone else's harmful actions. Anonymity doesn't seem like it would have the same requirement, unless you're doing it for their relation who's an addict's sake. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, from the suggested opening:
&quot;Anonymity is an important principle of the Al-Anon/Alateen program. Everything that is said here, in the group meeting and member to member, must be held in confidence.  Only in this way can we feel free to say what is in our minds and hearts, for this is how we help one another in Al-Anon.&quot;</p>
<p>And from Digest of Al-Anon and Alateen policies:
&quot;Members use their full names within the fellowship when they wish.  The degree of anonymity a member chooses (first name, pseudonym, or full name) is not subject to criticism.  Each member has a right to decide.</p>
<p>Regardless of our personal choice, we guard with special care the anonymity of everyone else in the fellowship, Al-Anon/Alateen and A.A.  This means not revealing to anyone - even to relatives, friends and other memebers - whom we see and what we hear in a meeting.</p>
<p>Anonymity goes well beyond mere names.  All of us need to feel secure in the knowledge that nothing seen or heard at a meeting will be revealed.  We feel free to express ourselves among our fellow Al-Anons because we can be sure that what we say will be held in confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>I think it's pretty short sighted to say that the only person with a stigma that could be attached to them is the alcoholic/addict.  There are other family members and friends that do some pretty crazy shit due to the disease.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never even heard of Al Anon. Interesting to find out that there are different similar organizations! Very good thing of course. AA is all about talking about the hurt you've been through/ done to others and then following the 12 steps. Not the best method for everybody, so good to know there are others options out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Al-Anon is not a way of dealing with Alcoholism, it is a way for families of alcoholics to go through the steps for their own personal recovery. The thought is that being around an alcoholic is a lot like being an alcoholic and their tendencies might rub off on you in a negative way. By going through the steps and having the peer to peer understanding, you can recover as a family member in much the same way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is somewhat accurate in today's usage, but it really isn't the point. If you think about this shit in the 30's, there were way more active alcoholics than recovered alcoholics. The reality is, if more established members had shared their full names, they would be inundated with calls and letters. So much so that they would be unable to deal with them in a non-professional sense, the way that Bill had outlined it. So they encouraged people to go to and start local meetings using the books, instead of making it a cult of the individual and allowing the guys who were recovering early on to go out and live normal lives. This is obviously not necessary anymore, because there are thousands of people with legit long term sobriety. The point about &quot;outing&quot; people is just not accurate. Some people would obviously prefer not to have certain business associates or friends know about their situation, but that isn't the point of AA. The point is that no person and their success/failure can speak for AA. That means that you can certainly talk to other alcoholics outside AA, and I would venture to guess that most people do, but you can't speak for AA. </p></div>		</li>
