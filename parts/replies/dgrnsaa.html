<p>&quot;you might even be able to argue that episodes of sadness (even for no real reason), are inevitably needed to keep us functioning&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a functionalist perspective, (phenomena occur only when they are useful), this claim is pretty intuitive. However I'm struggling to understand the necessity of conditions like chronic mood disorders.</p>
<p>My brain has been sad every day of my life that I can recall. It causes far more social and physical problems than it solves. I've read that depression in particular might be related to inflammatory processes. So in this context I wonder instead if the mood alterations might be secondary to another necessary process- immune response for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's really important to differentiate between small bouts of sadness and clinically significant mood disorders. When I talk about emotion related to decision making and overall cognitive functioning, I'm mostly referring to uncomplicated and typical emotional states. When you get into the realm of mood disorders, I think the role of necessity changes dramatically since underlying biological function also changes. Personally, I don't think chronic mood disorders are necessary for functioning. As you said, they impede functioning. However, I will argue that we still need normal emotion to help aid our decision making, to solidify social bonds, and to motivate us. But you make a really good point about what could happen when emotional states become disregulated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But once it becomes disadvantageous, won't there be counter balancing evolutionary selection pressure? I wonder on how long of a time line maladaptive traits would take to become less prevalent. Puzzlingly, our population appears to be trending in the direction of emotional dysfunction. Could this have to do with the relatively abrupt changes to our physical and social environments brought on by modern culture's technological capacity?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not all that familiar with functionalism, but that can't possibly be an accurate summary of it. The human body does all sorts of things that aren't useful. As a particularly obvious example, heart attacks aren't useful. There's no situation in which having a heart attack is better than not having a heart attack.</p>
<p>A similar but less obviously-wrong claim would be &quot;phenomena occur only when the underlying mechanisms are useful, or at least were useful to an ancestor.&quot; (Even that is wrong, but it's close enough.)</p>
<p>It's useful to be able to experience emotions, form memories, and learn from experience. It's useful for the brain to coordinate our physical and mental responses to pain, stress, or danger. It's useful to be able to see patterns, make connections, and infer causality quickly, without depending on formal reasoning. Each of those abilities is valuable in its own right - but when you combine certain variants of them with certain environmental stressors, you get complex psychiatric phenomena like depression, anxiety disorders, or psychosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Functionalism is the idea that form implies function. So even a heart attack or a mental illness would serve a purpose, even if not readily apparent.</p>
<p>They might serve to jumpstart a systemic response to a problem. Or in the case of a heart attack maybe the body is trying to force out a blockage with irregular spasming.. but having a purpose I guess doesn't have to always mean having a high success rate at achieving the intended goal. I would just think that conditions that produce low desirability low functionality outcomes consistently like mental illness and heart attacks would eventually be replaced by more efficient purposeful mechanisms. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is me being contrarian for the sake of contrarianism. . .</p>
<p>It could easily be argued that <em>surviving</em> is the beneficial &quot;component&quot; of a heart attack. If the heart attack is the function from the form of an unhealthy lifestyle, and functionalism holds. The additional benefit of having a heart attack and surviving is that it could lead to lifestyle changes that improve the form of their lifestyle to lead to more desirable functions. i.e. Surviving a heart attack could be the wake-up call that someone needs to address their poor health.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>Our emotions, as you said are influenced by a multitude of complicated factors, and these factors will directly impact our mentality as well. Hell, something as simple as botox making it harder to frown could result in generally happier people.^^<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/smile-it-could-make-you-happier/" target="_blank">1</a> </p>
<p>When we want to look at something, the general route is to look at their biopsychosocial circumstances, and the three can somewhat blend into each other. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, the biology: do they have any genetic preconditions, history of mental illness, or a family history of genetically-based mental illness such as depression or anxiety? Are they in good physical condition, or are there chemical imbalances? </li>
<li>Secondly, the psychology: what are their mental patterns during these times? Do they feel sad for multiple weeks at a time? Do they have weeks of intense happiness? What kinds of things are they seeing/doing when they begin to feel sad, and CBT says that the things they tell themself/think about will be intrinsically related to their emotions (either causing the emotions, being caused by the emotions, or both). </li>
<li>Third, the social: Is there anything going on in their life that could be producing these effects or triggering these emotional changes? Do they have positive support systems in life, and do their interactions with the world around them reinforce a sense of purpose or fulfillment? What are their physical habits or routines? Do they eat at regular times, sleep at regular times, and exercise? </li>
</ul>
<p>As I said before, the psychology can be easily influenced by the rest of your body's state. I had one client who suffered from intense anxiety and panic attacks, but he never had any specific triggers or self-talk during his panic attacks. We took him to a cardiologist, and found that it was a heart condition-- then his rapidly increasing heart rate would impact his emotions and flood his system with adrenaline. Once he was receiving treatment for his heart, his panic attacks stopped. </p>
<p>As cliche as it may sound, if you want a happier you, the first step is to address your diet and exercise. Sugar increases dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (area related to reward, motivation, etc) and causes dependency,^^<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15987666" target="_blank">2</a> but also results in an emotional crash after going without it for very long.^^<a href="http://www.iflscience.com/brain/here-s-what-happens-your-brain-when-you-give-sugar-lent/" target="_blank">3</a> Reducing or cutting sugars from your diet can be a good first way to improve your physical and emotional health, but it can cause withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, depression, sense of dread) for the first few weeks, so don't do it alone. </p>
<p>Exercise does a LOT for the brain. Even in ~4 BCE, Seneca, the Roman philosopher, prescribed exercise for a healthy and happy mind. Good aerobic exercise impacts functional plasticity.^^<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.408.4205&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">4</a> According to Cotman, Berchtold, &amp; Christie:^^<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/acba/2db2954f38241bae6261d33c80dedd5d3b86.pdf" target="_blank">5</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The benefits of
exercise have been best defined for learning and memory,
protection from neurodegeneration, and alleviation of
depression, particularly in elderly populations. Exercise
increases synaptic plasticity by directly affecting synaptic
structure and potentiating synaptic strength, and by
strengthening the underlying systems that support
plasticity including neurogenesis, metabolism and vascular
function.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can your example of the person with the cardiac condition work in reverse?  I have bipolar disorder which is mostly manifested in depression.  Last year I had some personal problems, but really I think the depression exists as being a &quot;biochemical thing&quot; as bipolar people are used to experiencing as a result to a physical trigger or the life of the illness itself.  Trying to create a simple story from this:  had an event where I lost conciousness,  it caused injury, so in trying to establish the &quot;why&quot; of the L.O.C. I saw a few doctors, one being a cardiologist who did a heart monitor test for a week.  He told me I had extremely low blood pressure.  Could this cause or make a depressive episode worse?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bipolar disorder is connected with a higher rate of cardiovascular mortality, as well as very high blood pressure.^^<a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313380.php" target="_blank">1</a> Depression also results in typically higher blood pressure. If you are currently taking medication, there could be an impact on your blood pressure and bipolar disorder both. In fact, hypertension (extremely high blood pressure) is almost always found in tandem with bipolar disorder, so it is interesting to see that isn't the case with you. </p>
<p>Seeing as how you have extremely low blood pressure, I would suspect that (with no medication causing it) your low blood pressure could be a causal factor in some of your bouts of depression. Though more common in elderly populations, hypotension has been indicated to be associated with depression.^^<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2465598/" target="_blank">2</a> </p>
<p>You very well may have a bipolar 2 disorder, but I would consider talking with a doctor or psychiatrist about it and doing further testing. It may be something related to your blood pressure and cortisol regulation. </p></div>		</li>
