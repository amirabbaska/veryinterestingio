			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive the simplification, but it seems like it's saying that if you blast matter with enough energy you'll get (very very very small amounts of) anti-matter.</p>
<p>Do we have any ideas (explicable in English) as to how/why this is possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simplest version is that energy condenses into matter.</p>
<p>So if there is enough energy in a given place, it will form matter - both matter and antimatter.</p>
<p>What you do is take a proton, make it go as fast as it can possibly go, and make it hit something. The resulting impact is energetic enough that the proton and whatever it hits turns into energy, which causes there to be a lot of energy in a certain spot. That energy then condenses into matter, including some anti matter.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This is what I understand happens. I could be wrong, and it is a vast, vast simplification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are able to do this because particle number is not fixed in nature. This is what the dirac equation and its interpretation elucidates to. </p>
<p>Suppose I have a photon of energy E. This photon can strike an atom after it strikes the atom the photon can be annilated and an electron and a positron can be created. </p>
<p>There are a few requirements for these types of particle physics reactions to occur. The E required for this to occur is greater than the sum of the rest mass energies E &gt; 2mc^2 (the four momentum must be conserved in the center of mass frame). Reactions like this occur all the time and are subject to certain rules. For instance, conservation of charge and lepton number. </p></div>		</li>
