<p>Most of the cards will pay 1%-4% of the purchase price back to the merchant that sells the card.  </p>
<p>This is a terrible margin for a retail store.  Grocery stores generally have a 15-30% margin on prices, other retail stores will go higher, with some stores clearing 200%.  </p>
<p>/u/Joepoints is correct that merchants use them to draw people into the store as a second benefit.  And finally they don't have the downsides other products have.  The merchants don't pay anything for the cards, so there's no cost to get them in the store.  If they don't sell, the merchant can just dump the gift cards in the trash.  </p>
<p>The racks and such are usually given to the stores as well, and don't require traditional shelf space - they can fit in odd places where other product doesn't really go.</p>
<p>So the low risk and unique form factor offsets the very low margin.</p>
