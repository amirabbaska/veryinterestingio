			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it? I thought that the expansion curve was smooth so that the acceleration away from us was dependent on distance alone. What I mean is that every object is accelerating away from us at the exact same pace so if light were to wrap around it would hit from both directions at the same time. Maybe I'm missing something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The distance traveled would (most often) be different in opposite directions.  Try this: draw a large circle. Now pick 2 random points. Draw a straight line between the points and measure. Now draw a line in the opposite direction out of a point as the first line, when you hit the edge of the circle, &quot;wrap around&quot; it (jump to the other side) and complete the line into the 2nd point. Compare the length of the 2 segments.</p>
<p>If you happened to get close numbers, try it again with the points a lot closer together and/or further apart.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the light from the sun reaches us in about 8 minutes on the direct route. It would take billions of light years to reach us the &quot;long way.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
