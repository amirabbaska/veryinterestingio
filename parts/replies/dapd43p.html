			<div class="markdown"><p>But I think what people often mean is more along the lines of <em>how</em> sick they got. Like, a lot of people might technically get exposed to 6 new viruses in a year, but they might just experience a few days of low level symptoms like lethargy, sneezing a bit more than normal, and then it's gone. They never even really register in their head they were 'sick' (even though they were) because of the efficiency of the immune system response. </p>
<p>That being said, I do agree that people don't really use the phrase right, as it's true sometimes they could just have the bad luck of which particular viruses they were exposed to, or they could be doing things to hamper their own immune system like stress or lack of sleep. Not really the immune system is bad in those cases, it's just struggling to work at it's natural peak just like the rest of the body!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the flip side, you hear about people &quot;getting sick&quot; from the flu shot. Their body has an immune response to the dead flu cells, inflammation kicks in and is overreactive, and they <em>feel</em> sick but aren't actually ill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure there is a difference between the two for most people. You have an immune response, you feel sick, it goes away in a few days. From a layman's perspective, and for all practical purposes, you are sick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed to some degree. People definitely don't realize how much is up to chance </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's also what they see in a close environment, eg if there are 5 people in close vicinity to each other in an office and 1 gets sick and infects the others. Mostly a couple of others catch it, making 3 out of 5 ill. That might happen numerous times over a year, but during all that if 1 of them never gets ill, at least enough to show/feel it, then they have 'a strong immune system'...  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. But it's both a misunderstanding of probability and immune function </p></div>		</li>
