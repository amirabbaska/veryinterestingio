			<div class="markdown"><p>Good post. I've worked in software development for a while and I often think the best hackers are close in mindset to the best test analysts - the kind of people who think &quot;yeah, it works if I do that, but what if I do <em>this</em>?&quot; Most software developers develop for all predictable scenarios and a lot of hacking - like being a good tester - is doing something that nobody expected anyone to do when using the application.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, good QA guys/gals are amazing. Our guy finds bugs I couldn’t have found in 1000 years. </p>
<p>“Hmmm. Let’s see what happens if I plug two mice in, hold click on this button with one, while also holding click on the button with the other, then slide one mouse over to this other button, then let go of click on both while tilting my monitor sideways and rubbing my belly in a counter clockwise direction as I eat this piece of cheese. Oh look, I broke it!”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>QA is the real hero. I don’t understand how they are so thorough. It’s almost supernatural. I have bashed around a product for weeks and ended up with “uhhh the line height looks off?” while our QA lead uses the product once and generates a list of 450 todos. I’m amazed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bug report filed.</p>
<p>Severity: Crash</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce: rub belly counter clockwise while eating cheese, requires monitor to be sideways, belly does not need to be sideways. 7 orbits has the highest success.</p>
<p>Dev comment:</p>
<p>Problem determined to be caused by ESD. Monitor rotated to side caused grounding circuit through base to fail. ESD generated by crossing happy trail repeatedly. Discharged through mice.</p>
<p>Resolution: Groom properly before turning monitor on side.</p>
<p>Closed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In high school, the door to the band room had a chip in the wood right where the latch for the door was. Every day when we would arrive, we would take two pens, insert into the small crack and slowly work the latch open until it released the door. We would hang out there instead of going to homeroom.</p></div>		</li>
