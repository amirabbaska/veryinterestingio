<p>truly random data</p>

<p>That's the part that seems off. I'm not familiar with quantum mechanics, which is something that's often assosicated with <em>true</em> randomness, but other than that randomness is just something that exists in context. To us as humans we consider things random when we can't comprehend and thus predict the actio-reactio behind it. </p>
<p>Whether or not we can do that for any given source of randomness entirely depends on our knowledge and most importantly our information about it. I know that a common source of randomness is meassuring changes in atmospheric pressure. That works for all practical reasons, but the actual philosophical concept of randomness isn't satisfied as its results aren't truly random but just a product of our lack of information.</p></div>		</li>
