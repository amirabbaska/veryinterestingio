			<div class="markdown"><p>It would pay for the cost of treatment at a hospital. Australian healthcare is like American healthcare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Health care in Australia is largely provided by private medical practitioners or by private or government operated hospitals, with costs of medical services paid by private insurance or government agencies, and the balance payable by the patient.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically the million dollar insurance is just another way of saying, &quot;this guy is medically important so he gets free healthcare for life.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
