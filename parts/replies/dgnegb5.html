			<div class="markdown"><p>Disinfectants are generally liquid or gas based and would not be practical to apply to a probe on another planetary body. Furthermore, man-made disinfectants are unlikely to be more effective than the radiation encountered during space travel and other attributes of space at destroying microbial hitchhikers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might seem a little counter intuitive, but aerosols in space can actually be a big problem. With a near perfect vacuum, gravity and other attractive forces can work wonders. We've lost satellites because of outgassing of materials on the satellite itself (plastics, vynils, fuel, etc.) on the solar arrays and reducing their effectiveness drastically. Most probes going to a planet further than Mars to land are likely to be nuclear powered to make up for the lack of sunlight (Curiosity is powered by the radioactive decay of Pu-238, for example. Stuff glows red hot from its own heat), so there's less of an issue with them than a solar powered probe. So spray disinfectants could be effective in space prior to an atmospheric reentry, but only if properly engineered to apply them correctly. </p>
<p>All that said, however, most things that can survive the vacuum and radiation of an earth launch, trip through the Van Allen belts, deep space, and close approach to whichever planet we're sending it to, a simple disinfectant wouldn't harm either, as you stated, so it's not worth doing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is done on Earth. Very thoroughly. But that doesn't kill everything.</p>
<p>You can kill nearly everything by heating the whole spacecraft up, but that means every component has to survive these high temperatures - which makes the spacecraft much more expensive. And even that does not kill the very last spore. Completely melting the spacecraft would work, but then your spacecraft is completely useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what I'm gathering from various answers is there's no way to kill <em>every</em>thing. Hence, the need to be careful with what we land where.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>biggest problem is cost.  Heat stuff above 450, and let it bake, the proteins break down but, it's slow and expensive.</p>
<p>Means you have to add that as a design criteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple levels of disinfecting, most are various stages of autoclave (oven) and the temperature and time depends on how clean you want to be. </p>
<p>Heat can damage the electronics, so you don't go super high of it's not needed. </p>
<p>Planetary Protection is a real division, and one that makes sure we don't infect another world</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically we have to go to very ancient regions of water (like Opportunity is about to) or wait for a tower that is cleared by Planetary Protection to go to a site with water near the surface. As of right now any water, I think, 5m below the surface is forbidden. You need more disinfectant tools before we can go</p></div>		</li>
