<p>Mass of alpha = 4.00260325415 amu</p>
<p>Mass of Tl-205 =204.9744275 amu (decay product)</p>
<p>208.9803987 - (4.00260325415+204.9744275) = +0.0033679 amu</p>
<p>Since the mass of the parent Bi-209 is heaver than the mass of the decay products, it is a reasonable assumption that the Bi-209 is radioactive.  Also since the decay energy of the alpha is 3.1 MeV (take the mass excess and use E=mc^2 and convert the units), this is pretty low for alpha decays so we can be pretty certain it will have a very long half-life.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may well be so, but if you operate under the assumption that Bi-209 is not radioactive, then what is the use of Geiger-Nuttall? Or put differently, how does GN predict Bi-209 radioactivity? (I'm genuinely asking.)
Edit: Spelling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geiger-Nuttall is an empirical method of approximating alpha decay half-lives. All you have to do is plug in the Z and the Q-value for the decay. As long as the Q-value is positive, the equation will give a physically reasonable answer (meaning not zero, infinity, imaginary, etc.).</p>
<p>There are no assumptions necessary. All you need is a nuclide with a positive alpha decay Q-value.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But wouldn't the mass of almost everything heavier than iron be than the mass of the parent + decay products, since the peak of nuclear binding energy is around iron?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your thinking is sound but the energy difference between the parent and daughter products is even smaller so the half lives would be even longer.</p>
<p>If you look at the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_mercury" target="_blank">isotopes of mercury</a> as an example, you'll see it lists the naturally occurring isotopes as &quot;observationally
stable&quot; meaning that yes they could undergo alpha decay to platinum,
but nobody has seen it yet.  Here is a full list of those isotopes which could decay but nobody has seen it yet.</p>
