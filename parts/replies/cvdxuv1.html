<p>Therefore, it would be VERY difficult for a person to show standing to even start a case to force the Feds to enforce said laws.</p>

<p>While I agree that standing is key, the problem for the Feds is even worse than that.  The Feds would be the plaintiffs in one of the scenarios that OP is questioning (prosecuting the States for non-enforcement of federal drug laws).  As such, in order to have standing, they would have to prove that the States not enforcing a law that <em>they themselves are choosing not to enforce</em> somehow damages them.</p></div>		</li>
