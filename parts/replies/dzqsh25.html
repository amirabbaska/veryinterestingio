			<div class="markdown"><p>I have eczema caused by my immune system being a dick to my skin, and taking a probiotic pill has helped me <em>a ton</em>. I recently had a bottle of kombucha and my skin has been in a lot better shape than it has been, even with the probiotic pill.</p>
<p>In my case, I definitely need the probiotics since it seems to give my immune system something to do other than attack my skin, but for someone who is not suffering from an immune system disfunction I can agree that they probably don't want to mess with probiotics other than something like yogurt.</p>
<p>They aren't a miracle drug to fix any ailment, and I feel like probiotics are the 2010s version of antioxidants since that used to be a huge marketing push in the 2000s. I'm just happy I've finally found something that helps me after 2 decades of hating my skin. </p></div>		</li>
