			<div class="markdown"><p>The true definition and beauty of Saturn's rings comes from the fact that they have been around a while. It takes time for them to get that thin and to get the intricate banding (although that is also partly the result of moons).</p>
<p>When the material, that would later become the moon, was ejected from the Earth it would have ended up as a bunch of differently sized rocks in a broad-ish array of orbits. It is my understanding that these discrete lumps very quickly coalesced into the Moon (in the order of centuries). I do not think this is long enough to pass through a phase that you could call &quot;ring-like&quot;. In fact the very fact that they coalesced at all maybe tells us they were never a ring.</p>
<p>I am prepared to be corrected by an expert though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert either, but I do know thats a fairly accurate description.  Most collisions result in something similar to a ring, but not one as finely tuned as Saturn's ring system. I doubt earth had much of one, simply because the collision resulted in 2 massive bodies that would disrupt any ring shape that might have started to form.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, there was a simulation of 2 planetary bodies colliding on my front page today: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8N2y1Nk.gifv" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/8N2y1Nk.gifv</a></p>
<p>You can actually see a moon-like structure form in the gif.</p>
<p>While an initial collision will send debris in all directions, the structure will eventually flatten into a disk due to gravity. Both galaxies and solar systems assume this shape for the same reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't exactly relevant, but there's a fiction book, Seveneves by Neal Stephenson, that describes the formation of rings around earth in the context of the story, essentially the reverse of your question. Damn good book too. I haven't read one by him that isn't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By no means an astronomy expert, but there's no way that it would be visible from any distance greater than a few hundred kilometers if the debris was even close enough to be seen next to other debris. There's just so much space out there, and satellites are for the most part very tiny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of unrelated question.  In Isaac Asimov's literature, it at one point heavily implies that our solar system has some very &quot;unique&quot; aspects to it, and nobody is really sure why our solar system is so unique.  For starters, it suggests that it is very unusual that our planet has a single satellite (moon) that is &quot;an unusually large satellite, proportional to Earth's size&quot;.  The literature also suggests that there is something unusual about the size and scope of Saturn's ring.  Specifically, it states that this legendary &quot;planet has very prominent rings, much more so than any known gas giant&quot;.</p>
<p>Asimov was a scientist himself, and I am not, so I'm wondering if there is any truth (and cause) to these peculiarities in our solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was almost certainly taking writers liberties.</p>
<p>I think he died before we discovered a single exoplanet, and even now we have not discovered enough to say anything about how typical either of those features are. We still do not know how many planets have rings as good as Saturn, all we know is that no other planet in our system does.</p>
<p>We can't quite (very close) detect Earth size planets maybe our moon is unusual maybe not.</p>
<p>It might be that both features are unusual! But then it might also be the case that every stellar system has planets with features you could call unusual. Thus making the uniqueness not so unique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On this same topic, however, the exoplanet evidence we have so far <em>does</em> suggest that our gas giants are a little unusual (if not super rare), given their distance from the star and their number.  Some people theorize that Jupiter + Saturn, with their immense gravity wells, have diverted or gobbled up a good portion of collision-course objects which would have pounded the Earth over and over.  Because we have been (relatively) protected by our gas giants, the Earth has had &quot;time&quot; to develop life.  Admittedly, a large percentage of the exoplanets we can detect with the transit method tend to be &quot;hot Jupiters&quot; which are very, very large and very, very close to their stars (hence the &quot;hot&quot; nickname).  It <em>appears</em> that systems with hot Jupiters are very different than our solar system, but of course the smaller the planet, the harder it is to detect.</p></div>		</li>
