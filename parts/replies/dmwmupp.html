			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember all this right, nitrogen is present in ammonia, which is a byproduct of our metabolism (proteins break down to amino acids, excess amino acids are broken down into components including ammonia). This is toxic to our cells in large amounts because nitrogen will displace oxygen if there's a high enough concentration, making it harder for cells to perform their aerobic functions, but that's more relevant to gaseous nitrogen (don't worry, unless you're breathing straight off a nitrous tank or in bad air in a mine or chemical plant you're fine, a large proportion of Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen and your ancestor's respiratory systems evolved to handle that). Getting back to ammonia...to avoid internal nitrogen buildup, our bodies process that ammonia in the liver, turning it into the more stable molecule urea by popping off one of the ammonia (NHsub4) molecule's hydrogens and replacing it with an amide group (CONHsub2). This urea is then filtered out of the blood by the kidneys, and sent to your bladder for storage until you urinate. Breakdowns in this process can lead to issues like gout and kidney stones.
To answer your question more directly (Why are there people who insist urine is sterile and healthy if it's so toxic?) URINE as a whole is mostly water plus excess salts/ions your body doesn't need, including urea. Pee won't kill you or anything else, that's the point of all the processes that make it. UREA is a processed and much less toxic nitrogenous waste than ammonia, but excessive buildup can still be harmful to you.
Other organisms handle their nitrogenous wastes differently. As I mentioned before, birds further process urea into uric acid because they need to not waste water. Fish and amphibians, which have an abundance of water available, usually excrete straight ammonia because they don't have to store it internally for long and don't need to waste calories processing it further. Some sharks are extra weird and actually maintain a certain amount of urea in their blood to keep their osmolarity similar to that of the ocean water around them without any notably ill effects.
If you want more detail ask Google, the Wikipedia on Urea covers lots of environmental and biological info.</p></div>		</li>
