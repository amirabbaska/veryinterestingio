			<div class="markdown"><p>I will preface this response with see a medically orientated optometrist or an opthalmologist. If sleep apnea is suspected then it may be related to floppy eyelid syndrome which would contribute to surface dryness due to exposure. Sometimes our eyelids just don't close all the way while we sleep or if we sleep on our sides or stomach that may cause exposure surface dryness and corneal edema leading to symptoms such as temporary blurred vision. </p></div>		</li>
