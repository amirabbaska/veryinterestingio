<p>The 0.5% number is very low and is only true if you look at total fuel rod mass and not isotope mass. Light water reactors can only utilize U233, U235, and Pu239 as fissile fuel. If you only look at those elements, we actually burnup most of that in three to four fuel cycles. </p>
<p>For my boiling water reactor: Peak fuel enrichment in my new fuel is 4.95%. After 3 or 4 cycles I can the reactor, total enrichment of the combination of U235 and the Pu239 hat we bred in the fuel is around 0.7%. </p>
<p>So you end up burning the majority of the original U235, and breed a decent amount of Pu239 which is also burned. So even in terms of total fuel mass of both fissile and non fissile elements, we burn up a lot more than 0.5%. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the clarification.  0.5% was what I had read.</p>
<p>I thought that gen I also only uses fuel rods in one cycle.  Is that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, 0.5% of total fuel mass may be correct for CANDU reactors, which start at natural uranium enrichment levels (0.75% of total fuel mass). I specifically was talking about light water reactors.</p>
<p>The once through fuel cycle has nothing to do with the generation of reactors. We currently have gen 2 through 3+, there are no gen 1 power reactors operating in the US. It doesn't matter though, the reason we have a once through fuel cycle in the US and most of the world is because the costs associated with reprocessing don't justify it. France does reprocess their fuel, so they take the fissile elements and some of the non-fissile elements and remix it to make new fuel assemblies, but France is also 75% nuclear and has wide governmental support. </p>
<p>The costs of new uranium are low enough combined with the fact that we don't have 1000+ nuclear plants to support reprocessing at levels required to be economically viable, that we just never built reprocessing facilities for commercial power applications. </p>
<p>I believe there are military fuel reprocessing facilities. </p>
<p>So it is done.....it's also different from generation 4 reactors (non are design ready yet). For example, LFTR which is always talked about would have a molten reactor core with a continuous reprocessing system running. This system doesn't exist yet, but the idea is you would do real time remixing of the fuel to maximize fuel burnup. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The oral toxicity of uranium compounds has been evaluated in several animal species.
Oral LD50 (dose producing 50% mortality rate) values of 114 and 136 mg U/kg have
been estimated for rats and mice, respectively, following single gavage administrations
of uranyl acetate dihydrate (Domingo et al., 1987).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That LD-50 would never be achieved with the dilution of a few grains of uranium waste in a whole lake, I'm calling bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's not only uranium, otherwise we probably wouldn't throw it away. There should be a lot of decay and fission products in there, mostly heavy metals, which are often quite poisonous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uranium is a heavy metal, and most decay products can be (and are) chemically separated. Nothing there is more poisonous chemically than uranium, including lead. The radioactive profile of a few grains diluted would be even smaller a consideration to make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, yes it is.  0.5% is for Gen I reactors.</p>
<p>Gen II reactors are 1% efficient.</p>
<p>The US has mostly Gen I reactors (since we pioneered the whole technology).  We have some Gen II reactors.  When I last checked 10+ years ago, there were only 4 breeder reactors worldwide: France, Russia, and Japan.  I couldn't find which country had two.</p>
<p>Edit: the military has breeder reactors, obviously, but they are not used for power generation.</p></div>		</li>
