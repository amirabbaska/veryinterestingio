			<div class="markdown"><p>There are companies in my town that go around in a car with border collies and keep geese away from whatever site they are working at. I know that the geese learn eventually that they shouldn't stop at this particular spot because a &quot;predator&quot; is going to be there to get them. I'm looking to train my own border collie and start my own business doing this as soon as I can move to a new place w/ a sufficient yard to exercise my dog. That info is cool, so these geese can remember where to stop, and also remember where not to stop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed about the importance of memory but geese also pay attention to conditions and can adjust accordingly. For example, in a warm winter, they may stay much further north and not head as far south, just because they don't need to do all that extra flying if they're already finding food just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago, around Easter, we took in a baby Canada Goose that appeared in our back yard, with no flock in sight. He stayed with us in the back yard and played with our dogs and was more or less a family pet for about 6 months or so.</p>
<p>Then he disappeared and hasn't returned since.</p>
<p>Since he never knew his flock, is it safe to assume he just went and joined a flock as a stranger?</p></div>		</li>
