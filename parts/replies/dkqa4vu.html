			<div class="markdown"><p>Very well put, but I would like to throw something in here to support your comment.   In engineering terms batch means &quot;put stuff in tank, dump it out entirely, start over.&quot;  Continuous means &quot;steady flow constantly from one end to the other, with only minor changes to deal with variations in conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>Continuous batch is a weird hybrid in the middle.  For the stomach, some liquid level is generally maintained...things come in, digestive fluids come in...thing balance...things get dumped out the pyloric sphincter...everything goes up and down.  Continuous batch is absolutely a great term, because when you dump in a bunch of food your body reacts by adding a bunch of enzymes and digestive fluids to deal with it.  You add alcohol, it gets dumped to the intestines fairly soon.  Nothing is purely continuous or batch about the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, alcohol is one of the only substances (including water and I think aspirin) that can be absorbed directly by the stomach. Most of it (like 80%) is absorbed in the small intestine but absorption in the stomach means it hits the bloodstream faster. Which explains why alcohol affects us faster than other drugs which are absorbed in the intestines only. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the form of Aspirin but yeah. Caffeine is also absorbed through the stomach, which is why it is said to only take a few minutes before you begin to feel its effects.</p>
<p>Edit: not much water is absorbed through the stomach. 85% is absorbed through the small intestine and the rest through the colon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything goes out the end. The pancreas releases bicarbonate and more digestive enzymes which neutralizes the acidity of the 'food'. Also, increased acidity in the small intestine is a signal to the rest of the body to do more digestion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, acid is released into the intestine. Chyme, the churned food, is very acidic. The other commenter mentions that the pancreas secretes bicarbonate, which is true, but doesn't really paint a full picture. Bicarbonate-rich mucus from the pancreas is released into the small intestine, like 10cm into the small intestine. i.e. if you cut someone open, you'll see the hepatopancreatic duct connect into the small intestine ten cm past the pylorus of the stomach.</p>
<p>So for 10cm, your duodenum is tortured with stomach acid until it reaches this duct, at which point hepatic bile and bicarb can act on it, right? Thankfully not. The first 10cm of the small intestine are covered in specialized glands that secrete bicarb on their own; Brunner's glands. </p>
<p>The intestines are also lined with mucus, which protects the intestinal wall from acid at all points along its length.</p>
<p>edit: also I said that you can see the hepatopancreatic ampulla in situ, that is, if you cut somebody open. Well... maybe <em>you</em> can. But that shit is hard to find in a cadaver. The actual sphincter of Oddi, the opening from the hepatopancreatic ampulla, is goddamn invisible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that the mucus is protective (it's a great chemoenzymatic barrier), but it's presence is patchy in the small intestines, increasing in thickness as you head towards the colon which has a thick layer made up of both firmly adherent and loosely adherent mucus (largely MUC2 glycoprotein, which has a long protein backbone and decorated with branched sugars to look like a pipe cleaner / cotton candy). These sugars, which make up ~80% of the mass, are responsible for much of the protection. </p>
<p>Back to the small intestine, Peyer's patches and M cells are virtually devoid of mucus (easily released) to assist in their function to sense the environment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why we can grow accustomed to different foods? Like when I was eating salad and grilled chicken exclusively in college I could not handle greasy foods at all. But then I started eating a more diversified diet and I can handle eating many more things. </p>
<p>Or how vegans can't just jump into eating a steak right away, they need to slowly start eating meat.</p></div>		</li>
