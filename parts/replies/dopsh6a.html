			<div class="markdown"><p>Good summary except the statement about adjusting for other factors.  From the results section of the paper you referenced:  &quot;these effects exist even when adjusted for marital, socioeconomic, and psychiatric status; and their influences are much stronger in women than in men.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the confidence intervals in table 2 calculated in the adjusted analyses, none of the confidence intervals of male parents do not include an OR of 1, and this is only the case for female parents who have 3 or more children. The implicit effect size is slightly higher for women, but that's expected as the base rate is much lower (women are less likely to commit suicide). In the combined analysis, only very large families (5 or more children) have a (weak) protective effect in the adjusted analysis.</p>
<p>In the unadjusted ('crude') analysis, the total OR is 0.73 for parents with one child and 0.55 for parents with two children, whereas the adjusted ORs are in both cases 1.01. This means that in a standard two-parent family setting, you go from having almost half the suicide risk to having exactly the same suicide risk once you adjust for other variables of interest. If you look at the point where the negative effect is strongest, in the large-family setting, adjusting for other variables removes more than half of the risk reduction (the 0.49 OR in the unadjusted model turns into a 0.77 OR in the adjusted model in the 5-or-more-children group). I think it's perfectly fair to say based on that that: 'When you adjust for other factors of interest (like income and ethnicity) parental status seems to lose a lot of its explanatory power when you look at 'the big picture'.' </p></div>		</li>
