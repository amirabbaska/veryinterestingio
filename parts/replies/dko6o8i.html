			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a great bit in Freakanomics about a daycare that implemented a late fee as a last resort to try to limit the problem of parents arriving late to pick up their kids. The number of late arrivals skyrocketed because they had removed the strong social pressure to follow a rule and replaced it with a simple shame-free transaction.  Detention is about social pressure as much or more so than punishment.</p>
<p>I would also add that they aren't responsible for just one student.  Some suspensions are as much about removing the student for the good of others. This path leads to expulsion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. My daughter used to go to a daycare and they charged a ridiculous amount for every 15 min delay. They kept the parents in check. I guess it depends on how much the parents are being charged. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the time students who end up with suspension don't care about their classes and sometimes don't have parent who will discipline them on the days they are suspended. I really don't think it works as a deterrent for most students who end up in the kind of trouble that warrants a suspension. Without adequate parenting, there isn't really much a school can do to discipline students.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but unless I'm mistaken I don't think that makes suspension actually an attractive option.  I mean, I don't know of people intentionally gunning for a suspension just to have some days off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's the issue, they likely don't care and it mimics or jail system. You punish them, take away their ability to remain at pace with their peers, and in cases of left behind or grades costs both the school and society more money in both the re-education and subsequent less capable person in the working world. </p>
<p>It doesn't do anything to rehabilitate a wrong doer, just keeps them back longer.</p></div>		</li>
