<p>The second paragraph I can imagine, but assuming rotation changes are slow and steady, do they have an effect on a human scale?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my googling, the Earth will lose the Moon to the Sun's pull before the Earth becomes tidally locked to the Moon. From there, the Sun will have become hot enough to vaporize the oceans of Earth and remove the greatest source of tidal friction, so there really shouldn't be anything to keep the Earth from rotating before it's engulfed by the growing red giant that was our Sun.</p></div>		</li>
