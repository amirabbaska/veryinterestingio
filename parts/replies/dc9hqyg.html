			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, the two that I'm thinking of specifically are both main thoroughfares for the area, which is part of why it's odd to me. I think /u/jonathan_6 is onto something with the managing traffic flow theory, but I haven't paid enough attention, I guess, to see if that may be it. Whatever the reason, it drives me nuts, especially when I'm (constantly) late for work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty odd to me that you experience this, because every major city I've lived in has done the opposite. If you are on a major road and heading in the normal traffic direction for that time of day, the lights are specifically arranged so you hit greens all in a row.</p>
<p>It may just be that your city is unusual, or you drive unusually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it's just local shitty infrastructure. Most of the city makes no sense, so I shouldn't be surprised by something like stoplights. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my city you can make all of the green lights in a row but if you hit one red then you get caught in the rest. However, I think they just recently changed it so in the middle it switches you're not stopping every time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big one is how traffic merges onto the thoroughfares. Generally you have big &quot;feeder&quot; areas, where lots of cars are making left/rights into main streets, and &quot;leaver&quot; areas, where lots of cars are making left/rights out of main streets. These can obviously overlap (a feeder and leaver side street).</p>
<p>Lets consider the most simple case: A straight road 5 street lights long, each well spaced out, at small side streets that have no turn signals (no left/right turns). You can time these street lights to go green in a staggered fashion so that it turns green as the lead car from the last light hits it. This only works in one direction. In the opposite direction, they will make a few lights at a time before hitting a red, but still pretty efficient if its the kind of street where traffic flows one way early in the day, the opposite at the end of day.</p>
<p>Now lets say the third light is a feeder street which has a huge queue of cars trying to make a left onto your main street. What happens if we keep our &quot;efficient&quot; system. Well, when the feeder light turns green, the main street at that light just turns red (duh). That means that the next light will just turn red by the time these cars turning from the feeder street make it there.</p>
<p>So they build up at the light, lets say 20 cars make a left and are now waiting at the next light on our main street. Now our feeder street turns red. The cars on the main street start driving. The lead car is supposed to get to the next light and have it turn green. But there are 20 cars there now. So he actually only gets to a point 20 cars back. That means that 20 cars that SHOULD make the light from our main street won't make the light, and are now waiting there (not taking into account acceleration etc).</p>
<p>Now our feeder street turns green again. Instead of no cars at the next red, there are 20 cars waiting there. So 20 cars join them, and now we have 40 cars waiting. then 60. Then eventually the first car from the main light at the feeder street will not make the next light at all because there are too many cars waiting, and almost no one is ever able to turn from the feeder street after that.</p>
<p>We could add a little extra green time to each light after the feeder street to clear both the cars from the previous light and the turning cars from our feeder streets, but if we have multiple feeder streets in a row, our green lights are going to get insanely long. </p>
<p>If its a feeder and leaver spot, like a mall, we could hope on average that the cars going into the mall are roughly equal to those leaving. So we could say that a good solution is for that light, we'll make it so that the next light turns red just as the previous light's traffic gets to it (basically like a train station system). People will both leave and join at that feeder intersection at about the same rates, so the number of cars waiting at the next light will stay roughly the same, and after that we can go back to our staggered system.</p>
<p>So now instead of maximum waiting at one light, you will maximum wait at 2 lights. Its a little less efficient, but we prevent clogging up our feeder/leaver intersection.</p>
<p>That's obviously really simplified, and real systems are taking into account a ton of factors (different types of vehicles, flow rates changing by time of day, w/e). </p>
<p>But that is the start of an explanation for why you might choose to use a staggered 1 light at a time type queue system in certain neighborhoods. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you live in the same city I do. I've never seen such stupid lights in any other city. Between home and work, there are 12 lights, and I've been stopped at 13 before, despite it being 6AM and traveling entirely on major roads. (Not only are they timed poorly, but sometimes they're green long enough for like two cars.) It's obscene - 45 minutes to travel 5 miles with no traffic is a fucking bummer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. Going to work down the main thoroughfare of my city can either take me 15 minutes if I hit all greens, or nearly 40 minutes if I hit all reds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meanwhile, I had an experience where I was in a car that got off the Van Wyck Expressway at the Queens Boulevard exit, then drove 5 miles along Queens Boulevard to 58th Street, and encountered only two red lights: First one was in Rego Park, second was the left turn signal at 58th Street. It took about 16 minutes to cover the distance, and traffic was flowing well.</p>
