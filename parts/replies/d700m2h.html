			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the lucid and insightful explanation. Explaining that the gravitational waves themselves have momentum and, if I understand correctly, a &quot;lateral&quot; velocity in like with the earth-sun system, makes it very clear how the whole system functions.</p>
<p>Solved!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This gets far more complicated if you apply acceleration to the Sun independently of it's surrounding bodies (i.e., the earth)</p>

<p>Interesting. So what about a thrusting stellar engine like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_engine#Class_A_.28Shkadov_thruster.29" target="_blank">Shkadov thruster</a>? (TL;DR: put a giant light sail high over one pole of the sun, accelerate the entire solar system to go somewhere.) The descriptions I've read of this say all the planets will be neatly &quot;dragged&quot; along, but my take from this thread is that accelerating the sun would necessarily do weird things to the orbits of everything else in the solar system, even if it's very slight it seems intuitive (which admittedly is a very bad metric for advanced physics) to me that long-stable orbits would be messed up in a hurry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An 8 minute delay isn't going to have much of a chance to impact the stability of orbiting bodies unless it undergoes a <strong>massive</strong> acceleration.  The difference between where the gravitational forces point and where the Sun's true position lie wouldn't be all that significant.</p>
<p>If you could <strong>massively</strong> alter the velocity of the sun over a <strong>very</strong> short period of time, then yes, the orbits wouldn't hold.  But that's not something that can really happen.</p></div>		</li>
