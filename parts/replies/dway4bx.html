			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a proposal to grind up the Martian moons into dust to spread on the surface, which would darken it up to absorb more heat, which would cause the CO2 ice at the poles to sublimate and cause a runaway greenhouse effect to warm things up.</p>
<p>If we really wanted a moon around Mars, I think towing Ceres into a stable orbit would be the best choice. We could even mine water ice on Ceres and send it down to Mars for human use and crop cultivation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Phobos - apply directly to the surface.  Phobos - apply directly to the surface.  Phobos - apply directly to the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would warm the surface but the problem of not having a magnetic field is still there. Without that the solar winds will strip the atmosphere and the surface will still get lots of radiation.</p></div>		</li>
