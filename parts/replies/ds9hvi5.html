And it's certainly not &quot;our research project is to find the biggest prime ever found&quot;, because, as someone else put it, finding it does not extend our mathematical knowledge at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, (pure) mathematicians generally work on building, expanding and broadening the tools of mathematics, or furthering the understanding of mathematical objects. </p>
<p>Let's try to  keep things not too esoteric. I presume you've at least heard of calculus, and know that it's an area of mathematics which has a lot of application in the sciences. You might even have taken a calculus course yourself. Well, at some point, calculus didn't exist. Someone had to invent it (or discover it, depending on which philosophical stance you have). </p>
<p>Some mathematicians are the people who invent subject areas like calculus. These are the 'theory-builders'. They invent integrals and derivatives, and then notice that calculus gives rise to differential equations, which turn out to have a vast number of applications in physics, chemistry, and biology. They then help answer how to solve such equations, what kind of equations have easy-to-understand solutions and which have not, and how you can find solutions which are 'good enough' for those that are not easy to solve. Then they might take it further, by noticing that calculus is really a form of measurement over straight, euclidean space, and ask whether the notion applies to more exotic geometries. Out pops differential geometry. Or they note that differentials are at first taken on finite-dimensional spaces, but can be extended to infinite dimensions, and functional analysis pops out. Physicians are happy, they now have the tools to study black holes. Medical doctors are happy, they can now do tensor imaging and CAT scans. Engineers are happy, they can prevent ever more complex objects from collapsing. And mathematicians are happy, because they either take pride in what mathematics can accomplish outside of mathematics, or because of the beauty of the theories themselves. </p>
<p>Not all mathematicians are theory builders. Some are more like problem solvers. They carry around their mathematical toolset like carpenters carry their hammers and drills, and apply them wherever needed. People who are called 'applied mathematicians' often fit into this pigeonhole, but not all. And not all pure mathematicians are theory builders. </p>
<p>This very simplified narrative doesn't really do justice to everything mathematicians do, but I hope it helps put it into context. There are a huge number of areas of mathematics out there, and calculus is just a small dot on the chart. Some areas of math are developed because they have applications outside of math, some because they have applications to math itself, and some just because of pure aesthetics. The main takeaway is that math isn't a &quot;solved problem&quot;, an area where everything that can be discovered has already been discovered. Many people who never did math beyond elementary school or high school seem to believe that. Mathematics is a very active field of study, with new, vast avenues of research showing up, new results being discovered, all the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not the sort of thing mathematicians research. There are many branches of math that research all sorts of things, from how exotic, many-dimensional spaces behave, to new methods for solving differential equations, to formalizing logical reasoning. Finding new prime numbers isn't really interesting for mathematicians, though coming up with new methods for finding prime numbers may be.</p></div>		</li>
