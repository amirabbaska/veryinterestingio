			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's how it starts.  First you laugh because you recognize the pattern your life is falling into.  Then you just chuckle because start to see that there is no end.  Then you become irritated that this is all there is?  But!  Then you get that first sip of a cold one at the end of another shit day.  This isn't so bad, is it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, I liked beer the first time I tried it.</p>
<p>That said, I had my first beer at 28, and I had already developed a taste for bitter foods (green veggies, coffee), and I didn't really like sweets anymore. So I think most of your comment is correct, with a slight caveat that sometimes it has less to do with beer itself, and more to do with your tastes overall. </p>
<p>I feel like a lot of teenagers who try beer for the first time probably also drink a lot of soda, so they're not really conditioned to enjoy beer yet.</p></div>		</li>
