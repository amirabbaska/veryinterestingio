			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, when the machine is reset, the CPU begins executing code at a specific address, called a &quot;reset vector&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reset_vector" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reset_vector</a>). Every time you turn on the machine, it begins execution at the same address ... eventually loading a small program called a bootloader, which knows how to load the OS kernel.</p>
<p>All of the microprocessor ICs in the computer (including the CPU) have a reset pin, which causes a hardware interrupt that sets the instruction pointer to the reset vector.</p></div>		</li>
