<p>That section explicitly mentions Iraq and Syria, as well as any other &quot;country or area of concern&quot; which either the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security can determine. These are where those seven countries come from: <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/02/18/dhs-announces-further-travel-restrictions-visa-waiver-program" target="_blank">https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/02/18/dhs-announces-further-travel-restrictions-visa-waiver-program</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Except the problem with this claim is that the ban is on people <strong>who have already been vetted, including permanent residents</strong>. If the goal of the ban was as you stated, then he should've done what Obama did and disallow new refugee claims from those countries, and/or not allow new visas to be issued for people from those countries. </p>
<p>Banning people who have already been vetted doesn't do anything to aid this purported goal.</p></div>		</li>
