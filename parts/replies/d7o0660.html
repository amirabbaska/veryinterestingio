<p>The Last Train From Hiroshima by Charles Pellegrino</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently, the first edition included content based on fabricated material by a man who claimed to be flight engineer on one of the planes that escorted the Enola Gay.</p>
<p>This material was removed in the second <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/charles-pellegrino/to-hell-and-back-last-train/" target="_blank">2015 edition</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recounting graphically detailed stories of the hibakusha (exposed), including double survivors who experienced the bombings of both cities, the author conjures a hellish landscape: we see “flash-burned” images on roads, people dissolving into gas and desiccated carbon, a man seemingly tap-dancing on feetless legs, and men, women, and children “degloved,” their skin pulled off by the wind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first reaction to the comment was &quot;I am buying this book&quot;, but after seeing this review, I don't think I am really up for it. </p>
<p>Edit: Ok, this is really bothering me. Can anyone speculate on how long would a person remain conscious if their skin were ripped off like that? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I made the mistake of watching <a href="https://youtu.be/8QFNP-UV9jo" target="_blank">Barefoot Gen</a> on a whim which is an animated movie but it really doesn't hold back when showing the aftermath of the bomb and what happened to people when it hit. The original manga to this movie was written by someone who was a witness to everything that happened so I like to think it's pretty accurate. It's also very heart wrenching so you have BEEN WARNED! </p>
<p>Edit: Just realized there aren't any English subs but I believe the part when the bomb hits is around the 30 minute mark. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they're being degloved due to an atomic blast, the degloving will not be the only problem. I'm no expert (clearly) but I'd imagine the pressure alone needed to degloved a person that way would probably have knocked them unconscious too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.  I'm not an expert, but from what I do know, the amount of force it would take to deglove <em>a whole person</em> would most likely be many many times higher than the force that is required to liquefy your organs and break your bones.  You'd probably be knocked unconscious, degloved, and die simultaneously. People get organ damage from the force of decelerating in a car crash going 70 miles an hour. A shock wave many times faster would be crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been to the museum in Hiroshima. The worst part, by far, is the section on the aftermath. People were jumping into water wells, which were boiling, in an attempt to alleviate the burn pain/ dehydrated from the heat. </p>
<p>It's an intense experience. Made even more intense by the fact that I was there as an active duty US Navy sailor.</p></div>		</li>
