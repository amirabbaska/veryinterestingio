<p>Both are evolutionary traits and they are not a heritage thing necessarily.</p>
<p>The mind is it's own separate construct from the body, and evolutionary traits along with patterns of thought are learned and change over time as your environment calls for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine was going down the stairs with a baby. Every time I measured the odds of something horrifying coming from it. Dropped the baby... but what if I fell too and was too hurt to help the baby? Or if I fell ON the baby?</p>
<p>I was insanely careful about going down the stairs with the baby and didn't ever let anyone else carry him down the stairs. If something so horrible happened, let it happen to me although I'm aware and hyper careful. Wouldn't want my mom to blame herself for something like that happening when I'm scared it might happen to me. </p>
<p>It happened when he was 1.5. And he slid right down those stairs, stiff as a board, face first. No rolling, no broken bruised or scraped anything. I missed the edge of a step with my heel and fell sitting, also slid down some but he slid all the way to the bottom of the stairs. </p>
<p>Out of all the scenarios I imagined, best and worst case scenario if I should drop the baby down the stairs, this wasn't one of them. </p></div>		</li>
