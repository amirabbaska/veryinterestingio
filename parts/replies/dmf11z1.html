			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I have heard of people talking about sleep apnea, but i doubt it is this. Sleep apnea will hinder your performance throughout the day if I'm not mistaken? I am not tired during the day. I just have to really push myself with every fiber of my body to get out of bed and get going. After about an hour I start to feel human and am fine. </p>
<p>I have experienced that some people are just naturally more energetic when waking up, versus people like me where it is more difficult, but we feel the same throughout the rest of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep Apnoea builds up cumulative sleep debt. At the start you may recover easily, but after years it can wear you out to the point of seriously affecting your day time performance.</p>
<p>Has anyone told you that you snore?</p>
<p>I don't think there is such a thing as those that 'naturally' are more energetic waking up. It's about sleep quality and health, and the two are interlinked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't ever been told that I snore a lot, or that it's a problem. So I am not too sure? I was just wondering if there's maybe a genetic disposition, if it is a health factor, if there's something people do wrong when sleeping, maybe sleeping too little - or even too much etc. Maybe a combination of different factors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apnea affects different people differently, and it's not something to take lightly, it can be life-threatening.  </p>
<p>It's an easy thing to diagnose clinically without any needles or x-rays or CAT-scans.  Most of the time, treatment involves no surgery and no drugs.</p>
<p>If you're resorting to Reddit for answers, do yourself a favor and just get tested, or at least talk to a doctor about it.  It's really a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Getting treatment for apnea made a night-and-day difference to me (sorry for the pun).  It was a life-changer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I am trying to say in this thread is I don't think there is anything wrong with me. Many many people find it hard to wake up in the mornings. I just want to know why some naturally do, and some naturally don't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have sleep apnea and I don't wake up during the night but it doesn't matter. I just always seem to need a lot more sleep than most people. Not only that but it doesn't matter how many hours of sleep I get, I'm always tired in the morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd recommend talking to your doctor as well.  For years my wife told me I needed to get my sleep checked out, but she never saw me stop breathing or anything else that would point to an actual medical issue.  I finally gave in, talked to a doctor, did a sleep study, found I had moderate apnea and got a CPAP.  I just chalked all the issues up to bad sleep habits, etc, when I reality there was an actual medical issue.   Sleep has been significantly more restful now since I got it, and I didn't even realize how bad it got.  I compare it to when I finally got glasses after years, and immediately realizing how bad my eyesight was and how I just had gotten used to it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insurance paid some, but it was about 2500-3000 out of pocket, none of which was told to me ahead of time.  I'd still do it again, but it was expensive.  Now when I wake up, I can feel a major difference in my level of being tired, even if I only get 5-6 hours, I feel a lot more rested upon waking, much less groggy overall, more productive in the morning.  </p></div>		</li>
