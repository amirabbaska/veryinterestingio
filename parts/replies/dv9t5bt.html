			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who had an &quot;inny&quot; his whole life, I remember wondering about why I would see so many other kids with an &quot;outy&quot; when we went swimming, but never saw an adult with an &quot;outy&quot;. I still don't think I've ever seen an adult with an &quot;outy&quot; except for some pregnant women. Haven't thought about that in years, but thanks for solving that childhood mystery for me!</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, I never expected that one day my inbox would explode with so many people telling and showing me what their belly button looks like. It's okay everyone, I wasn't implying that one type is better than the other. Just something I was curious about as a kid and never really encountered as an adult, nothing more. Of course, I haven't exactly spent a lot of time studying people's belly buttons. I don't think it's something most people care or even think about after childhood. So yeah, everyone is beautiful and I don't think there's any reason to feel ashamed, whatever your belly button looks like. </p>
<p>I think I have enough descriptions and pictures of belly buttons to last me a lifetime at this point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, it's probably because he too had un umbilical hernia. They can be caused because his ab muscle are so weak that the bowels come through a place that was already weak. He could have also had a laproscopic surgery, where they operate via tools and cameras inserted into small holes in your abdomen. They use the belly button as one of these main &quot;holes&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy crap, you just gave me another flashback. I totally knew a kid who could do that. He could sort of push it in like pressing a button and move his belly to pop it out again. And now I'm laughing at the memory of how fascinated we all were with his little party trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad doesn’t have a belly button because of a hernia when he was a baby. I guess they had to perform surgery so they just sewed it up. Either that, or he’s an alien and just told me the hernia story to help me assimilate with human society. It actually looks normal though, just like he’s constantly wearing his pants super high. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>As an aside, the resulting belly button can be influenced by umbilical hernias (when a baby's abdominal muscles haven't fully developed/fused). This can cause the belly button to push outward when they flex or cry etc. and is usually resolved naturally over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I literally watched this happen with my daughter when she was an infant.  She was crying, and it just popped out like a button.  Still an outie to this day.</p></div>		</li>
