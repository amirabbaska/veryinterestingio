			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Extreme</em> nitpick, but nothing can reach 0 K from either direction. There is no highest temperature, just like there is no lowest temperature; you can always make something hotter and you will never reach 0 K from below, just like you can always make something colder and you will never reach 0 K from above.</p>
<p>To add on to your explanation: this weird behavior makes more sense if you flip the definition of temperature upside down. “Thermodynamic beta” is defined as β = dS/dU. Higher thermodynamic beta means colder, and lower means warmer. Absolute +0 on the temperature scale corresponds to +∞ on the beta scale, and -0 temperature corresponds to -∞. Zero beta would correspond to ±∞ temperature, but zero beta would mean zero change in entropy over time, which is prohibited by the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Temperature is simply the reciprocal of beta. This explains the strange behavior: if you look at the graph of f(x) = 1/x, you can see that f(x) always decreases when x increases, but f(x) is always positive when x &gt; 0 and negative when x &lt; 0. This is only possible because f(0) is not defined. This is exactly how temperature works: an increase in temperature is always hotter, but negative temperatures are hotter than positive. This is only possible because 0 K is undefined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really interested in thermodynamics but I only have some  simplified knowledge of it from some college chemistry classes. I've always been taught the definition of temperature as enthalpy added to a system increases motion of its particles, etc. But it seems there's a consensus in this thread that this is an oversimplification of what temperature really is. If I'm understanding that consensus correctly, how can I start to learn a more &quot;correct&quot; definition of what temperature is so to speak? </p></div>		</li>

<p>And this is incorrect, although it's useful because they're <em>basically</em> the same thing for almost every temperature you'd ever encounter without trying to do chemistry on the Sun. You were taught to think of it this way entirely because it's a pretty useful link between the enthalpy/internal energy (whichever you want to use will work) and the temperature.</p>

<p>A dedicated thermo class would do part of it. I got the accurate definition of temperature from my undergrad thermo classes in engineering, but the consequences of that definition (including the negative absolute temperature range) I didn't get until I started getting introductions to statistical thermodynamics in grad school (which get's into the deep end of thermodynamics that most of us who actually study it still don't entirely intuitively understand).</p></div>		</li>
