			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! A clapperboard creates a transient (short, high energy sound), that shows up on an audio analyser really obviously. This makes it really easy to edit at, as you can visually see the exact point the transient happened and zoom in to cut. A lot of editing software also use a 'tab to transient' function, so you can instantly move to the exact beginning of the transient to start your edit. Also, clapperboards often display SMPTE time code, which is a standard way of reading time in the motion picture / audio world. This makes it even easier to synchronise between audio editing software and video. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually synced dailies the old fashioned way for the film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377107/" target="_blank">Proof</a> when I was right out of college. The old fashioned way meaning a <a href="http://www.abctvgorehill.com.au/assets/photos/text_photos/editing-bench-w.jpg" target="_blank">bench</a>, <a href="http://www.abctvgorehill.com.au/assets/photos/text_photos/synchronizer-splicer-w.jpg" target="_blank">gang sync</a>, and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelraso/3184172182" target="_blank">moviescope</a>.<br />
One track of the gang sync had the film, another track had a clear piece of film with a magnetic audio stripe with an audio head.<br />
You'd watch through the moviescope and mark the frame where the clapper closes, then roll through the audio until you heard the slate crack and mark that as well. Then remove the unnecessary piece of audio track and viola! Synched audio. Then finish the 1000 ft roll. Then do fourteen more and you're all done for the day. </p></div>		</li>

<p>About the Audio, have you ever seen the movie <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/27561-blow-out" target="_blank">Blow Out</a>? John Travolta plays an audio tech guy for movies and the film shows in detail all he does to sync audio to video. You might like it since you'd know what he's actually doing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a just a fun thought, but you've explained incredibly well why a clapperboard is used now in the context of modern digital audio technology.  However, the clapperboard predates this practice by a long, long time.  It's fun precisely because it's such an enduring, if antiquated, bit of equipment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been useful ever since sound and picture have been recorded by separate devices - which means as long as there has been sound in movies.</p>
<p>Also, it has another use completely separate from sound.  Since movie scenes are filmed out of sequence and then edited back together in the correct order later, by holding up a card (or clapperboard) at the beginning of each scene identifying which scene it is, it makes finding the one you need when editing MUCH much much (an incredible number of much's) easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not visually, no. But the timecode can be fed from the audio system to the camera wirelessly. If the camera sorts it then it will simply record the same timecode on the clips. Otherwise it can be recorded on to the footage as an audio signal which many editing systems can extract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern cameras and clap boards actually &quot;jam sync&quot; to a single master timecode device, so they have matching timecode metadata.  Assuming production remembers to jam sync.  Which they never, ever do.  And as much as I like to bag on them for constantly (CONSTANTLY) blowing it on the technical execution of their jobs, the fact of the matter is that production only gets 1 chance to get it right, and if they fuck up it's immortalized forever in their footage, whereas in post we can just go back and fix our mistakes.</p>
<p>Whenever I have to call production to fix a technical mistake they've been chronically making, my mental debate is basically:  Even if they are getting shot while diving out of a crashing airplane, do I want them to stop and fix this?  If the answer is yes, we make the call.  Otherwise, FML, we'll fix it in post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also adding on to this, sometimes those black and white clapperboards have squares of colors on them as well. Standard colors like red, green, blue, and grey. That way the editor can look at the white, black, and grey to make adjustments just in case the white balance or color settings of the camera were a bit off in production. The red, green, and blue are for the same purpose- if they don't look correct then the white balance/color settings need tweaked in post- as well as the added purpose of being used to test color grading(changing colors in post for an aesthetically pleasing effect, usually done at the end when the edits are already made).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite, that's called a gray card. A slate isn't used for color correction - a color chart and gray card are protected so they stay clean and don't get dirty and off color, a slate is handled by many dirty hands and doesn't represent the color properly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a somewhat technical question. One of my pet peeves in movies/TV is when you can tell that audio has clearly been added to a scene in post because the recorded audio sounds nothing like the audio from the scene. We know from basic signals/systems theory that one can produce the output of a linear time-invariant system to any arbitrary input by convolving the system's impulse response with the input signal. So here's my question: a clapperboard gives you the impulse response of the room. Has anyone tried convolving the clapperboard sound with the post-recorded signal to make the audio sound more natural?</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be fair on the sound team, sound recording and design is <em>really</em> difficult and it's an element of the production that people usually aren't even aware of until something goes wrong.  Sound departments do try incredibly hard to create a coherent sound for each scene (involving recording roomtone and ambience for every location they shoot in), but depending on the post schedule there's a limit to what they can do.  Sometimes producers will come in during post and write whole new sections of dialogue that will be delivered during shots of backs of heads etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Our job is to be completely invisible on set. And there are many factors working against us on set - especially on location. A lot of inexperienced producers for example do not consider sound when picking locations - like under airport flight patterns or next to busy highways.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your solution would work, but it's more complicated than needed. For a GOOD production, the sound dept captures some seconds/minutes of the room sound to sit as a 'bed' for any ADR or other post work.</p>
<p>As far as adding reverb to ADR voices, a guestimate is good enough (bedroom, outdoors, empty cavern, concert hall, etc) to make it sound convincing. If it sounds phony to you, it was either a cheap production or the sound editor sucked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  A lot of the auditory cues are just about inaudible but you miss them when they're not there.  The quiet background noise of a room is an important one, and is easy to &quot;fix&quot; when you add dialogue.</p></div>		</li>
