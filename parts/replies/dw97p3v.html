			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a real weakness for early Nintendo. They made every bit count. Some of the details of the math behind packing so much content into the levels of Mario on such a small cartridge are mind blowing. Getting all those themes and sounds out of 8 and 16 bit midi files? Those songs are so rich and catchy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light guns have been a thing since the 1930's. And Nintendo was hardly the first video game creator to use it. The first gaming console, the Magnavox Odyssey, already had it in 1972. That's 12 years before Nintendo's light gun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun fact: the real reason the zapper won’t work with LCDs isn’t because of lag. Newer TVs are fast enough the white squares show up while the NES is looking for them. It doesn’t work because they aren’t bright enough. The scanning beam of a CRT is incredibly bright, you can see this in extreme slow-mo videos of a CRT TV. Phosphors have a decay once they are hit, and that is why the entire screen appears to be lit due to persistence of vision. The zapper senses the bright flash as the beam sweeps past, and LCD has no such thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, also how light pens worked on old computers. You press the pen directly against the screen and it only sends a pulse the exact instant the bright light from the beam hits it. The video hardware in the computer also knows where the scan is and latches the counters into the light pen registers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LCD screens also don't draw in the pattern that crts do and aren't interlaced. The tech is different enough in the way the image gets drawn to the screen that the gun can't get a read on where it is aimed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That shouldn't matter for Duck Hunt, however, since the console generates the signal for scanning the ducks (flashes a white block on each duck).</p>
<p>Some other games work such that whenever you pull the trigger, the whole screen flashes white and then you can know the pixel the light gun is pointed at. That requires knowing the raster pattern. It doesn't seem like Duck Hunt works like that.</p></div>		</li>
