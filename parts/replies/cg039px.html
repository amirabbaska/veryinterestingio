			<div class="markdown"><p>And judging by this thread, people who hold degrees in math or math-related fields can't figure it out. I studied physics and am completely stumped. I can't imagine how a first grader, even with a lecture, could solve that homework.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More importantly, forget whether or not they can solve it, I'm worried that our first graders <em>are being taught this way</em>. Using numbers as variables? If you're going to teach them about variables, you should at least do it properly and introduce <em>actual variables</em>. </p>
<p>As a physics student who is passionate about early childhood education, this really, really irks me. </p></div>		</li>
