			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why I get destroyed by the sun within a hour of being at the beach, I have a lot of pheomelanin?</p>
<p>Is it weird that even after I leave the beach and am out of direct sunlight that my sunburn will constantly get worse for up to and hour?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The UV causes a burn in two ways - direct DNA damage in the nucleus of skin cells, and by hitting pheomelanin.  The pheomelanin + UV results in oxidative stress. Both types of damage result in release of signals that promote inflammation. The entire process takes time, so there is a lag between the UV exposure and the inflamed skin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to Hawaii decades ago with my parents.  Stood in the water to my shoulders.  The part out of the water, from shoulder to shoulder?  Yep.  Burned.  Blistered.  Went to the ER.  They said, “Severe second degree burn.  Worst sunburn we’ve seen in...a damn long time.”</p>
<p>No pain or blood, though.  When the blisters (HUGE) burst and the skin peeled, I was down to “cottage cheese skin.”  It all healed.  Tons of freckles.  The area is not more sensitive than any other.</p>
<p>Saw a dermatologist a few years ago.  She said “no problem but stay out of the sun,” and that I had the skin of a 6 yo.  I bought Coolibar for other vacations to Hawaii.  No sunscreen required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine continues on for many hours. I usually can't tell how bad I've actually burned until I wake up the next morning. I always assumed that the damage was done quickly but my skin couldn't process it as fast as the sun could damage it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pain and redness come from inflammation processes (accumulation of blood stuff in the damaged zone that helps to repair body stuff). Those take some time to get to the zone and build up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go to the store and smudge some of the foundation sample colours on yourself. Some are pinkish and others are yellow. It's a subtle difference when you're just looking at someone (usually), but when you see the colours on your own skin the difference becomes pretty apparent. </p>
<p>People with pink undertones (pheomelanin) will burn much more easily/severely, people with yellow undertones (eumenlanin) generally won't.</p>
<p>So, two people can be equally <em>pale</em> but have different skin tones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife and I are exceptions to that.</p>
<p>I am a blond and she a redhead.  My skin is definitely yellow, her's definitely red. </p>
<p>I will burn in Ohio Winter afternoon sun in my car on a ten minute drive. She can sit on the beach in full Florida Summer sun for hours and barely get pink. </p>
<p>I say it's because redheads were born in fire... :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why i rarely burn? I wear warm colored foundations because they look better on me - cools and neutrals wash me out. I'm extremely pale but can stay in the sun for hours. If I do burn it's either the bridge of my nose or tops of my ears, and it fades very quickly (within the hour) to a tan. I have dark hair, which usually means people have more melanin but the pale skin would suggest otherwise, so I've always wondered why my skin barely reacts to the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>melanin is released by melanocytes in your skin. They release melanin as a response to sunlight. Everyone has roughly the same amount of melanocytes, whether it be a dark african or a pale Irish woman. Genetics determine the type and amount of melanin released into you skin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pigment itself will alter the color of your skin (red/brown). The answer to the OP's question is that people's skin produces more red or brown pigment <em>in response to UV.</em> (When you tan, your skin ups the amount of pigment it makes because all that extra sunlight tells it to.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't be the first medication to alter the production of chemicals in humans.</p>
<p>I think the better argument as to why it's not done is a combination of &quot;Yes it's helpful, but not helpful enough to spend money looking for a drug&quot; and &quot;We haven't found anything accidentally that already does that&quot;.</p>
<p>Much of our medication is minor variations on something we found existing already. We don't understand binding spots/chemistry/physics quite enough to be designing drugs from scratch yet as far as I'm aware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong there are actually two types of drugs that can act on melanin.</p>
<p>1) Any drug that increases ACTH can lead to increased melanin production. </p>
<p>(Theoretically a drug could be made to agonize the MC1R receptor on melanocytes and do this directly. Some known MC1R ligands: alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone (β-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone are endogenous agonists of MC1R.[16]:1175 Agouti signaling protein (ASIP) appears to be the only endogenous antagonist of MC1R. Synthetic MC1R agonists have been designed; examples include the peptides afamelanotide and melanotan II)</p>
<p>2) Skin bleachers such at Hydroquinone with exfoliant like alpha hydroxy acid exfoliants can be used to reduce skin darkness and very very safe (sold over the counter in the US).</p></div>		</li>
