			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, this information is accurate and not listed in a &quot;duration of sustainability&quot;, and actually that's not a good way to look at it anyway--these systems can drastically change individual to individual..mitochondrial density in marathon runners..enzyme kinetics of baseball players..on and on.  They are listed in the order of intensity felt, as that relates more to ELI5 the concept of a second wind.</p>
