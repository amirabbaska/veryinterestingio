			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that because it is only legal at the state level. Pharmacies most likely follow regulations set by the federal government (FDA) and thus can't supply marijuana. Also, part of the state laws here in Colorado specifies that marijuana can only be sold at specific marijuana dispensaries and those locations must go through approval to open. It is almost treated more like a liquor store than a medicine store, if that makes sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In California medicinal pot was legal to buy at dispensaries only. But you needed 'Rx'. Handily supplied by going to 'Dr', tell him your ailments,   pay you $100-200 and get a 'Rx'. Sometimes 'Dr' was even in same building.</p>
<p>Now it's legal recreationally in CA. But still have to go to pot shops. Methinkums thought process keep separate from regular stores to minimize exposure and impulse buying. Yet collect that sweet tax money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is legal in Aus (at least in my state) for medicinal prescribing, but you won't find it in a pharmacy as the TGA has a rigorous approval process that basically means a pharmacy can only stock cannabis products for a patient that has a prescription, so kinda like a custom order rather than just having it out the back for anyone who walks in.</p>
<p>No idea about the US but it might be similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering, in some countries you can get prescription medicine without prescription at the discretion of the pharmacist, albeit more expensive because insurance doesn't pay in that case. What's it like in the US? Any leeway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Aus, Ventolin is available over the counter (a pharmacist sells it to you, it's not at the Supermarket) however, to encourage asthmatics to go to their GP and have their condition managed properly, ventolin costs less with a prescription, even less with a concession. This is a sensibe decision. However their previous decision to force all asthmatics to go to the gp for a script and not having Ventolin available without a prescription at all was absolute stupidity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that even include simple things like Tums (if you don't have that it's a chalky tablet with calcium for upset stomach). I believe we still regulate that the same as the other OTC medicine. We can get most basic medications at gas stations if you don't mind paying a huge premium for one or two doses. We can get OTC and prescription medications online too. </p>
<p>I guess with the way much of Europe is laid out it's probably easy to get to a pharmacy. Here we have a lot of small towns where you might only have a gas station to get your food, medicine, basic supplies, etc. Also a lot places where there might just be a gas station without any towns nearby at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same in the UK, stuff on shelves, stuff behind the counter, and stuff in the back you need a prescription for.</p>
<p>Also here if the pharmacist isn't on duty -on lunch say- you can't buy behind the counter stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh lord. The daily half hour of moaning we get when the pharmacist takes his break and we can't sell co-codamol! </p>
<p>The shelves behind the counter are legally part of the pharmacy rather than the shop so that bit closes when the pharmacy does. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I found out the difference when I was looking for some decongestant that actually works. The shelf stuff is the standard Phenylephrine that even tests show is a placebo, but you can't get the proper Pseudoephedrine unless it's Over The Counter. I think it's because you can make meth or something with it, but are there really that many people crushing up Sudofed to make meth in the UK?</p>
<p>It's a choice of 'You can buy a placebo right now, or wait for the counter to open and then buy something that is proven to work'.</p>
<p>It taught me that if I'm in need of medication for something but don't want to go to my GP, then don't just get something from the shelf in Boots - go over to the counter and ask for something proper.</p></div>		</li>
