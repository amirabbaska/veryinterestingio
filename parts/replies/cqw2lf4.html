			<p>That's interesting, thanks for the links!<br><br>This certainly isn't a new idea, but it seems with their mass production and successfull advertisement they will be a lot cheaper. At least that's what I gathered from searching for similar energies (5-10 kWh). Tesla seems to be about 5 times cheaper. I'm no expert at batteries, so many different factors would probably need to be considered to compare these systems.</p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't seem to indicate prices from what I could make out/Google translate.<br><br>But just going from the company that tried to undercut Tesla before the presentation: people thought the Powerwall would be 10 kWh for 13.5 k$ and that company tried to undercut them at 10 kWh for 10 k$. It turns out the Powerwall is 10 kWh for 3.5 k$. From this limited data, it seems that the Powerwall is <strong>much</strong> cheaper than what is currently available.</p>		</li>

			<p>This a thousand times. Elon didn't innovate on this at all. The media is treating this as they treat every Apple product. This stuff have been done before. </p>		</li>
