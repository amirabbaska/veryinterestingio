			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens when a few drops of liquid dish soap are added to the water?  Surface tension reduction, water doesn't travel as far up the napkin because of reduced Delta?  Bounty paper towels greater capillary action, so higher water maximum?  Negligible difference max height of napkin and Bounty?  Material with the greatest theoretical maximum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense, most people know about surface tension, but I had never thought to connect the meanings of surface tension and the tension forces experienced by a mass on a rope. It would make sense, then, that the surface tension being broken would need work to be done, which would aallow the water to travel. Interesting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be careful with thinking about it from a surface <em>tension</em> point of view as strictly speaking that doesn't allow you to consideration the solid surface. Maybe I'm confused by it but I think you're muddling yourself with that analogy. Breaking of the water's surface is working against us just as gravity is. Among other ways of physically explaining the phenomenon, it's the reduction of the total surface energy for the system that gives us capillary action, i.e. the solid-water interface has a considerably smaller surface energy than that of the solid-gas. This is why liquids nearly always wet solids. Energetically speaking, solids have inherently unfavourable surfaces.</p></div>		</li>
