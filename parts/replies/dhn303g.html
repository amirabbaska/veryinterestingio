<p>Perhaps I phrased something poorly. Social democracy is capitalism because it allows private ownership of production, but it is socialism because it taxes the rich and redistributes the wealth in order to maintain equality. It's a mixed bag, so it seems like both and also like neither depending on the particular policies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you think of as Socialism is commonly known as welfare.</p>
<p>Yet people on here and in many places want to redefine Socialism from what has become a classical definition (check any dictionary and the definition will include the means of production controlled by the government or collectively by the people).  Essentially some social democracies were an effort to slowly change a Capitalist economy to Socialism instead of the typical bloody means seen in the East and Central America.  This led to a capitalist system that continually promoted welfare programs yet never got far enough to actually take away private property (turns out people don't like to give up their stuff peacefully).  So these efforts in Europe were deemed Socialist even though they never fully seized the means of production for the people.  So overall the whole definition of Socialism continues to evolve.  Ironically in the US politicians used to deride Europe for being Socialists which was a misnomer but now many people accept it as being accurate.  I see the fight here all the time and really the problem is people define Socialism differently.  </p></div>		</li>
