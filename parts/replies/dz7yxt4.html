<p>The chance of developing brain cancer from X-rays is always low, but the chance of developing abdominal cancers from X-rays is much higher.</p>
<p>I'm glad I have the lead vest when I get dental X-rays, because I get them regularly. And I needed a chest X-ray last year. Well, I've basically only had that one chest X-ray. Whereas if there was no lead vest during my dental X-rays, it would be as if I was getting a chest X-ray on an almost yearly basis!</p></div>		</li>

<p>If lead vests do anything for dental x-rays, it's an <em>increase</em> in dose. </p>
<p>The beam is already collimated to just hit your jaw region. But some radiation will scatter though from your jaw into your body. Some of that radiation will scatter again. If you're wearing a lead vest then it has a chance to hit the vest from within and scatter back into your body, whereas if you wore nothing it would just exit your body.</p>
<p>All in all, this extra dose is tiny and is absolutely nothing to worry about.</p></div>		</li>
