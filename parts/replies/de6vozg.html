			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK that was the only scene that was filmed out of the natural environment. They got in a lot of shit for it.  As I recall, there would be no way to get cameras into a den without spooking the mother and risking her killing the cubs, hence filming that scene in a zoo where the cameras were already in place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The plant growth time-lapse is also faked. They used some real plants, but much of it is cgi and blue screen to pull the shot together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember of Polar bear-gate it felt to me that the real reason people were so up in arms about the incident was it was the first time the British public found out that documentary does not equal real life. In most people's minds they take documentary as fact and were shocked that they were being lied to, but as it died down they began to realise how little it actually mattered. I'm under the impression that there's a huge amount of Foley artistry in those BBC wildlife docs, at least I've not seen much in the way of audio recording kit in those mini making ofs at the end of each episode.</p>
<p>In addition, Documentary theory is fascinating if you want to read about it. An on going debate of how much you're allowed to lie before a film passes from non-fiction to fiction (in layman's terms). Some of my favourite historical examples:</p>
<p>Nanook of the North, Robert Flaherty, 1914: A film portraying the wild ways of Nanook and his family spearfishing in the Canadian North. In fact they actually hunted with guns. In one scene Nanook was directed to bite a record (grammaphone) to help with his portrayal as a wild native.</p>
<p>The Night Mail (?), John Grierson, 1930-9: British film showing the process of sorting and delivering post/mail on a London to Edinburgh train. Included is an overhead of the train charging through the countryside. Actually a model train set, drones/helicopters were obviously not available...</p>
<p>Workers leaving a Factory, Lumiere Bros, 1895: This may be an urban myth, but if not it's my favourite. This is the first ever film, and it is simply 10 seconds or so of workers leaving the Lumiere factory, documentary truth if you ever saw it. Only, it's the second take. We've been lied to since the beginning!</p>
<p>If someone fancies fact checking for me that would be great. My source is one class I took 6 years ago, and I don't have a great memory. I'm also lay in a German hospital hopped up on painkillers...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, take the biggest guy and put him in a polar bear suit, he's going to play the mother. Cut a hole in the suit for the vagina. </p>
<p>Get the smallest member of staff and put them in another polar bear suit. </p>
<p>Get them to climb out the hole slowly and awkwardly like ace ventura in the birthing scene in &quot;when nature calls&quot;. Add some music, some realistic sounds made on a keyboard or off youtube, cut to some real stock footage of polar bears faces as 'reaction' bits and you got yourself a polar bear giving birth.</p></div>		</li>
