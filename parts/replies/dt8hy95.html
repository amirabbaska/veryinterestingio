			<div class="markdown"><p>But just because someone has wide hips doesn't mean their pelvic opening itself is necessarily going to be wide enough to birth a large baby. I'd be interested in seeing what the best ratio is for that. From what I've read the average pelvic opening is something like 5.5 inches in diameter which seems pretty narrow to me but then you also have to figure that the pubic symphysis does allow the pelvic bones to separate during birth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The relationship between hip width and birth canal size could be positively correlated, negatively correlated, or uncorrelated. Regardless, why speculate?</p>
<p>It would be more interesting to find some study on the actual relationship.</p></div>		</li>
