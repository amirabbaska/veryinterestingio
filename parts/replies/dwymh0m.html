			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it seems about right. My idea was,that our legs weren't quite designed for fast running. Since we're connected to apes,maybe our legs are more designed to climb trees?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You wouldn't want legs half the length of your body if your goal was to climb trees.   That's not how apes roll, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only are humans the prototypical &quot;zombie horde&quot;, but we don't even need to actually get our hands on our victim. We not only walk things to their deaths, our spatial awareness and muscle/skeletal structure have evolved to throw with high force and extreme accuracy.</p>
<p>That way, not only do things exhaust themselves sprinting while we relentlessly keep on marching at them, but where other animals get to that distance you always see on animal planet where the predator and prey both start dashing, we don't even need to get our hands on our victim; a pointy dense thing sent downrange will either put a hole in it before it knows what's up, or send it running for its life to tire out a little more.</p></div>		</li>
