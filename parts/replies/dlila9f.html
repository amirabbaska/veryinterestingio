In turn, you're adding a supplement that will hopefully counteract that effect to a small degree. However, many of them are also killed by the antibiotics. </p>
<p>Because of this, I'd actually say it's more important to take probiotics after treatment. Taking them during may help in the short run, but if you take them after, you're repopulating your system with bacteria that could very well help your stomach. </p>
<p>Try a bottle of kombucha or a probiotic supplement and see if it helps. By the way, kombucha tastes a little weird so I go with the sour ones (I've found they're more effective, and I actually used to have stomach trouble after sour drinks). </p></div>		</li>

<p>It very well could be. You might want to see a gastroenterologist.
You might want to read Dr. Blaster's Missing Microbes.</p>
<p>Here is one of his lectures and an extra something showing just how dangerous these drugs can be:</p>

<p>Recent research suggests that IBS has a multifactorial etiology that includes alterations in gut motility, small-bowel bacterial overgrowth, microscopic inflammation, and visceral hypersensitivity. Some of these postulated components of IBS pathophysiology may potentially lend themselves to probiotic therapeutic benefits.
