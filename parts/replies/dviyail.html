			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you follow up on your claim that long chain hydrocarbons are colored? You can purchase many of these(i.e. docecane, undecane) from a chemical supplier and they are colourless. Even ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene is a colorless long chain hydrocarbon. Branched hydrocarbons are also colourless. Since such compounds are primarily composed of sp3 C-C and C-H bonds, how can they absorb light to cause the color observed in the gas giant's atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. All the <em>alkanes</em> are odourless and colourless, and I was wrong to use them as an example. </p>
<p>However, the fact doesn't change that both photochemical smog and the reddish-brown bands of Jupiter <em>are</em> due to photochemical reactions of <em>hydrocarbons</em>, and my use of that word was intentional, because the resultant chemicals formed need not necessarily be alkanes. It is likely that they probably <em>aren't</em> alkanes at all. Jupiter itself is a very energetic planet, and <a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/1010/graphics/jupiter_spect.gif" target="_blank">emits plenty of infrared radiationâ€”more than it receives from the Sun</a>, at least. Given such particularly energetic conditions compared to even Earth (and its much higher insolation), it is indubitable that the atmosphere of Jupiter is, to put it simply, one hot mess. </p>
<p>The chemistry of Jupiter's bands and belts is quite complex and not yet fully understood. It <em>is</em> clear, however, that the trace hydrocarbons, sulfurous and nitrogenous compounds in its atmosphere strongly contribute to the darker colours of the bands of Jupiter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok thank you for the clarification. The radicals species produced in the atmosphere from hydrocarbon reactions must be a cause. But would all of that photo chemistry cause so much light? Or is it more of a scattering process of atmospheric gaseous particles? For example when we look at earth from space, we mostly see scattered light from the surface. We see clouds as scattered light as well. Wouldn't Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus follow something similar but differ in color based on the particles composition?</p></div>		</li>
