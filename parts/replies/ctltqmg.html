			<div class="markdown"><p>In 19th century rural US it was not uncommon for a daughter to be named for her mother.  Though often the middle name would change, sometimes it did not.  In regular conversation the daughter would go by a diminutive (Betty, Lilly, Maggie) or by her middle name.  In formal cases (like court) they would be (and still are) &quot;the older&quot; and &quot;the younger.&quot;  This mimics the French &quot;la vieille&quot;* and &quot;la jeune.&quot;</p>
<p>In Mexico this still occurs sometimes with each going by the same name except in cases where differentiation is necessary (e.g. &quot;Maria madre&quot; and &quot;Maria hija&quot;).  </p>

Just last week, I got one for a woman who was a Jr. She was named after her mother, and even had the Jr. at the end of her name. Her mother was listed as (Name) Sr.  It was the first time I've ever seen anything like it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was working on my family tree, I saw this in previous generations, back in the Acadiens around the 1600s. One of my ancestors had around a dozen children, and 3 of the daughters were Marie &quot;Senior,&quot; Marie, and Marie &quot;Junior.&quot; Not exactly the same thing, but that was the first time I have ever seen those terms used with females....</p>
<p>Granted, this was the English translation :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to my dad his mother and all of her sisters were named Marie, and all of their brothers were named Joseph. They all had second names they went by, however. They were French Canadian and Catholic, and I guess among the French-heritage Catholics Marie and Joseph were such popular names that having multiple family members with those names was not uncommon (although I think my great grandparents took it to an extreme...).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regents have numbers to distinguish them from previous regents with the same name. For example, Queen Elizabeth II of England is from a different family line entirely and was born over 300 years after Elizabeth I died.</p>
<p>It is also relatively common for them to change their names when they are crowned. My favorite example of this is Pope John Paul II whose Polish birth name was Karol Józef Wojtyła, a pretty big change, huh?</p>
<p>Edit: Shouldn't've picked the Pope. I get it, just about every Pope changes their name and it happens way more often than with anyone else, it was just an extreme example of a leader changing their name that came to mind right away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Female sovereigns don't number themselves after parentage or lineage, though, but by regnal name. It just happens to be that Queen Elizabeth II's mother's name was also Elizabeth. She's not II because of her mother, though; she's II because of the previous sovereign Queen Elizabeth in the 1500s.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, in many countries the children carry the mother's family name as a middle name.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another note:  My paternal grandfather's middle name is his father's name, my father's middle name is his uncle's first name, and my middle name is my father's middle name.  Not sure how far back that goes, and I'm not sure of any female naming traditions besides &quot;traditional Christian&quot; names on my mom's side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's become a bit of an unofficial tradition over the past two generations for the women on my mother's side of the family to name one of their sons (myself included) after their maiden name. It's a form of carrying on the name but it was never planned. I was the first one and since then I have 4 cousins who've all been given the same name for the same reason. It will probably just be a brief quirk in our family tree but its interesting to be a part of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty cool! I suppose that mother's maiden name sounds like a first name, like Grant or Harris, if that makes sense? </p>
<p>I'd like to do that. My wife's maiden name sounds nothing like a first name, but I guess that's what nicknames are for aren't they? To be called a name other than one's given name.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The handy thing with middle names, though, is that they're only ours. You're not really going to be using them every day and whatnot, it's like your own special secret, you know? So it's a good place to honor people like that.</p>
<p>*Edit: I'm also for men taking their wives names, if they feel hers is more important than his (for example, my last name was very important to me, and my wife understood why, while her last name was an Ellis Isle name, so our family uses mine for this reason). You can hyphenate the whole family, but I'm not sure how that works legally, and then like what happens when your daughter marries? Do you hyphenate a third name into it? That seems like the kind of thing that will get away from you pretty fast...</p></div>		</li>
