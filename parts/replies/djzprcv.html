			<div class="markdown"><p>Its actually mostly and purely for marketing and monetary reasons. Facebook already has tons of info compiled and by having you link up your game or app with your facebook account allows the game or app to immedietly tailor ads to you without having to build a database themselves. This allows them to succesfully sell you things or services.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, and if they want to avoid people making a ton of fake accounts, having facebook handle that is easy, otherwise you have to do <strong>at least</strong> email validation, which is a couple more steps, steps people are less likely to take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very charitable summary. I'm a synic, Facebook wants to know exactly everything about you so they can sell you to the highest paying advertiser. How long you game, what you play and who you play with are part of your enormously private and valuable dataset.</p></div>		</li>
