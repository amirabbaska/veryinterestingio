<p>Let's say your high-school buddy, Johnny, knows something about your business. Johnny gets himself charged for a completely unrelated crime.  </p>
<p>Johnny could rat you out. You don't know if he <strong>will</strong>, just that he <strong>could</strong>, and if he <strong>does</strong> you could end up in prison for a long, long time. So what's the best way to mitigate that risk? RIP Johnny. Nothing personal.  </p></div>		</li>

<li>This creates an illusion that there is no positive to this. The trade-off for creating a black market is keeping a good portion of the population from creating life-long addictions that ruin lives. Yes you should protect those who will obey the laws. </li>
<li>Marking it harder to get off drugs can be fixed without removing prohibition. </li>
<li>An extraordinary amount of human capital will also be lost to drug addictions and long-term consequences of drugs. Not to mention treating the health consequences, which could cost inordinate amounts of money</li>
<li>Do you reduce the risk of death for those breaking the law by trading it for increasing risk of the law-abiding citizens who will become addicts through experimentation of now-legal drugs? I say definitely no, and I lost my brother to drug addiction. </li>
</ul>
<p>Really the whole stop prohibition argument boils down to helping those who are already addicts by making it safer and not funding organizations with the money. We can fix the first one without making it legal and the second one is not worth the trade-off increased use ---&gt; increased number of addicts unable to control their addiction.</p>
<p>Of course the real issue is the phrase. We need a strategic change, but to jump to legalizing opioids is silly. People somehow think the opium dens of the past wouldn't come back - and the loss of human capital with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really sorry about your brother. I can't imagine. </p>
<p>OP asked why the war on drugs is considered a failure - these deaths are exactly why I'd consider it to be one. You're right that the mere fact that it's illegal will keep a lot of people from trying it in the first place; but that can also be accomplished by using the money that's currently used for enforcement ($30-50k/yr per person in prison), and using it on education/rehab instead. </p>
<p>As to your fourth point, it's really arbitrary whether they're breaking the law or law-abiding - they're doing the exact same action; the only difference is whether the government says it's illegal or not. People are going to experiment whether it's legal or not - and I know, thanks to my education on the effects of these drugs (referring specifically to opiates), that I'd never touch them, even if they were legal, even though I'm a law-abiding citizen (as would most people). </p>
<p>I'm not saying legalization would be a panacea, or that people would stop dying - it will unfortunately happen no matter what you try to do. Also not saying &quot;legalization&quot; should be to the extent of alcohol, having it on every corner - maybe &quot;decriminalization&quot; is a more accurate word. If we've got limited resources, I think we should be using them on treatment and education/prevention, as opposed to stricter punishments (the war on drugs). We have some of the strictest drug laws in the world in the US; and also some of the highest rates of drug use/addiction/death. We need to make sure we're allocating our resources intelligently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To start:Thank you for your condolences. Thankfully, my other brother is sober after about 15 years of an extremely heavy methadone and xanax addiction (think 200 mg methadone and 10 mg xanax) - thank Jesus! He's about 2 years free. That being said:</p>
<p>What I mean with my 4th comment is that I think it's unwise to trade a risk of addiction to regular law-abiding citizens(through legalizing opioids, for instance), for a decreased risk of death for those who are not contributing to society and have already knowingly defied law. Decriminalization not included. Just free and open legalization is a silly knee-jerk left response to the right &quot;war on drugs&quot;.
Just to point out, you initially said that being illegal causes reduced use and then proceed to say &quot;people are going to experiment whether it's illegal or not&quot;. I don't know if I'm missing some portion of your thought process, but it is be certain that many, many less-than-genius individuals would end up hooked on drugs if they were made legal. </p>
<p>Anyway, I'm saying that legalization is NOT the answer. Decriminalization is one thing, but legalization is HUGELY different.
tl;dr: weed obviously needs to be legal, we obviously need to reallocate a HUGE amount of funds to re-integrate these people and help them rather than jail them, but true legalization is a pipedream that will only end in a serious detriment to the modern world and slow the actual potential changes (such as reallocation of funds or legalization of weed). </p>
<p>Also I've had quite a few drinks so forgive my grammar - lol. </p></div>		</li>
