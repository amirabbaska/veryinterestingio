			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe either the same or similar warheads were designed for artillery guns, big mortars, nuclear depth charges and torpedoes. I believe all of those devices and delivery systems were designed and fielded only briefly in the 1950's and early 1960's, at which point various nuclear test bans and strategic arms limitation treaties were increasingly being signed by the nuclear club powers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The W-54 variants used in the Davy Crockett tactical nuclear recoilless gun (M-388) had a yield of between yield between 10 and 20 tons TNT equivalent.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W54" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W54</a></p>
<p>My understanding of they achieved such a low yield is by using a critical mass capable of a much higher yield, but using various techniques to disrupt the efficiency of the chain reaction.

<p>Davy Crockett OP, pls nerf.</p>

<p>The fact that a nuclear weapon was made that was specifically weakened says something about how insanely energy dense nuclear reactions are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was scrapped mostly due to game theory. Tactical/battlefield nuked such as the W54 have the problem that it's highly unlikely that the usage of these weapons will stay contained to that particular battlefield, and will most likely escalate to a strategic nuclear exchange and MAD. At the same time, in order for such a weapon to be tactically useful, release authority has to be with the field commanders, and realistically your sergeants and leutenants need to be able to fire it.</p>
<p>So, due to these risks, it was withdrawn.</p></div>		</li>
