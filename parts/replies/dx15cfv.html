			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, processed carbohydrates increase inflammation in the body, which has been shown to cause an increase in LDL. This why more recent research has found that while eating saturated fat by itself can be healthy, eating it along with processed carbohydrates is very unhealthy and causes an increase in LDL. A diet low in inflammatory foods is one of the best ways that you can normalize your cholesterol levels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are different forms of the cholesterol in your blood, which depends on its density. Some forms are &quot;good&quot; cholesterol (HDL), and some are &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol (LDL). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite.  These aren't different forms of cholesterol, these are different things that have cholesterol in them.  The cholesterol is the same, but HDLs and LDLs have different sizes and properties.</p></div>		</li>
