			<p>&gt; Other first-world nations are stepping up. Look at the auto industry. The US auto industry was once a world-leader, now FORD stands for &quot;fix or repair daily&quot;. Rich people would rather drive something European than something American any day.<br><br>This doesn't quite cover the problems with the American auto industry..  The whole &quot;fix or repair daily&quot; business isn't exactly a recent development.  I've been hearing that since I started thinking about driving, about 25 years ago.  It's not just the wealthy that want to drive something other than an American brand car - take a look around.  The problem is that 25-30 years ago, the American brands began a great slide downhill in terms of quality.  My first 3 cars were GM cars.  Heck, my father retired from GM, and I could get a screaming hot deal on a GM car if I wanted to.  Yet, I want nothing to do with them.<br><br>Why do I want nothing to do with American brands?  The first car I had was a mid-70s used Oldsmobile, and it ran fine for what it was.  The second?  Chevy Cavalier.  Piece of junk.  Fooled me once, shame on them.  The third? Pontiac Grand Prix, circa 1997.  Horrible junk.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  I haven't owned an &quot;American&quot; car since.  Probably a better term would be a &quot;Mexican car&quot;, since that's where the majority of those cars are made.<br><br>Curiously, the &quot;Japanese&quot; cars I've owned (Honda, Toyota and most recently Subaru) were all made in the USA, by American workers, and those cars were all <em>fantastic</em>.<br><br>&gt; Things used to be &quot;Show up, be consistent, make mostly responsible choices, and you will do well in America.&quot; (You've probably heard something like this from your boomer parents). Now it's &quot;Bust your ass for four years in college, make only responsible choices (When you're young, and doing so is most difficult), and you might do well in America.&quot;<br><br>Those things, quite often, are still the case.  When I see what sort of effort the average worker puts in, that is to say, next to none, simply showing up and putting forth any kind of reasonable effort catapults you forward.  Case in point - I'm in the technical side of sales, and I inherited a territory with a new sales rep back in April.  The guys who had the patch before us were typical &quot;do nothing&quot; types.  They made all sorts of promises to customers, but never delivered anything.  We walked into a territory with <strong><em>zero</em></strong> pipeline, and no pending business.  That first quarter, our numbers sucked.  BUT, we showed up.  We got out and met with customers, and when we promised them something, we delivered it, almost universally within 24 hours.  If I couldn't deliver on my promise in 24 hours, you can bet your ass that I was on the phone or emailing the customer apologizing for the delay and telling them when I'd have it done.  That's showing up and putting in a reasonable effort.  The second quarter we had that territory?  We'd built up and rebuilt relationships in the territory, and built a pipeline.  That second quarter, we crushed our number (which we didn't get a break on for getting a new patch) and led the region in both sales as well as percentage of quota.<br><br>Showing up and putting in effort gets you noticed and good things happen.  Doing the bare minimum only ever gets you noticed in the bad way.</p>		</li>

			<p>I used to think, &quot;I hear about that more than I see it,&quot; and then I got a temp job at a government communications manufacturing operation.<br><br>We had workers who were 40-60 and for whatever reason decided they had all the answers when they were twenty and just lived their life on autopilot ever since, fucking wallets and collecting debt to stay afloat. And <em>so</em> bitter.<br><br>We had one lady who actually sat and read paperback romance novels while she was clocked in. If a supervisor came by, she would hide in the storage closet to do it and get people to &quot;cover&quot; for her. She also made phone calls there. Twice she was asleep on the job, literally drooling on what she was making, while our boss' boss' boss came by. He asked her what her problem was and she said she had a second job working at a senior living facility and she hadn't had a chance to rest between jobs. He shook his head and just moved on.<br><br>Later, in the summer, my group of temps I came in with were busy winning awards. My department of just a few people specifically achieved a 97% discrepancy rate for parts working perfectly the first time they went to be assembled into whatever they were being built for. This is a global company and we were regarded as one of its most efficient departments.<br><br>They shitcanned us all the next month because they said they ran out of money. Meanwhile, Sleepy McReadsALot got her annual raise. People asked about it and they said, we recognize you're good workers, but hiring people is a pain in the arse and we don't want people we invested in to leave, yes, even if they're not as effective.<br><br>Hopefully, that's not a motivational tool in widespread use out there.<br><br>We were the models and we got shit on (although they did lay us off so we could attempt unemployment instead of just being fired-fired). I won't stop having a great work ethic, but less mature people, I could see turning into the already-hired people who give zero fucks, because to an overly simplified child's mindset that's what's being rewarded.</p>		</li>

After hearing their complaints and histories I told them that the job I was doing (for half what they were making in some cases) was the highest paying job I had ever had.<br><br>They told me that they had bought their first home by my age.

I still feel like a losery piece of shit on the outside, but all other things being equal I'd be topping the charts because in the face of all of it, I still mostly subsist just from working so hard, so I'm genuinely proud of that and won't remain self-critical past a point.<br><br>Not to mention how many people got gifts and inheritances growing up for every last thing.<br><br>I'm not saying it's widespread.

			<p>Ha! I used to work at UPS as a seasonal driver helper. The one driver I had said he got a bonus if he came in earlier than the normal eight hours during holidays, so he'd find the nearest gas station to where our last house was and just have me walk (this was younger before I drove). I accidentally went the wrong direction one time because I misunderstood the street signs in the dark and walked eight miles in the opposite direction.

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/[deleted]" target="_blank">[deleted]</a>
			<p>I thought the person was asking for facts, so I don't take a stance. I personally believe that anyone or any group that takes a multifaceted look at how the situation came to be comes across as accurate. Whether it's politifact or just people you talk to in conversation that have lived that long.<br><br>My grandparents bought a house for just over eight grand in the 60s when (I believe) the minimum wage was two dollars or less. They both made more than that, though. Now it's gone up 4-5 dollars but houses in the exact same neighborhood are 150+. That's evidence of nothing, really, but it made me look into it more.<br><br>There are more variables in play than I am honestly able to follow and understand, except to say that I recognize there are tons of variables.<br><br>My response was targeted to that person's sub-issue in and of itself, not because I felt it was part of the broader issue so much. I can point at 10 millennials that are fucking amazing and 10 that are fuckups, and 10 amazing older people and 10 that would even call themselves dregs on society.<br><br>I have met very few people that weren't cognizant of how good they had it, but almost all of them say they just took it because it was there, and it certainly wasn't out of malice. Just, maybe, shortsightedness. They were indulging in their circumstances, just like many of us are victims of ours. I look at generations to come after me and it freaks me out, but I don't think it's any stronger than generations that look at my group.<br><br>I don't want to sound like an apologist for everyone, but I also don't want to jump to conclusions about laziness or ill intent or greed. I think as a country, we're too numerous and this stretched across too wide of a time to say that any kind of homogeneity is at fault. Just a bunch of shitty situations that add up together to a struggle.<br><br>I did everything I was supposed to and it didn't work out. But I didn't fold. I made sacrifices and taught myself a new skill. It's still hard but it's not desperate, and it always has the potential to regain forward traction. I think that's the takeaway for me, it just doesn't make it any easier for some people when you're right smack dab in the time of your life where you don't know quite who you are, just that you know you want everything to be for some sort of good reason and have a clear sense of purpose.<br><br>I was raised to recognize that if something sucks, and is unfair, you do what you can about it but when that doesn't work, you suck it up. The super young people today (I'm only 30, so I'm thinking, basically, half my age and younger) seem to not be able to even hold in their head that bad things happening is an option. They're so averse to it that it doesn't compute, and they use it as an argument why things should or shouldn't be a certain way. Everyone else seems to recognize that it's just a part of life. At least half of it. Maybe more. But hey, maybe when they're just a bit older it'll dawn on them too.<br><br>Sorry for that rambling but I was honestly trying to get at what you were asking.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, really decently. It's a huge effort to try to make a life for myself, but it beats the alternative, and every day I count my blessings that my situation isn't worse.<br><br>My next job was also a staffing job and it was scanning engineering drawings at Patrick Air Force Base of an old cargo plane. When our manager left, they promoted me to her position because they felt I was the most resourceful and had the most tech savvy and, amazingly, everyone was treated like an adult because they had problems to solve instead of fingers to point.<br><br>I had a degree with the first job but because it was irrelevant to the work they treated me like I failed at getting my GED and was a habitual drug user (I've never even experiemented). I think all the &quot;circlejerking&quot; here is amusing. It's real there, with STEM stuff. It was almost hostile, but certainly disparaging.<br><br>You get what you put in. I still had an irrelevant degree, but they took advantage of the skill sets I did have to offer that were of benefit and we absolutely killed the project.<br><br>Getting into programming saved my ass though. I work for myself and can tolerate my boss most days, and having to do most of the other parts of the business like financials and customer service has made me a better worker and a better person.</p>		</li>

			<p>So you're a programmer now?</p>		</li>
					<ul class="replies">
		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/[deleted]" target="_blank">[deleted]</a>
			<p>I'd say so. There are people that say that because the languages I use aren't offline, and are Web-specific and pretty abstract (otherwise known as high-level, or made up of commands that are themselves pre-programmed versus crazy bare-bones closer-to-machine-code kinds of instructions)...think PHP, JavaScript, etc. that I'm not a real programmer. To me it's the difference between a keyboard and a piano. One's a string instrument, the other's an electronic device, but they're set up the same, the pieces you touch all mean and do the same thing, and mastering one means you've got a head start at the other.<br><br>Personally, I don't care. I know I'm limited to what I do, but the barrier to entry is also super low and still very lucrative. With just those two things I can make a lot of amazing, interesting, useful and interactive crap happen for people and businesses and they're willing to pay me a pretty good amount of money each time to do the stuff they won't or can't or is not quite available in the specific way they want it.<br><br>See a need, fill a need. Most of our business is through word of mouth. For all my abilities, I can and have been swapped out for more experienced people on a whim. Customer service is part of my brand now. I educate the customers, make myself super available, am friendly and speak plain English to them, etc. That has a value on its own. When people say client vs. customer, they're not (usually) being pretentious. It's someone you <em>keep</em> working with because you <em>relate</em> well. Not a push-button interaction.</p>		</li>

			<p>I somewhat understand where you're coming from, but there's a massive oversimplification in your statement, and it gets repeated way too often.<br><br>Work didn't go to China because Chinese people are hard workers, nor did it go overseas because American are lazy and demand that jobs allow them to play with their cell phones all day. Those things may or may not be true, but most likely vary with the individual, as do all things.  <br><br>Work went to China because its less expensive to do labor-intensive and environmentally destructive manufacturing work in a country where labor and environmental protection laws don't exist, and because the vast majority of corporate leaders in the United States care more about their bottom lines than they do about the well-being of their employees. <br><br>Foxconn, one of the largest employers in Mainland China, had to install nets at the factory dormitories because people were literally jumping to their deaths rather than continuing to work at Foxconn. Considering that Foxconn is a multinational company, Taiwanese-owned, and a major supplier to Apple, one can assume that conditions there are not the worst in China, if only due to the endless media coverage of its doings. <br><br>Circumstantial evidence, I know, but on-site suicides suggests that these people are not &quot;diligent workers happy to be earning a living wage,&quot; but rather migrant workers with no legal protections pushed faced with no options other than farming rice in a bleak village in rural Sichuan and pushed well past their breaking points. </p>		</li>

			<p>It's maturity and work ethic I think. Yes, some people you've mentioned do have the qualities of a really terrible employee. However, they make the mistake in bringing their personal lives into work. Work is not the same as life. <br><br>I work at an international firm in their IT Division. We provide internal support for the rest of the company. I'm the youngest one there at 20. The second youngest is 28. The thing is, I do my work and I do it very well. I do it well enough for the CEO to say that he's heard exceptional things and to make it known if I want to specialize in a specific division.<br><br>The simple fact is that if you do your work and do it well without griping about it every damn moment then you'll do well. I think that many workers for you are just out of high school/college and not making a large amount of money. You don't need to be a Chinese guy with a great work ethic. You need to be a human being with efficient work ethic. Hard/great work ethic =/= efficient work ethic.</p>		</li>

Working 40+ hours a week just because it makes you look like a responsible person is a shitty way to live no matter how you twist it, unless you're consistently striving to live a life you're proud of.<br><br>And I got good grades in high school on and off, C's on a report card sometimes, and a D only once or twice throughout all of my schooling. I sometimes did my homework, sometimes didn't. Graduated with scholarships and $30000 in free money to a $50000 dollar school. And I made sure to hang out with friends, go places, make time for myself and goof off because life is too fucking short and long to have a stick up your ass and be an obedient lap dog.</p>		</li>

			<p>So you're taking your small sample size of experience and extrapolating from it that: (a) Chinese people are better workers, hence the switch; and (b) that Americans are sucky workers?<br><br>I have a degree from a highly ranked institution in a &quot;hard&quot; science (Physics). Everyone said it would be easy to get a job upon graduation, but I've found that I'm either overqualified (but usually stated as not possessing the background necessary for the job - I received good grades in high level mathematics and physics classes, I can learn on the job) or I'm not qualified enough (some ares want a Master-level or higher degree).<br><br>I always arrive to jobs on time (on time = early; arriving at the start of work = late for me), and I turn my cell phone off. I'm happy to repeatedly conduct an operation, but I love to learn new skills, work hard, and be innovative.<br><br>Where's my job? I thought I did everything right. Instead, I'm told I did everything wrong. Should've majored in business because fuck me for getting an education in something I thought was interesting (major in physics, minors in education and philosophy). I would LOVE a decent job. I want to raise a family, I want to contribute positively to society. Instead, I'm butt fucked by a mountain of debt after receiving what was supposedly a worthwhile education.</p>		</li>

			<p>I worked a factory job right out of Grad School.<br><br>I made the Chocolate Frogs for the Harry Potter park at Universal Studios.<br><br>They paid us exactly minimum wage.  8 Hours standing in front of a conveyor belt cranking out fist-sized lumps of chocolate.<br>Each frog sold for $14 at the park.  Our company sold them to the park for something like $9 a piece.<br><br>We had had maybe 20 people working there. (I just did some math)<br>It took roughly 30-60 minutes of production at low speed (gross numbers mind you, not actual profit) to pay for every person working the line.<br><br>The turn-over at this place was mindblowing.

I need someone who can show up on time, do a repetitive task on a consistent basis without whining about why they can't play with their cell phone, or bullshit with their friends endlessly throughout the day. The worst are the people who drag their personal lives into the work place, create drama and pull me away from doing my job to deal with their bullshit.<br><br>There are people who would take these jobs.

			<p>The big problem is that if you are an American and show that Chinese man's dedication and work ethic you will be socially ostracized, mocked, and stabbed in the back....all day.... every day of your life...by all the other employees at the plant. Sadly you only fired half of the sorry ones and the ones you missed are the sneakier/more political ones usually, and the worst of the bunch. <br><br>Not that a person should care, or is &quot;allowed&quot; to have feelings at work, but it sucks working in a hostile environment day in day out and doing your best just to be surrounded by folks who hate you, and, to top it off, you'll maybe advance to a rate of pay that will leave you broke on Tuesday instead of Sunday--maybe--if you are willing tolerate that garbage and stagnate in poverty for 5-10 years. Just remember how the smart kids got treated in school when you and me were kids, you miss out on all that by being the boss. They just talk about you behind your back. <br><br><br>Also, the only three guys on the plant who will work, get worked to death and not really treated better by supervision and don't get but maybe 2-3 bucks an hour beyond the sorriest fella there. My answer to this was to say screw all you guys and branch out, everyone else I know who is younger and worth anything has pretty much done the same. A lot of people aren't cut out for that kind of leap and just learn to blend into the background. This creates and enforces a culture of mediocracy and no one at the top will question it because they need bodies on the job one way or another. <br><br>As far as dragging personal problems to work, being poorly paid and treated like dookie by all your coworkers and the supervision too, practically and financially, spills into the home life and it is hard to care about a job that has no real positive impact on your life than keeping you off the streets and is miserable to boot. If people had paid me double for applying myself and producing double, and of better quality, I would still be a happy worker bee today maintaining and building plants just like the one you run...I bet Chinese guy gets a whole 50 cent raise for all his hard work, each and every year. <br><br>Edit: Bad manners, sorry OP you know what I took out, and that was wrong for me to say. I apologise. </p>		</li>

I can easily see an entire sector just adding that money to their profits or simply reinvesting it into research and development, or a slew of other places other than decreased prices.

			<p>In the 1950's, the United States had the huge economic advantage of...not being completely ravaged by war. I mean, much of the rest of the world outside of the Americas was digging out from the ruins of war.<br><br>As a result, it was easy for unskilled American workers to get high paying jobs. Meanwhile, workers in most of the rest of the lived in abject poverty.<br><br>Today, workers in Thailand or the Philippines compete with American workers. This means that unskilled workers in the USA can't demand high paying jobs. More importantly, it means that workers in the developing world have raised their standard of living by orders of magnitude in a single generation.<br><br>So, American workers have a harder time affording luxurious lifestyles, and workers throughout the world have an easier time maintaining basic standards of living.

			<p>&gt; Cheaper labor ultimately drives prices down and makes the costs of things in the stores cheaper. <br><br>I thought your comment was insightful, but I wondered about this one line.  I wondered what percent of the manufacturing savings actually went into lower prices and what percent went into company profits?  For example, if shoes are now made for 35 cents instead of $20, but consumers pay $18 dollars for them then how does that balance out for the consumers and their ever dwindling job/wage options? Those savings don't seem to actually get passed on to consumers?<br><br>It's not like the companies weren't making a profit before, when they WERE paying people decent wages for US made goods which US consumer could then purchase.  It seems more like they have found a way to simply increase their profits more?<br><br>Interestingly, as I write this, I am reminded of all the robot automation stuff that people have been talking about lately.  Even if manufacturing costs are reduced to virtually zero dollars, consumers still won't see prices that reflect such low costs of manufacturing. </p>		</li>

			<p>Keep in mind, the problems of a couple of nations, is the benefit for the rest. <br><br>More people are being lifted out of poverty now than ever before, and the standard of living for people across the world is rising rapidly. Also, globalization and free trade make things as efficient as possible, which contrary to what you might think, leaves more wealth for humans. In this case, wealth can be defined as free time, standard of living and peace of mind. <br><br>Think of the creation of wealth through globalization and efficiency this way. <br><br>In the past, if you wanted to build a house in America, you'd get a 100 men and a shovel for each of them. Now 2-3 people with machines can build a house, because it's just as fast, but a hell of a lot cheaper than paying 100 men with shovels ect. Your initial reaction might be, that the loss of 97-98 jobs is HUGE, and must have really hurt that economy. No.<br>The efficiency (in this case machines, but it can also be a cheap workforce) gave them the opportunity to build more and more houses, cheaper and cheaper. <br><br>It also meant that more people had the opportunity to do other things than building houses. Such as inventing other ways humans can be replaced. So whilst on the surface you might say how bad efficient economies are for people, you have to keep in mind that they actually provide you previously unimaginable wealth.<br><br> If we are talking about purchasing power, we are by far the wealthiest generation ever. For 399 I can buy an iPhone that has cost billions to research and produce, and would never have been available 15-20 years ago. Efficient markets and globalization make that possible. </p>		</li>

			<p>Protectionism and isolationism worked great for Japan, bringing in a Golden Age of arts, culture, and prosperity.  Until the rest of the world, which had moved on while they stagnated, came in and screwed them. Their markets spiraled out of control...but in the end, the 95% of peasants growing rice and fishing led a much better life than they did during the Golden Age...because they were no longer peasants.<br><br>Not competing with the best means that you're no longer in the race, and when you inevitably rejoin the rest of the world, you're Australian marsupials being outcompeted in every way by mammals.<br><br>So globalization is always a net positive on your economy.<br><br>This must be balanced against several things, because the economy is not the only thing to consider.  Because of the threat of war, traditional or economic, and the threat of breakdown of global trade networks, and other risks, it can still be a very good choice to protect local industries.  For example, even if Russia is supplying the cheapest natural gas to your country, there may be certain geopolitical incentives to not source 100% of your natural gas from Russia.  Similarly, even if the United States can grow wheat for half the cost of growing wheat in your country, if you can afford it, you should probably subsidize some local grain production just in case.  Because the fact is, if there was a worldwide food shortage, the US is going to feed itself first. All your citizens owning yachts does you not a lick of good if you're all starving.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>I saw my father get hurt at work,  the employer drag him through the court's for a decade refusing to pay,  and then finally settle on a pittance. He was retired early and is in constant pain that will not stop until he dies. His retirement was stolen from him. He is a shell of the man he once was. Call me a pussy all you want.  Hopefully you won't have to learn the hard way how harmful that sentiment is.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fact is, he said to get a good paying job you need college while back then you just needed s blue collar job. That's false. You can still get a well paying blue collar job. Vo/tech schools are also great.  You can learn for hella cheap and get a white or blue collar job. </p>		</li>

			<p>Sometimes things with incredible benefits also have great costs. Hes saying for all the good globalization does those costs are almost solely laid on the shoulders of the millenials. The solution isn't getting rid of globalization but redristributing the income costs across a greater number of people.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm 24, been in the IBEW union for 3 years now, started at 45k, making 65k now, and 100k in 2.5 years.<br><br>It's not impossible to get these jobs, just have to look and work hard.<br><br>Now, I don't want to sound like a bitch, and I don't want to take the entirety of Reddit in a pissing match, but what I see as our problem (our being the 20-30 year olds) is that we expect the world handed to us, like it owes us, AND moreover, we don't want to work hard at all... 90% of my friends are just lazy.<br><br>I get up at 3:20am every day, get to work an hour early and prepare for the day, work diligently (I don't kill myself, but I keep a steady pace to get the job done on time and RIGHT), work hard, and work smart. When I tell my friends they can get a job starting at 40k, ending at 100k in 5.5 years, they want in, but when I say they have to work hard, they immediately back out. Everyone wants to be a boss, sit at the comfy desk in the AC, take a nice 1.5 hour break, and talk to the got receptionist... Well, good luck I say.<br><br>To any one interested, I am an electrician. They pay for my school, they pay ME to go to school (8hrs of pay if I pass the test biweekly), they pay my benefits FOR me (health, vision, dental, hearing, retirement [both a 401k and a pension], death benefit). And THEN they pay me my wage (Journeymen in my area is ~45/hr) OT is 1.5 times wage @40hrs, DT is 2 times wage @60hrs, paid holidays.</p>		</li>

			<p>before I got a job working in a dealership(lube tech, training to get tech certified) I was looking into getting into a job with one of the labor unions. what you are saying about these jobs is correct, they are great pay with great benefits, but the issue is at least in the metro detroit area, the wait list to get into these programs is at least 2 years backed up. for someone looking for work, that is not really a viable option. maybe in other parts of the country it is easier to get into, but idk. there is a lot more to the problem than laziness, the economy is just not built to work your way up anymore.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; make <em>only</em> responsible choices<br><br>This is more true than people realize. The whole &quot;pick yourself up and dust yourself off&quot; thing doesn't work, when the dust is $30k in student debt that didn't result in a good job.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;ELI5: The millennial <strong>American</strong> generation appears to be so much poorer than those of their parents. ... What exactly happened to cause this?<br><br>Fixed that for OP.  The millennial global manufacturing (<a href="http://ablog.typepad.com/keytrendsinglobalisation/2013/11/china-world-poverty.html" target="_blank">basically Chinese</a>) generation appears to be so much <em>better off</em> than their parents.  <br><br>In one word, like you said, globalization.  &quot;Lower end&quot; jobs are being exported around the world.  More &quot;higher end&quot; (skilled) job-seekers and consumers (rich foreigners) are coming into the US, competing for high-end jobs here and keeping the prices of certain consumption items (like real estate?) from dropping with the rest of American wages.  </p>		</li>
