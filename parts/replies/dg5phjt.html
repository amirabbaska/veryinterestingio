			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any idea what is the file located in Steam\steamapps\common\Age2HD\bin\en? </p>
<p>To me, it looks like the file is strings that are used elsewhere in the code, so that changing it here will change it everywhere else as well, kinda like the strings.xml file in android.</p>
<p>What really caught my eye was line 10, which says:
103       &quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; </p>
<p>Have you ever seen comic sans in AoE2HD?</p></div>		</li>
