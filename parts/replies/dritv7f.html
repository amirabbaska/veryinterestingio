			<div class="markdown"><p>It demonstrates the non-Euclidean nature of the four spacetime dimensions we do have evidence for, but it doesn't demonstrate that those four are embedded in a higher-dimensional space.  In the mathematics of general relativity, the curvature is a property that is intrinsic to the spacetime manifold.  It is intimately related to the non-Euclidean nature, but the relationship is entirely internal, with the curvature being defined by the energy and matter content of the spacetime manifold.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does not. Curvature is an intrinsic property of spacetime and doesn't need a higher dimension to be embedded in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that knots can only exist in exactly three spatial dimensions (can't tie one in fewer, extra dimensions mean all knots are non-knots in higher). Most mathematicians I've talked to about dimensional physics/metaphysics seem to think that's the most likely reason we live in exactly three, macro spatial dimensions.</p>
