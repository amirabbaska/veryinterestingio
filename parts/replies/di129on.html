<p>Then we'd have to think how to make it survive atmospheric entry, strong acceleration and the shock of landing. If it wasn't designed for this and we don't have precise documentation about the details of the design, I'd say forget it. </p>

<p>This is probably a moot point since I don't know anyone with power being OK with bringing an artifact of alien origin to earth. Maybe after studying it for awhile and ensuring that it is safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I just wrote without thinking.</p>
<p>A point that comes to my mind is planetary protection, i.e. making sure it has no microscopic lifeforms that could cause harmful contamination as per article IX of the Outer Space Treaty. COSPAR requires the maximum level of protection for any samples brought back to Earth.</p>
<p>But I guess you're referring to making sure it isn't a weapon, etc. We don't have any precise rules for that so it'd have to be an ad-hoc agreement. Probably bring it to a high geocentric orbit and keep it there until we can study it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, my fear too would be of contamination. Though there is also the issue of unknown risks when dealing with something alien.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just thinking out loud here, if it swooshed by at your proposed top speed, wouldn't we sort of know where it'd be going? Assuming it doesn't accelerate or decelerate on its own.</p>
<p>Do you think we'd create and build the necessary technology needed to catch up to it (let's say to catch up to it in 50 years)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if it's moving in a ballistic trajectory (i.e. governed only by inertia and gravity, no propulsion) then its position and velocity at any given future time are perfectly predictable.</p>
<p>50 years are more than enough to build the required technology, even just 10 years or less could do, provided you discover it, know its trajectory in avance and get someone to put down the money. (Except for the part about grabbing it and decelerating it, which is essentially impossible if you don't know the details of its mechanical design.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't you, and again, I'm just thinking out loud here, essentially build a craft in orbit with a ton of fuel and try that? Do you think there'd be enough political push for that? Just your opinion.</p>
<p>On a related note, would it be possible to somehow eyeball/detect the mass of the device?</p></div>		</li>
