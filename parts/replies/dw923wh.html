			<div class="markdown"><p>What is the difference between your polymer chain and any other solid? I've always thought 'molecule' was a soft term that didn't really have a definition out of context.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule" target="_blank">molecule</a> is any group of atoms held together by &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond" target="_blank">chemical bonds</a>&quot; which are summarized as ionic or covalent bonds. But all solids are held together by some the electrostatic force between the atoms (though normally there is a lattice structure that forms due to potential minima, you don't really need to consider electron sharing to study the structure). </p>
<p>For instance, I don't understand what the difference is between a diamond and a polymer that causes us to say 'the diamond is made up of many molecules' while 'the polymer is a single molecule.' </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's like the difference between a single very long chain, all tangled up, and multiple separate chains all tangled up together in a huge pile. Just looking at it or poking at it you won't really notice any difference and the properties will be mostly identical, but one is a connected whole and the others aren't.</p>
<p>As the Wikipedia link says, it's all about the type of bonds. It's just a convenient definition that isn't of much use in the real world .</p>

<p>A flawless diamond is actually also a single molecule. It's a covalently bonded crystal. But since crystals always have repeating structures and can get huge, they're often specifically excluded from being considered molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in my senior year of chemical engineering for what it's worth, but I don't really have a good answer for you. If I had to guess I'd say it has to do with how polymers have been defined and their characteristic properties. Possibly because of the fact that the lattice structure of polymers are largely dependent on the monomers it's composed of and how they link up? I'm genuinely curious as well, so if you do get a good answer could you shoot me a reply?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can go even bigger than that. It's possible to have a whole yacht where the hull is technically a single molecule. It might also be several enormous molecules all tangled up in each other, resulting in the same overall properties. It's impossible to know for sure without going over every nanometer of the hull with an electron microscope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way. Polymerisation usually starts with a liquid and can end with something like those mattresses, but also like any plastic material you can think of. The starting liquid is made of small molecules, and polymerisation essentially just links them together, so you could see the macroscopic change as a result of structure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, each of these links is the result of a chemical reaction, and we usually don't equate those to structure. Like the difference between oxygen and ozone is you put three identical atoms together rather than just two, but the substances are widely different and you wouldn't put that on &quot;structure&quot;, instead it's what people think of as &quot;chemistry&quot;.</p>
<p>To come back to the mattress, it being one large molecule is not critical to function, but I'm guessing a result of the cross linking that was mentioned. I don't know at all about the mattresses, but crosslinking for polymers means that after that first step where you linked the small molecules in long, one dimensional chains, you make another reaction happen to link said chains to one another in multiple points. This is akin to vulcanisation in tire rubber. Do that enough and everything is linked &gt;one big molecule. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cross-linked polymers are normally more rigid and harder than their linear buddies, but the price is sometimes being less resilient. They had a great time producing canoes and touting cross-linked polymers as the next big thing, until they found out that X-linked polypropylene performs very badly below freezing and the boats were cracking. Oops. Melamine is a good example too. Smooth, hard and rigid, but poor impact performance.</p></div>		</li>
