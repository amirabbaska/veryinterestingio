			<p>Because text based questions are easier for bots to answer. They could probably send the question straight over to Wolfram Alpha or some other engine and then respond correctly.</p>		</li>

			<p>My favourite one is a picture of an apple with &quot;what fruit is this?&quot; - the apple is very easily identifiable even with a small picture.</p>		</li>

			<p>However - images can be created that will create the statistical apple from a convolutional neural network - that look nothing at all like apples or anything a human would identify as apples.  I think machines can still be fooled with images  that have enough characteristics of a thing to be the thing (from the computers perspective).</p>		</li>

			<p>ask google (via ok google) or siri what the 2nd letter of the alphabet is. Now ask them (Google googles?) which are pictures with a body of water. See how computers fare at these tasksâ€¦</p>		</li>

			<p>Computers get better and better at identifying images all the time. I have no doubt that the best AI and computer vision systems out there could do it. But your average scripter trying to crack a form submission won't know how to take advantage of such things.</p>		</li>

			<p>sure, but when you compare that to how 'easy' it is for a computer to answer &quot;what's the second letter of the alphabet&quot;, it should be clear why one is a more common captcha.</p>		</li>

			<p>At some point, the effort in producing a bot capable of answering questions like identify objects in small images (click all the pictures that contain mountains) and understanding natural language (like &quot;is tomorrow a Tuesday?&quot;) becomes expensive both in time and computing resources. Things like Google's reverse image search and Siri are hooked up to large networks of machines with immense previous knowledge. They don't know everything when created, they have to learn new things as time goes on to be better at recognizing patterns. It takes awhile for a bot to be good at recognizing certain patterns. Looking at simple captchas that have a string of numbers and letters morphed and obscured worked in the past but bots are able to identify the characters much faster now so those captchas are useless against the smarter bots.<br><br>There's a balance of how hard a question is for a bot and how hard it is for a human. The old school captchas are getting easier for bots to answer but still remain just as difficult for humans. The innovation is developing captchas that are easy for humans but hard for the bots of today and the near future. ReCaptcha is easy for us, click a check box but a bot must mimic a human in the way that it repeatedly clicks that box, the randomness is key. Plus, when ReCaptcha asks the user to pick some images that contain a common object, that bot now must be able to identify any sort of representation of that object multiple times with a few false positives as possible. Can you describe what a car looks like? Shiny box on wheels with windows. What do wheels and windows look like? The knowledge required to answer these questions is easy for a human, you've probably seen enough cars to be able to recognize one but a bot doesn't know what a car is unless someone teaches it. This takes time and access to a huge collection of images.</p>		</li>

			<p>Because CAPTCHAs are a prevention measure against bots! It's not easy for a bot to do image detection. It's easy for a bot to parse a string of text (or do OCR on an image of text). <br><br>Yes, the second option would be easier for the user, but so would it be for the bots. It's all a matter of trade-offs; balancing the convenience of the user vs. making it difficult for bots.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ha, I just commented about this and then saw your comment...  I think the answer is that Google is using us to improve its ability to recognize what the images uploaded to google's photo service are of.  Perhaps we are unknowingly being shown images uploaded to Google by other people, so that Google can categorize them.</p>		</li>

			<p>if was something like type the second letter of the alphabet the AI would also be boom problem solved.</p>		</li>

			<p>I heard they use those picture identifying ones for google images or something like that</p>		</li>
