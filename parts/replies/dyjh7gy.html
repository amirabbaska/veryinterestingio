			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. So, as you and the other 2 answers stated the discs can correct the errors within them. But what if the little lost part is sensitive? Can't the CD guess the missing information wrong? Let's say I have a scratched music CD. Could the error corrected part of song be different from the original audio?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's a big enough error or at a really poorly placed location the disc will have errors. Each playback device may deal with it differently. Some CD players realize they are skipping and they will automatically seek forward a couple seconds. Additionally the CD contains an index at the beginning that tells the CD player where the tracks start and stop so that it can quickly hop between them. If that index is damaged the player may say the disc is unreadable or it may just seek forward till it finds useful data and start playing from there.</p>
<p>As for reconstructing a missing bit of music on a cd the audio would be interpolated so yes it would sound a little different but your talking about a fractional second of missing data in most cases so you probably won't hear it. Additional the read head on the cd player makes tiny mistakes as well that you won't necessarily notice, ie a flek of dust on the cd or a bump that the lens doesn't account for</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Write down a list of 10 numbers. Now write the total at the bottom.</p>
<p>Now, scratch away one of the numbers so its unreadable. Give the list to your friend. Because he knows the total, he can work out what the missing number was. </p>
<p>DVDs use a system like that, only much MUCH more complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The much more complicated is kinda like a sudoku puzzle. You can have a bunch of missing pieces and it can still figure out the right answer. </p></div>		</li>

<p>For the most basic version, imagine that on each third of the disk is a complete duplicate of the movie.  Then the reader just reads all three copies, and each bit gets to 'vote' on the true value.  It is very unlikely that you'll manage to scratch the disk such that a specific bit gets flipped in two copies.</p>
<p>There are even <em>more</em> robust methods than this for guarding against errors and identifying or correcting them (and also <em>much</em> more efficient).  Source coding is an entire field of information theory applications for telecommunications and computer science.  But at it's core, this is what it's doing. Duplicating the information in a way that a limited number of errors can be corrected for.  Then it's just a question of how much redundancy is necessary to ensure the limited number of errors is greater than the average expected errors from wear and tear.</p></div>		</li>
