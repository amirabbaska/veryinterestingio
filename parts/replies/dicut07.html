			<div class="markdown"><p>The key is that these games have a high level of replayability.</p>
<p>Rhythm games are something you can dedicate every single day to and never get tired of because there's always something harder. Arcade owners want to purchase games that will keep customers coming back, thats why japanese and chinese arcades tend to be filled with things like fighting games, racing games, and rhythm games. Since you know of beatmania, I'm assuming you know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BVTIGY7_Wc" target="_blank">how hard it can get,</a> there's always room for improvement so people end up spending thousands of dollars coming back day after day trying to get to that highest level of play. It's only natural that after spending years playing these games that you'd want to be the best, or at least better than your friends.</p>
<p>And I mean come on, they're really fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the games aren't changing are they, they aren't removing some of the replay-ability when they ship it abroad?</p>
<p>You also say that these are games you can play and never tire of, so why wouldn't that be the case outside of Japan? Non-Japanese people play lots of games for years and years as well - just not these rhythm games.</p>
<p>The question (I think) is: why are these games so popular in Japan and not everywhere else (even though the game itself is the same). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>usually because rhythm games can be shared quite easily. That is, there is no journey with the games, so no one is glued to the game in order to finish it. You can switch out players easily with rhythm games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since top-level comments have to be explanations, I'd like to use this child thread to remind OP that In The Groove was produced by RoXoR, an American company based in Texas. One of the lead developers moved on after Konami shut down ITG and worked on <a href="http://rerave.com/" target="_blank">ReRave</a> and <a href="http://www.kyleaward.com/faq/pump-it-up-pro/" target="_blank">Pump it Up Pro</a>, and is currently developing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DanceDanceRevolution/comments/5mazhy/new_dance_game_from_kyle_ward_stepmaniax/" target="_blank">StepManiaX</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add that arcade culture in the States is going through somewhat of a resurgence. </p>
<p>Lots of 'barcades' are popping up across cities and towns and they're all doing really well. Quarters, casual games, booze. I'm not talking about Dave &amp; Busters - I'm talking about classics like Donkey Kong, Mortal Kombat, NBA Jam, Simpsons, and pinball. Folks that grew up on such games but want a more casual, down to earth setting than the bright flashy lights and loudness of a D&amp;B. Places like <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52e7d286e4b05e17af6ab08c/58c0617b725e2557b963cec8/58c06188bf629a89d65c681d/1489002909696/A4cade-96.jpg?format=1000w" target="_blank">A4Cade</a> here in Boston, or <a href="https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1180975/size/tmg-article_default_mobile.jpg" target="_blank">Ground Kontrol</a> in Portland.</p>
<p>The games act as a talking point between strangers. They're simple, cheap and act as a catalyst for social interaction - something that you can't really do when you're at home with an xbox. The drinking comes first, however, unlike the arcades of our youth.</p>
<p>Of course, having been to Tokyo, it's no comparison to their culture. But it's still great to have our own take here at home. </p>
<p>And of course, I rarely see rhythm games at these things. I don't know why, but it'd be fun to see.</p></div>		</li>
