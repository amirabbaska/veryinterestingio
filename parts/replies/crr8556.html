			<div class="markdown"><p><em>sigh...</em></p>
<p>Here's the thing.  You said a &quot;jackdaw is a crow.&quot;</p>
<p>Is it in the same family?  Yes.  No one's arguing that.  </p>
<p>As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows.  If you want to be &quot;specific&quot; like you said, then you shouldn't either.  They're not the same thing.</p>
<p>If you're saying &quot;crow family&quot; you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  </p>
<p>So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people &quot;call the black ones crows?&quot;  Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.</p>
<p>Also, calling someone a human or an ape?  It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works.  They're both.  A jackdaw is a jackdaw <em>and</em> a member of the crow family.  But that's not what you said.  You said a jackdaw <em>is</em> a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling <em>all</em> members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.  Which you said you don't.</p>
<p>It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>he was caught by administrators performing Vote Manipulation magic (Alternate accounts, upvoting his posts and downvoting his enemies) and well now his unibanned.</p></div>		</li>
