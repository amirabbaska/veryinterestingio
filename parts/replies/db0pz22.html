			<div class="markdown"><p>One lung or one kidney is more than sufficient for life without modern medicine stepping in, at least in certain cases.</p>
<p>It's true that many of the traumatic ways to lose an organ would often be fatal without modern interventions, but there are plenty of other options.</p>
<p>The most common reason to have only one kidney is to be <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/kidney-disease/solitary-kidney/Pages/facts.aspx" target="_blank">born with only one</a>.</p>
<p>The lungs also have a thing where one lung lacks a functional pulmonary artery, it's main source of blood to be oxygenated, so it doesn't really function.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2853047/" target="_blank">Agenesis of an entire lung</a>, on the other hand, is rare but does exist.</p>
<p>Finally, a number of nonfatal things can also destroy one lung and not be fatal.  This includes severe tuberculosis where it destroys the lung, or a blood clot obstructing an entire pulmonary artery that fails to dissolve.  Both would cause symptoms, but not necessarily death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I neglected to discuss these kinds of situations. It has been sufficiently rare in our history for one of a humans binary organs to be damaged or absent without killing them that the benefit of redundancy is not sufficient to have driven their development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that seems reasonable - these survivable events would be rare enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, it's more than sufficient for life, but is it sufficient for a very active life? It's one thing to survive with those if you have help, but it's completely different if you have to hunt animals every day with only one lung and filter all the things in your blood from your caveman diet with only one kidney.</p>
<p>&quot;Living with one lung doesn't usually affect everyday tasks or life expectancy, though a person with one lung wouldn't be able to exercise as strenuously as a healthy person with two lungs, said Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.&quot;</p>
<p>I imagine having to hunt for food pretty much takes the one lung theory out. Also, reproducing (in most species, I assume it was the same in pre-civilisation humanity) means competition with other males as well. That might be more difficult with a handicap.</p>
<p>This is actually a question, I'm curious to find out the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's little fundamental difference between two normal-sized lungs or kidneys and one double-sized lung or kidney.  We could have evolved to have one lung and one kidney and have them adequately sized to our needs; we just didn't evolve that way.  We evolved to have two of each, not because two small organs are necessarily better than one large organ with the capacity of two small organs, but because having two of each is a side-effect of our bilateral symmetry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are typically cardiac limited - in normal individuals and athletes alike, the primary determinant of aerobic exercise capacity is the heart.  We can therefore lose a little lung function and not be impaired much at all.</p>
<p>However, beyond the first bit of lung function, lung capacity and exercise capacity do follow a roughly linear relationship (lung function by FEV1 or FVC vs peak VO2) <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/262810164_fig1_Correlation-between-VO2-peak-and-FEV1-FVC-VECO2-peak-BR-PA-aO2-peak-and-VDVT" target="_blank">ref</a></p>
<p>Practically speaking - at 50% lung function most can walk quickly, but much more often gets difficult. </p>
<p>One other issue though: a healthy young person born with only one lung is likely going to have a lung capacity that measures more than 50%, because the other lung will have grown larger.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying that kidneys, lungs, and gonads didn't evolve from midline structures? Can you explain that? I don't know what it means. Is the evolutionary origin of the bilateral organs somehow fundamentally different from the midline organs like liver, heart, or bladder?</p></div>		</li>
