<p>(j/k, I had it for about 3 weeks, while not painful having a half smile all the time was weird).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience was absolutely horrible.</p>
<p>The hospital put me on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone" target="_blank">Presnisolone</a>  which granted, likely prevented any lasting effects (I fully recovered, some people do not) has nasty side effects. These are the ones I experienced:</p>
<p>Fluid retention
Insomnia
Blurred vision (could hardly read anything)
Mood swings</p>
<p>So basically, I couldn’t eat, drink, sleep, drive, work, or see properly. Talk about a mental roller coaster...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom never fully recovered. Also I think she had some lasting vision issues in the eye that was paralyzed. She also says it's affected her sense of taste, and now everything is much much stronger of a flavor. Since then she's started adding water to her food and drinks.</p>
<p>Tbh I can't remember if she ever got real treatment. May have just kept on eating vitamins and colloidal silver or similar shit. She certainly went to get it diagnosed considering it resembled a stroke in some ways.</p>
<p>Over the years it's slowly improved, but her smile is still pretty messed up. Unfortunate. Despite being as abusive and evil as she was to me, nobody really deserves this. Not even her.</p>
<p>Glad you recovered!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude exact same for me. Summer going into 5th grade when I was already freaking about and put Bells Palsy on top of it. Sucked sooooo much ass. I also wore an eye patch at night to help me sleep and I regularly had to put in eye drops in my paralyzed eye. </p>
<p>What’s interesting is I have lasting effects from it now. Whenever I eat food, my left eye waters every now and then so it looks like I’m crying out my once paralyzed eye. When I eat spicy food it’s like goddamn waterworks but ONLY out of my formerly paralyzed eye. Shits weird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had it also, earlier this year! I only wore the patch at night usually, but I had it in winter and those winds could be a real bitch on my eye. They had this cool patch for the daytime that was transparent so I could be shielded from the wind while still being able to see. It took me about a month to recover and it was not fun at all. But my pictures and videos are kinda funny now, after the fact</p></div>		</li>
