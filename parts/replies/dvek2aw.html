You may want to try other strains, but it's also possible that you just don't enjoy the way you experience marijuana. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea it can be a psychological thing. Some people don't like NOT being in control. It's Ike if you're a passenger in a car and the driver is going faster than your preference and it makes you very uncomfortable. That's too high to enjoy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I hate being in a car when I’m high unless we are sitting still. I can’t stand having someone else driving and I get really over paranoid driving myself. I used to not have any problems with either, too many close calls with the law has my brain stuck in paranoia when I’m high now :/ it really sucks. Now I only smoke if I’m by myself usually </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happened to me in Amsterdam. I am very careful with my things and the first day I had no time for the Hotel so I had my Jacket, my backpack and 300 Euro only 50euro notes. After Smoking good Quality Berlin weed, I thought that it will be like always.. damn it was even crazier! It was like I am zooming in into things and then I drifted into different stories Inside my Head. Everytime I came out I was shoocked and tryharded Not to get in again.. terrible. Then my Cousins started speaking with me and I was like &quot;Dude I am tripping and you Talk with me?! I cant concentrate!!&quot;. Later they Wanted to go and I was like &quot;What!? Really?! Shit I will get robed while beeing high&quot;. We went to McDonald's and I was like &quot;can you Please pay? I am Scared to pay Go much.. I only have 50euro notes&quot; and they laughed and went by.. so I ordered nothing.  </p>
<p>Next day I only took minimal things with me and &quot;allowed&quot; it to fuck up my senses.. and daaamn I was Flying High. I possible meet Snoop and we raped together (Rap/Hiphop). I underestimated it and I hate losing control of my self so I paniced First Time. The next ones I chilled and damn nice experience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went from an every day user to rarely being able to touch the stuff. In my experience and in the experience of those around me, weed (although a mild drug) can cause good and bad trips. I find my mindset has to be in the right state to ever enjoy myself on it. Personally I like being active and then smoking while remaining active. If I'm home alone with my thoughts it amplifies my already overthinking personality and I become paranoid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, everyday user.  Not a Snoop Dog level but it was a alot.  Dont smoke at all anymore.  I kinda felt like I outgrew an old friend.  But god damn do your dreams ramp up when you stop.  If I ever picked it up again it would be something before bed.  Dreaming is annoying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never ever seem to dream, or I guess i just don’t remember them. Long suspected it was due to my daily use. I guess your comment confirmed my theory!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same page. When i quit habitually smoking, id have crazy night sweats cause my dreams were so vivid. The sweats lasted quite a long time actually. Say a month or so and in general i was just running hot so maybe they were unrelated to the dreams but still crazy dreams were had. I smoke occasionally or do edibles or use one of those vape pens with a high CBD content, but ill never be habitual again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people just don't enjoy the high. It could be personal preference, or it could be how their body reacts. Get really good, dispensary bud. If you still don't enjoy it, then that's probably what's happening. </p></div>		</li>
