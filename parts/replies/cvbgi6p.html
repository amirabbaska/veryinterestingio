			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth travels at 108,000kph around the sun, so in one minute the Earth would travel 1,800km in a straight line. Considering that the orbit already varies by 5 million km over the course of the year, 1,800km could be a rounding error on the calculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And as I've said in another comment; 1800km isn't even the distance that it would deviate from its proper orbit. It's the distance it would travel either way in that time. The deviation from the proper orbit would take into account the 1800km as well as whatever angle the sun causes the earth to change its course by in 1 minute. It's going to be a tiny, tiny angle and the deviation is going to be way, way less than 1800km.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some perspective, 1800km is a little over a quarter of the radius of the Earth.  The Earth/Moon center of gravity, the barycenter of our little two-body home is 4671 km from the center of the Earth.  So losing the Sun's gravity for a minute is a little over a third of the wobble we get from slinging the Moon around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would travel about 1000 miles, but it would end up even less than 1000 miles off course. (Because instead of travelling 1000 miles while curving <em>very slightly</em>, it will travel 1000 miles in a straight line). Since the &quot;curve&quot; in 1 minute is more or less negligible, it'd surely be less than 100 miles off course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That 1 minute when the sun is gone should by similar to 1 minute of night. This is not a perfect analogy of course, but the heat stored in all the water on Earth should keep the Earth at roughly the same temperature for the entire minute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well we would travel in that straight line for a total distance of 1800km! Small in comparison to the average radius of orbit of about 149,597,870km. Assuming a perfectly circular orbit and a no other physical effects that would add approximately 10 meters to our radius of orbit around the sun. Which would maybe amount to a few ns more a day. Maybe a millisecond a year? </p>
<p>Of course the math is not nearly so simple when the sun reappears we have momentum that gravitational force will have to overcome before we resume orbit, Orbit is definitely not perfectly circular...</p>
<p>Basically I think you're right.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about collateral effects on the Moon?</p>
<p>If the earth suddenly changed course for a minute (or more strictly, stopped constantly changing course and went straight) would the Moon maintain its strict orbit or veer off course?</p>
<p>Seems like even if it caused a small disturbance in the moons orbit there might be a chance we could lose the moon to space - or maybe into the Pacific Ocean!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The earth-moon system is orbiting the sun itself. It's almost (depends on how technical you get) as if <em>our part of space</em> is orbiting the sun. So it's not as dramatic as one might think. Of course there would be some effect, but in the grand scheme of things the earth and the moon is not much different from one single body. </p>
<p>Though I haven't checked the numbers so please tell me if I'm wrong! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's say the Sun is positioned for maximum tidal pull over the center of the Pacific.  That pull is taken away for one minute and then restored.  It's not a lot of pull, but it's over a huge area and this is not a gradual change.  Tide, or tsunami?</p></div>		</li>
