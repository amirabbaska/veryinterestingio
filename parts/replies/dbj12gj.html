			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the opposite of my relationship with my boss. I naturally miss out the word that from most sentences but he insists I added them back in. While writing my PhD thesis, I added a ridiculous number back in from his direction or having learnt his style. </p>
<p>I think the way I used to write was more direct. But I have internalize the need for the word that at every opportunity I am not sure that I can go back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Citation need; I have always heard that flow was most important. </p>
<p>(The sentence above is a perfect example. You don't need the word <em>that</em> but I think the sentence is a bit weird without it.) </p></div>		</li>
