			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest problem with inbreeding/incest isn't genetic, it's social. Incestuous relationships usually involve some sort of abuse and/or coercion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, these days. Historically (for our species) 2nd cousin was about as UNrelated as it got (small nomadic groups had small nomadic gene pools).</p>
<p>As long as everything is consensual, and you don't have a major genetic problem, I don't really have any issues with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell that to Jewish(the race, not the religion) and Muslims.  Both have considerably higher rates of genetic disorders and the Jewish  even have genetic disorders specific to their race.  This is generations of incest.  I'm not pointing this out to sound like a dick because I feel like I sound like a dick but those are honestly the best examples I have of normalized inbreeding.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I could use tazmanian devils - so inbred that they are all dying out from the exact genetic predisposition to that face cancer.</p>
<p>Edit: I just remembered.  Native Americans are succumbing to incest problems and reservations actually keep genealogy records so that couples can go see if they are closely related before they date.</p></div>		</li>
