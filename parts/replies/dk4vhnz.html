			<div class="markdown"><p>But trying to describe machine language and how the CPU works goes well beyond programming. With programming, you already have a user friendly form and language to tell the computer what to do. OP is basically asking how the CPU ends up reading it, how it knows what &quot;cout&quot; (the code to display an output in C, as I understand). That is some really complex stuff, even trying to find an analogy that a non-college educated person could understand is complicated. </p></div>		</li>
