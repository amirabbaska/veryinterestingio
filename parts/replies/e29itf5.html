			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth is bombarded with a plethora of particles every seconds, and we don't know where all of those come from. Some of them have a lot of energy, far beyond what we can achieve on Earth. They must come from some cosmic particle accelerators, but we don't understand the mechanisms involved yet.  This new measurement allows us to improve our models and give us more predictive power.</p>
<p>New technology is not in sight anytime soon, but it will allow us to make better models of really interesting objects in space - galaxy cores for example - and how they affect our life on Earth</p></div>		</li>

<p>For those who don't know, the LHC can accelerate particles up to a maximum energy of ~13 TeV. The ~290 TeV from this event is insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you theoretically use this particle acceleration mechanism as a method of propulsion for an object? Obviously the technology to do something like that is far beyond our capabilities, but are there any laws of physics that would prevent it from happening?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to formulate an analogy. Asking if humans can harness cosmic accelerators as a method of propulsion... is kinda like a bee asking if it could ever harness volcanoes to move the hive closer to the flowers. The obvious result involves immediate and painless vaporization of the bee and all of her friends.</p>
<p>Unless we were suddenly given a cosmic open window into the cushy air-conditioned interior of some massive alien luxury sedan, shielding our squishy meat bags (and computers, too) from the mind-boggling energies involved in these cosmic accelerators... It would be a bit like loading a bee into a shotgun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not likely. Neutrinos are near massless (1/millionth of an electron), so there is no use in using them as reaction mass. And they are extremely plentiful anyway, from all nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, etc. - mostly from Sol.</p>
<p>The high energy observed here wouldn’t facilitate any benefit for propulsion. And you’d need an super massive blackhole, kilonova explosion etc. to generate ones.</p>
<p>Edit: of course I’m just a pleb, so caveat emptor / what do I know...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So sort of like neutrino-based radio? By no means faster (would be impossible without exploiting other dimensions), but could potentially carry signals further across the universe.</p>
<p>If alien civs were to send messages from system to system, and couldn't use warp drive to quickly deliver information by way of space carrier pigeons, they could possibly use &quot;neutrino radio&quot;. And if we ourselves end up being able to set up neutrino radio networks, that increases the chances of us intercepting some of the last transmissions of a long-dead elder race that used similar tech.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a nugget of info:
Neutrinos have very small mass compared to other particles &lt;0.12eV.
290 TeV is quite intense. It is 46 micro Joules. </p>
<p>It is the same energy as a ping pong ball dropping 10cm onto the table. Just that it has macroscopic mass is unusual.</p>
<p>Similar to a fast moscito (2.5mg) hitting you on the road, and it feels like at 50 ton 18 wheeler ramming you at 380 km/h.</p></div>		</li>
