			<div class="markdown"><p>Black holes can be described by a few parameters only like mass, charge and spin, sounds familiar?</p>
<p>Again, not claiming elementary particles like electrons are black holes since we dont have a theory for that. Just throwing out the thought that in our current framework its entirely possible that you wouldn't know the difference if they were indeed the same phenomenon, except with different values for the characterizing parameters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spin isn't actually a kind of movement.</p>
<p>It can be modelled mathematically as a kind of angular momentum, and in some ways acts like spinning (e.g. in inducing magnetic fields), but it is an internal/intrinsic property of the object.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>[Copied from a previous answer I gave to a similar question]</p>
<p>For me, the best way to understand a particle’s intrinsic quantum spin is by thinking in terms of rotational symmetry. Imagine a ball on a pool table perpetually spinning on a vertical axis, anti-clockwise as you look down on it (by convention we say its spin vector points up). Now imagine the ball flipping over (without changing how it's spinning) i.e. rotated 180 degrees around a horizontal axis. It will now be spinning clockwise as you look down on it, with its spin vector pointing down, and so will impart an oppositely-directed angular momentum to any other ball that strikes it. Flip it over again (a total of 360 degrees of rotation now) and it will be back to how it started. Therefore, the spinning pool ball has 360-degree rotational symmetry, and so will interact with the other balls on the table identically before and after this rotation. This is analogous to what are called spin-1 bosons (bosons are particles with integer spin). Most of the force-carrying elementary particles i.e. the photon mediating the electromagnetic, the gluon mediating the strong nuclear, and the W and Z particles mediating the weak nuclear force, are spin-1 bosons. Just like the pool ball, they too will interact with other quantum particles in the same way after a 360-degree rotation as they did before.</p>
<p>Electrons however, are different. And weird. They are spin-1/2 particles, part of the group called fermions (particles with half-integer spin). This means they will interact differently with other particles before and after being rotated 360 degrees (excluding a rotation about their spin axis). To get them back to their initial spin state, they have to be rotated 720 degrees, not 360. For me, of all the strangeness of quantum mechanics, this is one of the most bizarre. It’s like having to flip the pool ball over (a 180-degree rotation) four times to get it back to how it started! In this way, an object’s spin (either macroscopic or quantum) can be generalised as a property defined by its dynamical rotational symmetry, that in turn affects its interaction, via angular momentum transfer, with other objects of varying spin and rotational symmetry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer that keeps things simple enough to understand, and it really illustrates how I wish people would stop trying to use layman's analogies to describe quantum mechanics.  Quantum mechanics makes sense via the math behind it.  It's impossible to use analogies because not only are they half-truths, but they perpetuate false notions of how things work.  Quantum physics is so completely outside of one's daily experience that analogies do little more than just confuse and bewilder a layperson.  I think the best answers are the one's like above, where you respond with a direct reason.  I know it's really difficult to explain a lot of scientific topics without analogies, but boy do a lot of them mess up perceptions on &quot;how things work&quot;. </p>
<p>To be more clear, I defer to the way Richard Feynman answered a reporter on 'how magnets work'.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA</a></p>
<p>I think ultimately a brief answer (such as given by  /RobusEtCeleritas and Feynman) should be sufficient, and it's then up to the curious person to further delve into the topic to understand more.  </p></div>		</li>
