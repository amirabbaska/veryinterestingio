			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure" target="_blank">crystallization pattern</a> of water is hexagonal. This has to do with the way the atoms in a molecule of water (well, ice) are arranged. All solids have difference crystallization patterns (if they have any pattern at all). </p>
<p>So it has to do with the ways in which other molecules of water can connect to existing solid molecules of water. There's only certain points. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're hexagonal because of the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/3D_model_hydrogen_bonds_in_water.svg" target="_blank">shape of water molecules</a>. The angle they form is roughly 120 degrees, which is also the angle of each corner of a hexagon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My knowledge there is a bit limited. I believe it's a trait common to polar structures. Hexagons are regular and tessellate in 3 Dimensional axes, so it's a shape that is stable and balances competing forces well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still don't understand. Do snowflakes start off with a hexagonal shape then form into their final shape as they fall due to the same conditions on corresponding points of <del>rational</del> rotational symmetry or do they start off as nothing and form their shape as they fall?</p></div>		</li>

In snowflakes the conditions within the small area are so similar that the crystal growing to six directions grows roughly the same way in each direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The former. They grow outwards from their centre. They add more hexagons to edges. When they're closer to the centre they're more likely to grow back in on themselves so they fill in all the gaps and the centre mass is more solid. At each point of growth there are only ever 6 ways they can go.<br />
In exactly the same conditions 2 ice crystal structures will grow in exactly the same way, the have the same &quot;instructions&quot;. Essentially a growth algorithm, if you apply the exact same variables you get the exact same result. Lab grown snowflakes can be perfectly symmetrical, and can even be &quot;clones&quot; and identical. In the world at large, the conditions are not stable and the further they grow, the less consistent each branch is, as more and more variations are introduced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there are hexagonal in structure to begin with. When the ice first starts to crystallize from water, the nucleation point, where the crystal begins forming is already in that symmetrical hexagonal structure. The needle like ice structure you see are called dendritee.</p>
<p>Other than the 6 larger hexagonal dendrites, you also notice smaller dendrite arms growing out of the larger ones. These smaller dendrites still follow the same growth orientation, that's why you can see defined angles of dendrite branches instead of dendrite arms going all over the place.</p></div>		</li>
