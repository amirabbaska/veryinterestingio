			<div class="markdown"><p>/r/AskHistorians is a very different subreddit from most and it's important to understand why. </p>
<p>They are heavily curated to provide accurate answers with sources. Because of this it's common to have &quot;comment graveyards&quot; from people wandering in thinking it's /r/AskReddit and leaving random responses, jokes, references or uninformed nonsense. </p>
<p>You have to wait for an answer. </p>
<p>Usually in a couple hours to a day someone who has flaired credentials, or who knows about the subject and the subreddit enough to leave a sourced comment, will come along and give him a free college level essay about the question asked. </p>
<p>/r/AskHistorians is one of if not the best part of Reddit for factual fascinating information but it may not fit your need for instant gratification. </p>
<p>In the meantime, try to go make their mod's jobs any harder and just upvote, save the post, and come back later for some interesting reading. </p>
<p>In the meantime they have a massive backlog of stuff, some of it probably related, to get lost in. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I never get any answers when I post there</p>
<p>Not even removed ones :(</p>
<p>I've actually seen a few quite interesting posts removed from that sub, e.g. in some posts about subjects where only educated speculation exists.</p>
<p>I think there is a middle ground to moderation, and r/askHistorians is a bit too extreme. Many posts only have one person responding whose comments aren't nuked, but I find it hard to believe that there was not one other sourced post among all the other hundreds of removed comments.</p>
<p>I'd also be surprised if this didn't discourage people from posting long informed posts - if there's a large chance your post will be removed, why would you throw more than a couple of minutes at it?</p>
<p>Quora manages to get a much better balance, imo.</p></div>		</li>
