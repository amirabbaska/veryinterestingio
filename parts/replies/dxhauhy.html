<p>Aren't they rather difficult to separate from themselves as they tend to have <em>very</em> similar properties.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no.  they have extremely different properties.</p>
<p>it's because they're in ridiculous trace amounts, and because early on we did it with spectroscopy, but the spectra of higher elements are complex and were at the time poorly understood.</p>
<p>they're not actually particularly difficult to separate per se.  it's that you have to do a gargantuan amount of separation to yield anything, and that amount of separation is always difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehmmm... What kind of extremely different properties are we talking about? All of them having extremely different shades of metallic colour or density varying by up to 30%? Or perhaps their atomic radii varying by 40 pm? </p>
<p>Anyway, chemically these guys are very similar and their separation from one another is anything but easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like some evidence for this. I remember reading &quot;the discovery of the elements&quot; as a kid and separating the elements like yttrium from each other required heroic efforts due to their very similar chemistry. Hence four elements named after one Swedish town: Ytterby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anytime you have elements with similar chemical (valence electrons) and physical properties (melting point) it will be hard to separate. Transition metals can have different valence electrons as well.</p>
<p>Basically typical separation methods of using acids won't work. They use Ion Exchange Chromatography which is going to be expensive and slow.</p>
<p>But at least it isn't as stupid as separating uranium U238 from U235.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not really. It just uses ion exchange, much like recycling metal alloys. </p>
<p>The real issue is that you need just as many people and almost as much power in order to produce much smaller batches of metal. </p>
<p>The scale of production has a huge impact on cost. The complexity is only slightly higher, maybe 50% more complex. </p>
<p>Its really all about scale. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No not at all. The dredging process is likely to stir up a huge amount of sediment from the ocean floor. This could drift over large areas of the sea, potentially damaging ecosystems. The ocean floor itself is also home to abundant life, and can be a significant carbon sink (due to falling detritus). The economist did a good article on this recently.... let met just find it for you. <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21738059-mining-ocean-floor-about-go-mainstream-race-bottom" target="_blank">Here it is!</a></p></div>		</li>
