			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any science behind it or is it something a drunk texan just came up with some day?  It sounds very condescebding as though the bidders are idiotic toddlers being enthralled with baby jibberish. For some reason when I hear an American auctioneer it enrages me. I'm uncertain why. In UK the auctioneers will speak a bit fast but they don't do the baby jibberish thing. It's preferable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't actually gibberish.  It's usually a set series of statements.  Just going really fast' so you mostly just hear a few key words. </p>
<p>&quot;Can I have a five?  I have a five.  Does anyone have a ten, do I hear a ten, we have a five in the back, and now a ten to the side, who will give me another five, we have another five, we are at fifteen, does anyone have twenty.&quot;  It will pick up speed, and if there is a pause you'll get some &quot;we're looking for another dollar here, another dollar, who'll give me more and it's over with you, surely we have another dollar, and fair warning and sold.&quot;  What you might hear is the dollar, so it sounds like &quot;looka fer a dollah here, a dollah, who's got a dollah, to you, suuuure we have a dollah, fair warns an sold.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UK auctioneers literally just speak quickly, i understand every word.</p>
<p>However (and the only experience i have with american auctioneers is like storage wars or some shit) i've seen 'auctioneers' from other countries literally just make sounds in amongst the numbers. It's like they couldn't do it right and so just started making noise and hoped it seemed intelligent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forget what I was watching, one of those dumbass storage locker reality shows. The &quot;auctioneer&quot; would literally just roll his tongue in between bids and words. He thought it made his spiel sound cool, but he succeeded in sounding like a special ed kid trying to be a bona fide auction man. It MAY have been intentional, because I was completely transfixed by this red-faced bald dude going &quot;Twenny? Twenny, Twenny dollah rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr can I hear Twenny fie? Rrrrrrrrrrrrr Twenny fie here rrrrrrrrrrrthirty can I hear thirty rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr thirty anyone thirty thirty rrrrrrrrrrrrr Twenny fie going once going twice sold!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>same with a lot of NZ auctioneers. i used to work for one as a sheet runner.  good money for being being paid under the table and for very little work.  even had some perks.  sometimes if somethings didnt get picked up, left behind or not part of a lot i could get it.  only happened once as i found a copy of Final Fantasy 7 and was yeah, thatll be for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father was an auctioneer.  I compare watching them to watching a great comedian.  There is some basic ground rules but each auctioneer develops his own style and intuitively learns the reactions he can expect from different kinds of crowds.  It really does become more of a theater than a science.</p>
<p>As to the UK vs. US thing, I suspect that it would be analogous to why there is a style difference between british comedy and american comedy.  Different separated cultures evolved over time to expect different kinds of basic &quot;auctioneer chant&quot;.  Just having this basic framework seems important. The pattern gets associated with throwing your hand in the air &quot;just one more time&quot;.  </p>
<p>The professional buyers at auctions understand this process well and  intuitively develop their own psychological tricks to keep competition from bidding on an item they could buy for a profit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think speed is essential factor. As a buyer if I had a magic way to speed up or slow down time even with him speaking quickly I'd probably watch 85% of it at double speed 10% at normal and only 5% slightly slowed down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the thing is, they don't say words, they literally cram in gibberish between words. Slow down any hyper-speed-talking auctioneer and it will never be a real word coming out of his mouth between the information he needs to deliver.</p></div>		</li>
