			<div class="markdown"><p>Methamphetamine is much more dangerous and considered neurotoxic. The neurotoxicity stems from the methyl group on methamphetamine, which allows for a higher fat solubility, this is one of the inherent health effects on a molecular level. This coupled with the inherent effect it had on the body, coupled with the fact that not all of methamphetamine is broken down into amphetamine, makes it the more dangerous chemical. Amphetamines typically have many direct and indirect psychological and physiological benefits if used in the correct setting. People with heart disease or seizures should not take it due to the over activity is causes in relation to those two regions of the body. Many time overactivity in a normal person actually has the opposite effect is someone clinically diagnosed with ADHD. It is traditionally not advised for young children to take stimulants, but many times ADHD may be a developmental disorder of the brain. Indirect lack of dopamine in certain centers of the brain, this is helped by this medicine. It outweighs the low chance of bad things that can happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Originally because the hemp would hurt the textile industry and lobbyists pushed for outlawing weed and hemp (even though it won't get you high). There was a government funded study done in the Nixon era to prove marijuana's harmful effects. It actually showed the opposite, so Nixon suppressed the study. Money, basically.</p></div>		</li>
