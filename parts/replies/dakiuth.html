<p>When I searched for it on this sub most answers I found were about it actually being one sound (crediting it to psychological effects), but I was absolutely positive my wall clock made two slightly different noises: one was a little sharper, and the other sounded a bit more like something was dragged over another thing. Now it all makes sense, thanks!</p>
<p>Another question: my wall clock runs on batteries, how does this mechanism work with electrical power?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if wall clocks use exactly the same mechanism but it won't be that different than.</p>
<p>Electric watches or clocks have a quartz crystal implemented in them, the crystal is shaped like a fork and an electric current runs through the quartz crystal. This crystal now vibrates at very precise frequency and another electronic component counts these vibrations, after a certain number of vibrations it will give a signal for the stepper motor to move the seconds hand forward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was confused when you said it moved a stepper motor. Stepper motors are typically pretty expensive, and are difficult to make very small. So, I did some searching.</p>
<p>Watches use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavet_type_stepping_motor" target="_blank">Lavet type stepping motor</a>. These are a bit different from a typical stepper motor in that they are not made for fine movements. They have only two steps per rotation.</p>
<p>I guess you learn something new everyday. Thanks for sharing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a wall clock, sometimes a weight mechanism is used instead of a winding one. So the energy is not stored as elastic potential but as gravitational potential.</p>
<p>Another common difference is the use of a pendulum instead of a hairspring to regulate the ratcheting speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mechanism depicted in the gif does not work with electrical power. It is found in mechanical watches, <em>usually</em> more upmarket and luxurious than your average quartz watch. </p>
<p>Quartz watches theoretically shouldn't produce two alternating noises since the hands are moving with a stepper motor as described in another reply.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No and yes.  The lever escapement works with mechanical energy, which is normally supplied by a coiled spring, but it could as well come from an electric motor, at least in principle.  An electric motor is, after all, a machine that converts electric power to mechanical power.</p>
<p>Conversely, mechanical power can be converted to electrical power.  See for example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Drive" target="_blank">Seiko Spring Drive</a>, an electromechanical watch design that uses a coiled spring as the power source for a quartz crystal.</p>
<p>More generally, the same resonator and escapement designs can often be reused with multiple power sources.  One example is that historic weight-driven tower clocks are often fitted with <a href="http://www.richardwhiteclocks.co.uk/autowinders" target="_blank">electric winders</a> to power them electrically.  Less silly examples come from the history of pre-quartz <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_clock" target="_blank">electric clocks</a>, which were often similar designs to purely mechanical ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it's more of an &quot;up&quot; &quot;down&quot; rather than &quot;tick&quot; &quot;tock&quot;. I guess tick would be up and tock down. I can't really explain it, but one sounds like it's moving up and the other sounds like it's moving down.</p>
<p>Edit: ticked when I should have tocked</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mechanical watches use an escapement gear (which /u/liarandathief linked to above) along with an oscillating balance wheel to regulate the time of the watch.  The gear train is maintained under tension with a spring, and the escapement and balance wheel just let a &quot;tick&quot; happen at a rate based on the geometry of the balance wheel.  The balance wheel in a typical Rolex oscillates at 28800 times per hour, which works out to 8 times per second. This means that it is actually ticking 8 times per second, but it happens so quickly that it appears to glide smoothly.</p></div>		</li>
