			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is fine, but one could guess that it's because swallowing is important. I wouldn't mind reading more about the mechanism of the &quot;override&quot; if someone has those details! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, as is it doesn't really answer the question.</p>
<p>&quot;Why doesn't swallowing trigger the gag reflex?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because the gag reflex doesn't trigger while swallowing.&quot;</p>
<p>Cool, thanks! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's kind of the answer. It's not a very complicated system, it's to do with the Pharnygeal wall, when swallowing food is chewed first and made moist by the saliva so it doesn't hit the wall in a hard unexpected way. It just slides down the throat.</p>
<p>When something bigger touches the back or the roof of your throat, the reflex will activate . </p>
<p>So basically, the act of chewing renders food to a state that it will not trigger the reflex. Put too much in your mouth and try to swallow it, and you might gag even if it's chewed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thought it had to do with accessibility to the windpipe. Stick your fingers down your throat, brain thinks you are going to choke so you gag. Swallowing closes the windpipe so the brain doesnt think you're going to choke, no gag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not a biologist of any sort, but I did suffer through orthodontics as a kid.</p>
<p>I can tell you some mechanics that affect (or rather, help prevent) the gag reflex: </p>
<p>One is swallowing before doing whatever might cause you to gag. In my case it was getting molds of my teeth taken. For some reason I think swallowing will temporarily suppress the reflex. Or maybe its just to clear the mouth of saliva etc.</p>
<p>The other is breathing through your nose. I believe this is to reduce/eliminate extra stimulation of the throat that would normally happen with cool air going through your mouth.</p>
<p>Thirdly is to concentrate on some elaborate task, such as trying to rotate your feet in different circles. Like one clockwise and the other, counter.</p>
<p>Im sure all these things have something to do with the mechanics of gagging, but I dont totally understand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once the swallow is triggered, the bolus moves to the back of the throat and travels to the esophagus. When you put your fingers back there, it is in the absence of the swallow reflex. I'm guessing this has something to do with it, as well as your fingers being far bigger than a typical bolus.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the gag reflex isn't a reflex at all and is instead something psychosomatic?</p>
<p>If you believe you are swallowing, you won't gag?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, it's a real reflex, it can just be covered up. Think of tapping you patella tendon while standing up. Do you think your leg kick out? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm...not sure that's an accurate example. That reflex is triggered by stretching the tendon, when you're standing the tendon isn't under tension like it is when you're sitting with lower legs dependent. Try assessing that reflex with a patient supine, you have to flex the knee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect tickling would be a better analogy here; it elicits an involuntary response of laughter in some people. Purposeful touching of your skin with your own hand triggers your nervous system differently than if the contact comes from a hand not attached to your body (someone else's). It's inhibited in part by your sense of spatial awareness, as you know at an autonomic level that your skin is touching your skin.</p>
<p>It appears from the source comment's explanation that the act of purposely swallowing may be suppressing an autonomic gag response, while contact with a material without that purposeful swallowing does not suppress it. People who try to make themselves vomit aren't trying to swallow their fingers, they're attempting to touch the back of their throat. Food is also usually sodden with saliva by the time it gets to the back of the throat, and a person's hands are likely to be dry. The experiences of food vs. fingers would differ enough to trigger the nervous system in a different manner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. While you're chewing and preparing your food to be swallowed, your mouth is forming and squeezing that food into a cylindrical/tubelike shape. You probably never noticed that. The next time you're chewing something, focus on what the muscles inside your mouth are doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly enough the same behavior is seen in programmable interrupt controllers for microprocessors. All of the interrupt lines to control input and output operations have a priority where some signals are processed before others and some can be ignored while others are mandatory. So it's an interesting example where the body and the computer are more similar than you would expect on the surface. Quite fascinating for a random off-the-wall topic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gag reflex can be over ridden by sticking a finger in the back of the throat and pressing down firmly. Seems like it'd do the opposite but at least in cases alcohol poisoning I've had to use it to keep someone from panicking when they were dry heaving until they couldn't breath. Learned it from a bartender.</p></div>		</li>
