			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the heat is transferred via pipes in the reactor walls and is then pumped into a pool of water, which begins evaporating and spins turbines as a result. From the outside a fusion reactor complex will look very similar to a fission reactor complex</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense, its just you never hear discussion on that step as much as the primary energy (heat) source. I wonder how much loss there is with the steam turbines and what problems/breakthroughs can be made there.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not really. It's a lot easier energetically to induce fission than than to induce fusion. The opposite process is used in thermonuclear weapons, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In short, no but yes :)</p>
<p>There have been many discussions over the years to use fusion reactors, which would be a strong neutron source, to either breed or transmute fission fuel. Russia and Japan have both championed this idea as an alternative to a full-blown fusion power plant.</p></div>		</li>
