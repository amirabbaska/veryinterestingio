			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing many forget about the US and Canada is, if you live out in some middle of nowhere place, and are studying a specialty, first you have to move to the town the university is in. After 4-6 years doing that, and being on your own, you probably do not want to move back home, even if that was practical. </p>
<p>But the main thing is, you got student loans to pay off, and a life to start, so you follow the money. If you grew up in say, rural Kentucky, you might well have gone to college in Ohio, or Michigan, and then found a job in Chicago, LA, Phoenix, Atlanta, you name it. </p>
<p>Even jobs that are trades, or factory jobs, you follow the money. Yeah, your first auto assembly job might have been in Youngstown, Ohio, but you can get a promotion and nice bump in pay grade if you go down to Tennessee or Oklahoma to work the new factories there. And then maybe you end up in France, Germany, Italy for 6-9 months, down in Mexico for 18 months setting up a production line, then end up settling in Texas. </p>
<p>For people in other places is the world that are not the UK or the US, this sounds utterly and totally bonkers. Unless they happen to be engineers, pilots, sailors, international businessmen, etc. ;) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your last paragraph is right. It's seen as pretty bad to mooch off your parents when you can be out, living on your own or with friends and not costing them your keep. Western parents still help their grown kids, though, even to the point of helping with a house down payment if they're kind of loaded. And it's generally acceptable to live at home if you're in school, including graduate school, or if you're specifically saving for a house down payment. In other words, progressing with their help, not just mooching.</p></div>		</li>
