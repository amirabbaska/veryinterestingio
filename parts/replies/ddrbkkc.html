			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to sunnbeta's comment, proteins and DNA undergo depolymerization starting at 192f (the PCR temperature).  Bacteria is typically killed by 165f internal temperature first though.  Thus, raising the temp from 200f to 300f vastly increases the speed of the denaturation of the food, and penetrating temperatures.</p>
<p>Thus, you want to cook at a high enough temperature to kill off evil things, and then from there denature the proteins to make it more palatable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the best ways to cook that steak is at like 250-275 for a long duration until the internal temp is where you want. It would take forever at 150 and doesn't produce any additional benefit that 250 won't give you.</p>
<p>Toss that thing in a pan with an oil/butter/fat of choice and sear the outside. Then let rest before serving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an oven yes that would be true about the temp, but with a method like sous-vide it is possible to go low and slow at really specific temp (because it's heating with a circulated liquid, it's a much more even heat transfer):<a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-steak.html#chart" target="_blank">http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-steak.html#chart</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah if you want to do that.</p>
<p>That method doesn't work with &quot;meat&quot; in general though. You need to hit certain temps to kill off a host of nasty bacteria and parasites that can come with that tasty meat. </p>
<p>I was trying to say more broadly.. </p>
<p>I wouldn't want to eat something only cooked at 120 degreees.  I can hold my hand in 120 degree water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some commercial pizza ovens do go higher, not just for subway type stuff... but yeah not common. My point was more that it's possible but not typical
