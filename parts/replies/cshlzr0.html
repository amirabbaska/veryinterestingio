			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny! A quick calculation (using r_s = 2GM/c^2 for the schwartzchild radius, and GM/r^2 for gravity) shows the gravity at the horizon is c^4 /(4GM), which of course is unbounded as M-&gt;0. Since there is such a thing as a <em>smallest singularity</em>, perhaps this would be an answer to OP?</p>
<p>EDIT: although a smallest singularity has to do with quantum limits, so I doubt gravity still works the same way there...</p></div>		</li>
