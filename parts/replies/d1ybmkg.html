			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, but I have another questions. Why is the gravitational field constant, even when moving away from the plane? I get how it's constant when moving parallel to the plane, but when you move upwards from it why doesn't it decrease according to the equation <em>g=GM/r^2</em>? Is it because you can't model an infinite plane as a single particle as you could with a planet? What if the plane isn't uniform in density/mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The formula <strong>g</strong> = GM <strong>r</strong>/r^(3) only holds for point particles with mass <em>M</em>. Since the infinite plane is not a point particle, you have to integrate the differential d<strong>g</strong> = GdM <strong>r</strong>/r^(3) over the entire plane, where dM is a small piece of the surface. (This is just the superposition principle.) This is a standard exercise in calculus III.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use Gauss's Law which states that div(<strong>g</strong>) = 4πGρ, which in its integral form says that the flux of <strong>g</strong> across any surface is equal to 4πGM<em><em>enclosed</em></em>. This makes the entire calculation much easier and the desired result falls out almost immediately.</p>
<p>If the plane is not uniform, then you likely cannot use Gauss's Law in a simple way since there may not be any symmetry. But you can still integrate d<strong>g</strong> across the plane to get the field. There are some decay conditions on the density to ensure that the integrals converge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth mentioning is that this is the same solution as the electric field near one or between two parallel plates (which are big enough to be considered infinite with respect to the measurement point).   Constant electric field between parallel plates is used for all sorts of physics (ion beam accelration/deflection, capacitance, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because most of the plane's gravity (being infinite) is pulling you laterally and cancelling itself out. Only the parts directly below you pull straight down while the rest pulls at some angle. As you move higher up, the gravitational strength of any one point on the plane does get weaker, but more distant points are now pulling in a more downward direction, and you wind up with more total points pulling downward with slightly less force. Ultimately the net gravitational force remains constant, and unrelated to altitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Midtek gave the correct mathematical answer. </p>
<p>A more intuitive approach would be the following: Earth is already very large relative to you, so you have to go up a lot to notice a significant change in gravity. The larger the sphere that you are on is, the smaller the change in gravity for a constant change in height.</p>
<p>Now you could view the infinite plane as a sphere with infinite radius (and the fitting infinite mass) - then the change in height has no effect, as lim GM/R^2 = lim GM/(R+h)^2 for R-&gt;infinity, h your change of height and M=m*R^2 for some initial <del>mass</del> value m. (The mass has to increase with the radius, otherwise gravity would converge to 0.)</p>
<p>Edit: m is not a mass, it is a value of mass/distance^2 .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another intuitive answer is that with the earth if you are in space and move twice as far away from the earth the earth appears to get 4 times smaller in area.  With an infinite plane no matter how far away you move the plane will always appear to be exactly half of the sky and never gets smaller.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What's a line but a circle with an infinite radius? Sure, we break the usefulness of field algebra, but it's fun and certainly useful in its own right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic. However you miss one crucial detail. Obstruction by atmosphere density. With an infinite density of air for the light to be passing through on its way to us we would see only up to [Uncalculated distance] away, then it would be just haze past there until you get far enough away to see that infinite point directly above. It would look more like a ceiling above a hazy atmosphere.</p>
<p>Edit: not atmosphere above, that's just silly as you'd be more worried about the crushing pressure than visibility. But the light travels an infinite distance through the atmosphere and would be obscured. Though once it's far enough away were looking at the stuff that's gone above the atmosphere and come back down, so you'd still see the ceiling, just not a horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I think it's more complicated. The atmosphere does not extend infinitely above our flat plane, otherwise atmospheric pressure would be infinite. At some point the atmosphere must terminate. So light from points very far away from the observer goes at an angle nearly perpendicular to Earth, exits the atmosphere, and is eventually bent back through the atmosphere and to the observer. Therefore light from very far away only passes through the atmosphere <em>vertically</em> twice, and is therefore <em>less</em> hazy than nearby light sources which travel horizontally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you get a haze at a certain distance then past another mark it starts becoming clear again. Which means you get a hazy horizon and a ceiling of redshift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did state they were treating the universe as having uniform density (except you). So they ignored atmospheric density, instead of missing it, I believe. :-).</p>
<p>Would it be hazy though? at what point would an infinite, uniformly dense atmosphere refract enough light to be an infinite rainbow effect? With Gravity bending light over very large distances, wouldn't red be bent at a different rate than blue, and so on through out the spectrum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you're going to throw in an atmosphere, wouldn't the &quot;ceiling&quot; also be hazy?  this kind of obviates the problem.  you'll just see a flat plane with haze at the end</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atmosphere only goes so far up before the pressure would be too much to sustain life, thus we only concern ourselves with the haze from distance not height. If we had to worry about how thick the atmosphere was we would be worried about breathing and standing more than visibility.</p></div>		</li>

Do you have any idea how the sky would look in that case? Would there be a recognizable pattern or would it just be a diffused haze?</p></div>		</li>
