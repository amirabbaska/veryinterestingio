			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say &quot;standard calculator&quot; do you mean a basic calculator with the most complicated operation being a square root? I'm not sure I'd call those the standard calculator anymore. </p>
<p>These days most people have a smart phone in their pocket. At least on my phone, the standard calculator includes functionality you'd typically see in low-end scientific calculators. Logarithms, exponentials, powers, trig functions, binomial coefficients, etc.</p>
<p>If you're not comparing the speed of taking a logarithm on a slide rule to the speed of taking a logarithm on a calculator that only has +,-,*,/ then I'm curious what calculations you had in mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only is this the correct answer, I just couldn't &quot;get&quot; why logarithms worked on paper until my teacher showed me the concept on my slide rule... suddenly everything clicked.  Yeah, I grew up in the 1970s.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To take the square root, you take the log, cut it in half, and reverse the log.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And for anyone rusty on their properties of logarithms:</p>
<p>a*log(x) = log(x^(a))  </p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>1/2 log(x) = log(x^(1/2)) = log(sqrt(x))</p>
<p>Reversing the log gives you sqrt(x).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several scales on a slide rule. The main one goes from 0 to 1, another goes from 0 to 1 twice. If you put the indicator on a number on the main scale, the indicator on the second scale gives you the square of the number. You go the other way to get the square root. This is because log( x^2 ) = 2 log(x). Fancier slide rules have a scale that goes from 0 to 1 three times for cubes and cube roots.</p></div>		</li>
