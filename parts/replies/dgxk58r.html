<p>It does not really make sense to call them &quot;free neutrons&quot;. This is fairly obvious when you look at the density of the inner regions. It is higher thant the density of a neutron ! You would call it another phase of matter. I am not really sure how far the discussion about the exact structure is settled, but we can be sure it is not hadronic matter (like neutrons).  It will be something like a (non-) colour flavour locked liquid phase or quark gluon plasma....</p>
<p>Edit: You should take at some sources like [this]( <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6618.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6618.pdf</a>) or just use [wikipedia]( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:QCD_phase_diagram.png" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:QCD_phase_diagram.png</a>)</p>
<p>The point is that at higher chemical potentials/densities the states of QCD change. You wil  have hadronic matter at low mu, which will change into neutron matter at higher mu (these are NOT free neutrons)  and at even higher chemical potentials lead to restoration of the chiral  symmetry i.e.  colour superconducting phases / quark-gluon plasma.</p></div>		</li>
