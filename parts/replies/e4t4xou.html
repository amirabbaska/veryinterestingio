			<div class="markdown"><p>Today it’s basically the same on the nasdaq and NYSE. 99.99% of trading on both exchanges (and pretty much all other exchanges) is computerized matchmaking that takes place on servers in data centers in seacacus NJ. </p>
<p>The NYSE (and AMEX) back in the day had what was called a ‘specialist system’ where each stock had a specialist on the floor that matched buyers and sellers (the people screaming and yelling on the trading floor) to facilitate transactions. In the 70s, the nasdaq developed and perfected a ‘specialist-less’ computer matching system, which was inferior at first but evolved enough to eventually exceed the specialist system by the late 90s. </p>
<p>Since then, the NYSE has for the most part ditched the specialist system for computer matching. There are a few floor traders and specialists left, but they see minimal volume and are basically dinosaurs that have yet to die out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my professors had an old student who worked on computer matching systems for NYSE. Apparently, a lot of the code base was written in Assembly just because writing at such a low level gets rid of overhead that could shave milliseconds off of trading speeds. </p></div>		</li>
