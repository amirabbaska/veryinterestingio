			<div class="markdown"><p>An simple overview: </p>
<p>These brain cells are in the substantia nigra. It's a dark strip of neurons which are in the middle of your brain, and these communicate through the striatum and other parts of the basal ganglia (also in the middle of the brain) using dopamine signalling. These areas of the brain are integral to smooth motor control, and when approximately 70% of these nigral neurons are lost, parkinsonism manifests. </p></div>		</li>
