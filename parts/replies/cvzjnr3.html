			<div class="markdown"><p>Some phones try to actually send small images as emojis which is why its converted into a multimedia message. It's now more common for text message apps like google hangouts to just convert the text version of the emoji into an image after it has been received.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess your app is changing the emoji into graphics, then sending those graphics with the message. Therefore, it's a multimedia message. The advantage of this is that the recipient sees the same graphics you do. If you're not seeing the graphics, maybe only the recipient is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because iOS and Android have different rendering for emojis  <a href="http://observer.com/2015/07/is-your-emoji-message-getting-lost-in-translation-between-apple-and-android/" target="_blank">which can bring some confusion</a>, so they are converted to images to prevent them to change in transit when possible (as /u/cwhazzoo said). This transforms the SMS into a multimedia message.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of text encoding is to be fast and consistent. It would be possible to have codes for all possible formatting combinations, but then each character code would be huge, and there would be multiple codes for each &quot;base&quot; character such as the letter 'a'.</p>
<p>Unicode currently has 109,384 unique characters assigned to codes. If you subtract the 722 emoji characters, that leaves 108,662 base characters. Now let's do some math. Let's assume there are only  7 possible formatting choices for each character(bold, italics, underline, and the combinations of these). If each base character had a unique chats for each format, that would make 760,634 unique characters. Now, if you wanted to have unique codes for 16 possible colors, there would need to be 12,170,144 codes! That's over 110 times the amount of codes assigned by Unicode. </p>
<p>Here comes the biggest issue. Software that parses code such as spell checkers now have to consider 110 times as many characters. They have to know that each letter has over 110 different versions. They also have to guess exactly which kind of formatting and color combination it should replace your text with. This would make these programs take an exponentially greater amount of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Text client can render text it any way it wants. For example it can be smart and detect URL in the text and make link of it. But under the hood you're receiving 160 characters (140 bytes really) in plain text which is quite short and you probably don't want to waste that for some extra formatting info.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It's your chat client that detects url:s and show them to you in a different fashion. The sms that is sent is in raw text.</p>
<p>I mean, you could make an sms client that replaces every instance of the word <code>hello</code> with a 20 MiB large animated gif. That doesn't mean that it's a feature of sms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hangouts will animate certain words automatically. There could be some simple BBC style coding built into all sms clients... Maybe new formatting emojis so there's no confusion and those clients that don't support the format won't look strange as it won't show up at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of a text file made in notepad. When you type it, you can't add formatting because its text only. If you copy and paste it into Word, the more advanced program detects the link and highlights it, making it clickable. You can also make bold text, italics, etc in Word. Now copy and paste it back into notepad. Only the text remains. Testing is the same way--it only supports sending text, despite what the more advanced messaging apps might decide to show or do. </p></div>		</li>
