			<div class="markdown"><p>Flies may be dumb, but they're not <em>that</em> dumb - they can do much more than fly around randomly and obey simple rules like &quot;avoid walls.&quot; C. Elegans can do that sort of thing (if you hit something turn around; if you smell food go straight) with 302 neurons; fruit flies have 135,000. Those extra 134,698 neurons add a lot of interesting capabilities, like recognizing odors and objects.</p>
<p>Neuroscientists who study fruit flies claim they display some aspects of consciousness, like attention. (That includes <a href="http://greenspanlab.ucsd.edu/greenspan.html" target="_blank">Ralph Greenspan</a>, who literally wrote the book on fruit fly genetics.)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subtle point that they might display aspects of consciousness, but it doesn't suggest they are conscious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That these three variables associated with changes in consciousness might exist even in a fruit-fly does not necessarily imply that a fly is &quot;conscious&quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in Michigan where the house flies were the kind that flew all over, and they would fly onto the window and it would look like they were trying to get out. Now I live in California, and the &quot;normal&quot; kind of flies are much less common than the kind that find the center of a space and then just circle it nonstop all day long. They don't seem to land and eat anything, they just fly in circles. If you compress the space they're using, they just find the new center and circle in that. They're goddamn idiots. Why?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're usually circling a light, because they think it's the Sun, and they think they're flying straight with it as a reference point.  They don't know they're going in circles.</p></div>		</li>
