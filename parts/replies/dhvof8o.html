			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is anything like the marriages of most of my coworkers', the men and women both work equally long hours but afterwards the men expect the women to do ALL the housework. The men go out and grab drinks with each other while the women have to hurry home and do stuff for the kids. I can see why the women get fed up, but then again none of the people I described have bachelor's degrees so that might be the result of uneducated styles of thinking.</p></div>		</li>
