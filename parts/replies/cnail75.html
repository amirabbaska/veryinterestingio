			<div class="markdown"><p>We orbit the galaxy every ~230 million years. Which means the Solar System is ~18-20 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year" target="_blank">galactic years</a> old. And means in the last year we've traveled about 6 billion km or <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+year+%2F+230+million+years+*+2+pi+*+distance+to+galactic+center" target="_blank">43 AU</a> around the galaxy.</p>
<p>Tangent: Our orbit around the galaxy isn't nearly as normal as the Earth's around the Sun because the Sun gets tugged slightly off course by passing stars/molecular clouds, etc way more than other planets affect the Earth. So it's unlikely the Sun will ever come back to the same location in the galaxy again, and in fact stars seem to migrate inward and outward quite a bit over their lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to answer that in a meaningful way. Imagine you had a bucket of water with some particles floating in it and the water was swirling around. You can't really say &quot;how far has one of those particles moved relative to all the others,&quot; because they're all moving at different rates and different directions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth's orbit isn't perfectly stable. None of the orbits in the solar system are. So we're never retracing exactly the same orbit every year. For example, there's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession#mediaviewer/File:Precessing_Kepler_orbit_280frames_e0.6_smaller.gif" target="_blank">apsidal precession</a>.</p>
<p>And all the planets slightly alter each other's orbits, barely noticeable on human timescales, but important over billions of years. In fact, we're not even positive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_of_the_Solar_System" target="_blank">the solar system is stable</a> over billions of years because we can't predict the future accurately more than maybe 50 million years in advance.</p></div>		</li>
