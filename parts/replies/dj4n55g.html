<p>One grain of rice is about the same size as said pencil tip.  Those are hundreds of eggs.  You would not mistake eggs for rice.</p>
<p>Also, I don't know what <em>your</em> culinary proclivities are, but rice on raw meat is not a combination <em>I</em> find in my fridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was very informative, more so than many comments on this thread. I appreciate it a lot. I had no idea that gasses from rotting food can ever so slightly open a fridge door.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this explanation.  The other responses about eggs being all over all my food made me feel like I could never eat again.  </p>
<p>You probably saved my life lol </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are hella right. Anecdote time - there are always a few ants hanging around our fridge. Just last night, I found a dead spider near the door and brushed it out. For a few days when we had fruit flies secretly breeding in the trash can, there was always a mysterious few dead flies inside the freezer (not the fridge for some reason) near the door. My roommate used to have a habit of leaving a used cup for chocolate milk in the freezer, and one day, I tiptoed and actually looked up there - a trail and ring of a bunch of fricken dead ants around the metal cup. We keep a bag of sugar in there. No ants near the bag of sugar on the door. </p></div>		</li>
