			<p>average elevation of the [Tibetan Plateau] (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Plateau" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Plateau</a>) is 4,500 meters... on the Nepal side of the mountain elevation drops faster than the Tibetan side, but when I traveled through the region I remember getting pretty damn far away from Everest before there was significant drop in elevation<br><br>I guess it depends on how much of the Himalayas you count as &quot;base&quot;, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest" target="_blank">Everest</a> Wiki puts it at between 4,200 meters and 5,600 meters, leaving a height above base between 4,650 meters and 3,650 meters... it's not much higher above base than Mt. Rainier, if at all.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually it would be fourth (or fifth?) from base to peak.<br><br>Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa: 10.2 km (6.3 mi)<br><br>Pico del Teide: 7.5 km (4.7 mi)<br><br>Mount McKinley 5.3 to 5.9 km (3.3 to 3.7 mi)<br><br>Mount Everest 3.6 to 4.6 km (2.2 to 2.9 mi)<br><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_mountains_in_the_Solar_System" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_mountains_in_the_Solar_System</a><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Would the base of the Himalayas then be beyond the coast of Asia and western Europe?</p>		</li>
