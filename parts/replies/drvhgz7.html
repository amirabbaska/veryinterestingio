			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a YouTube video of a sprint cyclist toasting bread with a generator hooked up to a bycicle. He barely managed to power the toaster through to the goal of toasting it. It was pretty awesome to watch. </p>
<p>It required something like 700 or 1000 watts for 45 seconds or a minute or something.</p>
<p>Edit: found it <a href="https://youtu.be/S4O5voOCqAQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/S4O5voOCqAQ</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really important point, have to stress it once more, perhaps more succinctly:</p>
<p>Air resistance is quadratic, so even <em>enormous</em> differences in power translate to very small differences in time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>v^2 in the equation K=(mv^2 )/2 is quadratic as well, which explains how going 2 times faster can take 8 times more energy, since air resistance quadruples and simply going faster in a vacuum the energy required also quadruples</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if air resistance were not a factor, the equation for kinetic energy is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>K=(mv^2 )/2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning that as the velocity of a mass doubles, the kinetic energy actually quadruples, because it's <em>v^2</em>. It takes four times as much energy to go twice as fast, while moving a twice heavy mass only takes twice as much energy.</p>
<p>When a weightlifter lifts an olympic weight, they aren't judged by how fast they can lift it. They simply have to lift a heavier weight the same distance above their head even if they take more time to so it, meaning power lifting is seeing how much <em>m</em> can be increased. Sprinting, the focus is seeing how much we can increase the <em>v</em> portion of this equation. Even if we had the Olympics in a vacuum, we'd still see a similar discrepancy between improvements in power lifting vs improvements in sprinting speeds, but it wouldn't be so drastic as it is when air resistance is thrown in.</p></div>		</li>
