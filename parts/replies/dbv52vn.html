			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I am listening to a tone emanating from a waterproof speaker and then go underwater with the speaker, will I perceive a higher pitch because the sound waves travel through the water faster than through the air? And will it sound louder at the same distance from my ear?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will certainly sound different.</p>
<p>The pitch will be the sameâ€”the sound waves traveling faster through water merely causes them to reach your ear <em>sooner</em>, but not at a higher frequency. At short range and with a continuous tone, the difference is imperceptible. If you were a considerable distance away, you would hear the underwater tone earlier (and likely with less loss of power) than the tone through air, with the same frequency.</p>
<p>The acoustics underwater will also be different than in air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That all depends on whether or not there's air stuck within your ears at the moment you're listening! Most people when they go underwater will still have their ear canal filled with air, and if there were an underwater speaker then theres a change in medium from the water where the sound originates to the air in your ear where you hear it.</p>
<p>If there were a waterproof microphone however, who was completely submerged, as long as there's no significant change in the waters temperature or composition, and neither of them are moving relative to each other, then the microphone should pick up the same pitch the speaker is producing</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot about one last thing! The thing I said about the air in your ear canal is half true, because that's part of how sound resonates in your ear (That's why humans are so sensitive to 4kHz frequencies). However, you would also hear sounds coming from the outside of your skull, in which there isn't air between that and your hearing. It would be quite a bit more quiet, but depending on how much the frequency changes you could potentially pick up on it.</p>
<p>Most likely it would just blend with the sound you're hearing from your ear canal and create a comb filter, which changes timbre and not pitch.</p>
<p>Only if the change in frequency is greater than a certain frequency (which I can't find in my notes anywhere, it has something to do with the Haas effect but I can't remember for the life of me what it's called) will we perceive the two sounds as two distinguishable notes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>if you made the sound by vibrating water instead of air (which is bad, it requires breathing in water) then the pitch would be very different to anyone hearing the medium in air.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Seriously asking) So would that mean that the Golden Egg clue in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is plausible? Like how we interpret the sound changes depending on media?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using only acoustics, I don't think so! It goes from a horrible screeching to beautiful music, so there's a significant change in both timbre and pitch. Assuming that Harry opened it in the air, and it's designed to be listened to when submerged in water, it's likely that it would be as loud as it is in the movie, because it would have to be to handle the loss of energy when traveling through the mediums (some of the wave is reflected, absorbed, refracted, and what Harry hears is mostly the transmitted sound).</p>
<p>Now what the egg should sound like when played in air is a super loud, kind of higher version of the song when it's submerged, so it's not exactly possible to get the same effect as in the movie but there also could be things I'm missing. Good question!</p></div>		</li>
