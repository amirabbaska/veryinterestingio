<p>I call BS. There's nothing pleasant about the smell of roasting coffee -- it smells like burnt popcorn. Roasted or brewing coffee might smell nice (especially to those people already addicted whose bodies associate the smell with satisfying their addiction), but roasting coffee smells terrible.</p>
<p>As a side note, Disney's California Adventure theme park made this mistake. Some executive thought &quot;hey, everyone likes the smell of roasting coffee, right?&quot; and placed a coffee roaster right at the park entrance. Reportedly, park security was getting constant reports about something being on fire and guest services were getting constant complaints about the acrid smell until they finally removed it when the remodeled the park entrance.</p></div>		</li>
