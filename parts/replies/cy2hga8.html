			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, gravitational waves interact with each other, producing spacetime curvature of their own, though trying to split up a hierarchy of &quot;waves&quot; and &quot;metawaves&quot; is kind of artificial. The important takeaway is that gravity can in fact be self-sustaining, and that there are nontrivial solutions to Einstein's equations that have no matter in them whatsoever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure gravitational waves also radiate gravitational waves, though not positive by any means. If you made gravitational wave black hole near eachother and they inspiralled, they would definitely produce their own gravitational waves. I imagine though that these gravitational wave black holes are tiny (though in principle I guess I don't see why they couldn't be big) so the gravitational waves they give off will also be tiny.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So you're pretty sure or you're unsure? Which is it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Underrated answer here. In layman's terms, in <em>theory</em>, a black hole can be created from gravity itself.</p>
<p>As a side note, photons absolutely affect the gravitational field.</p></div>		</li>
