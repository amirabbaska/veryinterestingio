			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 24 and am still pretty particular about eggs. They have to be seasoned  or they will gross me out. I went to a military school for college and are expected to eat as fast as we can. To make things quick they served &quot;hot plates&quot; that were just preloaded with a entre and 2 sides that was quick to grab. For breakfast it was eggs, sausage, and hash browns. I remember one day I grabbed a plate and tried to scarf down my eggs and almost threw up on the upperclassmen in charge of me. </p></div>		</li>
