<p>Massive cell death through lack of regeneration is what leads to the death of regular organisms (natural causes/old age). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you explain the link please ? How is cell death/old age related to bodily death/old age ?</p>
<p>For that matter, how do folks die of old age ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically your body is in good shape for a couple decades and it continues to grow and develop all the cells it needs to function. At a certain age range you're in your peak and you're producing as many cells as you need. Eventually, you're not producing enough, your body systems start to wear down, and eventually you can't produce enough cells to repair your body and fight off infection/disease. Parts of the system start to barely function or totally shut down and your body stops working. </p>
<p>ELI5: if you were a factory that took 150 people to run efficiently and had a 100 person minimum, as you get closer to 100 employees you lose efficiency. Certain work stations might cease to function. Once you get below 100 employees, the factory shuts down. The body works the same way. If you can't keep the necessary number of cells for a function to fight off injury/infection/disease: the body loses the fight. </p>
<p>When people die of old age it's usually because an essential function of the body completely stops like blood cell replication, brain cell repair/maintenance, kidney/liver function, heart cell replacement. The body just stops working and you die. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I correct in assuming that if we could find a way to activate telomerase in all human cells, we could live longer, if not forever? I think this was the plot of a novel I read once. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what the brouhaha was over in the scientific community when telomerase was first identified and characterised in cell biology. Not so much now, (it is now clear that immortality/combating ageing takes more than manipulating telomerase) but it is still being hotly researched in tumour-related studies due to its implication in cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what my biology teacher said. Your cells would never get old so you would stay at whatever your peak/mature age would be. He said it would be in your 20s for men. It's already turned on in men for sperm production which is why we have sexual viability for our entire life. </p></div>		</li>
