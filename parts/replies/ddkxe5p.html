<p>*The universe is a simulation (God did it!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm curious because I've been reading about this stuff and its really fascinating and mind-boggling. If all matter comes from seemingly nowhere and if we're inside the program then the big bang is just the moment the simulation started. Though even if we're in a simulation, there has to be an original universe. So doesn't that just bring us back to the same problem?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it does. It's a baffling state affairs, but when you consider how long we've been seriously asking these questions we've come a long way. Maybe there is an answer out there that we can understand, maybe not. No theories we have now really even try to address &quot;why&quot;, they talk about &quot;how&quot;.</p>
<p>For example, we observe the mass of the proton to be a certain value, the fundamental unit of electric charge to be another, the gravitational constant yet another. They don't <em>have</em> to be this way for any reason we know of, except that they are. What physics tries to do for the most part, is figure out how all of the gears fit together and how everything works. Where the gears came from is a valid question, but it may not be a question we're ever capable of answering as humans. </p>
<p>If we are, it may be an answer exotic like M-Theory... something we can mathematically formulate, but defies the human imagination. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes and that lends further credence to the simulation and god theories out there. If these values were any different the universe we know wouldn't exist. That could just be a happy coincidence or maybe it's actually programmed. I don't know about you but I actually believe this is very possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, whatever the cause for 'this' universe might be, it could operate under completely different laws, or none at all, which means it wouldn't have to be a universe, i.e. it does not operate under the laws of space and time. </p>
<p>Instead of a physical manifestation of laws that operate over the course of time, this super-universe only consists of logical equations which describe how universes are created. Now technically we would still be curious to know how this 'super-universe' came into existence and why it works the way it does, but maybe on this level these question don't even make sense because it behaves entirely different.</p>
<p>Any assumption is equally unsubstantial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heard/watched video on an interesting one. String theory extends to large strings that are larger than our universe. The big bang was caused by two of the large strings bumping into each other 13.8 billion years ago. The other string that collided could have had its own big bang.</p></div>		</li>
