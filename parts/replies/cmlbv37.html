			<div class="markdown"><p>Want to see cheese turn all sorts of funky disgusting colours?  Take a nice wet juicy bite out of a small block, seal it in a Ziploc bag with some air inside, and toss it in the fridge for a week.  The bacteria from your mouth, combined with the humid environment inside the Ziploc bag, are going to throw a party all over that cheese!</p></div>		</li>

<p>And it might also have been aged in a thick rind or wax, which helps somewhat.</p>
<p>When I want to keep cheese a long time, I just vacuum seal it. I do sous vide cooking, so I have a very nice vacuum machine, but you can also get cheap FoodSaver machines that work fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're referring to the sous vide cooking, I actually advocate that for people who aren't that well off or especially talented in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Reason being is that you can go down to the store, buy the most cheap-ass cut of meat they have, toss it in the SV tank and walk away. One or two days later, you pull it out, and you've got a piece of meat that eats like rich folks steak. Absolute best steaks I've EVER had have been moderately-priced cuts that came out of a SV tank.</p>
<p>It's a little pricey to get into up front, but once you've got the gear, you can eat fancy with little cash or talent. Impresses the hell outta the appropriate sex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other cheese like white mold or washed rind cheese are inoculated and encouraged to develop their own natural protective outer coating which avoids the need for sealing the cheese because it becomes a monoculture. Cheddar (as in true cheddared cheddar, not &quot;cheddar&quot;) cheese is cut into large blocks and stacked one on top of the other to make a kind of curd-tower which forcibly expels the whey from the curd, which dries it and so preserves it much better and longer than a soft cheese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that most contamination comes from contact with unwashed hands. Minimize your contact with your hands, and you minimize the chance for mold. Same for bread, I never put my hands inside and never touch the cheese directly and they rarely get moldy, the one time I get lazy they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You will also have to protect the cheese in something airtight. Your fridge sucks the moisture out of cheese. You can wax it or vacuum seal or store in containers with breathing room. </p>
<p>However, the fridge is usually too cold for good cheese aging. Also in the apocalypse the power usually goes out so that might suck.</p>
<p>Source - I am getting into home cheese making, have aging cheese in fridge right now.</p></div>		</li>
