			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't call you a luddite based on your reasoning – we absolutely <em>should</em> look at all the ways that technological systems can break when we move into new territory like this, it would be stupid not to. But I don't think that the inevitability of increasingly complex problems is a reason to abandon the pursuit of technological progress altogether.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something about getting a digital interface implant that crosses the line for me too. It really could open up tons of potential if I could just think these words to reply to you instead of typing them out. It's a huge bottle neck. I guess it's a different conversation between having a &quot;read only&quot; implant, vs a read/write implant.  </p>
<p>In a read only situation, no glitch or exploit could hurt my physical body, but imagine in a read/write situation that a glitch or exploit could let someone erase your memory, or implant false ideas or memories. Similar to the matrix where you can download a file and be a black belt but with negative consequences.  </p>
<p>I don't think we should avoid research into this, but in terms of a consumer product, it opens up a giant can of worms as far as security goes. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a good point I hadn't really considered... The thing is, hypothetically speaking, that technology wouldn't necessarily have to be read/write capable in order to potentially harm people. Read-only scenarios involving information overload or other unforeseen responses still come to mind – in the same way that epileptics can experience extremely negative effects from 'read-only' visual stimuli, I could imagine glitches occurring even at the passive read-only level for some otherwise normal people with such an increase in neural activity. </p>
<p>There's an episode of Doctor Who called 'The Long Game' that takes that idea to an extreme (although I don't suppose it totally counts as a read-only scenario) – reporters in this particular future have their brains ported to a mega-computer from which they receive massive amounts of data to then report upon, but it can be used to kill them if taken to an extreme.</p></div>		</li>
