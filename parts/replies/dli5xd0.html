			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard somewhat similar things, the field they are pulling this from is epigenetics, which relates to a type of genetic marking that doesn't alter the gene sequence.</p>
<p>Quick search yielded <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/Obesity-Epigenetics-and-Gene-Regulation-927" target="_blank">this.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I attended an epigenetic lecture, and the professor talked about a study. I was only half paying attention as it was a little over my head, but it was a study done on the grandchildren of people from a country that experienced a famine (not ireland). They found markers present in the offspring. I'm going to try to find the study. </p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/dutch-famine-affected-regulation-growth-genes" target="_blank">heres</a> a link to an article that discusses what I think I'm remembering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comment explains it wrong. The DNA doesn't change it activates genes which are kept active even across generations. I know it has been observed in mice, so it probably happens with people too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a thing called skinny-obesity, fundamentally, skinny-obese and obese people are indistinguishable minus the extra weight. Skinny-obese are always pre-diabetic, and under an x-ray, fat distributions is nearly identical. </p>
<p>If you're pre-diabetic and not obese, you're likely skinny-obese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if there are similar effects for boys who are obese and then get in shape before reaching sexual maturity.  With all the overweight kids around now, it would be interesting to know if they're all doomed to struggle with infertility later on.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4408383/" target="_blank">Study regarding the matter.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prime hormonal defect in obese men is hypotestosteronaemia, which results in impaired spermatogenesis leading to poor fecundability. <strong>Studies have shown that most mechanisms accounting for reduced fertility potentials in overweight men are reversible.</strong></p>

<p>Not saying you're wrong, but do you have anything to back this up? Really quite interested.</p></div>		</li>
