<p>Poor person in the USA here. I get called for jury duty quite often (every several years). I simply handwrite the judge a letter saying it would be an extreme financial hardship for me to serve on jury duty. Which is actually true. I think here in Portland they only pay something like $12 a day. That wouldn't even cover parking downtown near the courthouse!</p>
<p>I am happy to do my civic duty but I am not going to lose my house and starve in the process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was poor and called for jury duty in the US. I was so poor that I was nearing the point that I would be evicted from my home if I didn't get a job. I'd worked out the exact date I had to have a job by in order to earn a paycheck in time to keep my home, and it was two days after the day I was ordered to report for jury duty.</p>
<p>I showed up, explained it to the judge... and she gave me an angry lecture about the importance of the jury process, told me to shut up, and empaneled me on the jury.</p>
<p>One of the lawyers rejected me so I could leave and go back to my job search. (I did find a job, just barely in time.)</p>
<p><em>[edit:] Folks, thank you very, very much for your kind upvotes. I've had to disable inbox replies from this post because there are just too many people kindly trying to tell me how to get out of jury duty, it's blowing up my inbox. Thank you again and have a great jury-duty-free day.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep same thing happened to me when I got called for a Grand Jury murder trial. I told the judge that my employer would not compensate me and that if I had to serve I would not be able to pay my rent. He didn't even look at me, just scribbled away on his notes and said, &quot;That is not a compelling reason to be excused from jury duty.&quot; </p>
<p>I broke out the big guns when the lawyers were interviewing us. I told them that I believed the justice system was inherently racist and biased against the poor, and that it would be very difficult for me to vote to convict someone, especially an individual of color, given the circumstances. I was dismissed pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One problem is that most people charged with crimes are poor.  And so if the judge lets all the poor people off the jury, the justice system gets less and less fair.  That judge is probably trying to be fair to the poor person charged with the crime.  The result is hardship for the poor people on the jury.  </p>
<p>A better solution would be to fully fund our court system.  Day 1-2 of jury duty, $50 a day.  Day 3-4, $75 a day.  Day 5-20, $100 a day.  Day 20-100 (5 months) $150/day.  For criminal cases, the state would pay.  For civil cases, the parties would pay.  </p>
<p>BUT, that would limit access to justice for the poor in civil cases.  I guess we'd want the state to pay via a &quot;fee waiver&quot; for those &quot;in forma pauperis.&quot;  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently in <em>some</em> states you can actually volunteer for jury duty. But not in most places -- I think they actually frown on it, because they think you have an agenda (like you want to make sure no one ever gets the death penalty for example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I served on a federal jury on a civil case a few years ago.  I absolutely loved it.  The case was generally really interesting (involved fiber optic cables and communications) but it was also occasionally boring, and the bits where they whipped out some white noise generator so that we couldn't hear the lawyers and judge discussing whether or not we the jury could hear something were very boring - absolutely nothing to do while it happened.  But my employer was awesome about it.  I actually enjoyed the commute - it was new and different.  They reimbursed for mileage and parking and paid for lunch a couple of times.  </p>
<p>At the start of the jury selection process they asked who didn't want to serve and why and once the judge was through that, he asked &quot;does anyone want to be here&quot; and I raised my hand and and when asked why by the amused judge, I said &quot;I think the whole process is fascinating, and this is all really neat&quot; and everyone laughed.  It was really fun - deliberations at the end were awesome, I loved my fellow jurors (we had a postal worker, a professional musician and a professional Santa and a stand-up comic... it was super eclectic).  It was a truly great experience all around... although a few more weeks and I'd maybe start to get tired of it... but for what it was, it was really great. </p>
<p>When it was over, the judge came in and sat with us for an hour or so, asked us our thoughts on the case, gave us his thoughts, answered questions, shook our hands and we got a certificate and then he asked &quot;well, do you still think it was fascinating&quot; and I told him &quot;absolutely!&quot;.  </p>
<p>I hope you get selected and have as great an experience as I did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In NYS (or at least in Nassau County), they're more civilized.  If you get a summons for jury duty, you get a number and a phone number to call  You call the night before, each night for a week.  If they haven't gotten up to your number, you're off the hook and haven't taken off from or wasted time sitting in the courthouse twiddling your thumbs.  They only call the number of jurors they're likely to need the next day (factoring in the number likely to be excused for whatever reasons or rejected during voir dire.  And there was special parking for jurors near the courthouse.  I don't know what jurisdiction you're in, but it sounds to me like it's time for them to up their game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO we should just get rid of juries completely.  The whole 'jury of your peers' thing is a complete joke anyway.  In what way is the 70 year old grandma (who is the only person who can afford a multi-week trial) a peer to a software engineer discussing a very complicated patent case.  Trials, and the law they refer to, have become so complicated it's difficult for a lay person to understand, it's ludicrous to expect the entire legal system hinges on lawyers dumbing down the law and making emotional arguments to sway idiots in the jury box (myself included the few times I've served on a jury).  I'd much rather see a panel of professional jurors (lawyers, judges, etc) who actually understand the law making these decisions.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>What you are making is the case for &quot;expert juries.&quot; </p>
<p>A trial is a combined resolution of questions of facts and questions of law. Juries resolve factual issues, judges resolve legal ones.</p>
<p>Where the factual issues are complex beyond what a layperson could understand without extensive education and training, the jury should be composed of people who have experience in that field. It would almost axiomatically shorten trials and provide fairer outcomes.</p>

<p>It seems especially ridiculous that random people can be forced to sit on multi-million dollar civil suits between corporations. I mean, millions of dollars are on the line because these two companies can't settle their differences, and yet totally random people are basically enslaved, given almost no money and basically forced to work &quot;for&quot; these companies to settle their differences for them. </p>
<p>It would be fine if Jurors got paid the same for their time at the same rate as the lawyers. </p></div>		</li>
