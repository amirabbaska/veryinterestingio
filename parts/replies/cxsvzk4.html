			<div class="markdown"><p>Then there's the Underweb, which can only be accessed by a modified build of a specific Photoshop client from '00s. The shadow web, which is operated in cells with courier pidgeons carrying thumb drives between them. And the lightless void web, for which you need an air gapped PC, an apparatus of mirrors, and the arcane assistance of an ancient ghost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all seriousness, some of the 'dark web' sites need special clients to access that can be a pain.  Tor is the one everyone knows about, hell they even have a 'search engine' to get you to the most popular dark web sites.  Seems like an oxymoron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably also worth pointing out that so far, we've talked about &quot;the web&quot; -- meaning HTML traffic sent over TCP, usually connected to the Internet.
There are lots of other protocols out there that people use, from the more common XMPP, IRC, SMTP, FTP, SSH, Bitcoin, Bittorrent, RSTP (video streaming), and even NNTP, to the more esoteric, like FirstClass, HXD, Wired, Freenet, etc.</p>
<p>So once you've downloaded everything available on the surface web, deep web and dark web, you've still only scratched the surface of what's actually passing through the Internet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Shadow web: uhh... I'm not sure how that's considered the web, but I guess the logistics make sense.</p>
<p>Lightless-void web: oh ok, I get the joke now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can access the deep web from any browser if you know what you are looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>just to clarify but any things that cannot be searched on google are deepweb which including your private only me facebook account, your banking online page, your company internal website which require name to log in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely the case. I can search for a private facebook account and be able to find it via google, however when I click the link to take me to that page, I do not have access. This is different from it not being catalogued.</p>
<p>Those things are logged, it is just you don't have access to those pages. To be part of the deep web there have to be no way of finding a link to it via a search engine.</p>
<p>And for it to be dark web, it has to meet the requirements of deep web and also not allow access to the page altogether and/or be hidden. There are hoops to jump through to just get to the actually site, even when you know where to look, you also have to use something like TOR to access these pages.</p>
<p>Also if it is completely internal, then it is not actually on the internet and therefore is not covered by this either. Internal websites would be more of an intranet not internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the dark web, I've used TOR for mundane &quot;search for this political thing with out ISP / gov knowing &amp; tracking&quot; but how would TOR be the only way to access parts of the dark web?</p>
<p>Do the web servers look to see if you came from a TOR exit node and THEN they serve up a page if you did?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and also piratebay and many other sites not indexed by google, this is why it's consider way bigger than the normal web. There's TB of databases that you can access but not google. Colleges, governament, private companies, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that that stat of &quot;deep web is way bigger than surface web&quot; is because when you define it as anything not indexed by search engines it includes all private webpages and intranets that have probably private links to the normal web such as company and government networks and internal webpages. </p></div>		</li>
