			<div class="markdown"><p>And feces. That was my take away after watching a Myth Busters a few years back. </p>
<p>They were trying to test if a toothbrush in the bathroom would pick up shit particles (the scientific term, you know) if it was covered, uncovered and depending on distance. So they filled a bathroom with toothbrushes all around the room - some covered and uncovered. And then they kept two 'control' brushes covered and in their break room - which was a completely different room, elsewhere in the building. At the end of the test period - I think did a few weeks? - all of the tooth brushes in the bathroom had some particles of poop on them. But...so did the fucking two control brushes in the break room! </p>
<p>From then on, I've been resigned to the fact there is probably shit - literally - on just about every-fucking-thing. =(</p></div>		</li>

<p>And if DOES have something that could potentially infect you or have something that's toxic....   your body deals with that stuff ALL the time. As long as it's not in a significant quantity, your immune system just takes it in stride. </p>
<p>Same goes for food poisoning. A bad case of food poisoning will make you with for death, but we get a minor case quite frequently and don't even notice.  Most of it's killed by the stomach acids, and you just keep chugging along. </p>
<p>Think of...   you know how a sun-beam comes in through a window and you can see all the dust motes?   Yeah, they're ALWAYS there and you constantly breathe them.   But that's normal. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends on the species that laid the egg. Chicken eggs aren't designed to be implanted in flesh and feed off of it once they hatch. Eat a fertilized chicken egg and it is dead. Different story with the eggs of some fly species. If those maggot eggs get lodged in your gums, enjoy your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bB-3OTQQIA" target="_blank">oral myasis</a>. Even if you manage to digest them, there is a chance that they will survive and hatch in your intestines. Now enjoy your intestinal myasis.</p>
<p>This is why you cook your food thoroughly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are literally covered and filled with microrganisms, their corpses and their shit. Literally every square inch of your body, mouth, bowel and even the inside if your vagina (in case you are a woman) is completely covered with it.</p>
<p>The bacteria in your bowel are fundamental to your life, as they are the only able to break down a number of thigs and give to you some vitamins you can't produce or directly assimilate by yourself. All the other bacteria is still good for you, as they enter in competition with bacteria that is harmful for you and defend you from lot of things without you actually realizing.</p>
<p>And yeah pretty much everything organic is covered with bacteria, eggs and other stuff as well, but cooking it kills them. You have to only worry about rotten things because the bacteria there had enough time to produce large amounts of toxins, which aren't always destroyed by cooking and will still be able to harm you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got weirdly specific there. I think you had it covered with &quot;literally every square inch of your body&quot;.</p>
<p>Seems simply worth mentioning that all the places you listed are outside the body. Yes even the bowels. Food in your digestive tract is no more inside your body than a coin in your clenched fist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually I think you're probably wrong.  </p>
<p>Once your food started rotting, some of the flies it would attract don't lay eggs, but live larvae (to take quick advantage of a new food source).  They are very tiny and could slide into the freezer as your seal probably isn't as tight as you think.  </p>
<p>Any existing eggs on your food (highly unlikely) would have been killed by the freezing.  </p>
<p>I highly doubt if any of you took the contents of your freezer and put it in a truly air tight container, that you would find maggots/flies when you opened it.  </p>
<p>Basically, those fuckers get in everywhere, but are not everywhere at once.</p></div>		</li>
