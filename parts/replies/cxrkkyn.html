			<p>People with compromised peripheral circulation i.e., long term diabetics. Small wounds that on an otherwise healthy person would heal in a matter of days- can be so slow to heal that it takes months. Factor in the reduced ability to feel pain in the extremities because of the compromised circulation/neuropathy, the injury may not be detected right away. This is how something as seemingly benign as an ingrown toenail can result in amputation.<br>Tl;dr People with compromised peripheral circulation as a result of advanced diabetes are extremely vulnerable to slow wound healing.</p>		</li>
