			<div class="markdown"><p>One plus to semi-auto sniper rifles: the shooter doesn't need to move his hand to reload, allowing for follow-up shots without losing aim while cycling. In WWII the Soviets were interested in developing a sniper variant of their SVT-40 semi-auto rifle for that reason, although the SVT-40 was not accurate enough to make a good sniper rifle and so the sniper variant was scrapped. </p>
<p><strong>edited to add:</strong> </p>
<p>A lot of replies.  First off, the Red Army must have believed the idea of a semi-auto sniper-rifle had merit, because even thought the SVT-40 sniper variant didn't perform adequately, they put the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragunov_sniper_rifle" target="_blank">Dragunov semi-auto sniper rifle</a> into service in 1963, and it can't suck too much because it has been in service ever since.</p>
<p>Second, the Soviets aren't the only ones who thought the idea had merit, because the US has developed several variants of the M14 designed for long-range/marksman/sniper use, as well as the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M39_Enhanced_Marksman_Rifle" target="_blank">M39</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M110_Semi-Automatic_Sniper_System" target="_blank">M110 semi-automatic sniper rifles</a>.  If semi-automatic sniper weapons were such a dumb idea, I doubt the US Army would be replacing their M24 bolt-action sniper weapons with the M110.</p>
<p>Third-- &quot;video-game snipers&quot;. I admit I'm no sniper, but I do own an SVT-40, as well as two Mosin-Nagants (one scoped).  Firing from a prone position or with a solid rest to support the weapon, it's not too hard to keep the target in the scope field of view firing the scoped Mosin. The SVT-40 (which fires the same round) has more manageable recoil than the Mosin, largely thanks to a good muzzle-brake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add as well: one minus to semi auto rifles is the ejecting casing. If your job is to get that one perfect shot and slip away, the last thing you want is a shiny piece of brass flung 20 feet or more up and away from your position.
Often times snipers will collect their spent casings in order to leave fewer traces of their presence. If that were part of the mission a semi auto would not be considered, no matter how accurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you can set certain semi autos to only fire one shot and not cycle the action. For example my sig 716 has a setting that essentially makes you manually cycle the action every shot. Not saying that's the best route, but it can be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a former U.S. Army sniper and I used an SR-25 semi auto as my primary sniper rifle in Iraq. Quick feeding and being more easy to shoot from alternate firing positions (because of lighter weight and less recoil) were important for me. Also, picking up casings always seemed like a waste of time. Once you've shot, you're known and it's time to leave. Casings left behind would compromise the future use of that hide, but reusing an unprotected hide you've shot from is lazy and dangerous imo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From his bigraphy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hathcock had pioneered using the .50 caliber machine gun as a sniper
weapon. The big gun's seven hundred-grain bullets offered a stable
trajectory for nearly three thousand yards, extending the sniper's range of
highly accurate fire well beyond two thousand yards, more than double the
capability of his .30-06 rifle. The .50's cyclic rate was slow enough to allow
for single shots with no difficulty. And, mounted on its T-and-E, a traversing
and elevating tripod that accurately adjusted the machine-gun's fire with
geared control knobs, the system served as a steady and finely tuned aiming
platform for the eight-power telescopic sight, which was necessary to
precisely train the gun on its distant targets.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not mentioned, but significant: the M2 fires from closed bolt, meaning it loads a round before the trigger is pulled.</p>
<p>Many machine guns sit open - good for cooling but not for first-round accuracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a single well placed round. Well, two if you count that he shot the bicycle that the person was riding first. Carlos Hathcock was one of the greatest snipers that the world has ever seen. He accomplished goals and set records that held for nearly 40 years, until technology caught up with his skill. As a Marine who has read his book. This is absolutely true. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In fairness, the two Canadians who initially beat his distance record were using Tac-50s, which are from the '80s. </p></div>		</li>
