			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, I'm not sure. Sorta just lost the will to live for a long time after a certain trauma happened to me and my body weight and caloric intake reflected that. I just couldn't physically stomach any large amounts of food without getting sick. I'm better now, but even today, though, my stomach heaves at the idea of large amounts of food. Thanksgiving can be really rough for me - feel like I'm gonna throw up just thinking about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im told its stress and anxiety which really effects my eating. Ive always been a fussy eater and over years i became a private eater because i became so self conscious when eating around people, so have always been really skinny but with increased trauma/stress/anxiety it spirals out of control to the point i can only swallow liquids. I always had times growing up where i got <strong>really</strong> sick and it made me almost scared of eating so i think that plays into it also.</p>
<p>I'm 99% sure its all psychological (had many physical checks) but im finding it impossible to find a solution and talking to doctors they just look at me like im crazy so that doesn't help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I was curious about what illness would cause that. My Aunt died of cancer and I remember a few months prior she was down to 80 pounds and extremely thin. </p></div>		</li>
