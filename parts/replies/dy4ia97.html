			<div class="markdown"><p>Growing up, my cousin could look at poison ivy and suffer an awful reaction. So, naturally, when he was being a jerk, I would chase him around the farm with it because I was never allergic. </p>
<p>Fast forward to my early twenties, I’m back on the farm visiting my family. We had a few (several) beers. I popped a squat to pee in the dark in the woods. I chose the wrong place because I felt plants hit my nether region as I dropped trou but the beer won out and I finished. </p>
<p>BIG mistake. A childhood of being a brat and chasing down my cousin with poison ivy slaked its revenge on my vulva. </p>
<p>Paradoxically, it was rather enjoyable when there was mild swelling and irritation but that didn’t last long before the gates of Hell released a demonic, oozing, angry rash all down my legs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can actually develop allergies to pollen if you snort it - it's mostly about detecting a foreign body that does damage.  That's why exposure in infants to things like nuts and pollen and bees can cause a lifelong allergic reaction - it actually impacts them and flips a bunch of signals saying there's a foreign threat, then they have those antibodies being restocked every time they get exposed in the future.  If you snort enough pollen to actually clog your sinuses or even result in a sinus infection then your body is just going to treat everything in the area it doesn't know is itself as a foreign threat and start pumping out antibodies to target it until it's eliminated.  It's not certain you'll get an allergy as a result (it might stop the source of infection first then just flush the pollen when the mucus is flowing again,) but it heavily increases the odds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the advice now is the keeping peanuts from children is why they get allergies to peanuts. So if you don't want a child to have an allergy to peanuts once they are out of the danger age small amounts of exposure are good. In fact small amounts of exposure is the closest thing we have to curing food allergies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh lord.  Your comment is painful to read.  I recently mowed a ton of grass around a bunch of oak trees, and my sinuses literally filled up with pollen.  It was the worst.  Even in the absence of an immune response, pollen can definitely be awful.  Allergy pills calmed down my body, but I had to use nasal spray for like a week.  Ugh.  Wouldn't recommend snorting pollen.</p></div>		</li>
