<p>If you wait to pay the balance when your currency is worth less than it was when you initially made the purchase, you effectively spent less money overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mortgage interest tax deduction too.  If you are able to deduct the interest paid then you don't pay taxes on that same amount of income.  In other words, if your max tax bracket is 25% then your effective interest rate is that amount less.  A 4% loan is really only 3% come tax time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Invest the money instead.  Where exactly your break-even point is obviously depends on the interest rate you get on the loan, but historically money invested in an S&amp;P or Total Market index fund will see an average return of ~7-8% per year.  Of course investments aren't guaranteed, and every decade will have a couple of years where the market drops 10, 20, or even 30%.  It always comes back if you wait it out, but it's definitely not wise to put money you might need in the near future into stocks -- there are money markets, Bonds, and CDs that will pay anywhere from 1-3% that work very will for money you might need sooner. </p>
<p>But for the sake of this example, let's say you want to buy a house for $150k and have exactly $150k in the bank.  After a 20% downpayment, the bank will offer you a $120k loan at 4% interest.  If you take out the loan and pay it off over the course of its full lifespan, you'll pay a total of around $210k (about $85-90k in interest) over the life of the loan.  That's a lot of money, and it's tempting to say &quot;Fuck it, I'll just pay cash.&quot;  </p>
<p>However, if you take out the loan and invest the remaining 120k cash in an index mutual fund that returns 7-8% each year (which, again, is what we should expect based on historic performance) and <strong>LEAVE IT THERE</strong> the entire life of your mortgage, then by the time you make your last loan payment 30 years from now, that $120k will have grown to between $900k-$1.2m.  </p>
<p>So you get a significantly larger return over the course of the loan, and best of all -- you still have control over that money.  If something comes up and you find yourself needing $10k to pay for medical bills, you can just sell some of your investments and pay them.  If you need to replace the roof on your house, you can just sell some of your investments and pay the roofers.  You have a pot of money that you can dip into on a rainy day and save yourself from having to use credit cards to borrow money at 16-24% interest, which provides the peace of mind that comes with having some semblance of financial security.  </p>
<p>Buying versus financing a smaller purchase like a car isn't quite as clear-cut.  For one thing, the time horizon is much shorter.  Statistically speaking, there's a pretty good chance that the market will wind up negative or even over 5 years.  Furthermore, something like a car, boat, computer, or television depreciates very quickly -- to the point that you're almost guaranteed to find yourself owing more than the item is worth after a few months to a year.  The same phenomenon happens with houses at first, but their value typically stays the same or increases as time goes on; not the same for that 2018 Fiesta you just financed for $16k at 9.7%.  </p>
<p>If you can get a zero or near-zero percent interest rate on a smaller item, it makes sense.  But you're much better off borrowing as little as you can on things that are going to depreciate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think for most people a more likely outcome may be that you are able to pay for an emergency out of pocket vs. having to use a credit card which may come out much further ahead essentially paying the low car loan interest vs. the high credit card interest. </p></div>		</li>
