<p>The US is super close to Canada. Canada follows the English monarchy and is very close to the UK. Makes sense the US would be close to the UK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point of Order: Canada follows the Canadian monarch, the Queen of Canada, with a separate hat and scepter and all. It just so happens that the person who holds that role <em>also</em> happens to be the Queen of England and lives over there.</p>
<p>Changing the rules for succession gets to be tricky because all of the governments have to do so at the same time. If the monarch were to die in the middle of the process where some had passed the appropriate legislation and others had not it would be very strange what happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even though we (the UK) are close to Canada in terms of relations, it's such a small country on the international scale that most Brits consider Canada to the US like Belgium to France. As a country, it doesn't really get involved in international affairs. (NATO/EU is headquartered in Brussels, but Belgium as a country isn't considered a big player.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add in CANZUK and it's crazy dude. Unprecedented global power IMO. Here you have several wealthy countries all speaking the same language with military installations all over the globe, using similar military structure, with the size and scope to basically handle any conflict short of World War 3.</p></div>		</li>
