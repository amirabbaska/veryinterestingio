			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Single-cell organisms evolve relatively quickly, and our persistent use of hand sanitizer and not finishing antibiotic treatments are able to affect microscopic species over thousands of their generations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure there's no concern over hand sanitizer, as it kills pretty much all microorganisms. Evolving a defense mechanism against it would be like humans evolving a defense mechanism against being shot in the head - there's very little chance to survive it and small changes typical of non-lethal mutations won't make it any higher.</p>
<p>With antibiotics it's completely different as they target specific proteins in the bacterial cell. This is why they can be specific to some species of bacteria, as their metabolism is quite diverse, and also why a small mutation in the protein can make the bacterium completely immune to the antibiotic. This is a great problem because we're overusing antibiotics, especially with factory farms feeding them to animals in high doses, which is cheaper than identifying sick animals - and it shouldn't be as it puts all of us at risk.</p></div>		</li>
