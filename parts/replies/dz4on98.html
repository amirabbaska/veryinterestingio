			<div class="markdown"><p>The example I've always given at talks has been that DNA is the master set of blueprints - they cover every detail of the building process, but they're valuable and secure.</p>
<p>RNA is like a copy of a specific section of the blueprints, the copies handed out to workers.</p>
<p>The building itself, of course, is the cell.</p>
<p>I do like this description, though, because it makes the &quot;copies&quot; idea much more clear!</p></div>		</li>
