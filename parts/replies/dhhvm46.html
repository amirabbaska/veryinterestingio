			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on where you consider the &quot;self&quot; to be, you may consider a head transplant to be a brain transplant by inclusion. I saw a Ted talk about upcoming head transplant possibilities. </p>
<p>However, I personally would call it an entire body transplant, and that the person is the head. Also because it comes with a bunch of other stuff, it's not really a &quot;brain transplant&quot;, although it does involve connecting the brain stem to a new nervous system. </p></div>		</li>
