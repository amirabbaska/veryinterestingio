It has taken millions of years for humans to develop facial recognition skills amongst our own close community. We are only hundreds of years mixing with Asian cultures and we have not adopted those skills accordingly. So I think it is unlikely that a genetic defect will be accompanied by a facial recognition sub routine.</p></div>		</li>
