			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I honestly dont know why this is the top answer lol. Not to bag on you or anything, but thats def not the reason why. SSDs are actually sold in nice round increments as well, I just recently bought a 500gb SSD. The reason why its not a power of 2 like itbshould be is because.. well it WAS a power of 2 I.e. if you bought 500gb ssd then it was probably 512gb, its just that the manufacturer uses some of the memory on the drive to store management information to help the drive run better/faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit of a tangent, but why can't you use a variant of RAM for permanent storage nowadays? Getting 32 or 64 GB of RAM in a daily machine is very doable right now - why can't we start using it for permanent storage once it gets to 128 - 256 GB? Is RAM fast <em>because</em> it's so volatile? Like, is the reason it operates so quickly directly tied into its inability to store data long-term?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a direct cause-effect relationship, but so far we haven't come up with memory that is both fast and non-volatile.  For system memory we want the absolute fastest memory we can get, and that memory happens to be volatile. </p>
<p>That said, though, there have been various attempts at using RAM for longer-term data storage.  The simplest is just to make a RAM Disk, which is a software construct that mounts a file system on your computer where the contents of that file system are always stored in RAM (and perhaps stored on a hard drive for when the computer turns off).  For programs that are constrained by how fast they can read data this can be a good tool, although of course you still have to get the data into RAM in the first place.  This is mostly for programs that have a lot of back-and-forth to disk, where you don't want to re-write the program to work out of a larger amount of RAM than it was originally envisioned for.</p>
<p>Another approach is to actually mount RAM modules on a PCI card and use that as a disk.  I haven't seen one of these in a long time.  They would often even come with a specific power port so that the RAM could store the data while the rest of the computer is turned off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting, thanks for the reply. </p>
<p>I guess it's just one of those things... although to be honest, I don't think faster storage would benefit users very much anymore. I can only speak as a user who games a lot, but my load times are already very short, and my games never seem to have issues with grabbing textures or what I assume to be other storage-heavy files. </p>
<p>The only thing that could really be improved significantly for me are transfer times between drives. Perhaps for more content-based users that retrieve a lot of large files on a regular basis, faster storage would be useful.</p></div>		</li>
