			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-70_(synchrotron\)" target="_blank">proton accelerator he was working at</a> launched a beam consisting of packets of 1.7*10^13 protons spaced 10s apart, each having an energy of 76 GeV (or a speed of 0.99993c). That is 10 million million particles every ten seconds! This massive scale gives you a good idea of how minuscule the effect of one single high energy particle can be. If such an intense beam would only cut a small hole through you, one single particle would be effectively imperceptible barring some localized molecular damage. </p>

<p>There was virtually no damage to his intellectual capacity, but the fatigue of mental work increased markedly.[2] Bugorski completely lost hearing in the left ear and only a constant, unpleasant internal noise remained. The left half of his face was paralyzed due to the destruction of nerves.[1] He was able to function well, except for the fact that he had occasional complex partial seizures and rare tonic-clonic seizures.</p>

<p>Which are thought to be iron cores traveling at relativistic speeds. A single one has the equivalent kinetic energy to a baseball traveling at 58 mph. However, since its a single nuclei it lacks the momentum of the larger object. You would not even feel it.</p>
