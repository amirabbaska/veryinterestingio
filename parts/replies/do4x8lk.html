			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean to sound confrontational, but this is a specious argument. Pitch has nothing to do with the slope of an audio signal. Pitch is a synonym for frequency, which is a measure of how many complete cycles of the audio signal are completed in a given unit of time.</p>
<p>The maximum slope of the signals is affected not only by pitch (frequency), but also volume (intensity), as well as the presence of harmonic overtones, which could change the shape of the signal from sinusoidal to a polygonal waveform of nearly arbitrary steepness. For example, a faint 400 Hz sine wave will have a lower maximum slope but a higher pitch than a loud 300 Hz sine wave.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that these low-res ascii renditions unintentionally and incorrectly depict the wave transforming from a somewhat rounded and possibly sinusoidal signal to a sawtooth wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a triangle waveform, even.</p>
<p>And I figured it was pretty obvious that he was trying to simulate increased frequency of the waveform by tightening the cycles, although it looks confusing because increased or decreased frequency would not show itself like that if illustrated properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. What background do you have in audio-engineering or similar?</p>
<p>Increasing the speed increases the frequency which the human ear perceives as pitch. The slope is zero almost everywhere in a square wave, which has a nonzero pitch.</p>
<p>This alone disproves your shaky explanation. Furthermore, stretching time keeps the derivative of a square wave still zero, yet pitch, (literally test this on your computer) increases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact: derivative of square wave is not actually zero. It's a bunch of impulses. Impulses interestingly have infinite amplitude and (approaching) zero width. But the area under the impulse (despite the width being zero), is actually equal to the amplitude of the square wave from memory. If my square wave had 1 amplitude, I'd have 1 unit squared under my impulse, as implied by the fundamental thereom of calculus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. Technically, for a square wave, the derivative is simply not defined at those certain points. We can talk about impulses in a justified manner only when we consider a sequence of functions that converge to a square wave. </p>
<p>This is because an impulse does not act as a real-valued function, although we can define it as a distribution or measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost everywhere, but not on average.</p>
<p>Ultimately, pitch is a non-scientific term made up by musicians for PERCEIVED sound.  As far as I can tell, that term goes back centuries, long before oscilloscopes and such.  So, until I see a better explanation of the origin of the term, I'm going to assume they made it up centuries ago based on seeing waves in water and comparing the slopes to pitched roofs, or something like that.</p>
<p>The fact that the (angular sense of) pitch MOSTLY correlates with frequency, for a certain type and volume of sound seems accurate enough for an ELI5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also very wrong.</p>
<p>The slope is zero almost everywhere and on average by the integral definition. Also, there is a precise mathematical definition of almost everywhere. Look it up.</p>
<p>You don't know what you are talking about. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>The term is by coincidence similar to pitch as a sloping roof. Take any other language but English and you will see.</p>
<p>From wikipedia: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pitch may be quantified as a frequency, but pitch is not a purely objective physical property; it is a subjective psychoacoustical attribute of sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The closest we can get to defining pitch is frequency, as this is what our brains decode and encode as pitch. Nowhere in the world will you see anyone credible describe pitch as pertaining to the slop.</p></div>		</li>
