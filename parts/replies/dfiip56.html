			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does. Reflection is absorption and re-emissions of photons by electrons. When an electron absorbs a photon, it is pushed to a higher energy state, which is what excitement is. It then relaxes and gives off a photon. The only difference between reflection and absorption is that the photon given off in reflection is the same wavelength and maintains coherence (amplitude is reduced), whereas an absorbed photon's energy is radiated off as lower energy photons that don't maintain coherence (thermal radiation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's scattering isn't it? Which doesn't involve electronic absorption.</p>
<p>If it were caused by absorption, then you would require a separate excited state for every wavelength of reflected light, and as we both know, electronic excited states are quantized, so only certain wavelengths could be reflected</p>
<p>As well as this, how do you explain reflections on glass or water when these substances don't absorb (barely) in the visible region of the spectrum?</p></div>		</li>
