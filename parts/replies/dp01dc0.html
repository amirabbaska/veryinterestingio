			<div class="markdown"><p>Add white vinegar to the rinse cycle, or dampen a washcloth with vinegar and use it as a dryer sheet. Works like a charm, the smell goes away as the clothes dry, and it doesn't affect the absorbency. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It leaves a terrible residue on cloth to make it “soft”. It’s a skin irritant, the fist thing any good dermatologist tells you to avoid. Stuff needs to go away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vinegar. Nothing fancy, just white and cheap. If you have a big build up  wash them in pretty hot water and put vinegar in the softener compartment, then when finished wash them again, hot water not needed as you've already done the germy things said to be killed by hot water alone, and put vinegar in both the washing powder/liquid and fabric softener dispensers.  If you have build up from many years, put an extra cup or so in your second wash. Good as new, don't worry, you may smell vinegar when you lift them out but won't smell a thing by the time they're dry.  If you have very hard water, add a small handful of borax or epsom salts to your final deep rinse for a bit of softness. If you like smelly, add a FEW drops of the essential oil of your choice at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but what does that actually mean? How do you “account” for fabric softener? Has OP measured the exact amount of absorption difference between using fabric softener and not, and subtracted it from his calculations?</p>
<p>More likely OP is just saying “even when I don’t use fabric softener on this specific load,” but that doesn’t mean fabric softener isn’t still getting on the towels.</p></div>		</li>
