			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to piggyback on your comment to get at the bigger issue behind these issues which has to do with on-demand power and peaks/valleys in grid requirements.</p>
<p>Until we reach a point that battery storage is MUCH better (or we change from a fixed price consumer electric model, which is another issue entirely) it costs us all MORE money (and more carbon emissions) to move to renewable energy.</p>
<p>Because we can't store electricity very well at the moment, electric companies work on a model where they have to forecast usage and attempt to meet it with electricity they produce.  The less variability over time there is in this forecast, the better for everybody.  Nuclear and coal power (nuclear being of course cleaner but also slower to react) are not particularly responsive, but provide constant heat to water, which produces steam to turn turbines and generate power.  When more power is needed than whatever the base, constant usage in the forecast is, natural gas is used to quickly add more heat and produce more power.</p>
<p>When people attempt to use solar or wind power to decrease load on the grid, power plants have to respond by generating less power.  Unfortunately though, solar/wind users still want to have power at the plug at night or when it's not windy (any time they arent producing power) which makes spikes in the forecast for grid requirements.  This makes power companies pay more money (and produce more emissions) for faster, less efficient fuels during off-peak hours.   The monetary cost of this is then passed on to people using renewable energy (taxes to pay the difference in the cost of coal vs natural gas to pay for these spikes) and also a carbon emissions cost that is paid by everybody by way of increased pollution.</p>
<p>There are only two real answers to this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everybody goes to nuclear power.  This is a slow to react, but efficient fuel with low carbon footprint.  It's only really viable if the load on the grid is more or less constant.</li>
<li>De-regularization on the cost of power for consumers.  Right now, since power is a utility, all companies must sell it to you at the same cost regardless of your usage pattern.  This doesn't match their energy generation model.  If everyone is willing to pay for electricity at the current cost of generation, which may change by the minute, this model could change.</li>
<li>There is a third option which comes from advancing technologies.  If batteries become much better to the extent that you can store 600-700% (guesstimate) of daily usage, then individuals can remove themselves from the grid entirely.  This would also allow power companies to more effectively plan for peaks and valleys in power usage and generate power at a more constant rate as described in point one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Electricity is really a complicated problem that not very many people grasp.  It seems like a great idea to go buy a powerwall and solar shingles, but the effect is causing more variability on the grid which kind of undoes all the environmental and cost benefits people think they are generating.  The big picture of power is just more complicated.  Environmentally-minded and cost-minded people are better off to try to keep their usage constant and minimal to have the best outcomes for everybody.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Power utilities most certainly do not charge you the same cost regardless of usage pattern.  There are on peak and off peak billing rates.  With solar you generate electricity when it is at its most expensive (during the day) and &quot;buy it back&quot; from the grid when it's at its cheapest (at night).  Net-metering might not be everywhere though, it's certainly a thing in sunny California in Edison territory.</p>

<p>Until battery technology increases to the point where we can hold exponentially more energy, we have to live with having peak / on demand batteries which go a long ways to eat the cost of electricity.  Are you spinning up something that takes a lot of juice?  Better to pull from the battery first and not the grid.  The initial power up of stuff is what costs the most electricity, not the long term running of it where the power demand is less than peak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't saying that prices are uniform at all times for consumers, only that there is a cap on what companies can charge at a given time and that the usage rates are based on end user averages not on individual households.</p>
<p>I agree with your second point on batteries entirely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In California, the price of electricity becomes negative during the day as solar generation peaks and outpaces demand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard of 3D batteries that don't use any liquid to store electricity but instead a 3D structure. Supposedly those batteries charge faster, store more energy and don't explode.

			<div class="markdown"><p>We'll see about that project. It seems like an elegant solution to the need for distributing solar panels all over the place, but we're taking steps in the right direction without it. </p>
<p>Every obstacle I mentioned, political, economic, distribution, consistency, are all lessened for installations spread out across many owners/buildings/properties. And so we're making constant and significant progress towards power coming from decentralized solar panels. If Elon Musk comes up with a design/production process that makes it all cheaper, easier to install, and more efficient that won't hurt either, of course. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Gigafactory in Sparks, NV is closer to OPs idea than the solar roof, and also addresses much of the obstacles  described, since it is also producing a means of storing energy.</p>
<p>The  solar roof is more about aesthetics than production.  I still don't know how much they will produce compared to conventional panels.  </p>
<p>I used to work sales for SolarCity, and you'd be surprised how many people will pay an $800 a month PG&amp;E bill before putting those &quot;ugly&quot; panels on their pretty, Spanish tile roofs.</p></div>		</li>
