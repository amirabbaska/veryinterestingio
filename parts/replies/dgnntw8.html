			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm on the alcohol killing you. When I tried to cold turkey I wound up in the hospital from collapsing outside my place from a seizure. One of my neighbors saw and called an ambulance and I spent the next week in the hospital under heavy medication and constant medical watch. After that I was given the option to go to the detox center which I did, and I have to tell you that was probably the hardest month of my life.</p>
<p>Of course like a lot of addicts I'm back drinking again but what can ya do. The only good thing is that I'm not drinking nearly as much as I was... still way more than any person should, but probably only 15-20% as much as I used to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad you made it through that!  Addiction is a real bitch, been smoking the butts since I was in my teens, and theyâ€™ve got me under their spell big time.  I hope you and I can both beat our demons at some point, but trying is the most important part, good luck to you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that alcohol is definitely more dangerous but although weed won't kill you it can lead to drug induced psychosis.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't doubt this.  I know a guy that doesn't smoke because he loses his marbles completely when he has tried it.  I got to witness the effects on him and he was in really tough shape, major anxiety attack.  </p>
<p>This is pretty rare and probably exacerbated an existing condition, in that it is not safe for everyone.  Alcohol, it could be argued, is unsafe for everyone, in that it can kill you.</p></div>		</li>
