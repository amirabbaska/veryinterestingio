			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious answer: blind people have friends, including sighted friends. They take the sighted person's arm just <del>below</del> above the elbow <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Walk-With-a-Blind-Person" target="_blank">like this</a> and go for a walk. The two converse about what's around -- what's dangerous, what's ambiguous, etc.</p>
<p>In the case that the blind person doesn't have a sighted person capable of helping (new to town, etc.), there are social services that can also assist a blind person becoming familiar with his or her surroundings.</p>
<p><em>Edited</em> to change &quot;below&quot; to &quot;above.&quot; Not sure how I got that wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually very interesting. I never thought they'd be talking about the environment around them as they walk. I honestly thought it'd just be another normal, everyday conversation that you and I might have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think most blind people were not born blind and can visually map out their local area in their mind after a few assisted trips. For blind from birth people then that is a question I would like to ask them too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure of the data on % blind from birth vs % going blind, I myself am going blind after almost thirty years of being able to use my eyes to navigate and have been learning to use a white cane. My orientation and mobility instructor has had me do exercises such as mapping a room and a city block with a blindfold on and it can be a slow process for me, but I've also been out with some completely blind friends and they get around in new places with only a white cane extremely efficiently. </p>
<p>Using a combination of feedback from the cane, audio cues (cars going by, foot step sound as you walk by an open door, etc.) and just keeping a sense of direction (hard for me without vision) blind persons can navigate new areas fairly safely without assistance. It also helps as far as traffic goes that the white cane is made to be as visibly noticeable as possible and we are trained to hold it when waiting at a curb in a way that is highly visible to approaching cars. </p>
<p>If you ever have questions head over to /r/blind and ask! It's a small community but friendly!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they just have to figure it out.  There was a house where blind people lived during the summers where I went to college.  They would go on long walks together I'm assuming to get the lay of the land.</p>
<p>If heard the hardest thing learning to function being blind is that people always want to help you not run into things, when in reality that's what you have to do to learn. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In college there was a blind kid in my class. He had a seeing eye dog that actually was trained to take him where he asked on campus. He'd say the name of the building and the dog would take him there. But when the dog was wrong, he'd flip the fuck out, &quot;Quasar, I said the dining hall, not the science building! Fuck!&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a bus with a woman who had a seeing eye dog that laid on the ground at her feet. Without fail, the dog seemed to know when to stand up without even looking out the window. A couple times she had to tell him to wait because we were stuck in traffic at the light or they were going somewhere else first. I have big respect for both of them! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooooooh holy shit so the dogs <em>don't</em> know whether the light is green or red, it's the person that issues the command to stop or go at crossings? :O</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the person issues the command to go. Usually they rely on the change in sound of the traffic lights when they're green, but in cases where the surroundings are too noisy to hear the sound change clearly, they rely on asking passerbys if it is safe to cross. </p></div>		</li>
