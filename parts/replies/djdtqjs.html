			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever been walking through some tallish grass and you find yourself jumping back reactively without realizing why, only to find there's a snake slithering away? I used to have a garter snake family living outside of one of my places, and I never got used to them slithering around the yard. I would stop jumping/reacting once I consciously realize there's a snake there (I like snakes), but anecdotally, there certainly seems to be some instinctual, subconscious processing going on for those type of things.</p></div>		</li>
