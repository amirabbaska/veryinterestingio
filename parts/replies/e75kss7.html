			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I found surprising as I ventured into backyard astronomy is that most of the cool stuff you see photos of isn't actually too small to see with the naked eye, it's just too dim.  Andromeda is the size of the Moon.  It's so large that I have to use a lower power eyepiece just to see all of it.  Yet on all but the clearest nights, you can't see any of it without at least a pair of binoculars.</p>
<p>Someone asked me recently if anybody in history ever saw a nebula and thought it was a star. The answer is no, because if a nebula was far enough away to look like a star, it would be too dim to see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't one of the stars in the Orion costellation not a star but a  nebula?</p>
<p>I was pretty sure the middle one of the sword of orion was a nebula... I may be totally wrong... Something i learned 15 years ago</p>
<p>I'll go check</p>
<p>Edit: i think i was right <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula" target="_blank">Orion Nebula </a> but i would happily hear an ELI5 correcting me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, it's the middle star of Orion's sword. The reason it's so bright is that the nebula is a stellar nursery (where new stars are born) and contains many young stars, most notably <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezium_Cluster" target="_blank">the trapezium</a> which is a cluster of very bright, young stars at the heart of the nebula that illuminates the whole thing.   </p>
<p>If you have sharp eyes, or a pair of binoculars, it's pretty easy to see that the nebula isn't just a point of light, but rather a big blurry mass containing many.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I know, the Orion Nebula down between his knees is one of the brightest deep-space-objects in the sky and can easily be seen even in light polluted skies (I can make it out in downtown Seattle), but you’d never mistake it for a star. It’s a smudge. </p>
<p>Is that what you were thinking of?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in my airsoft days one of the games we attended had dude's from the military playing. I was on night shift and one of them let me use his night vision goggles. The coolest thing about using them was looking up at sky and seeing all these stars I'd never been able to before. There are so many more than what the naked eye can pick up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were they legit gas tube light-amp goggles and not infrared? If so, yeah there are a ton of stars you can't see.  Even just pointing a pair of binoculars up will show you a few since in addition to making things bigger, they also effectively increase the size of your pupils to the diameter of the front optic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first time doing night driving with the NVG's was the same thing. It was already low light in the jungle and then I looked up, saw the Milky Way band for the first time. Waiting for our turn most guys were trying to play cornhole with the goggles on, I couldn't stop looking up. </p></div>		</li>
