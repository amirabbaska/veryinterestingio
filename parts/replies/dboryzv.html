<p>He used to say, &quot;Aunt UsedToBeHot, see that little girl over there? She makes me freezing.&quot; </p>
<p>I told him I didn't understand what he was saying. It was 90 degrees outside. How could you be freezing?</p>
<p>When the little girl walked past, he said, &quot;See!  She makes me freezing.&quot; He had goose bumps all over his arms. So cute!</p></div>		</li>
