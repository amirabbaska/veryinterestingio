			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.... It really depends on the nature of the law suit. If I was being sued because my dog bit a child at my residence, my house insurance would cover me up until what ever my coverage is. Then at that point I would be responsible for the remainder. It also depends on your assets and their value. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You mean the obligation dies with the bankruptcy? So even if the person wins the lottery 2 weeks later they're in no obligation to pay?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends on what you got sued for.</p>
<p>The rough EL5 rule of thumb is if you did the thing you got sued for on purpose bankruptcy doesn't help, if you did it on accident it does.</p>
<p>I can avoid paying the guy who slipped on my wet sidewalk by going bankrupt.  I cannot avoid paying the guy I pushed to the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One nitpick on the &quot;Debts due to civil lawsuits don't survive bankruptcy&quot; bit: if you are sued for fraud, embezzlement, or certain malicious acts and lose, that judgment against you will probably not be discharged in bankruptcy.  Your creditor will still be able to garnish any wages you earn or seize any (non-exempt) property you acquire until the judgment is either paid or expires by operation of law (usually after 10-20 years).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are <em>criminal acts</em>. Monetary judgements related to those subjects could result from <em>criminal lawsuits/charges</em>, i.e. &quot;you are sentenced to 3 years in federal prison, and also you have to give the stolen money back&quot;.</p>
<p>You might be right about some civil judgements related to those acts not being discharged, but it seems they often <em>wouldn't be civil</em> judgements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they are civil judgments.  If I punched you in the face, I'd face criminal charges for assault and battery.  But even if convicted and sent to prison, you wouldn't get any money out of that.  You'd need to file a civil lawsuit against me for that.  </p>
<p>Think about the OJ Simpson trials.  Remember, there were two.  He was found not guilty in the criminal trial but liable in the civil trial.</p></div>		</li>
