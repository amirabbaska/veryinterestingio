<p>Dude, if they made a whole line? like &quot;The Galaxy S5 Amp&quot; or something i think it would sell pretty good, especially with a way better battery?  Clearly im not the only one wanting something like that lmao.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they're set in a path of phones getting thinner and thinner.</p>
<p>If they make a phone that's even 0.5mm thicker, people will be all over it and screaming bloody murder about how APPLE/SAMSUNG IS MAKING PHONES BIGGER NOW!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they don't sell as well.  Phones are used by pretty much everyone, so just because you may want a high capacity phone doesn't mean most people do </p></div>		</li>

<p>This of course will never happen. The reason it won't is that nobody in the design field is even willing to propose an aftermarket battery that makes the phone so heavy and large. It's not &quot;sexy.&quot; These people seem to be in an arms race to drive the phone to thinner and thinner dimensions. I couldn't care less about having a phone the thickness of an ordinary pencil; I just want to be able to go off-grid for a few days and not have to worry about charging.</p>

<p>Mophie makes pretty much exactly that.  It's as thick as an otterbox case but with a battery built into it.</p>
<p>The problem is they don't release the current model until 7-8 months <em>after</em> the phone is released.  They were also iphone exclusive for a while, and just recently branched out into models for the Galaxy S6 and S7.</p>
<p>Oh, and they're also expensive as fuck.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but due to my job and hobbies I have a lot of &quot;non-normal&quot; days where I actually have to charge the phone during the day to make it to the end of the day: the screen is on a lot or the phone is searching for service all the time because I'm in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>Shouldn't you be able to turn that off somehow? </p></div>		</li>
