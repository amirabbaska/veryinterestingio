<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>George Malcolm Stratton (September 26, 1865 â€“ October 8, 1957) was a psychologist who pioneered the study of perception in vision by wearing special glasses which inverted images up and down and left and right. He studied under one of the founders of modern psychology, Wilhelm Wundt, and started one of the first experimental psychology labs in America, at the University of California, Berkeley. </p>
<p>Stratton went on to become a first-generation experimentalist in psychology. Wundt's lab in Leipzig, with experimental programs bringing together the fields of evolutionary biology, sensory physiology and nervous-system studies, was a part of the career of most of the first generation.[56] It was the exposure there, added to the graduate work at Yale, that influenced Stratton into becoming a psychologist.[39] It was there that he started his binocular vision experiments as well. In these experiments, he found himself adapting to the new perception of the environment over a few days, after inverting the images his eyes saw on a regular basis. For this, he wore a set of glasses inverting images both upside-down and left-right. Stratton wore these glasses over his right eye and covered the left with a patch during the day, and slept blindfolded at night. Initial movement was clumsy, but adjusting to the new environment took only a few days.[57]</p>
<p>Stratton tried variations of the experiment over the next few years. First he wore the glasses for eight days, back at Berkeley. The first day he was nauseated and the inverted landscape felt unreal, but by the second day just his own body position seemed strange, and by day seven, things felt normal. A sense of strangeness returned when the glasses were taken out though the world looked straight side up, and he found himself reaching out with the right hand when he should have used the left, and the other way around.[58] Then he tried the experiment outdoors. He also tried another experiment disrupting the mental link between touch and sight. There he wore a set of mirrors attached to a harness as shown in the figure allowing, and forcing, him to see his body from above. He found the senses adapted in a similar way over three days. His interpretation was that we build up an association between sight and touch by associational learning over a period of time.[59] During certain periods, the disconnect between vision and touch made him feel as if his body was not where his touch and proprioceptive feeling told him it was. This out-of-body experience, caused by an altered but normal sensory perception, vanished when he attended to the issue critically, focusing on the disconnect.[60]</p>

<p>You can read more on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Stratton" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>. One of the mechanisms thought to be in play is Neural Adaptation. On the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation" target="_blank">Wikipedia of Neural Adaptation</a> under History you can read more about Stratton and also how it applies to our other senses.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neural adaptation or sensory adaptation is a change over time in the responsiveness of the sensory system to a constant stimulus. It is usually experienced as a change in the stimulus.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 flips? Maybe he wants to know if the brain was being efficient about this compensation.  Whether or not the brain being forced to adapt quickly went with the first thing that worked (flip twice) and stuck with it, or if it realized no flips were necessary.  How long did that take?  </p></div>		</li>
