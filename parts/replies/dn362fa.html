			<div class="markdown"><p>For pro equipment it is just for durability and looser tolerance.  It is easier to deal with 1/4&quot; both in use and repair, than 3.5mm. There is Bantam in between 1/4&quot; and 1/8&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For line level applications you can use anything to  connect equipment as long as the contacts are made.  What you get with the standard connectors is ease of use, strength, safety and assurances that you've mafe the connection properly.</p>
<p>Many connectors have a locking component that ensures the connection will hold with reasonable strength.  Others are gendered so you arent able to connect improperly.  Others, especially multi-pin connections are extremely robust, with locking, gendered and shielded components so as to ensure your 36 or so individual signals are all properly connected and safe from a reasonable accident. </p>
<p>In the end, there is verly little that seperates the connectors on an electrical level.  It's mostly to help us flawed humans from fucking up expensive equipment or losing a critical connection is a critical moment, which happens anyway, despite the safeguards that have been designed.  </p></div>		</li>
