			<div class="markdown"><p>One correction to a good answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>increased water resistance from the high pressure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The viscosity of water doesn't change much with pressure -- in fact, it actually goes <em>down</em> with pressure until you hit a depth of about 1 km.  It does depend on <em>temperature</em>, though: viscosity in deep water is often somewhat higher than at the surface because deep water is cold.</p>
<p>But I don't know whether this actually matters to deep sea fish.</p>

<p>I'm a recreational fisherman and I knew the rest but that bit was an educated guess of mine. I should have learned not to do that by now, my bad. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would explode in the way shaken pop bottle &quot;explodes&quot; when you open it.  Except with fish guts.</p>
<p>Gases would be equally dispersed in the fluids, and as they expand, they'd all grow bigger until the containers (skin, blood vessels, etc) ruptured.</p>
<p>Something with a lot of gas,  like a gas bladder would probably rupture violently.</p>
<p>Which makes me wonder how Star Trek dealt with different air pressures on the planets and ships they teleported to...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, not quite.  If something is born and raised at the bottom of the sea, the fluids inside its body are going to be at the same pressure as the surrounding environment.  Similarly, animals on the surface did not &quot;evolve to survive&quot; at atmospheric pressure (as opposed to the near-zero pressure of space).  Their bodies are by default at that pressure.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Ok, take an empty balloon down to the bottom of the sea.  Start filling it with seawater then tie it up.  The balloon does not have to be incredibly strong to withstand the outside pressure, because the pressure of its contents are the same.  Same thing with a deep-sea fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fish is mostly made of water that is balanced at the same pressure as the water it lives in. Keep in mind that humans are capable of diving to depths that create pressures far in excess of the air we normally live in. The trick is that a scuba regulator delivers air at higher pressure depending on depth to balance the water pressure. Most of the limitations of scuba are gas pressure/chemistry limits rather than human physiological limits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do the same thing.  Every person on Earth has the weight of the atmosphere pushing on them at all times.  In fact, their statement regarding higher pressure life being pulled to the surface and dying is very similar to how we have to pressurize plane cabins.</p></div>		</li>
