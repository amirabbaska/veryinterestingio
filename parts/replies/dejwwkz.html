			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum Tunneling sounds like a real-life  &quot;cheat code&quot; to physical behaviors. Is there any chance that there's a way to induce the tunneling to happen more often? Like some not-yet-understood combination of variables can cause it to happen more often?</p>
<p>Can one even reliably find out if hidden variables account for a certain behavior at this scale?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like cheat code because it doesn't happen in our reference frame. We can't see macroscopic object quantum tunnel anywhere, so it's hard for us to imagine anything doing so, even subatomic particles. However, quantum tunneling is not a cheat code or something special, it is a natural phenomenon that seems to
be the result of the characteristics of these particles - they simply behave in ways that are not intuitive as long as you're substituting differently coloured and weighed balls for particles, because that's absolutely not how they particles behave.</p>
<p>Quantum tunneling is something that kind of emerges from the rules of quantum physics in general. It just seems like the basic nature of our universe is deeply probabilistic, rather than discrete and deterministic.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory" target="_blank">hidden variables</a>, that's kind of a thorny issue. Basically, there was a suggestion at one point that the probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics, and the corresponding behaviours observed in nature in quantum scale, could be explained by a sufficient amount of hidden variables, so naturally scientists started to look for these hidden variables and what they could be. However, this turned out to be a dead end, as something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_theorem" target="_blank">Bell's theorem</a> states that <em>no physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics.</em> It's quite theoretical and I won't pretend to fully understand it, but the basic idea is fairly clear.</p>
<p>Which means that, if we're talking about local hidden variables, there shouldn't be any that could influence the rate of quantum tunneling, because there shouldn't be any <em>in general</em>. We can influence the <em>known</em> variables, which is what you do by researching, experimenting, isolating different variables, and if you end up with different results with no explanation, then you start looking what exactly is the variable that could have caused it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good heavens, no, it would of course be the same 15 million degrees that it was in the Sun, so it would be radiating <em>quite</em> intensely. To be specific your living room would be a very non-living room on a short order. It would also, with the loss of gravitational containing pressure, immediately start to expand <em>very rapidly</em> and stop whatever fusion is going on. Not only that, but the intense radiation from this Sun-chunk would heat the surrounding matter as well, causing it too to expand in a very impressive fireball.</p>
<p>If we assume that a regular human is about 80 litres in volume, the human-sized chunk would now be almost 13 tons of hydrogen and helium plasma. The specific heat of plasmas behaves differently from regular matter, as the electron disassociation binds energy as well as the increase in kinetic energies (and rotations for Helium nuclei), so it's a bit hard to find accurate specific heat values at 15 million Kelvins temperature, but I guess using <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/hydrogen-d_976.html" target="_blank">specific heat of hydrogen gas at 6,000K temperature</a> will at least give a very crude lower value for the thermal energy bound in this human-sized chunk: It's about 20.96 kJ / kg K.</p>
<p>So that means the thermal energy in the human-sized chunk of Sun's core would be <em>at least</em>:</p>
<p>12,800 kg <em> 15,000,000 K </em> 20.96 kJ / kg*K = 4,024,320,000,000 kJ</p>
<p>The real figure would be significantly higher, because of the specific heat capacity doing wonky stuff at higher temperatures and increased electron disassociation levels, but that's the bare bones lower limit value right there.</p>
<p>Put into simpler units, it would be about 4.024x10^15 Joules, or four <em>petajoules</em>. By chance, the often used kiloton of TNT equivalency unit is about 4.184x10^12 Joules, so with a simple Fermi estimate we could say that you'd end up with <em>at least</em> an equivalent of a 1000 kiloton, or one megaton nuke's worth of energy in your living room, and this being a crude lower estimate it'd probably be considerably more, possibly by a magnitude or even more. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4tbOvKwZUw" target="_blank">Not what I would describe as a pleasant day. Please consider other subjects to teleport.</a></p>
<p>The reason for Sun being so hot at its core is, of course, that while the fusion reactions happening there are slow, they are continuous, and heat can only exit the Sun by radiating off from its surface. And it turns out that when the surface temperature is a meager 6,000 Kelvins or so, the Sun has reached a thermal equilibrium where the core produces exactly the same amount of energy through fusion as is radiating away from the surface, and also a gravitational equilibrium where the pressure exerted by the core's radiation is equal to the weight of each layer of the Sun. Well, not <em>exactly</em> the same amount since the Sun is slowly increasing its power as it goes through its hydrogen supply, but it's close enough to equilibrium that it makes no difference in human reference frame of time.</p></div>		</li>
