			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the most helpful answer I've seen so far, thank you. I never really thought of it that way. I always imagined every cell is trying to protect me but it's more so that the strongest humans with the most beneficial cells were the ones to reproduce</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you :)</p>
<p>I'd probably add: &quot;beneficial in most circumstances, and even then it's only beneficial for reproduction, and we also have to consider the net effect.&quot; Some animals are pretty much defenseless and so fragile, but they make up for it with high rates of reproduction, such that they survive up to now, e.g. bunnies. </p>
<p>So it's not that bunnies don't have any self defense mechanism because it (by itself) is beneficial.. they only manage to survive all this time because they breed so damn much ;) </p>
<p>However in this case our immune system <em>is</em> beneficial. Not all surviving traits are, is what I'm trying to say. </p>
<p>Cheers.</p></div>		</li>
