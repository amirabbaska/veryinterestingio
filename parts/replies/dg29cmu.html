			<div class="markdown"><p>In my case, closing my eyes, leaning on one side and forcefully relaxing my body has helped the most, even tricks of looking at the road don't help that much. I have to convince myself <em>I'm not there</em>. </p>
<p>Anyway I am sure nowadays if I was more physically active when I was little I wouldn't handle transportation this bad. I've read that dancing at a young age trains the vestibular apparatus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably doing the opposite thing from me then; I try to convince my organism that it is actually moving and not sitting in place, while you convince your self you're stationary. I'd probably be afraid of closing my eyes, I feel it would probably make me feel sick faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it make any difference to be riding shotgun vs going in the back seat? To me it does, back seat is a big no-no to me, I feel dizzy almost immediately (open window helps a lot though). But sitting in the front passenger seat makes things very different. I guess it's because I can see in front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's another thing that helps to me too. I can usually take about 30 minutes of driving before I get sick, and these kinds of things usually buy me like 10 minutes, by my estimate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait... Am I freak? So I take the bus to get around all the time. The only time I don't get motion sickness while reading is if I'm sitting sideways. I never get sick sitting sideways. I've been able to read on long 45 to 60 min trips as long as I grab a sideways seat. How to explain this?</p>
<p>I can't read sitting forward at all. Get sick very quickly. I hate the backwards facing seats cause I get sick even if I'm just sitting, not reading or doing anything. </p></div>		</li>

<p>the driver does not feel motion sickness, even when the other passengers might.</p>

<p>Like a small percentage of other lucky people... I get really bad motion sickness. And on very windy roads or even kinda windy roads at night... I get motion sickness when I drive.</p>
<p>Even had to stop once on a fucking motorcycle to get off the bike and puke.</p>
<p>My brain is an asshole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in a hilly area and then moved to somewhere flat. After years of being away, I visited home and learned the cruel fact that the driver can indeed get carsickness. I have no idea how I survived my childhood in that place!</p></div>		</li>
