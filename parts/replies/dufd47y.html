			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as you would expect they still developed agriculture, trade, and began to settle in larger groups pretty much like everywhere else. However, they still held tightly onto their traditions so they developed a unique culture. </p>
<p>The people I'm going to talk about are the Bantu, and although they mainly speak the same language they were not a single people. They formed into villages although there were tens of millions of them (I believe) around the time the Dutch started colonizing the Southern tip of Africa. So they were the main group dominating Southern Africa. </p>
<p>What's unique about them is how they balanced power with a sense of community. There were ruling families who claimed special lineages, and they held ruling power. Their customs and religions supported this power. Their power was not absolute though, and the people operated as a community trying to achieve success together. So despite Kings (I'll just use that since they essentially were) holding the power, they still adhered to these traditions which guided how they handled matters and disputes within their villages, and interacted with other villages. So essentially the Kings were accountable to customary traditions which dictated the limits of their power. None of this was written down anywhere, so it's hard to find a lot of concrete examples of exactly what this meant.  Selfishness was very frowned upon upon as well. These Kings mainly just solved disputes and we're the diplomats, but they didn't interfere with the day to day lives of their people. So they just had more of a sense of community as opposed to Europe, this was probably helped because they lived in smaller groups. Also, a person's age was what determined their function within the society, as well as gender (unless they were in the special lineages, but these people still worked like everyone else). Another interesting thing is how skilled these people were at hunting and fighting. Even though they didn't have guns, they had essentially reached the pinnacle of human achievement in terms of hunting with spears and bows. </p>
<p>I guess Shaka is an interesting example because he took over the Zulu tribe, and started his own version of that type of society. All boys around age 12 I believe were taught to battle and trained to be in the army. That was their job, just to fight. He was the first King who created a dedicated army. The women and men too old to fight took care of children, and managed the farms and livestock, and basically ran the society while the warriors spent their time conquering other groups to amass wealth (mostly in the form of cattle). </p>
<p>I hope that helps a bit. To be honest, I took the class a while ago, and don't remember a ton, so some of this might be a little off. As I said before, most of what is known about them is from early Dutch priests/colonists who initially interacted with them. I tried to do some quick research on Google but it's a little difficult to find stuff on the internet. If you're really curious I would just look stuff up about Bantu tribal life, the Zulu, Xhosa, and Shaka more specifically, as I said before. It is very interesting to think about what the future of these people would have been without European interference.</p></div>		</li>
