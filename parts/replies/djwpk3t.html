			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it's to do with trusting the client to make sure you're there and not attacking the system, and the ability to revoke that trust. When you use a normal reader the merchant has an account and their reader is trusted. When you use an ATM the device is also trusted.</p>
<p>The same can't be said of a web browser. Fake browsers from all over the world can be trying tens of times a second and the only thing the bank can do in defense is lock the user out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I could make your customers very angry simply by randomly trying account / passwords until they got locked out, from computers all around the world.</p>

<p>My old credit union's online banking portal had the &quot;enter username, then enter password&quot; double screens with the picture and code phrase displayed. It's been a few years ago now, so I can't remember exactly how I figured it out, but I realized that I could enter random account numbers and see someone's thumbnail and passphrase. I only did this once: I clicked &quot;forgot password&quot; and was told the password was reset with an email sent to the owner.</p>
<p>I think I figured it out because my own password was unexpectedly reset one day.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t bank with them anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To the other extreme, First Direct in the UK need your username, obscure security question and a 6 digit pin (which is generate on the mobile app which requires your password and a authenticated device) that has to be entered into the web browser within 30 seconds. </p>
<p>It can be a bit of a pain but gives a great sense of reassurance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be done well, though.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have login occur with password and 2FA as normal, but return a time-limited token which can be used for partial authorization in the future, such as by checking &quot;remember my computer&quot;, or by authentication happening in a mobile app.  The time-limited token is stored locally in a cookie or in browser storage or in whatever vault the platform provides for such things.</p>
</li>
<li>Next time a login occurs, the time-limited token is submit first and verified (rejected if incorrect or the time window has expired, obviously).  Upon this verification, the user is prompted for some other, simpler form of authentication - such as a PIN.  One or more incorrect attempts at using this PIN may result in the authentication token being revoked.  If they enter it correctly and complete the remaining 2FA steps, access granted, and a new token is generated and stored.</li>
