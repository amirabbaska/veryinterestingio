<p>&quot;The main source of fish are from fish farms as wild fish are nearly extinct. Time travelers keep going back to the 1900's when stocks were more plentiful to fish.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed! Lots to imagine- you'd have to be able to service whatever gear you brought using stuff available in the time period... no monofiliment, no spectra, no way to charge a battery, no landings to launch your modern boat... Fun to daydream</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thoughts exactly, thanks for articulating this.</p>
<p>People have no freaking idea how amazing the fisheries were before we ruined them. Populations of fish were absolutely monstrous, and the further you go back, the larger individual fish tended to be, simply because they weren't fished before they had the chance to grow old and huge.</p>
<p>I remember hearing this story from a lake ecologist from my area on the north shore of Lake Erie. Apparently once our region of Southern Ontario had been stripped of its biggest best trees (our region <em>still</em> has &lt;5% regional tree cover), people working on the shores of one of the larger rivers (maybe the Thames? I don't recall which) resorted to <em>pitchforking sturgeon</em> out of the river, drying them out, and <em>burning them for fuel</em> because they were so abundant. For reference, I've never even seen a sturgeon in Lake Erie... if they're still even present, the populations are very low.</p>
<p>It's actually quite frightening how much we've obliterated our wild fish stocks. We collapsed the cod, overhauled the Great Lakes aquatic ecosystems, thrown invasive fish species around the world... </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there actual fossil evidence that they grew that big, or are we going by historical accounts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about trout, but they're a close relative to salmon, and the salmon <em>Oncorhynchus rastrosus</em> from the Miocene was 9 feet long.  Go back a little further and you quickly see things like <em>Leedsichthys</em> in the Jurassic era, a 90 foot long rayed fin fish in the same phylum and class as trout and salmon.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be a big surprise.  Sturgeons split from the rayed fin fish in the Cretaceous era, and even today you can find sturgeons that are 20 feet long and weigh 2,000 pounds.</p></div>		</li>
