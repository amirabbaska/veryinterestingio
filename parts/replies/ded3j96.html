			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably both honestly. Although I guarantee I wouldn't realize I was in new hospital for a good 30 minutes after experiencing mild comatose inducement for extended periods. You don't usually even remember what is happening until 10 minutes after the mask comes off.</p></div>		</li>
