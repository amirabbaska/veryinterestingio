			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just listening to a podcast interview with Bill Burr who acted in Breaking Bad. He mentioned that, while the show was a &quot;critical darling&quot;, it was about to fold after a few seasons. It was a great show that not enough people were watching. Once they started streaming the initial seasons on Netflix, they were able to hook more viewers on the stuff and then have a reliable viewership.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'd never heard of it here in the UK and I only watched because it was on Netflix and I thought it would be cool to see Hal in something new.</p>
<p>I thought it was a film at first, then thought 'oh, it's a series, cool!'</p>
<p>It was already at the point where season one, and maybe two was on Netflix. Completely unheard of. But not soon after there it blew up and every man and his dog was talking about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really....its cable learning how to utilize Netflix to help themselves.  They had a show that was getting great reviews, but not enough people watching.  By it also being on Netflix, they gained a new audience that ended up making their way over to watch it on cable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, having a lot of people liking it does mean it makes money.  On A&amp;E, the 2nd top rated show was Longmire, but it was popular with an older audience, so it was cancelled because ad revenue for 60+ aged people is less than ad revenue for 18-35 aged people.  Netflix has a different business model that isn't ad based, and picked up Longmire after A &amp; E dumped it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! I know what you mean. My mom thinks all animation no matter what kind is stupid. Except for the 3D animation kind of movies like minions. </p>
<p>She is stubborn and wont give anything a chance really. I even tried to get her to watch some anime movies like Spirited Away or Howls Moving castle and nope. My aunt on the other hand tends to watch little cartoons every now and then with little kids because they want to watch it so she enjoyed those movies. </p>
<p>Just stinks how some people wont watch cartoons cause they feel its just for kids. Animation is one of the easier forms of entertainment that can do pretty much anything. The only limit is the artists imagination. Some of the stuff a cartoon/anime can pull off would cost millions/billions of dollars in CGI and stuff to pull off for a movie. And yet anime/cartoons can do it every episode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah that's too bad. I finally got my mom to give anime a chance and now she's hounding me for more and we have finished up about 11 shows together so far and she's even finding anime on her own (she picked out Rosario Plus Vampire and Death Note herself... Clearly I would not have picked that first one to show my mom if you are familiar with the show haha) I'm so proud. But she did actually admit to me that she really didn't think she would find the shows as compelling as she does but she figured since I've been into anime since I was very small she should at least give it a shot and now she's hooked! Once she got past the fact they were animated the stories sucked her right in. A lot more people would find something if they have it a shot, as you said the sky is the limit. I also find it much more visually pleasing when the special effects so to speak fit with the show; like it's easier to make nice looking fire magic that will fit and look nice in an animated show than it is to make cgi. So a daytime animation will have better looking magic than a real life tv show for the reasons that you mentioned, they can do it so much cheaper.</p>
<p>I'm also concerned when people assume cartoons=kids. I had to save my little cousin from seeing Attack on Titan (very violent and bloody show) because their mom saw the animation and was like &quot;kids show, should be good right?&quot; And then I showed her some clips... Yeah it's for kids if you want little Billy running from everyone over 5ft...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol, hey Billy come here and give your tall aunt a big kiss while she is playing with her dentures! &quot;AHHH!!&quot; lol</p>
<p>Yeah I avoided attack on titan for a while to keep off the hype train. I then started getting into it about a few months back. It's pretty good but im still waiting on the new seasons (whenever they get made) to make it out. (I will probably get hate on it like usual) I actually prefer the English Dubbed animes though. That's why my library is unfortunately a bit limited. I don't like having to look at the bottom of the screen then look up and see whats going on and miss out on half the stuff going on. </p>
<p>People always make the argument &quot;yeah but your missing out on so much dialog they cut from the show&quot; or &quot;they change it and cut it way to much when they make it into the English Dub&quot; but when I see movies like Redline and hear about the reviewers having to watch it a few times because they missed a few stuff (cause it's all very fast paced) cause they were busy reading what the characters were saying it kinda shows that you do miss out on stuff when having to try and read everything everyone says. </p>
<p>I kinda want to learn Japanese though so not only could I go visit Japan and have an easier time but also enjoy so many more anime's without having crapy text on the screen blocking stuff or distracting me. </p>
<p>That's one of the only problems with cartoons/animation. Even though its a lot cheaper then some really good CGI it still takes a long time to make each episode which I found out a lot time ago when doing some research and asking questions about why the cartoon Starwars: the &quot;Clone Wars&quot; was taking so long when they shows were only 5 minutes long. I then heard from my art teacher at the time that with just one person doing each show by himself it would take like a few months or something if he worked 8 hours a day or something which he went through all the math and explanation etc. I forgot most of it by now but I understand the concept and don't want to try to explain it all here. :P</p>
<p>Also that's pretty funny. I know iv shown my aunt Spirited Away and Howls Moving Castle but idk if I would try any others cause most of them would be shows and I think the main thing with her is that she mainly just humors me a bit. She already saw those two (or only one of them) before hand cause my cousins had seen it either in the movie theater or on tv and she watched it with them.  She still seems interested in them but idk about showing her a show like Death Note (even though its one of my fav anime's). It's not like she visits very often or for very long. </p>
<p>But yeah my cousin wasn't much into animation but every now and then when I would go visit or stay over for a few days I would bring something like an anime with. The time before last I brought S-Cry-Ed and showed him most of that show. He seemed to really like it and looked online to watch the rest. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So great, though it's kinda funny that the thing people need to get over to enjoy it is that it's animated instead of that goddawful second intro theme.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I never understood this &quot;only for kids&quot; mentality -- especially in the West, where Bugs Bunny and all of his contemporaries were originally shown as part of the pre-show reel for moviegoers of <em>all ages</em>. Hell, if anything, modern &quot;reality&quot; TV has shown us that live action can be far, far more insipid and &quot;childish&quot; than your average animated media.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think it's cause most cartoons that came on tv back in the day was only in the morning for kids to watch before school or something. And that only kids usually watched it cause adults had to go to their job or focus on other things. A lot of adults didn't have time to sit down and watch cartoons in the morning they had to get stuff done. But that's only one guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, her loss really. My sister in law is the same - she does not watch anything fantasy ever. Matter of principle. </p>
<p>Not even remotely. She just does not understand that you can display real world problems in a fascinating and maybe better way when using a fantasy setting. She also does not understand that there is no fundamental difference between a story and a story with a fantasy setting - both are products of imagination.</p>
<p>She just thinks everything that has a fantasy element in it is shit. Stupid, but what can you do.</p></div>		</li>
