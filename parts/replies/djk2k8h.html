<p>No, the surface is not harder to break on a larger body of water regardless of displacement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do not. Objects with identical mass displace the same amount of water no matter the depth unless it reaches the steady state lowest point of said object, in which case it would rest on the bottom experiencing a normal force resulting in less water displaced, aka &quot;squatting&quot; less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another question I'd like to ask is if the content of the water (i.e. dissolved substances) affect surface tension, thereby affecting the height at which one can jump into said water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure why people think surface tension is the culprit here.</p>
<p>Water is not like a giant steel balloon where if you break through the surface, under it there's fluffy cushions.</p>
<p>When you break the surface you are still in contact with essentially non-compressible substance which can't easily get out of the way.</p></div>		</li>
