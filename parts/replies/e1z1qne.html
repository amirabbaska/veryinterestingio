			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what you're saying, but I think it is reasonable to suggest that the object that is accelerating is the one doing the slamming and the object that is carrying on at basically the same speed and trajectory is the one being slammed into.</p>
<p>Then again, we are egotistical animals, so I get why it would feel like we are being slammed against the ceiling and not like the ceiling is coming down on us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the idea is that if you fall into the plane, or stand up and hit your head, you are moving more slowly and imparting less force than when you're in effective free fall. When the collision is because of the plane itself bucking under the force of air turbulence, that force is greater and also a lot faster occuring than if you just bumped your head on the overhead bin bit from not ducking far enough.</p>
<p>So what you're saying is technically the more accurate statement, but I also get what the original poster was going for: their post makes it clear that the impact from a little turbulence isn't the same as just being a little clumsy on a plane, because the speed and force of the turbulence collision is more than the head-bump one, probably. </p>
<p>...maybe. I am not a physicist, just taking a stab at what op is going for. </p></div>		</li>

<p>you know that for the galilean laws of relativity + the laws of dinamics that doesn't make sense, right? you know, the every action has an equal opposite reaction stuff. if you're slamming against a wall at x speed is the same thing as if that wall slammed against you at x speed. if you're going at 'a' speed and the wall is going at 'b' speed then it's a-b=x</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>galileo galilei theorized relativity along with the famous ship story: Let's assume you fainted and then you woke up inside a perfect ship with no windows and a fish-tank right beside you; if the ship was moving at a perfectly constant speed you wouldn't be able to tell it, as the water in the fishtank would not move and you would not be able to experience any change in acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not certain. If the airplane moves faster downwards than you fall, wouldn't that be more damaging than you just falling from a low height onto the ceiling? It makes little difference what collides into what, but the speed involved would be different depending on the downward force. So it's a moot point whether you collide with the plane or the plane collides into you, but the change in velocity is fixed for the freefalling person, for the plane not so much due to aerodynamics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, but that's because slamming into a wall with certain force is not the same as just falling onto it. it's should be noted that the correct term I should use is momentum, because if an apricot hits you at a certain speed is much preferable than a coconut hutting you at that same speed, but, if the objects interacting with each other stay the same between different hits, then yeah the only difference is the speed at which you hit each other</p></div>		</li>
