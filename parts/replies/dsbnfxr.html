			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is no. Time dilation, thanks to acceleration, will change the real age of the universe from the different observers perspectives. That's what we mean by relativity. Anything going faster than another thing experiences time slower than the other. Note that being in a gravity well is essentially like being constantly accelerated toward the center of it.</p>
<p>When scientists say the universe is about 13.8 billion years old, they are using the Cosmic Background Radiation's perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer would differ, but people in an orbit around a black hole would take their orbit into account to correct for that. Without orbits around black holes or neutron stars the effect is negligible. Something like a few thousand years, while our uncertainty on the age is tens of millions of years.</p></div>		</li>
