<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" target="_blank">ATP</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide (also called a nucleoside triphosphate) and is a small molecule used in cells as a coenzyme. It is often referred to as the &quot;molecular unit of currency&quot; of intracellular energy transfer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sometimes question using topic-specific acronyms, and then not defining them, in a place designed to explain things to people who bring little-to-no knowledge of the subject in question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but spelling it out will only confuse the layperson more since its a fairly complicated sounding word </p>
<p>And anyway ATP is like high school level biology..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the point you're trying to make, but that's exactly what this sub is for: helping the layperson understand.  Using acronyms they won't understand doesn't help that process.</p>
<p>As for high school biology, not necessarily.  As I, and several others, have commented below, this was not covered in every high school.</p>
<p>It wasn't in mine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's in large part why I added my own answer below.  The effects of potassium and ATP, etc., are going to be pretty obvious to anyone with a chem background, but you're not supposed to need that in this sub.  Their answers are good, but I can imagine people's eyes glazing  over as they read them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These pumps are also the reason why the brain is so energy-hungry â€“ it consumes about twenty percent of the energy your whole body consumes while at rest! Because sodium and potassium ions are always gradually trickling back across the membrane, these pumps need to be running all the time, just to keep the neurons ready to fire, and that of course constantly consumes energy.</p></div>		</li>
