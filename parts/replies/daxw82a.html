			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact! Drugs with the last three letters of -mab are monoclonal antibodies. </p>
<p>I work with bevacizamab (and it's sister drugs) which is an antibody against a protein in our blood stream called VEGF. That protein causes blood vessel growth. We use it to suppress tumors (essentially starving them by cutting off their blood supply) or what I'm studying to treat a disease call wet or neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Excess blood vessels grow and leak blood that seeps into the retina causing blindness. This requires an injection of these antibodies every 4-8 weeks until it dries up. If you catch it quickly enough you can reverse the vision loss. </p></div>		</li>
