			<div class="markdown"><p>Say you wake up in the morning and have your morning pee, it will take most people about 40 minutes after consuming a fair amount of liquid to feel the need to pee again. Your kidneys work relatively quick in filtering your blood, considering you start absorbing in the upper GI, itâ€™s not uncommon to smell your coffee and such on your next pee after drinking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different nutrients are soluble at different places in your digestive tract. </p>
<p>I.e. you start digesting starches and sugars as soon as you put them in your mouth, but fats and proteins need to be broken down in your stomach first. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some foods have an impact on other foods once they are all thrown together in your stomach. </p>
<p>Calcium and iron will compete for uptake, so taking them separately is recommended. Conversely, taking vitamin C helps with up uptake of both when taken at the same time. </p>
<p>As for glycemic load, the amount of energy your body gets from food and when... mixing fibers, fats, proteins and other things will slow digestion of sugars. If you eat a whole meal and then some high-sugar dessert, there wont be a sugar spike from dessert and the energy will be delayed and last a lot longer. </p></div>		</li>
