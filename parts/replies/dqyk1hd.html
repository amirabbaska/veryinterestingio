			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess because cigarette smoke has a lot of suspended particles that aren't gases more shit clings to the walls. Educated guess cause I'm not 100% sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smoke (from cigarettes or other sources) are very fine solids, that are light enough to remain suspended in a gas, at least for a period of time. What's being referred to as &quot;smells&quot; are compounds that are in a gaseous form at atmospheric pressure. </p>
<p>Basically smoke is very tiny floating solids, whereas most &quot;smells&quot; are true gases. Smoke particles are much larger than gaseous compounds, and when they stick to a surface, they often slowly break down and release gases that our noses pick up as &quot;smells&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say a cigarette averages a gram( ignore the filter). You smoke it, you know how over a gram (conservation of matter and combustion reaction and all) of gases and particles in the air from one cigarette. For rotting food to give off a gram worth of gases is a significant amount of decomposition. But let's say the odor was from a dead animal. It might give off significantly more decomposition gases and also take longer to purge the odor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I had to guess, the particles are being actively dispersed by whatever micro-organisms are eating it. So even though the particles settle within a few minutes more are being constantly thrown into the air by the feeding. Tossing the source means that whenever the particles currently in the air settle they won't be replaced. </p></div>		</li>
