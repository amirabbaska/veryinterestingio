			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't quite understand, doesn't this contradict the theory above? If each black hole's conclusion was the start of a new universe, and they &quot;ended instantly,&quot; wouldn't some black holes have already ended in our current universe, leading to another big bang, which would end the current universe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time dilation means that time is different in different reference frames. This means that, theoretically, from the inside of a black hole, a person would experience time passing much faster than a person would from outside of the influence of the black hole. One second on the inside of a black hole could be equivalent to 1 billion years on the outside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is time is relevant.  From the perspective of the blackhole itself, it is <em>instantly</em> destroyed (bang) as soon as it is formed (crunch).  From a perspective outside the blackhole, nothing ever reaches the center of the blackhole before the universe &quot;ends&quot;.  Time flows at different rates depending on your reference frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that essentially no time passes at the horizon, but to witness this you'd have to hover at the horizon which isn't possible because it would require exceeding the speed of light. If you fall into the horizon you die pretty quick when you hit the singularity in the middle (also an unavoidable fate), so you won't witness the end of the black hole by going into it. </p>
<p>You can hover just outside the horizon and essentially time travel to the future (no coming back of course), but this does require you to survive pretty extreme acceleration from the hovering thrusters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The observation from beyond the event horizon was just hypothetical.  Basically it was to describe how black holes might last an instant from their perspective. I wasn't actually suggesting we could fly in like Coop from Interstellar.</p></div>		</li>
