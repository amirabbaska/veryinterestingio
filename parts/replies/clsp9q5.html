			<div class="markdown"><p>Were you panting when you heard the shirt hits the fan pretty soon? Thanks for the comments and the best of days to you. Your words made death a little bit easier to accept. Cool to know you haven't hit sock bottom. It's quite the lingerieing thought that people facing death are the saddest. Ok enough bad puns</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's easy to play with words because I'm not a native english speaking person. I'll cherish this moment for having maybe put on a little smile on cancerguys face. Too bad I don't have many more puns undie way. I hope that when the time comes, it won't be too scarfy and you'll feel that you've lined a good life. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, you can figure out who I am and where I live pretty easily, but I'm dying anyway, sooo....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This line is heartbreaking, no pun intended. It's written so nonchalantly which makes it probably the saddest thing I've seen in a long time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aww.  Here is an internet hug. </p>
<p>I'm not dead yet, and that's the important part.  You see those two little faces in those photos.  I got to hug them this morning.  That was awesome.</p>
<p>Now, truly heartbreaking:
My daughter came down the other day and said
&quot;Daddy, I love you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks honey, I love you too.&quot; I replied.</p>
<p>&quot;And daddy, I love you more than ANY other daddy in the world!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks.&quot; I said again.</p>
<p>&quot;And daddy...when you die and we get another daddy, I'll still love you more!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Urk.&quot; I said &quot;can you get Daddy his whiskey now, honey, he needs some...oh, and does mommy have a list somewhere?&quot;</p>
<p>:)  I hope this brought a smile along with the heartbreak.  And honestly, thank you for caring about an utter stranger.  We need hearts like yours in the world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking at all of your pictures and when I saw your kids I teared up. I lost my mom at ten to cancer and seeing someone with kids so young with a terminal diagnosis... Puts me at a loss for words. I'm sure your kids will have fond memories of you and you seem like a truly awesome dad and person. I don't know much about what terminal means for a time frame but I know your family will cherish every moment they have with you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your kids must be really, really proud :D</p>
<p>My dad used to talk about death lightly and like how we cannot take material possessions when we die, death cannot take the moments we lived and leave here.</p>
<p>Whaddyaknow? He was right.and I think your kids will really appreciate the awesomeness you're sharing.</p>
<p>So yeah, you're leaving a lot of good stuff for everyone here. Thank you. Take that reaper!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dude you're like Iron Man with cancer instead of bomb shrapnel.</p>
<p>If Tony Stark did it you can do it too. Also, fuck cancer!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do love the comparison though!  :)</p></div>		</li>
