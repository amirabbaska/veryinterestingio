			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey cheese, thanks for a nice block quote (hooray for context). </p>
<p>But I wanted to point out that there's a big difference between unreliable and inconclusive research findings. Which I think is often lost on the lay public.  </p>
<p>From your excerpt, the paper found, reliably, that reported positive effects were inconclusive. Generally, peer reviewed findings are taken to be reliable, but even a perfect study can find that there is no conclusive effect. </p>
<p>ie: three observers and a video camera give a very reliable account of 100 coin flips. But that experiment will not give us very conclusive results about which side the coin lands on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that is an important distinction to make, his statement is still true - there is no reliable research saying that it conclusively has a positive impact.</p>
<p>I didn't read the full study that was linked, but the conclusion seems fairly clear and splits it out into a few groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For old-age related skeletal cramps, it implies that the research supports the conclusion that there is no impact</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For pregnancy-associated rest cramps, the research is conflicting and further research is needed for any conclusive statements either positive or negative</p>
</li>
<li>For cramps related to exercise or disease there were no randomized controlled trials found, therefore there is a lack of any rigorous research into those claims at all so no conclusions can be drawn either positive or negative</li>
</ul>
<p>So for all 3 cases, there does not exist a body of research literature that supports the conclusive claim that there is any positive impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's completely true. And I don't doubt your veracity/understanding a bit. </p>
<p>I guess my point (which may be a bit off topic in this thread) is that the phrasing of your true statement </p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is no reliable research saying that it conclusively has a positive impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>got my 'anti-science spider sense' tingly. While true, it states a negative and on the surface makes the findings look unreliable.  Instead, we should say something like: </p>
<p>a reliable review of multiple previous studies found no conclusive positive impact of the treatment.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NCBI is an amazing resource for a huge variety of topics. I'm going into the field of bioinformatics and have been learning how to use databases through NCBI. The most interesting to me so far is being able to view the genomic sequence of any human gene. Best of all, it's free information to anyone who wants to view it. Simply amazing what we can do these days!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just human genes! Generally, any new gene, rna, or protein data has to be uploaded to a public database during the publication process. There is also a big push to get the raw data included (which should really help you bioinformatics guys compare different technologies) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny enough, we have no idea why we cramp.  Athletes and non-athletes cramp... Muscle biopsies and all kinds of studies have uncovered too many potential issues, or no issues at all in cramping muscles.  It's still a mystery</p></div>		</li>
