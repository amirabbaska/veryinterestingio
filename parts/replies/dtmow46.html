			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question.</p>
<p>Here is my advice - don't try to decide the rest of your life during your undergraduate career.  No one really knows exactly what they will be doing in 10 years, so it's rather difficult to plan for that.  </p>
<p>You seem to be doing the right things - undergraduate research is super useful, so keep doing that.  If you stick with a double major, that's cool - but don't kill yourself with that.  In the end it probably doesn't matter that you have a double major - it's more important to have a good understanding of math (even if you don't finish the double major).</p>
<p>Take other classes too.  I can't say enough about courses like Art or music.  Seriously - taking a variety of classes is what helps in ways you couldn't predict.</p>
<p>For me, I think research is interesting - but it takes a lot of time.  In this stage of my life, I am very happy to be communicated about science and doing small projects for my blog.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the advice! I’ve already been incorporating arts and music into my many projects. I really love that stuff and was into that well before maths/physics. A lot of the stuff I do currently has some type of 3D printing aspect to it. As a result I’ve grown to love the CAD modeling aspect and occasionally the finish work associated.</p>
<p>Another question for you, just out of curiously: What was your main field of study when you were going for your PhD? And are you still studying in that field?</p></div>		</li>
