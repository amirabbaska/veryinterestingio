<p>I don't quite follow. Could you clarify? Those two things seem to contradict each other. Wouldn't mental stress be considered &quot;harming the mind&quot;? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is rather ambiguous isn't it? I'll be honest, I can't really reconcile those neatly. In a slightly messy sense it can be reconciled by saying that if that's the only criterion by which it could be considered a mental health condition, then so is working two jobs or having kids.</p>
<p>However, it's very important to note that psychology is not the same as hard-and-fast medicine. There are always shades of grey in psychological diagnoses, and I think this is one of them. Here, the DSM has chosen to give benefit of the doubt towards calling dysphoria (not being trans) a mental health disorder, for reasons explained in my other comments. So, on this front, I think it's possible to make a valid argument for both sides.</p>
<p>My own, entirely biased, perspective is that we should not consider being trans a mental health condition just because it causes cognitive dissonance. However, I am trans, so this is 100% biased and that should be taken into account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose that makes sense. </p>
<p>Perhaps a bit unrelated, but what do you think should be done going forward in the future with regards to trans people? For instance, would you rather see more efficient/better reassignment surgeries or perhaps drugs/therapy which could resolve that dissonance without such surgeries? Personally, if given the choice between a magic pill that'd resolve the dissonance or transform you into your &quot;correct&quot; sex, which would you pick?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Having a cleft palate can be very distressing to the mind, even if it is mild enough not to cause life-threatening problems. The facial deformity itself, compounded by social reactions to it, can cause serious harm to the mind. But that doesn't make the source problem a mental illness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even since beginning my transition my dysphoria has been hugely reduced. So I don't think being transgender PER SE is harmful, but <em>still having the wrong body</em> is harmful to the mind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even though that makes sense.. there is so many things that can be proven either (or both) neurological and physiological. All kinds of heart issues, Huntingtons, Downs Syndrome, blindness, deafness, etc All things one can be born with. Are you as a doctor arguing that anything one is born with should just be considered part of who one is and just accepted, not treated? </p>
<p>And that's a genuine question. I can see how that point of view would work for gay, transgender, having blonde hair... but where do you draw the line? Especially as a medical person. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You listed disabilities, which absolutely should be treated.

<p>We shouldn't try to &quot;cure&quot; things that don't harm people. Being transgender doesn't harm people, and therefore shouldn't be treated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's the issue here. It obviously does harm people. We have accounts here of people saying it caused them to be depressed or suicidal. Someone mentioned here that a big percentage of people with this 'issue' have tried to commit suicide. It obviously does harm them.</p>
<p>But you do go to the point there. I know those things are listed as disabilities. But what makes the difference? One could argue that Downs people aren't harmed either or blind people. It's just others making it an issue.</p>
<p>And you day 'by that logic', well that's what I am asking you is there one overarching logic? Or is it just somethings we as a society can now put up with and it's no longer a disability? ( Again I might sound like I am attacking you, but I am genuinely curious about the scientific way people make these calls)</p></div>		</li>

<p>True, but this is much, MUCH rarer, and is almost exclusively because transitioning doesn't cure depression. Depression is a devastating illness, one that hurts ~25% of the population of the planet at some point in their lives, and even when you remove the cause of the depression it can take a long time for the chemicals in the brain to sort themselves out again. I had a patient who killed themselves over a year after they divorced their partner, even though a colleague of mine had helped them work past their divorce and they were actually dating again. The depression stayed with them, and eventually it became too much to bear. Similarly, transitioning for a trans person doesn't cure their depression, but it is the first step for doing so in the future.</p>

<p>Plenty of them. Schizophrenics frequently hurt themselves or cause severe physical damage as a result of their delusions. Those with severe depersonalisation can simply stop eating, and starve to death without even noticing. Depression and anxiety disorders frequently result in suicide. Mental health can often be directly harmful or even fatal to the victim.</p>

<p>Bipolar syndromes, anxiety disorders and eating disorders all directly influence how thoughts are processed in the brain. The manic and depressive episodes of bipolar both cause extremely disparate forms of thought processing; those in a manic state are often likened to people on cocaine, causing clinically significant extreme risk taking, whilst those in a depressive state are likened to those on morphine, and experience a clinically significant extreme aversion to risk for example.</p>
<p>Anxiety disorders cause the brain to fixate on fears and worries, sending the brain spiralling into a self-repeating cycle of fear and forcing the sufferer to focus only on the negative aspects of everything around them. This significantly negatively alters how thought is processed, by causing rampant pessimism (among other things).</p>
<p>Eating disorders... well, do I even need to explain it? How could a 5'8&quot; person who weighs 35kg think they're healthy? Severe negative disruption of thought, that's how.</p>

<p>Psychiatry must move with the times. Not 120 years ago, almost all mental illnesses were seen as a result of disease of the soul. Atheists were considered to be mentally ill by default, because their lack of connection to Christianity meant they always had a diseased soul. Then, psychoanalysis was born, and the field of psychiatry soon followed. It became clear that mental health was something that was independent of morality, and conditions like schizophrenia were identified. In the 1960s, autism was barely thought to exist. Almost everyone who would today be classified as autistic was given the diagnosis of &quot;minimally brain damaged from birth&quot;. It took years of lobbying to get autism recognised as a valid condition of the brain in people who were actually capable of functioning alone.</p>
<p>Psychiatry has been resisting political pressure since it first existed. It attempts to remain impartial, following only the facts, and the facts that are now presented demonstrate quite clearly that being transgender is NOT a mental health condition. It was not due to public pressure that the DSM changed its diagnosis; if that were true, it would have been changed LONG ago. It was due to the invention of things like the MRI in the 1980s, and the use in the early 2000s and 2010s of this technology to map out the differences in the brains of transgender people and cisgender people. Many of the techniques used to prove that trans people are neurologically the same as their identified genders didn't even exist 10 years ago, because they required more computing power than was actually physically available to prove. </p>
<p>And, I won't dignify the last point with an answer. It's an irrelevant ad hominem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you concede the fact that men and women have different brains, why is it that it is not considered on the same level as other diseases/disorders? Isn't the fact that a trans has a brain of the opposite sex the issue itself? The same that if i were to have gynecomastia it would be considered are disease. Why is the brain considered any different?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gender transitioning is limited by technology. Also, suicide can be caused by many things not just dysphoria, such as lack of social acceptance.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes there are mental disorders that cause harm to the body. Depression is one. </p>
<p>I acutally think you need to understand the definition of &quot;disorder&quot;. Disorders BY DEFINITION cause harm (suffering). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not a convincing argument for the new classification you are supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &quot;new classification&quot; is THE classification, and the DSM is the authoritative text on mental conditions and disorders. </p>
<p>It's the diagnostic manual used by a majority of psychiatrists worldwide, alongside the (now very outdated) ICD which is rightfully used far less. </p>
<p>You don't really get much more authoritive than the DSM. Yes the DSM has been and can be wrong, but like all science, it's a work in progress.</p>
<p>The reality is gender dysphoria is not a disorder, and to say that transgender people have a disorder is incorrect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you define harming the mind? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The clinical definition of &quot;disorder&quot; is in the comment you replied to. Disorders cause harm to the mind (depression, anxiety, excessive stress) and can psychosomatically cause damage to the body too.</p>
<p>It's not BEING TRANSGENDER that causes harm, it's GENDER DYSPHORIA that causes harm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders</p>

<p>Completely irrelevant, these are not related to gender dysphoria.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Psychiatry is already taken seriously, VERY seriously. Psychiatry is also a mix between qualitative and quantitative science, in that there's a combination of psychology as well as neurology and other biological quantitative fields.</p>
<p>Also, politics and psychiatry is intertwined when it comes to classifications. The issue of homosexuality, personality disorders, pedophilia etc are all heavily politicised. That's the reality, but it does not mean that the DSM is wholly unreliable or corrupt. Psychologists don't WANT medical/clinical issues politicised, but they are anyway. It's complex but in general we should trust that the experts have made the correct decisions because we laypeople simply do not have the knowledge to make an informed decision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And how do YOU expect to be taken seriously as a neuroscientist when you fill your disquisitions with political buzz words and talking points?</p>
