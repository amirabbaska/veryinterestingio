			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in this case it is simply light reflected off the white paper that the cover image is printed on.</p>
<p>To understand this, imagine a thin, brightly coloured (orange for example) piece of transparent plastic (like a sweet wrapper). If we flattened it against a bright, white piece of paper the plastic colour would be very clearly visible. Imagine now, you put the same plastic over a matt black surface, the colour would be all but impossible to distinguish. This is because one substrate reflects a lot of light back through the plastic to your eye and the other does not. The printed ink film is essentially a very thin (~5 micron) layer of coloured plastic. In fact this is a key way in which printed inks work - google &quot;CMYK color model&quot; to see what I mean.</p>
<p>Note also that the reason the paper is white is because it is made up of bleached white wood and a significant amount of white inorganic filler pigments such as titanium dioxide. These inorganic pigments don't absorb visible light at all. They also have a very high refractive index (rutile TiO2 has n = 2.6!) and scatter light really well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean if black paper became the norm it would lower overall color printing costs? Can you dye paper black like that any easy way?</p></div>		</li>
