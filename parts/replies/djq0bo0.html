<p>One weird one is the higher doses of Synthroid. We could not order it in a bottle size that made sense. It either came in a 10ct bottle, or 1,200 ct. So either we ordered three of the 10ct bottle, or get the 1,200ct and hope that the expiration date was far enough out to get through the whole bottle. </p></div>		</li>
