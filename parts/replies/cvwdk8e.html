			<div class="markdown"><p>Your average vegetables are mostly water and nearly indigestible plant cellulose.  We like to call that fiber and it is good for you precisely because it is excreted and not digested.  In other words, most vegetables are already low in calories.  Cucumbers, like watermelon, are even more watery than your average vegetable, but with the sugars of a watermelon.</p></div>		</li>
