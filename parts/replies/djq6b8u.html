			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm realize you're joking, but could still add more detail: the best i can say is use like 5 sheets (of the thick stuff) and pinch the paper in your hand like a parachute. quickly pass the &quot;top&quot; of the chute through a weak stream of water. then do a reverse parachute, into your bum-hole with a slight twist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get manual bidets that replace the toilet seat too. All the cleaning effectiveness of the Japanese ones but at 25% the price and no needing to run wires by your toilet.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>or you could use my protip which is cleaner, and doesn't require purchase and installation of a fancy seat. i use the high tech toilet at my relatives house, then follow up with step two, and there's still some discoloration.</p></div>		</li>
