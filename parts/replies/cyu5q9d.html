			<div class="markdown"><p>Not trying to be a jerk, but what if they affected something else that, in turn, affected human cells? I'm trying to be skeptical in the same sense that no one foresaw the harm from neonicotinoids that could do (or already have done?) great harm to our food supply. </p>
<p>Can we actually say wifi and similar are harmless or just harmless <em>as far as we understand</em>?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well from everything I've read so far, we are <em>reasonably</em> sure WiFi does not have unforseen health consequence. And if down the road we discover there were actually harmful effects we did not know about... well fuck life is unpredictable like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can answer this question with simple statistics.  We've been keeping careful track of cancer incidence in humans far before the invention of the cell phones and wifi, we can even extrapolate records quite some time into the past.  If low energy photons such as radio waves or microwaves did have any really significant increase in cancer risk we'd expect to sharp increases with each major adoption of various technologies.  The invention of wide scale radio transmitters, microwave ovens, broadcast television, early warning radar (Cold War era), and cellphones.  Keep in mind that early warning radar systems used during the Cold War bounced gigantic amounts of microwave frequency light off the ionosphere to detect enemy nuclear launches, humanity was bathed in it for decades before we advanced to more subtle detection systems.  Microwave ovens as well leak hundreds of times the microwave radiation than your wifi router can possibly put out as well.  Your average 1200W microwave will leak 1-2 watts of microwave energy while a router puts out about 5 milliwatts of microwave energy (0.005W)</p>
<p>Even adjusting for declines in cancer due to other medical advances you'd still expect to see sharp increases of cancer rates with any technology that poses an increase in cancer rates.  If there is any effect it is too small to me noticed using the records we keep.  Even if we do prove some measurable increase in cancer risk it must be tiny as we've been able to routinely decrease or risk of cancer due to advances in science (determining and regulating known carcinogens).  If imagine that personal choices such as consuming higher amounts of nitrates, VOCs from charred foods, smoked meats and cheeses, etc would dwarf any increased risks from wifi/cellular technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the good insight. I guess what I'm wondering is, are we answering the question &quot;is this technology harmful?&quot; or merely assuming that cancer is the only risk because that's what our current knowledge would support and only answering the question of whether it's harmful specifically in terms of cancer? </p>
<p>Many people in this thread have made it seem foolish to question whether there is any harm and my gut instinct (again, not a scientist at all) is to assume it's foolish to assume we understand how everything works. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might also be worth saying that the only kinds of waves (electromagnetic waves, who's force is transmitted by photons) are gamma and x-rays, as they are the only ones that have high enough energy to ionize atoms. Everything else with less energy (like visible light and lower. The <a href="https://goo.gl/p1Mdst" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> has a list for context.) doesn't have the energy to ionize atoms.</p>
<p>The reason why ionizing atoms is bad (at least for humans), is that when an atom is ionized, it has too much energy and &quot;wants&quot; to return to the lower, un-ionized level (if I understood my science classes correctly).  When the atom gets rid of that extra energy, it does it in the form of a particle that shoots off and can hit other atoms.  When it hits another atom, one of the things it can do is give that atom more energy and change it.  That change can alter the way the chemical reactions happen, and that messes up the way DNA works.</p>
