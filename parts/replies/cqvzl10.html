			<p>I think this explanation is good, but perhaps doesn't go far enough in the solar direction.<br><br>To live on solar <em>only</em> requires enough battery storage for 2-4 days of use, depending on your climate and all of that.  I think everyone can remember a major weather system that essentially meant no sun for a couple of days.<br><br>Today, this is very expensive, in both dollars and space, done with lead acid or gel batteries that have limited cycles and limited life.  Pretty much the only people who do it are people who can't get utility electricity.<br><br>Tesla's battery pack is a HUGE leap forward, moving the technology to Lithium Ion batteries at an attractive price point.  It's not yet to where your average suburbanite will disconnect from the grid, but it shows a possibility that in 20-40 years there will be no need for power plants for homes.  Each home will have solar and a battery.  Cheaper, prettier (no power poles and wires down the road), and better for the environment.<br><br>10 years ago I would have told you that future was a pipe dream.  But with recent developments including this, I now give it a 50/50 shot of happening in 20 years.</p>		</li>
