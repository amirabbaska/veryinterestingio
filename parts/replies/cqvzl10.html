			<div class="markdown"><p>Please help me understand. I currently have solar through Vivint.  When I over produce during the day I am credited by my power utility, PG&amp;E. My yearly usage does not exceed the credits from overproduction. At the end of my year, my true up statement is slightly in my favor. I have a $100-200 balance. Of course I don't get this balance, but how can the  Tesla powerwall benefit my situation if I am currently carrying a zero to negative balance with my utility company? The only benefit I can think of is to be able to sell even more kWh units at the end of my true up, but this is at wholesale around $.02. Which would be less than $150/yr. Am I missing something? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Selling energy back to the power company is sort of a patchwork solution.</p>
<p>Basically <em>your</em> current problem is that you generate most of your power when you <em>don't</em> need it much (during the day) and can't generate any when you <em>do</em> need it (during the evening).</p>
<p>Since you can't store it, your best option is to sell the power you generate to the utility company at whatever price they pay. Then at night when your solar panels don't generate much you use that credit to buy power from the utility company.</p>
<p>Now here's the thing. The utility company doesn't like buying power from you. They've invested in an infrastructure that <em>generates</em> power and distributes it <em>to</em> the consumer. If the consumer starts to sell power with the expectation that the utility company will buy it and store it, the utility company invested in the wrong infrastructure. They're over invested in power generation and under invested in power storage.</p>
<p>What Tesla's home battery does is circumvent this entire scenario. However much power your home generates it can store and reuse later. If there's a surplus you keep it. If there's a deficit you buy from the utility company. But there's no more back and forth between the consumer and the utilities.</p>
<p>The upcoming complications are pretty similar to when solar panels started becoming privately available. It takes a long time to earn back the cost of the panel or battery. But advances are happening so fast that your tech is aging while you watch. Holding off on your purchase for months will probably get you a better piece of tech than if you head for the store today.</p>
<p>Ie. a panel that breaks down 10 years from now probably ended up costing you more than if you simply bought your energy from the utilities. These batteries need time to prove themselves or subsidies to make them a save purchase for consumers. For instance France subsidized solar panels for a long time by promising to make up the difference if a panel broke before producing enough to break even in terms of costs.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It is an interesting value proposition.</p>
<p>I just logged into my power utilities website and looked at my power consumption. There are a few days where usage peaked very high. To meet demand on those days, I would need six Tesla power walls ($18,000). But, on an average day, I'd only need about 3 ($9,000).</p>
<p>But, how long are those batteries good for? Do have to buy a new powerwall every 2-3 years with daily charging/discharging (typical cell phone battery life)? For the cost of buying batteries, I might be better off just using the utility company as a power supply instead of trying to maintain my own batteries. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I'm very interested in the lifespan of the batteries to make those sort of calculations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it my issue if the utility company invested in the wrong tech?  Will they eventually stop buying power from customers?
I mentioned I am negative balance on my true up statement.  This means the credits during high production months offset all of my off-peak and lower production months.  So if I am zero to negative out of my pocket to my utility company, why would someone in my position invest in this product?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except of course there is no such thing as &quot;however much power your home generates it can store and reuse later&quot; because batteries are batteries. The Powerwall has a 10 kWh maximum capacity and a maximum 3 kW peak load. So if you want to use more than 3 kW simultaneously you need more than one battery, and if you want to produce more than 10 kWh per day you need more than one battery. If this technology becomes a hit, the power companies will simply change their tariffs to their advantage, because like it or not, the tariffs are always to their advantage regardless if everybody buys batteries or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  You would still use the same amount of electricity.  The battery would just change  <em>when</em> you use it.  You would take less from the grid at night, but you would send less out to the grid during the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While now you benefit with the battery from the arbitrage between day and night, over time if lots of people use this battery the yield will become less and less till day/night charge will be equal. I can see the use of this battery in the short term but in the long run, I tend to think the benefit of having this battery will actually disappear. We as consumer are doing this ourself in the long term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, you'd run it the other way to maximize your profit.  You'd use power from the grid overnight for your house and also to charge the battery to full, then during the day you'd sell all surplus power from your panels as well as all the charge in your battery, back to the grid, at peak rates.  Basically your battery would be acting like a miniature, localized peaker plant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand all the advantages of storing power. In my situation, my net is zero dollars with my utility CURRENTLY.  My position is from someone who already has solar installed. I want to be clear, at the end of my full year, my true up statement is NEGATIVE dollars. This means, over the course of a year I paid my utility company nothing. So what COST advantage do I have in investing in powerwall? Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Another issue with the powerwall(not necessarily my issue) is being able to produce enough power and charge your batteries during the lower production months.  You may not have enough solar to offset your winter months. If the batteries can't charge, then what good are they? </p>
<p>I reviewed my usage during winter months and I am consuming somewhere between 18-22kwh and over producing about 10-12kwh during the day.  On an average winter day I don't think production will be high enough to offset evening demand. </p>
<p>BTW I live in the SF Bay Area. I think that my position is about average and I still don't see the advantage for the average position. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it sounds like you generate way more power than you need in order to offset the cost of power that you buy during non-generating periods (nights). If you are selling at 2 cents and buying at 11 cents and still breaking even then that means that your system has a much greater capacity than is needed. </p>
<p>Therefore, if 1-2 of your panels breaks in the future, it may be more beneficial to purchase a battery pack then to buy replacement panels. I am not savvy on how maintenance or replacement works or even the cost of panels, but there is a chance that it may be cheaper. Then there won't be this gap in purchase vs sales of electricity and you will be able to keep everything that you produce. </p>
<p>Just food for thought, but in your situation the only benefit would be if your consumption rises considerably. For example if you buy an electric car. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This... AND... it reduces the actual amount of power generation required to meet a population's needs.</p>
<p>Right now power infrastructure must be designed to supply and deliver the peak demand. If a population uses 5GW at 1PM on Friday, it doesn't matter that they only use 500MW at 1AM on Saturday, you need to size everything to produce and deliver 5GW or else someone doesn't get power during peak use.</p>
<p>Tesla's battery changes this. It means that you only need to generate the average amount. You store the excess during low use times and then supplement your existing production system during high use times. </p>
<p>TL;DR - Changes power generation (watts) to energy generation (watt-hours). That's cheaper. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very important part, if this is adopted in significant quantities power companies would need to significantly reducing the amount of power production capacity.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons (practical and legislative) the companies would likely shut down their oldest, dirtiest, and least efficient plants first.</p>
<p>While I'm excited about a renewable energy world its important to remember that there is a big range in the efficiency of fossil fuel plants today.</p>
<p>Just shutting down our least efficient plants by reducing our need for peak capacity would make our system far more efficient. And in the longer term adoption of this tech would pave the way for more renewable energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree and I think it's also worth noting that this can be done without battery packs. The same 3000 per cell could invested in insulation and low-e windows for your house. Reducing physical waste and light/AC cooling energy use could also make a big impact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also kind of important to point out that the way the grid works currently, generated power eventually has to go somewhere.</p>
<p>I used to work for a company that managed/owned power plants, and one of the things those plants occasionally had to do was to literally run the turbines backward, effectively sucking power back out of the grid.</p>
<p>The Tesla batteries would serve a great service in this regard, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a major utility. We make profit by expanding infrastructure, especially just for peak loading. A good chunk of our profit model pretty much relies on this. If we aren't doing projects to expand the capacity of our transmission and distribution system, we're not making as much money. We do make a little money doing infrastructure replacement, but not as much as expanding our infrastructure. This battery technology is very disruptive to our business model. Not to mention, all major transmission projects are going out for public bid due to FERC Order 1000.
TL;DR: We make money building stuff based off peaks. Wide scape deployment of batteries threatens this from a utility side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in the US, because power is provided as a utility there are a lot of restrictions on how much they can charge customers. The trick is that by using all of that solar energy that you collect, you are further reducing your electricity bill. If this were widespread enough to eliminate variable rates it would also lower the demand for grid-power by a substantial amount.</p>
<p>What would make this even more interesting is if it were to provide power in industrial settings where a sizable chunk of our electricity gets used. If huge factories started going solar and storing their own power then that would be an incredible leap forward in green power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to make a slight addition to what you're saying. Demand (kW) might reduce slightly, correct, but the utility is still required to have the infrastructure to meet the possible peak demand. This is the same strategy implemented with current renewables in CA.  What will change for sure is energy consumption (kWh). </p>
<p>Either way, distributed generation systems like this solar/tesla will definitely help with the daily grid ramp changes in the morning and evenings. I'd take a look at the California Independent System Operator (Casio.com) and look at the daily grid dynamics.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's already happening today, actually.  There are cities that are starting to use large-scale battery storage to integrate with renewables like wind-farms and solar arrays.  It all depends on the load needs of the resources, but the demand for such capabilities are really starting to drive innovation in this space.  The tesla Gigafactory is a really big deal in the wholesale electric space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People would respond by buying solar panels.</p>
<p>I figure about half the people would buy solar panels that they can place out of sight from the road and that would drive up the cost of buying energy from a power plant because they lose a shitload of bulk efficiency thus driving people to care more about the money than the eye sore and then you get a second wave of solar adoption.</p>
<p>Solar panel installation is going to be a big market in a few years, the cost and life cycle of panels are becoming clearly more cost effective than buying from power companies, the process of storing your own energy was just made far easier, the only thing left is for consumers to get the nudge that it would be wise to make the shift and that will probably be a five year process of slow but accelerating solar adoption.</p></div>		</li>
