			<div class="markdown"><p>Why accommodation breaks down is still not fully understood. We think it is due to a few things, the muscles in your eye that control your lens get weaker and/or the fact that lens in your eye gets thicker as you get older.</p>
<p>In young children with accommodative issues we try to do accommodative eye exercises like mental minus or lose lenses with good success. Im not sure on the research for adults however it is not normally  done for adults. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I did a little digging on the mental minus thing and it looks like there is some massive controversy over &quot;vision therapy&quot; and &quot;behavioral optometry.&quot;</p>
<p>Could I ask about that as well? I can't really tell what the situation is. You're saying that those sorts of mental exercises are effective on children but not on adults, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Umm just hope you are one of the lucky ones with good genetics :). Accommodation breaks down between 40 to 50yo, we ALL get it, and it will remain the case until technology improves significantly. Though not all people need reading glasses; esp if you are mildly myopic. There are also improvments in multifocal synthetic lenses used for cataract surgery that alleviates the need for glasses. I guess the take home message is that our bodies do change as we get older and you just have to embrace it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See that's where I'm just lost.  I run 2 miles every other day and weight lift.  Then I play basketball on weekends.  I eat mostly veggies and stay away from sweets.   I refuse to get old.  It won't happen.  I'll out work aging.  No doubt.  Can't even think about the alternative.  I'll never slow down. </p></div>		</li>
