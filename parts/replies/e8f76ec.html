			<div class="markdown"><p>We have 2 ways of dating things on Mars. The first is to date large surfaces on Mars by counting the impact craters. Over long enough times, craters form at statistically know rates. By counting the craters on a large area, you can estimate how long that area has been collecting craters. That is good for large regions on Mars, but is sensitive to erosion and other modifications and usually leaves large error bars. It is not great to age date any single fossil or rock. </p>

<p>The other way is through radiometric dating of samples in labs on Earth, by counting certain isotopes. This it mostly done on Mars rocks that ejected from Mars in impacts and then fell to Earth as meteorites. This allows for much better age dating but no context on where on Mars for where the rock came from. Plus there is a sample bias, since most of the rocks that come to Earth this way are the strongest volcanic rocks. It would be very hard for a fossil to survive that trip. </p>

<p>The next Mars rover, <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/" target="_blank">Mars 2020</a>, is planning to bring back carefully selected samples from Mars so that we can date more constrained samples and any biosignatures we find. </p>

<p>Some scientists are developing <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/eposter/1129.pdf" target="_blank">instruments that could do the dating in space</a>, but unfortunately, they have not flown yet.      </p>
