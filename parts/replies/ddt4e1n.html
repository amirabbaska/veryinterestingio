			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually all helicopters are limited to about 250mph. After that point even the best equipped/designed helicopter lose stability because of dissymmetry of lift:  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissymmetry_of_lift" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissymmetry_of_lift</a></p>
<p>ELI5: the blades moving the same direction of the aircraft (advancing) move faster than the blades going back the other way (retreating).  So despite various designs that help correct this (i.e., tilt angle, dual rotors, etc) there is an inherent weakness in helicopter design that limits top speed to ~250mph. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its possible. But there're way too many drawbacks. </p>
<p>The rotor will not last long. The key term is centrifugal force. Take a bucket of water and swing it overhead such that the water will not fall out. The force keeping the water in is centrifugal force. The faster you spin the rotor, the more force the blades will feel. You will need ridiculously strong materials for this task. Rotors will also feel another effect known as flutter. Just imagine the rotor tips vibrating insanely. The vibration will eventually snap or bend the blades. Even if it doesn't, material fatigue will wear the rotor blades out eventually. </p>
<p>Rotors will also not work as effectively in supersonic speeds. It works better at subsonic speeds. Too much complicated physics here. Need a physics captain to help out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aaaah, that makes sense.  Its material limitations then.  Essentially the longer the blade the more force acts upon it and the stronger the material needs to be?  And I'm guessing that the flutter is because no parts can be aligned 100% correctly or machined 100% perfectly? Or is is something else like turbulence?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The blades turn slower and the tip speed is slower, allowing higher airspeed before the advancing blade tips approach supersonic.</p>

<p>Is this the reason they can't send helicopters to the top of Mount Everest to rescue climbers?  I know they get some periods of calm weather, so weather can't be the reason.  It sounds like it's limited by the speed of sound, so to get more power in that thin air I'm guessing they can't just firewall the throttle to get super fast RPM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On modern helicopters the rotor rpm is constant at all power levels. What changes is the angle of attack of the blades with respect to the air they pass through. You might have to google &quot;angle of attack&quot; to know what angle I'm talking about. </p>
<p>The problem with high-altitude hover is air density. At the top of Mt Everest air pressure is only 4.5 psi. It is closer to outer space than it is to sea level. </p>
<p>The limitation is that even at the highest lift setting of the rotor angle of attack there is not enough air to support the weight of the airframe. It's not a power issue. </p>
<p>Although, engines do lose power at altitude unless they are turbines or turbocharged piston engines. That is a problem too. </p></div>		</li>
