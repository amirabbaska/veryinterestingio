			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similiar experience. There were faces In the trees and the forest seemed slightly menacing. It was almost like when you look at a cloud and it looks like some animal, except that it happens constantly everywhere you look and you can't tell whether it's real or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We heavily select for super-sleepers in our operator community by running training like that. That's IMO, a good thing. We want super sleepers killing our enemies. </p>
<p>What I don't understand is why we don't just find a way to test for that on the front end? We could wash way fewer people out of our elite schools if we incorporated some sleep need testing . </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in our case, I think it's more than just testing the effects of no sleep. It's all the other stuff, like carrying 150lbs of equipment while doing movements all day and only eating the one main meal of a MRE a day on top of the no sleep. I'm not sure you can really test for all that without just doing it and screening out the fall-outs.</p></div>		</li>
