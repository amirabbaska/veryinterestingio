			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory" target="_blank">control theory</a>, it's a recent field of math that's been a recent focus to deliver real world robotics. Quad copters were made possible because of it and are one of the simple practical applications of it. It's why you can cut off and damage multiple roaters on a quad copter and it can still fly.</p>
<p>It's all just math running at the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add to it that, up until pretty recently, RC planes and helicopters took a pretty high investment in both money and time to fly.  Very few people flew them.  Now, with new battery technology, RC flight has become much less costly, and a thing like a quadcopter is quite easy to fly.  Anyone with a bit of money can now fly a quadcopter that records 1080p video.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here is a good sub for those who are interested. It is not only cheap these days but you can hook up goggles and even have it track your head movement so you can &quot;look around&quot; when in flying.</p>
<p>Also you can link in a very cheap GPS board to program flight plans with Google maps so you don't even have to control the thing yourself. Add on another board for a HUD and make it look like you are flying a commercial jet or A-10, whatever you like. And they are fully functional as well.</p>
<p>Basically what was science fiction a short while ago is now easy to get for under $1000 for a really decent system.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly because quadcopters and multirotors got autopilot that they become so popular. There is no way for a person to control a quadcopter manually without some sort of assistance. Quadcopters couldn't even exist before the cost of the gryo, auto stabilizer, and other components became smaller and more affordable. Multirotors are also able to lift more weight, so cameras and other components got put on.  </p>
<p>Low skill level is essentially the main reason quadcopters and multirotors took off instead of fixed wing gliders and single rotor helicopters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only is this untrue, for years they had ENTIRE RC AIRPORTS with little paved runways and everything. It was so common that there were 4 or 5 major publications that were on every magazine stand in the country. They even used to fly them before airshows to keep people entertained. Even in 2000 there were several dozen being showed off at an airshow I went to. </p>
<p>Even a decade ago you could buy a battery powered, self stabilized RC aircraft for well under $300. I know, because my roommate won $300, got drunk and bought one. </p>
<p>They are not some new thing. And they used to have little hand held TVs for under $100 that were basically the size of a smart phone, and you could tune in to a camera on an RC plane. They became more common in the late 1990s, but the first cameras on RC were all the way back in the 1970s. </p>
<p>EDITED TO SAY: Here is a video from 1997 of an RC plane with dual cameras, a helmet mounted display, using an off the shelf PRODUCTION video transmitter to take video of the Oregon coast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uXef4fpkRQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uXef4fpkRQ</a></p>
<p>Edited again: If RC was considered a sport, it would be the 8th most valuable sports league on the planet. Only 7 leagues having an income above the $1.7 billion income that RC has. Its not small. Its not just a few guys in their garage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen one of these RC airstrips by lake Hefner in Oklahoma City.  It's a single paved runway with two concrete taxiways on either end, which converge in a 'V' shape to an area where people can safely place or pickup their aircraft.  Next to that spot, there was a covered area with tables setup so people can work on their planes, and a spectator location behind that.</p>
<p>The neat thing is that the work stations have electrical outlets, so people can charge their planes or controllers.  The stations are powered by a bank of batteries housed nearby in a closet-like enclosure.  And the batteries are charged by several solar panels mounted to the roof of the covered area.</p>
<p>These guys take their RC flying seriously, seen by how awesome their setup is.</p>
<p>Edit: <em>converge</em> not coverage</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've flown RC airplanes and helicopters for years- (I lived down the road from a model airplane runway in Campbellsville Kentucky just outside Green River State Park)- and while RC planes have always been popular- they have never as popular or widespread as &quot;drones&quot; are today.</p>
<p>Moreover- flying a drone is much easier than flying an airplane, and it's orders of magnitude easier than flying a helicopter.</p>
<p>For the record- here is the runway I used to use:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the real answer to the OP's question is the increased public awareness/drone notoriety that makes them an &quot;issue&quot; now. Especially the word usage &quot;drone.&quot; That groups harmless RC hobby items in with huge military grade flying missile launchers. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've been taping cheap little cameras to planes for years. As far back as 2005 I remember seeing FPV piloting (that's first person video) equipment popping up in the sub- $1000 range. Certainly cheap enough for serious hobbyists. Cheaper than many common hobbies - cars, motorcycles, photography... </p>
<p>I think it's just media hype. People are falling for it. This is just wankery and fearmongering, and people are biting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fear mongering because, as /u/SgtKashim already mentioned, it's been going on for at least a decade with no noticeably negative effects.  Now that the word &quot;drone&quot; is becoming more prevalent in our vocabulary, particularly considering the controversial use of drones by our own military, the media has decided to paint flying cameras in a negative light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The fact that what people have been doing for years isn't an issue is an entirely subjective viewpoint of yours. Some people don't like the idea that people can be filming them practically anywhere without the filmer being present. Just because we didn't know about it or weren't conscious of it or it wasn't frequent enough to warrant our focus doesn't mean it wasn't an issue and should remain not an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>The more common quadcopters become and the better their tech gets the utility for mass surveillance skyrockets. In 2005 maybe there was a photo taken from an rc plane where there's a blurry shot of me in the background. Not too useful in most cases. Today maybe there's a reasonable chance of there being a quadcopter shot of me if I go somewhere really cool looking. But in 5 years? 10? If nothing is done law wise there could very well be hundreds/thousands of these things over every city constantly. Battery life gets good enough and plenty of people will have one following their car, themselves while they walk, their kids, circle their house, etc and all of a sudden every single second you spend outside of your own home is on record from 20 different angles. Maybe you don't have an issue with that but again, that's subjective, and tons of people do.</li>

<p>The point is that now you can buy that for about $100.  That is cheap enough that you don't have to be a serious hobbyist.</p></div>		</li>
