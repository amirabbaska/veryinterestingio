			<div class="markdown"><p>When we still commonly used crown glass for glasses, we used to do this same process. The machine we used took over an hour to come to temperature. I lovingly referred to it as the &quot;easy bake oven.&quot; That thing was terrifying. Hotter than three hells. Plus, if the glass lens had even a microscopic defect, during the cool down it would make this subtle little &quot;tink&quot; noise. The sound of death. It meant that some tiny little burr had caused the entire lens to be structurally compromised (often shattered internally). Hours wasted, as glass takes a long time to work with and this process had to be done last (The lenses are too hard to cut or grind afterward, even on ruby or diamond wheels... the diamonds are harder, but they get ripped out of the substrate).</p>
<p>Glass is still used on occasion, but it's so rare now that we don't keep the equipment on site anymore. There are just too many better alternatives now. Although, despite what a salesperson may tell you, glass is still king for clarity. The downsides outweigh that upside substantially, though (primarily weight, they are ridiculously heavy).</p></div>		</li>
