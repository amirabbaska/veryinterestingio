			<div class="markdown"><p>So each food item begins breaking down as soon as it gets to you stomach, and different foods will take different times to finish breaking down? How does your stomach coordinate moving the finished product while keeping the slower stuff that's still digesting?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the muscle ring between stomach and small intestine is coordinating some interesting stuff, like a bouncer in a club.
Liquids in general go through the stomach faster, because they can flow through the muscular fissures of the stomach lining (like a motorcycle ignoring the traffic jam by driving around the cars). However, fat is kept longer inside the stomach, because the small intestine needs time to prepare for fat digestion (bile acids, enzymes from pancreas, bile acids need to be recycled if the fat content was too large).
The muscle ring also checks for acidity (not acidic enough? no entry! Can feel like heartburn if muscle reacts too strong), as well as particle size (not small enough? No entry! Come back once the stomach muscle has ground you to powder!)</p>
<p>Simple sugars and starch are already digested inside the mouth, and some can be absorbed/taken up in the stomach, same with alcohol. Rest makes it into the small intestine. Most of the stuff we can get energy out is digested and taken up here. The rest (water, bile, and undigested material, like fiber (or milk sugar if you are intolerant) moves to the colon: bacteria will digest what they can. If high energy stuff made it to the colon, the bacteria will throw a wild party, and you end up passing wind. The colon is where the water is absorbed, and if that does not happen, you end up with diarrhea (sugars bind water, so if you are lactose intolerant...). But many bacteria die daily as well, and they end up in the poop, too. Most of poop is dead bacteria, some leftover coloring from dead red blood cells (the brown in poop), and the occasional undigested sweet corn kernel and fiber not even the bacteria could handle. </p>
<p>Additionally, the body also a priority list of what to use first: Alcohol is always first, then fructose (because it needs to be turned into glucose first, so glucose will be turned into fat for storage during that time, because the body cannot have glucose floating around, aka diabetus), then glucose, and then fat. Protein is preferred to be used as building material, not energy. Unless you are sick as hell or on a diet, then the protein will be taken out of your muscles for energy production. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What would this high energy stuff be? Asking for a friend. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand proteins being taken out of our muscles. Why take protein out of our muscles if we then need to use proteins to repair our muscles? Wouldnt it be more efficient to simply skip the process?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It begins in the mouth. Teeth chops it up and saliva contains enzymes, breaking down nutrients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this also apply to water too or does it sort of go through a different system?  As in if I drink water now, how long does it take for it to turn into pee?  What if my stomach is empty?</p>
<p>I'm just trying to imagine all the water speeding past the intestine's contents or travelling  through a different path.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Foods don't all break down in your stomach...the majority of what your stomach digests is protein.  The intestines do most everything else (well they are the location at least) apart from the enzymes in saliva beginning the breakdown of carbohydrates.</p></div>		</li>
