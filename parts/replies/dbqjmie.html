			<div class="markdown"><p>Has anyone ever done an animation of the perspective of the earth view towards the Sun throughout the year INCLUDING the background stars throughout the year?</p>
<p>If I understand this correctly, the reason it's a figure 8 is because the Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees.  The reason it's a lopsided figure 8 is because of the elliptical orbit of the Earth (while tilted at 23.5 deg) around the sun, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but it's an extremely slow process - the full apsidal precession cycle is over 100 thousand years, or 1 day per 300 years (<a href="http://gji.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/3/323.short" target="_blank">source</a>). During the time the pyramids were built, the perihelion and aphelion occured about two weeks earlier than now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now, if the Earth was on a circular orbit, all would be fine, and every 24 hours the Sun would return to the same location in the sky (negating seasons).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if Earth's orbit were perfectly circular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time#Obliquity_of_the_ecliptic" target="_blank">the Sun would still appear to travel &quot;slow&quot; on some days or &quot;fast&quot; on others</a> throughout the year because of our axial tilt.</p></div>		</li>
