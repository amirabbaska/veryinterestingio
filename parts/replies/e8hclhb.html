			<div class="markdown"><p>You should compare Tom and Jerry  made in 1940  with animated features make for the big screen like the moves by Pixar and other animation that are released in the move theater. That comparison is a lot closer then  animation that is produced for TV today. Then you compare to production with similar quality goals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>very true, movie cartoons of the 1940's were shown at the cinema hundreds of times a week meaning they brought in more revenue in their lifetime. TV animation was expected to be aired once a week using the commercial break to earn back its costs before it was replaced by next week's episode (and with limited guarantee of later airing to recoop costs).</p>
<p>As such the budget per movie cartoon was so much higher</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still apples and pears really. Ultimately we don't live in the same world as we did back then. </p>
<p>The only thing you can really compare is the methods. And the reason it looks worse is because we changed methods. They could have made low quality animation back then (and they did) and we can still do high quality hand drawn animation today (and we do). But if you want to know where the difference comes from, it's methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. </p>
<p>Look at the movie <em>Frozen</em>.</p>
<p>The producers spent a sizeable amount of time actually in Norway to get the specific land and architectural features as close to accurate as possible. </p>
<p>Every detail in every shot is near perfection: Strands of hair, clothing, room and building features. </p>
<p>You're left with a complete shot that is far more realistic than what used to be with Tom and Jerry and older Disney movies. Yes, the characters had more action, but the background was a solid blur. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add, watch the original Superman cartoons.... Amazing animation. Their creator, Max,  invented all the Staples in animation that Disney popularized later.</p>
<p>I read that Each episode cost about a million dollars in today's money (hope that's right)</p>
<p>It's all in open domain and free to watch and some people restored them a bit too</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up watching those cartoons (along with just about anything Superman related). Since they're public domain, I think lots of companies used to throw them onto VHS. Always loved the aesthetic of the lava and plasma bursts and stuff - nothing else looks like it, and the animation is so fluid.</p>
<p>Had no idea until a few years ago how old they were, or how innovative for their time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>those fleischer cartoons utilized rotoscoping and some choice fill animation to cover gaps that they couldn't actually shoot with live models first:</p>
<p>> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscoping" target="_blank">Rotoscoping</a>, the process of tracing animation drawings from live-action footage, was used minimally to lend realism to the character's bodily movements.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(1940s_cartoons)#cite_note-Maltin-3" target="_blank">[3]</a> Many of Superman's actions, however, could not be rotoscoped (such as flying, lifting very large objects, etc.). In these cases, the Fleischers' lead animators—many of whom lacked training in figure drawing—animated &quot;roughly&quot; and depended upon their assistants (many of whom were inexperienced animators, but trained figure-drawers) to keep Superman &quot;on model&quot; during his action sequences.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(1940s_cartoons)#cite_note-Maltin-3" target="_blank">[3]</a></p>
<p>edit: the end result was beautiful</p></div>		</li>
