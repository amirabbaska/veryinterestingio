			<div class="markdown"><p>I once read, but unfortunately can't find, a fascinating popular science article about cell line cultures, and about the blurred lines around concepts such as individuals and species. If I remember correctly, it mentioned the hypothesis that malicious cell lines (i.e. cancer cells that can transfer between individuals, as happens in Tasmanian devils) could once have been a common enough danger to affect our evolution. This has the appeal of explaining why our bodies have the ability to distinguish between their own cells and cells of the same species; as far as I know there's no other satisfying explanation for transfusion rejection.</p>
<p>I believe the article brought this up as an interesting idea that needs more consideration, rather than a thoroughly discussed hypothesis, let alone a tested theory, so I'm curious what experts think — and also where I can find that dang article again, or others like it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They do. Dogs and horses (and likely other species that I am not aware of) can develop antibodies against &quot;foreign&quot; red blood cell antigens when they receive a transfusion, even if it's a type match (animals have blood types too!) That means any time that animal may need another transfusion in the future, their blood must be tested (cross-matched) against the new donor's blood to see if there will be a reaction.</p>
<p>Cats have these antibodies naturally, so they have to be cross-matched prior to every transfusion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Our bodies presumably have no concept of categories, like species, so probably simply a matter of how different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason why certain blood types may be associated with race is due to Darwinism.  For instance, many Africans have Duffy blood because of the prominent amount of mosquitos that carry Malaria in Africa.  The Africans who weren’t resistant to malaria were more likely to die, where as those resistant were more likely to survive, and reproduce, hence their prominence among Africans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent point. I totally skipped the 2nd question, but yes this is a great explanation for Duffy. It's harder to justify with blood types that don't have a clear evolutionary advantage. Or suggests that we just haven't identified the advantage yet. </p>
<p>As an aside, this is the same reason that the sickle cell trait is so prevalent in people with African heritage. As a heterozygote (1 copy), you have malaria protection but unfortunately as a homozygote (2 copied) you have a serious disease. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prevalence of mosquitoes in Sub-Saharan Africa also explains the prevalence of Sickle Cell there, in that Sickle Cell provides a selective advantage against the malaria parasite. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Sickle Cell trait also increases the vulnerability to HIV by 40% at exposure, and also increases the average lifespan of those infected by the virus by 2 years (making its victims a vector for much that much longer). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not shure but I think:   Africans don't have the a special type of the Duffy antigen on their red blood cells. Few of them are Fy(a) positive and Fy(b) negative. Most are Fy(a) &amp; Fy(b) negative. </p>
<p>The Fy(b) antigen is a Rezeptor for the severe form of malaria. The lack of it means that they are &quot;resistant for the severe form of malaria (malaria tropica)</p>
<p>Yeah it's nice to have this resistant... but they are more likely to get hiv due the lack of Fy(b)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this not suggest that may not everything has an 'evolutionary advantage' but is left as a free parameter so that sometimes things like blood type (for example) are just side effects of other things that get chosen 'for evolutionary advantage'?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's definitely a possibility. I framed my original answer as &quot;trying to find an evolutionary benefit&quot; because that's the clearest reason why we might have some very strongly preserved genetic variation. But certainly it could just be the result of mutations that didn't cause problems and just &quot;stuck&quot;. Or they're linked to other genes that may have some function. I can't say I know enough about the chromosomal position of the involved genes to comment on that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be really thick here and missing some evolutionary iceberg to crash my ship but is it possible that mutations occur as an evolutionary means to future proof the organism and not necessarily any immediate known advantage?
Ie if i have a mix of types of blood or any other possible genetic variant in a species that is better for possible protection for unknown future disease that would/could entirely wipe out the species if there was no variation.
Could mutations be less than chance, but responses to exposure to  say x factor( completely outside our ken ) and/or a response to how x might change ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The frequency of the different variants (alleles), A, B, and O differ between populations. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type_distribution_by_country" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type_distribution_by_country</a></p>
<p>The provided table is the phenotype distribution, not the genotype distribution. One difference is due to dominance. A and B are co-dominant, and O is recessive. So a person may have 1 A allele and 1 O allele, or they may have two copies of A. Both will be A blood type. An A and a B means AB blood type. Two Os means O blood type. + and - indicates <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_blood_group_system" target="_blank">Rhesus factor</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of things are produced by what's called neutral evolution, produced not by selection but by mutation and drift.  Some think this is the <em>dominant</em> method of evolution, but that's controversial and probably depends on what exactly you are looking at (it's probably more true for things like point mutations on genes than for things like body size and color and behavior).  It's a plausible explanation for blood types.</p></div>		</li>
