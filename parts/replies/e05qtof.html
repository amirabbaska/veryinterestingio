			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually a sodium glutamate coreceptor. And not just meat. Good example of the difference is tomatoes. Rich in glutamate but low in sodium. If you salt them a little you get a significant extra depth of flavor and savory character that is from umami.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was weird some of the stuff listed as unami (I haven’t heard celery or spinach before, but I’ve heard tomato all the time). To me tomatoes, celery, and spinach don’t have even a remotely meaty taste like meats, soy sauce, and mushrooms do. Then I again a really like meat, soy sauce, and mushrooms, is it possible that I’m just desensitized and tomatoes, celery, and spinach don’t have enough unami in them for it to register with me?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Genetic differences also affect sweetener side-tastes. For example, certain variants of 2 T2R bitter receptors respond to saccharin (19), providing a molecular explanation for the observation that some people find that saccharin tastes both sweet and bitter.</p>
