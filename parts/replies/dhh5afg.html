			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but brains, being more complex and more vulnerable than sperm, are much harder. </p>
<p>With sperm, if you kill half the cells, you're still ok, because you don't need all the cells, just most of them. </p>
<p>With the brain, if you don't kill any cells, but they lose their connective structure, you're done for. If you kill a quarter of the cells, you're probably done for. </p>
<p>The brain has to be preserved as a whole tissue, where the whole thing has to maintain its structure and where every cell that dies represents an unknown and possibly massive loss. Our current techniques do some pretty decent damage to the brain tissue. </p>
<p>So the hope isn't to preserve the brain <em>intact</em>, but to preserve it <em>well enough</em> that some future society, with better understanding of the brain, can either repair the damage, or, by inspection of the damaged tissue, produce some representation (digital or biological) which copies your brain function. That part is kinda hand wavy, because we have no idea how much damage it's possible to repair or ignore even in theory, so the best we can do is do as little damage as we can and cross our fingers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know if there have been any studies linking genetic variation to sperm cryogenic fitness? Ie. if you freeze sperm and kill some of them, you are selecting for sperm which can resist cold which might have other impacts down the line on the children.</p></div>		</li>
