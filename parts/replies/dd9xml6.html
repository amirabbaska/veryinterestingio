			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question. The executive producers are usually the investors of the film or the people who willingly attach their name to a film they believe in so that it ultimately helps the marketing of the film. The producer is the boss. They find the script, get the studio to back it, decide on the director, hire crew, find investors (or executive producers), work with the writer to move the script in the right direction, work with the budget, etc. The producer is the director's boss so to speak, but they work together to make sure the story comes to life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The producer takes care of the organization, crew, location, gear, etc.
The Executive Producer is about big picture stuff, securing funds, partnerships, but most importantly shaping the overall project. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, the Executive Producer has more power on how the final movie will look than the director (hence the Directors cut)</p>
