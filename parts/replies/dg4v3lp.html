			<div class="markdown"><p>Well 100w infrared led light is no where close to starring into the sun(edit: unless you put your eye right in front of it.) Compare it to starring into a 100w led spotlight or a 400w halogen bulb. But with normal spotlights, your pupil contracts, with infrared at night it is wide open. I would also avoid looking at it, but you also don't have to be to paranoid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. So momentary exposure is no big deal just don't stare at it, gotcha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This advice is a bit dangerous. A 100w led gives off about 35W of actual light. If you're right in front of it, that light might be concentrated over a 0.1m^2 area (1 ft x 1 ft) - in which case the light hitting you would be 350W/m^2. The sun delivers about 1000W/m^2, but sunlight is spread over a very wide part of the spectrum, some of which won't hurt your eyes and some of which will force you to blink. LEDs on the other hand only give off a single color of light, which might be concentrated in a color that will damage your eyes without triggering your blink reflex. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you are right in your high intensity scenario IR exposure would approach that of the sun. With the added problem of the open pupil. Fortunately IR light the least damaging wavelength per energy of the sunlight hitting earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black lights are definitely not good for your eyes. But they do admit UVA, and some violet light that is barely visible, but very unpleasant to look at. I tried it with sunglasses, and the relieve was immediate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you mean 100W equivalent? That is a ton of IR light. </p>
<p>But yes, staring into it at close range will essentially cook your retina. The manual for the light should specify safety limits. The dim red is essentially where the IR LED spectrum leaks into the visible spectrum and is not an indication of how bright it is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, I really do mean a single chip 100w LED. We buy cheap 100w LED floodlights on ebay and replace the COBs with 100w IR COBs. A 1 piece floodlight with diffuser will illuminate an entire 2000sqft warehouse in IR light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should be taking some precautions to ensure that people aren't too close to the LED then, as that wattage can definitely do some damage. There are safety specifications for these lighting setups that needed to be followed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>quick googling found this <a href="http://www.vishay.com/docs/81934/eyesafe.pdf" target="_blank">this pdf</a>. The 3rd page has a graph that may help you estimate maximum exposure limits.</p>
<p>What specific LED chip are you using? What size is the diffuser? I can help you calculate it since the limit will depend on both.</p></div>		</li>
