			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that only telomerase is neccessary to become immortal. There are a lot of cells in human that at the time of 100 or more years of age have more than enough telomers to divide. Telomerase is important to cells that divide constantly. And I'm not 100 % sure but i tink I heard that telomerase works in healthy cells that has those kinds of properties (I am talking about healthy adult human, not about gonads or rmbryonic stage of human development, but I am not sure that what I am saying is true).  The main problem why humans cant be immortal is that we cant regenerate some of our tissues. And thats not cells but proteins too. For example your aging skin ages because collagen (and probably elastin and many other structural priteins) cant be regenerated the way they would have the same qualities as they have in newborn baby (I am talking about the elasticity of a tissue not the shape of it, because interestig fact - babies and adults untill age of 28 have some adipose tissue in their cheeks and it loses its volume with aging that why babies have big cheeks and adults have small, bony ones). For example mouses are not dependant on telomere exhaustion to control their tissue proliferation and tissue homeostasis and they still age.
All in all aging and immortality is complex problem that has complex answer and many parts of it is still unknown. You just can't say that protein x keeps you immortal. Protein x might be neccessary to immortality, but without other proteins y z m and regulators n k l you can't achieve something that could be called immortality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you elaborate on the &quot;need&quot; to live for x amount of years? </p>
<p>I imagine the longer any organism lives + the procreation rate of it remaining constant would be the best in terms of survival. </p>
<p>A few thousand years ago I can imagine a human living 500 years with 20-30 offspring to be much better off ( in evolutionary terms ) then 40 with 4-6 offspring. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Evolution requires constant change mutations and adaptations. You don't really want your old unevolved DNA to keep reproducing 5 generation later when you have better more adapted DNA. So is better to let the old die off so that the new and more adapted can thrive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not convinced that from a fitness perspective that makes sense. Evolution is on a grand scale, the immediate impact of significantly more offspring probably wouldn't be totally negated by a theoretical advantage in rate of change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You kind of have this backwards. The DNA doesn't give a duck about evolving, and often adds hundreds to thousands of redundancies every generation,(alu sequences, transposing, reverse transposing etc) effectively propagating old code. Also, because of the nature of genetic information( semi conservative replication with independent segregation of chromosomes mostly) five generations isn't anywhere near long enough to see a change in sequence from anything other than recombination events. The odds of even one mutation appearing within five generations in the coding region of a gene that produces a helpful gain or loss of function mutation would be infinitely low. Effectively every generation is more likely to add old &quot;bad&quot; code to the offspring than it is likely to add new good code. When we talk about evolution, think more in terms of thousands of generations to even see relatively minor phenotypic or trait differences as a result of &quot;new&quot; mutations arising in the code. Basically most humans are still running the same code as when we stepped out of Africa, the humans then would be capable of basically every single thing humans today are capable of if you went time travel child snatching. Unfortunately if you did that you probably steal like a fortieth of the world's genetic diversity outside of Africa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it from the DNA's perspective.</p>
<p>Each generation born can make more generations in an explosive, exponential manner. So more offspring made in the smallest amount of time allows the DNA to propagate more and more rapidly. DNA doesn't care if it's host organism lives or dies, only that it makes more of itself. Mathematically, the fastest way to do that is short lifespans and high number of offspring. </p>
<p>Of course each organism's reproductive ages and number of offspring vary based on other considerations of their environment which is why we don't all mate like fruit flies. Also, it could be that it's beneficial to the DNA for each human to be immortal but that adaptation simply hasn't happened to manifest/mutate and spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But DNA doesn't have a perspective. It doesn't care if it can make more of itself, because it's not capable of the emotion of caring. It's not capable of doing mathematics. It's not making plans for how it wants the human species to go.</p>
<p>It's not thinking about an end goal. It just.. is. It gets passed down, or it doesn't, and it's more likely to get passed down if there's more propagation and all the conditions are working out in a way that enables survival, but it's not directing anything that way out of some kind of predestination. </p>
<p>It's more that things happen to it and it just goes with the flow. The environment and having the necessary mutations/adaptations have a lot more to do with it than anything.</p></div>		</li>
