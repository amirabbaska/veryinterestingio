			<div class="markdown"><p>I sort of disagree. I think different groups do better or worse jobs at explaining, or at least causing an attachment to, different fields. Roads are tangible. Schools, probably are also tangible, but have seen fairly significant cuts to funding anyways. National defense is not tangible at all, but rides on the coattails of fear, which certain groups have played up to dramatic effect. Space travel has, arguably, provided the most tangible benefits of everything you have listed. Much of our modern technology that fills our homes and offices can be traced back to projects born out of space travel, and yet space exploration and nasa budget have been cut dramatically since the 60's.</p>
<p>I think it's more likely an issue of immediacy, rather than a tangibility. New road? We get that now. National Defense? Safer now. Climate change? ...for our children and grandchildren... forget it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Secondhand effects.  Like you said, people don't realize in their day to day lives that they're benefiting from technology developed as part of the technological advances required for space flight. It's much easier to deal with firsthand things like you paying for the road you're driving on or the school your kids are going to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IANA rocket scientist but do work in research, so can give some heuristics. We haven't yet been to Mars. We are trying to. In order to get to Mars, some of the challenges are finding a suitable efficient mode of powering our craft so that it can float through space for a year. Our craft will need to be made of materials that can resist cosmic radiation for extended periods of time. An efficient and sustainable method of feeding/watering those going to Mars, both en route and on arrival is needed. All of these tech challenges will be useful for solving problems here on earth. </p>
<p>Tl;dr any significant tech breakthrough will have a knock-on effect far from the original &quot;design brief&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NASA developed HDTV during the Apollo missions, velcro was used to secure tools to spacecraft in zero-g, and memory foam was used in spacecraft initially. These techs would have been invented at some point, but space exploration sped it along. </p>
<p>Space has unique requirements so often a new invention is needed. Sometimes by developing a new technology other fields figure out how to use that. I'm sure the mattress industry figured out how to produce memory foam cheaper and/or of higher quality, so NASA and the public benefit from this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those benefits sometimes being radically intangible.  Too much science is a soft target for accusations of pointlessness and self-indulgence.  I mean who doesn't want a taxpayer-funded jaunt to Antarctica ?</p>
