			<div class="markdown"><p>Sodium tends to remain in the extracellular space, that is, in the fluid that surrounds cells and tissues, and in the blood. Cells actually pump out more sodium than retain it, but that's an entire ELI5 in itself.</p>
<p>And sodium doesn't remain in the blood forever. Your kidneys are capable of sensing how much sodium is present, and will adjust the reabsorption of sodium from the urine accordingly on a more or less minute to minute basis. Your heart can also detect sodium concentrations, though indirectly, (The only time this will happen is if the heart is failing, and can't pump properly) and increases Na+ excretion in the urine by secreting special peptides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's the part we don't know. Healthy kidneys are supposed to expel excess ions. The current line of thought is that if you are healthy salt won't cause a problem, but if you have a problem salt will make it worse.</p>
<p>There is also some benefit to using Potassium salt rather than Sodium. I don't recall the exact relationship, but your body needs both ions and it's something like your body ends up holding on to the Sodium so that it doesn't lose the Potassium when your Potassium is low. So, you eat more Potassium and then your body can get rid of both, resulting in lower blood concentrations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>M.D. here. Healthy kidney expel <em>some</em> ions. Human kidneys actually send most sodium back out of the urine back into the blood stream.  When we evolved sodium was scarce. </p></div>		</li>
