			<div class="markdown"><p>Professional costumer and textiles worker here. This is a fairly thorough and accurate explanation. I would also add that the motion that fabrics experience in the process of machine washing and drying also stretches, pulls, and contracts the fibers, and The tensile strength of the fiber as well as its flexibility determines how it reacts to those processes as well. The other factor in how a garment reacts to washing is what it’s made of and how it’s produced.</p>
<p>TL/DR: RTFM. If your clothes say machine wash, dry flat on the tag, follow those directions if you like your clothes.</p>
<p>In-depth explanation:</p>
<p>Natural fibers like cotton, linen, and silk tend to be more resilient. This is partly because they have already evolved to survive the elements like heat, cold, and water, and partly because they are fibrous in their natural state. </p>
<p>Synthetic fibers, like nylon, rayon, and spandex tend to have more give because of the elasticity of their chemical makeup, however as they are manufactured from plastic, their natural state is one of a solid or liquid, and heat tends to break down the artificial bonds which have made them into a fiber. That’s why your rayon or spandex garments will often recommend an air dry or low heat.</p>
<p>The method of production also has an effect on a garment’s resilience. </p>
<p>Woven fabric, which is made on a loom in the way we tend to think of fabric being made (right? I’m not the only one who thinks about this stuff? I am? Okay, moving on), tends to be much stronger, and have a lot less give. It is many fibers laid flat and woven across each other to produce a number of different patterns and textures, and tends to be very strong and not very flexible. Your dress shirts, suits, formal dresses, and curtains are all (probably) woven. This means it has very little give in the fit, and if the fibers move too much, they tend to break rather than stretch. This is why these garments often say Dry Clean Only, because the act of subjecting the fibers to the motion of the washing machine will eventually destroy the garment.</p>
<p>Knit fabric, which is manufactured in a number of ways, from complicated knitting machines all the way down to grandmas with needles, takes a single, impossibly long fiber and wraps it in and around itself to create a much more flexible texture. Most modern casual clothing, from your sweaters and leggings, all the way down to your t-shirts and sweatpants, is produced in this way, making it stretchy and comfortable. The directions on these garments have a wide range, but most are machine washable, with instructions on temperature and drying method being variable. </p>
<p>This is where the material comes in. The more synthetic fiber in your garment’s content, the lower its tolerance for heat will be. </p>
<p>The exception to this rule is garments made from yarn, like sweaters, hats, and scarves. Yarn is many fibers spun together to make one thick fiber that is used to make the garment. Now matter how natural the wool used to make the yarn, it still won’t tolerate heat and twisting well. Think of a fiber optics cable, where the individual filaments are soft and flexible, but you really don’t want to twist and bend the cable too much or you’ll damage its fidelity.</p>
<p>If you’re still with me, thanks for reading. This is one of my areas of expertise and I’m glad someone on the Internet needed it today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for taking the time to type such a detailed explanation. I'm very particular about taking care of my clothes because if you do, they will last so much longer. If you buy quality fabrics with classic cuts and styles, pay attention to washing instructions and flat dry or hang dry, most garments will last years before becoming faded and/or misshapen. </p>
<p>Now I know more about the how and why. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I pretty much air dry anything I care about/like. Best case scenario putting it in the drier still wears it out faster than hanging it up. Of course some really hefty items will mildew if you don't dry them out fast enough. There's probably other exceptions too but I haven't found them yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heck, even cheap stuff lasts a lot longer if you wash it gently (by hand, or in a lingerie bag in the washing machine on gentle cycle) and air dry it. I hang most of my stuff because I live in a smallish apartment, but drying flat is ideal because stuff is heavier when it's wet so the bottom of the garment pulls on the top if it's hanging.</p>
<p>Source: worked at a fast fashion store for 5 years (most of those as a manager) and left 5 years ago, and I <em>still</em> have some of the clothes I bought with my discount.</p>
<p>However, rayon is a BIG exception to this. Old Navy's favorite fabric seems to be rayon, for an example. I saw <strong>so many</strong> rayon items get returned at my store (not O.N.) because they shrunk even after following the washing instructions, and I had it happen to me a couple times. So now I don't buy rayon clothes unless I find something I like marked WAY down and I'm okay with only getting to wear it once before it goes to Goodwill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in middle school I had to do a research paper on dyes. This was before the ubiquitous internet access. (There was internet already but you’re limited to 30min at the library, school and public.) I picked up encyclopedia and books on dyes - which of course also talked a lot about fabrics since they work together.</p>
<p>I was in 6th/7th grade and had only come to the States when I was halfway through 3rd grade. My English was decent by then but definitely not good enough to understand all the textural lingo. So in doing my research I also had to have a dictionary nearby as well.</p>
<p>Fabrics and dyes and how they react to and with each other is fascinating! I was blown away by the basic fact that fabrics are dyed with every color <em>except</em> the one we see! All the other colors are absorbed and the one that bounces back is the visible color. And how we are able to achieve white and black is also amazing!</p>
<p>I tried to share my newfound knowledge and fascination with my friends and classmates but they all just laughed at me and it only further confirmed my nerd status. I didn’t care because I was still amazed that schools would let me read their precious books that contain so much knowledge! FOR FREE!</p>
<p>I have forgotten much of it by now - but that sense of wonder when I put on an article of clothing and feel its softness <em>or</em> roughness against my skin is still there. Even more fascinating when I have two of the same top/pants but in different colors and one would feel softer than the other. </p>
<p>Btw, I grew up with wooden weaving looms in my house and so did my entire neighborhood in Saigon - I’m always amazed at how fabrics are made! So you’re not the only one that thinks about fabrics on weaving looms!</p>
<p>I miss the rhythmic sounds of weaving looms that soundtracked my childhood. It was a constant that was loud and soothing all at once. </p>
<p>Thank you for that bit of nostalgia!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also starching. Which can make fabric artificially stiff and eventually exacerbates the fiber breakdown.</p>
<p>I worked in a dry cleaner for many years.</p></div>		</li>
