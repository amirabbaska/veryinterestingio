			<div class="markdown"><p>In reality only one of those is intended for security. The rest are meant for various torque limits, material composition, etc. Both Bristol and pentalobular are used in high end electronics, and things like avionics for aircraft often. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I count two. The one-way is designed to only go in, not out (though the diagram does not detail how) and the security torkx is designed to only be openable with an actual security torx bit (which you are assumed not to have) rather than also being workable with a flat-head like regular torx.</p>
<p>Other types like pentalobe are used for the same reason though: they make it harder to open the thing they're closing because the driver is uncommon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen it recently, but the niftiest anti-tamper screw I've ever seen was a pan-head screw (ie bump type) where the head had no indentation in it at all. Instead, it was ever so slightly out of round, and you drove it in with a special socket that was precisely sized to mate with the screw head. Unless you had the tool, the only way to get it out was to treat it like you would a stripped head screw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I'm sure you could pull them out with a decent set of vice grips, but that is true for pretty much any panhead. Unfortunately I saw them something like 5 years ago and haven't seen them since. We used them to assemble the partitions in a public restroom. </p></div>		</li>
