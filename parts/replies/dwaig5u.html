			<div class="markdown"><p>Sweating and heat dispersal are one of the factors that contribute to our high physical endurance.</p>
<p>Many animals, while far stronger/faster than humans, can only use those abilities for a relatively short time before they die of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Deer and horses will literally run themselves to death when being chased by human hunters, who can keep going all day.</p>
<p>Cheetahs are particularly bad about it, risking death if sprinting for even a few minutes.</p>
<p>One of the few animals that do have us beat are sled dogs, but only if properly provided for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Their kidneys are much more efficient at removing salt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Salt and water management in mammalian kidneys is a two-step process. First the blood passes through a microfilter system in a part of the kidney known as the glomerulus. Most of the blood plasma, including water and small molecules like salts, passes through the filter, but the larger molecules, as well as the blood cells, are held back. The filtered plasma then passes through a long tube called the loop of Henle, where the water is reabsorbed. This process concentrates the remaining fluid, which is finally excreted as urine. One popular theory holds that a simple modification of the standard mammalian kidneynamely, longer loops of Henleallows marine mammals to produce a more concentrated urine by reclaiming more of the water. Kidney anatomy in manatees and harbor porpoises seems to support this theory, but it has not been closely studied in most marine mammal species. </p>
