			<div class="markdown"><p>The human element aside, I hear all the time about unmanned space exploration, but I rarely hear anything about sending drones or robots into the ocean. (I'm sure it happens, just rarely know of it) How is it that we haven't created a pressure resistant drone, set it to autopilot, and let it explore and map out the ocean on its own? </p></div>		</li>

<p>A space craft orbiting a moon or a planet doesn't deal with the hazards you will find under the sea (terrain, currents, animals). </p>
<p>A rover on Mars can survive years using solar power and they are not on autopilot. They receive constant monitoring and commands from ground crews. </p>
<p>Underwater vehicles would require to carry their own power source and remote communication would be very difficult. Radio waves do not travel well through good electrical conductors like salt water so most underwater transmissions (e.g. deep sea oil wells) rely on cables or acoustic transmitters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh I see, you bring up many good points that I hadn't considered before. Could the drone save data locally and transmit the information when it returns to the surface? Are the power requirements of diving/surfacing too great for it to be feasible for the drone to repeatedly surface for solar recharging?</p></div>		</li>
