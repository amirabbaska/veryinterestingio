<p>No one was directly killed as a result of the Castle Bravo test. There was radiation exposure, but that's it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While above ground testing continued for a few years, the Castle Bravo event started to focus attention on how truly dangerous nuclear weapons in general and weapons testing in particular could be. Because the blast hurt non-American citizens, it opened the eyes to other world leaders that US and USSR weapons testing actually threatened people who had nothing to do with nuclear weapons. There was global outrage, and a growing push to reign in on weapons testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also they had used a doping agent, Lithium 6, but they didn't have enough time to remove all of the unwanted, although much more abundant, Lithium 7 from it, so said fuck it and threw it in, the Lithium 7 is what accounted for the MASSIVE increase in power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the lithium-7 isotope, accounting for 60% of the lithium content, was assumed to be inert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that test they learned that Fusion bombs can be pretty much infinitely doped to produce absolutely terrifying explosions, like Tsar Bomba showed, when they only put down half of the material that was supposed to be in it and STILL made an utterly massive explosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't explain anything about nuclear strategy to a 5 year old, so I will just give a normal explanation.  </p>
<p>From my research, the popular fears about nuclear Armageddon far outweigh the realistic scenarios.  Not that this is a bad thing, nuclear war would be pretty terrible.  </p>
<p>First thing first, we do not, and have never had the nuclear armaments to destroy the earth, render earth unfit for life, or even completely eradicate humanity.  Even at the peak of the cold war before the beginning of the arms control treaties that resulted in a slow disarmament, none of this was possible.  </p>
<p>The worst case scenarios I have ready about are where 80%+ of the worlds nuclear weapons are assumed to have detonated over their targets.  In this scenario, the majority of the United States is rendered uninhabitable.  Russia gets off easier because it is so much bigger, but all of the major and minor cities and infrastructure are destroyed.  Europe and the Middle East would likely be heavily damaged as well, with all major cities gone.  China and Russia would likely do major damage to each other in Asia.
You will notice that there have been almost no detonates in Africa, South America, or Australia.  </p>
<p>The bombs would create enough dust in the atmosphere to create cooler than normal summers and harsher winters for several years.  This would result in crop failures, but the amount of climate change would not be out of proportion to &quot;micro&quot; ice ages which we have had several times in the last few thousand years, usually the result of volcanic eruptions.  </p>
<p>There would be massive deaths directly from the blasts.  This would total in the hundreds of millions as all combatants would target their bombs on military installations, manufacturing, transportation, and population centers.  </p>
<p>Secondary deaths would outnumber the primary wave, and would result from the survivors in the most affected regions dying as a result of irradiation, injuries sustained in the primary blasts, and just plain hunger.  For instance, in the USA, there would be no intact infrastructure larger than medium sized towns.  Remaining hospitals would be overwhelmed, damns would have collapsed, crops would perish due to irradiation or lack of watering due to the destruction of all public utilities (water, gas, electric).  Aid would be impossible because all transportation infrastructure would be gone, and almost all first world countries would be damaged to some extent.  All in all it could be expected that deaths in the affected region would probably total over a billion within a few years.  </p>
<p>The last and hardest to quantify damage would be due to the collapse of modern civilization.  This is the hardest element to predict.  Large portions of the world would not be directly affected by the bombing, including all of the southern hemisphere and the more isolated regions of the northern hemisphere.  Potentially these countries could maintain their level of civilization and &quot;replace&quot; the extinct nuclear powers within a few decades.  More likely, the indirect effects of the bombing would cause these civilizations to collapse as well.  The radical shift in world power would result in political instability which would be exacerbated by extreme shortages of goods which used to be produced by the (nuked) major powers.  Electronics, heavy machinery, refined metal, and pharmaceutical plants would be concentrated in the first world, and so would be destroyed.  World trade would come to a halt, so even if goods were still being produced in some regions, they could not be moved across the world.  It is quite possible that within decades the remaining population of the world would be living in conditions which were at best similar to those of the 19th century with only limited medical and machine technology and no meaningful electrical capability.  This reduction in living standard would result in massive deaths due to the lack of modern medicine and the decreased ability to farm and distribute food without modern technology (fertilizers, tractors, refrigerated rapid food transport).  Resource scarcity breeds political unrest, so many of the deaths may occur due to violent revolutions or wars.  </p>
<p>Assuming the collapse of technological civilization, within a century the population of Earth might be reduced back to pre-technological levels of 1-2 billion.  This would mean the toll of the nuclear war was greater than 50% of the world's population.  </p>
<p>The regions hardest hit by nuclear bombs, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and northern Asia would have the worst long term outcome.  Basically all high and medium technology would be destroyed.  There would be no intact transportation, industry, government, or population centers.  Even without considering nuclear fallout, the people remaining in these regions would be reduced to basically stone age levels of civilization.  Rebuilding would be basically out of the question; what would you rebuild with when you have no ability to make even basic tools?  Assuming these survivors were left in peace, it would take centuries to rebuild to modern levels.  Of course, these people wouldn't be left in peace.  The vast expanses of territory would be too appetizing to the new emerging world powers from the less affected areas of the world.  There would likely be a colonization rush similar to the colonization of the Americas by the Europeans in the 16th century.  </p>
<p>The nuclear effects of massive bombing would be severe but short term.  Areas which were heavily bombed would be uninhabitable for decades but not lifetimes.  Worldwide atmospheric background radiation would spike, but not to levels which are lethal or even particularly detrimental (people living in certain areas with high levels of natural radiation such as Colorado already get multiple times more background radiation than average with no ill effects).  There is the possibility that countries could use weapons which were deliberately designed to produce massive fallout, such as cobalt jacketed bombs.  These bombs could render areas uninhabitable for a century or more, but the radiation would cease to be mobile after a few days or weeks as the dust literally settled, which would fix the contaminated zone's boundaries.  Assuming the heavy use of these weapons, it might be possible to render an area as large as the east coast of North America uninhabitable for several generations.  </p>
<p>Climate predictions are also hard to make.  The idea of nuclear winter comes from the fact that huge amounts of dust and ash would be released into the atmosphere.  We know that airborne particulates cause climate cooling due to correlations between large volcanic eruptions and short term climate change in recorded history.  However, predicting the exact amount of cooling is impossible.  We can't accurately predict the weather 4 days from now, let alone the global consequences of a hypothetical world war.  It seems likely that a large scale nuclear war would release atmospheric particulates to a level which would rival the eruption of a large volcano such as Krakatoa in 1883.  This eruption was estimated around 200MT equivalent, and altered the climate for 5 years.  Atmospheric particular release will not scale linearly with explosion size and there are many other factors which will contribute, but the idea that the resulting cool period would be fatal to life on earth is pretty laughable; life has survived far worse.  For instance, the KT Impact event was estimated to be the equivalent of 100 terratonnes of TNT.  This is the equivalent of 2 million of the largest nuclear weapon ever tested, and around 10 million of the largest weapons which were ever deployed.  By contrast, there are estimated to be around 15,000 existing nuclear weapons, and the total peaked around 52,000 at the end of the cold war.  Most of these weapon were/are far smaller than the largest weapons ever built or deployed, which were not terribly practical to use.  Despite the cataclysmic KT event, complex plant and animal life survived on the surface of the earth.  Humans are the most adaptable complex life for to have yet evolved, so it is hard to believe we would be driven extinct by a nuclear winter when squirrels (or squirrel like creates) managed to survive the KT event.  </p>
<p>The scenario I am describing was considered worst case in the 1970s or 1980s.  Several things have changed since then.  For one thing, the distribution of high technology has spread since that time.  There high tech industries mentioned (electronics, resource refining, heavy manufacturing, pharmaceuticals) are now spread out into many areas of the world so the destruction of the major powers would leave more functional infrastructure behind.  Secondly, the cooling and then end of the cold war resulted in massive reductions in the number and flexibility of the nuclear arsenals of the world.  The number of warheads has been massively decreased, meaning that fewer targets would be destroyed.  Certain types of weapons like short and medium range nuclear warheads have been practically eliminated.  This means that Europe would likely be far less damaged by a nuclear war, since Europe was the primary location and target of shorter range weapons.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! After doing some research myself some time so, I realized the apocalyptic scenario of nuclear war was no where near apocalyptic. Everyone thinks nuclear winter would be a death blow to humanity, and that radiation would linger like in Fallout, but that is just not the case.</p>
<p>Yes, be afraid of them, but civilization will continue after a war. For now at least.</p></div>		</li>
