			<div class="markdown"><p>The technical term for schemes like this is &quot;manufactured spending&quot;.</p>
<p>It tends to be a touchy subject and those who engage in these practices will often refuse to talk about it because once they find a loophole they realize the longer they keep it secret the longer it might take before it gets closed, so they have no incentive to share. Which is sometimes ironic considering they probably wouldn't know about it had someone not shared it with them in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The dude knew what he was doing and started threatening and weeping and dramaring. Digging himself a hole. If he'd just walked away, we wouldn't have found out about the cash back scheme. </p>

<p>Several years ago there was still the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/us-mint-ends-the-dollar-coin-scam-for-airline-miles-2011-7" target="_blank">great dollar coin initiative</a> which allowed people to basically farm rewards points.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a great explanation but fundamentally I think the answer can be simplified</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewards are paid by you and specifically by those with worse rewards and outstanding dept</li>
<li>The worst hit are cash (+debit) purchasers who pay a premium to fund your card purchase and rewards incentive</li>
<li>Everyone redeems less than what is made on your transaction*s in fees as a rule.</li>
<li>You get better rewards by spending more, there are some marginal benefits to be found for specific customers e.g. travel cards for business travelers</li>
<li>Sometimes you get good deals based on individual partnerships or circumstances</li>
<li>Upgrades are nice and take fewer points than outright buying flights and hotels on points</li>
<li>Its an easy way for an employer to throw a small incentive on employee expense  instead of purchasing, e.g. travel and equipment</li>

<p>Not necessarily true. If a credit card offers 5% cash back, your card issuer is giving you points at a loss, since the merchant discount rate or transaction fee doesn't go higher than about ~3%. The issuer usually advertises that 5% in one category hoping that you'll use that card for every purchase where they only give you 1%. If you only ever utilize that card for the maximum rewards <em>and pay off your bill at the end of the month</em>, they don't make money from you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>credit rewards are taxed above a certain nominal amount</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That shouldn't be happening. Credit rewards are considered rebates for money spent, so they should be untaxed. Maybe you're thinking of bank account sign up bonuses which count as interest payments?</p></div>		</li>

<p>True, there are promotions (with limits) that can be good deals on specific vendors or sectors or specific cards, but on the aggregate you pay more than you get back month-to-month unless you are very specific with purchases,  it's high stakes arcade tickets.  </p>

<p>I should have been more clear, The tax issue is if you collect reward and cash back on reimbursed, business purchases as opposed to personal ones . Then it may be considered a form of income. Rewards on flights alone for a regular business traveler can be significant and equivalent to a few $k in extra income. </p>
<p>Regular day-to-day rewards and cash back you are absolutely correct, I edited my answer to be clear (related to the previous bullet in my list)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having operated quite a few credit terminals, I have some input. The lowest fee added to a card is about 2.5% on Visa/master. This may or may not be accompanied by a set charge of say 50 cents on every swipe. A discover card will normally be at around 4 or 5% fee on the transaction and amex around 6% per transaction. However, rewards cards have an added percentage fee added to the sale varying from 1 to 4% depending on the card. So the best amex card adds 10% on to the transaction. Obviously this 10% isn't added on to your credit swipe, it's been included in the cost of goods. </p>
<p>So if you go somewhere that takes cash only and they aren't paying ~10% less then you are getting less value. It's also the reason many places don't take amex, as a 10% hike in price to facilitate one brand of card doesn't make sense for low price items. </p>
<p>Tl;Dr : your rewards points are paid  out with your own money from the things you bought, after the store uses it to pay the credit companies for the privilege of accepting their card; the rewards points made the cost of everything rise accordingly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, the bank/lender will usually apply higher percentage cash-back rewards to certain categories (i.e. gas, groceries) as long as the purchases do not exceed a predefined, quarterly amount. In other words, you may get 3% cash back for all gas purchases up to $1000 during the 3 month period; however, once that limit is exceeded, you are only entitled to 1% back until the next quarter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Yours is definitely more concise, I was trying to explain it more as an ELI5 since I think a lot of people genuinely don't understand how RPs work.  </p>
<p>The taxes aspect is tricky because it's typically seen as a discount on the purchase, so not technically income. This is what I use as reference - <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/110614/are-credit-card-rewards-considered-taxable-income-irs.asp" target="_blank">http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/110614/are-credit-card-rewards-considered-taxable-income-irs.asp</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. I use my credit card with 3% cash back on everything. I always pay it so I have no interest and no annual fees. It doesn't amount to a bunch, but does get me a free couple hundred bucks a year. The only thing that doesn't go on it is my mortgage which has to be from a checking account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great breakdown; Here's a question that I haven't seen but sparked a thought regarding people that never carry a balance i.e. pay the balance in full each cycle. So I have the Chase Amazon Prime Rewards Card Review – 5% Back on Amazon and lesser percentages for gas, groceries, restaurants, etc. There is no reported monthly/annual &quot;cash back&quot; limit I could find. I tend to put all of my expenses (Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, regular Amazon purchases, gas, groceries, utilities, insurance, memberships, etc) on this card and just pay it in full at the end of the month. Netting a cool $125/mo in cash rewards usable on Amazon. Holidays and birthdays net higher rewards with my highest being around $240 that month. There's no annual fee and they aren't making any money from interest. In the grand scheme of things, my monthly rewards are chump change but I am not making them any money. Do consumers like me get cards cancelled or restricted after this kind of use?</p>
<p>edit: missed an amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fall (sorta) into this category. The merchant is taking 2-5% of the sale price and in exchange I get just under 2% cash back. They'd prefer I spend more because the costs of keeping a card open are mostly fixed (monthly statement), but their take is based on a percentage of what I spend (some directly, some indirectly through float, interest, etc.). So they like more the more I spend.</p></div>		</li>
