<p>Average annual household power usage in the US: 10,766kWh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this a mathematical average including industrial uses or is this really the average of a &quot;normal&quot; household?</p>
<p>The German &quot;standard household&quot; has an average of only 3207 kWh.
What are you using so much power for?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, German houses are smaller with fewer people. And more appliances use gas vs electricity in the US.  US Electricity is about 1/3rd of the cost of German electricity, which explains why we use it to heat and cook with more than the Germans do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you use electricity for heating?
If yes than I understand where this number comes from.</p>
<p>I lived in an apartment that had an electric heating and I had about the same usage.</p>
<p>But this is really uncommon in Germany.</p>
<p>Average usage is as follows:
houshold with:
one person     : 2300 kWh
two persons   : 3000 kWh
three persons : 3600 kWh
four persons  : 4000 kWh
five persons  : 5000 kWh</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the maths and that makes the point very well. Unplugging or switching off at the socket will probably save a little but nothing significant compared to other ways to reduce energy usage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is so insignificant that it isn't worth the time and effort, honestly.</p>
<p>There are, as you said, things you could do that would dramatically decrease your wasted money. A single shower costs between $0.10 and $0.25 (there are a lot of assumptions you can make that causes wide variation). Simply taking a short shower every other day, in which you only clean the important bits, can save you $9.13 to $22.81 annually per person.</p>
<p>In a 5 person household, you've got about $50 to $100 in savings by barely changing anything.</p>
<p>You can also turn the heat down by 3 deg. F. and save 10% of your heating bill. Wear a sweater around the house and boom, you've saved about $15 to $90 during the cold season.</p></div>		</li>
