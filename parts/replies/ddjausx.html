			<div class="markdown"><p>Well written!
The federal government of the United States derives the power to rule from the <em>consent</em> of the citizenry.  Thus the citizenry have the right to modify the power of the federal government at any time, without the consent of the federal government, through constitutional conventions which are called by the citizenry, and whose findings (amendments) are approved by the individual states.</p>
<p>Another practical example of who holds the ultimate power:  jury nullification.  A jury is under <em>no obligation</em> to follow the law in a finding of guilt.  Huh?  If a jury decides a law which a person has been charged with breaking is unjust, the jury can declare defendant not guilty.  So any group of 12 citizens can override Congress (who wrote the law), the Supreme Court (who interprets the law), and the President (who executes the law), without repercussion.  To be clear, jury nullification also holds at the state level as well, overriding the state legislature, state court, and governor, respectively.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second example appears to be where the separation of church and state becomes somewhat murky. Someone can accurately argue that the Constitution was, at least in part, founded on Christian ideals, and should therefore be interpreted from a Christian standpoint. But the Constitution explicitly forbids favouring one religion over another. How do you reconcile that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The bill for establishing religious freedom, the principles of which had, to a certain degree, been enacted before, I had drawn in all the latitude of reason and right. It still met with opposition; but, with some mutilations in the preamble, it was finally passed; and a singular proposition proved that its protection of opinion was meant to be universal. Where the preamble declares, that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, an amendment was proposed, by inserting the word &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; so that it should read, &quot;a departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion;&quot; the insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend, within the mantle of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and Infidel of every denomination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Jefferson's autobiography.</p>
<p>The Constitution does not prohibit the favoring of one religion over another in a purely textual reading, it prohibits the establishment of an official church.</p>
<p>I think that its very important that it be interpreted from a Christian standpoint for two main reasons.</p>
<p>It draws heavily on Christian themes found in both the New Testament and Old. When they talk about Judeo-Christian values, most politicians are referencing a concept of free-will and equality before God. There is no inherent value outside your humanity before God, and thus should be none before government. Jesus saw equal value in his disciples as he saw among the tax collectors and prostitutes, thus equal rights should be attended to those as well. The rights granted are not rights granted to believers, to the saved, to the holy, but to all. The sinners and opposers of what any might consider the just or proper order have just as much right to rights as the defenders of justice or order. There's no inherent value in birthright (a descent form Mohammed for example) or a class you must be contained in. </p>
<p>Secondly, it needs to be interpreted as the final and supreme power, only second to The Creator. The Declaration, Constitution, state Constitutions, and most thought among the writers, founders, and early leaders, that the rights and protections of the government were sacred as they protected those derived from God. Taking an atheistic view of rights would remove that &quot;higher granted power&quot;-ish attribute of rights. If rights are not derived from a higher power than man's creation, they can be removed by the highest power of man's creation. If rights weren't sacred in an individual, there is no logical reason that rights found at a certain time could not be unfound at a later time.</p>
<p>An equal access to religious practice and belief is not incoherent with a recognition of one having an outsized influence compared to the others. A worship in a non-Christian belief system does not undermine or change the fact that a Christian influenced philosophical system is the underpinning of the Constitution. </p></div>		</li>
