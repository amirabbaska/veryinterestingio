			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a pilot, I've never heard that in our training. What I do know is that improper injection can kill you instantly. The force at ejection can skyrocket momentarily to 20+ Gs and if your spine is not straight, meaning you're not sitting in the proper position, your neck will snap like a twig.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've just done some looking at I couldn't find any reputable sources to corroborate the shortening thing - it is repeated persistently around the net though! I'm inclined to think that maybe it's a wives tale if you are a pilot and you haven't heard about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's more on the landing than the actual ejection. A buddy of mine was Airborne and he's 2 full inches shorter now than he was when he joined the army 15 years ago. As a PT student, I'd kill to get an image of his spine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main chute is actually fired off of the seat by way of a mortar, while still in the package. The pilot chute deploys when the packing pin is released, allowing the pilot chute to extract the recovery chute from the module, albeit in a reefed form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also serves the purpose of righting the ejection seat so that the pilot isn't completely upside down when the main chute comes out. Sometimes egress happens when the plane is inverted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not.  The pilot chute is smaller,  so less mass to spring out.  </p></div>		</li>
