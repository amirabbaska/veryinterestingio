<p>They didn't get flat without the rolling.  Rolled oats are also going to be &quot;cooked&quot; or &quot;par cooked&quot;.  Almost all oats are cooked to keep them from sprouting in storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  Most oats are heated to stop the germination process as well... long before they are sent to be turned into oatmeal.  So most oats will have likely been steamed/heated at least once if not twice in their lifetime before ending up in your bowl/blender.</p></div>		</li>
