			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice! I can't blame people that don't want to eat food that doesn't taste good. The regulations for school meals kind of drive me nuts because they demonize and limit fat and salt so much. Steamed broccoli with a little butter and a sprinkling of salt is so much tastier than plain steamed broccoli. They offer steamed spinach in the cafeteria in our district (I'm a dietitian that tries to encourage kids in the schools to eat healthier but I have nothing to do with the menus/cafeteria) and I don't even want to try it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter and I both fall on the spectrum, and have hypersensitivity issues. Eating fibrous vegetables (which are usually the best ones health-wise) is a chore for us, so anything to make them taste better is awesome. Otherwise we end up eating nothing but corn and carrots (which don't have all of the health benefits of veggies like green beans and spinach). </p></div>		</li>
