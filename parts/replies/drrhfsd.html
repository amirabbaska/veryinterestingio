<p>Basically, IPS panels can be viewed at any angle (up to 178 degrees) without the colors changing. Generally used in reference to computer displays. The other main type is TN, in which the colors wash out unless you look at it directly from the front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also VA displays (PVA, MVA and similar). They are rare but usually have better black level than IPS but worse angles of view and some problems near black. I preferred them over IPS for watching videos due to the higher static contrast and lower blacl level. Nothing beats OLED in that regard though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plasmas were good technology, but the shift to 4k and hdr made it too expensive to keep making since they sold in low numbers (hard to compete with LCD when companies rename LCD tech every few years) . The best plasma sets (2013 Panasonic and the older Kuro sets) still have better SDR PQ than any LCD set, and have better motion characteristics and near-black uniformity than OLED. Plasma also has perfect viewing angles, which not even OLED can claim</p>
<p>I'll be rocking my Panasonic St60 until HDMI 2.1 is implemented. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember, plasma was basically dead long before 4K and HDR started to become popular. Their main downfall was that they were more expensive, and couldn't/weren't being made at smaller screen sizes. Also, didn't they have reflectivity/glaring issues in bright rooms since the screen had to be glass? That's a pretty big con since a lot of homes put their TVs in well-lit rooms.</p>
<p>By the way, any source you can provide on plasma having better black uniformity than OLED?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also they 'died' because they were power hogs - my PS42C450 plasma consumes 135W when powered on, similar 40&quot; LCD TV consumes ~50W.</p>
<p>That causes higher energy bills, more difficult and expensive design to dissipate heat and TV more prone to damage (heat is always an enemy of electronics).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do better job on the near-black. I'm on a phone so I can't really dig around, but if you look into LG OLED reviews at all, you'll see how they have banding and uniformity issues in the near-blacks.</p>
<p>Also, peak light output was lower than LCD  which is why they weren't as good for a lit room, but progress was being made in that area. The Samsung F8500 was near an LCD in peak light output, but unfortunately that was the last model that Samsung made. HDR was probably unattainable with the types of light-output required, not without ridiculous power consumption at least. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plasmas weren’t more expensive at all. Your Pioneer and Pioneer Kuros were an exception but Samsung and Panasonic plasma panels ruled the larger sizes because they were at a lower cost than a large LCD. You are correct in that the smallest plasma was 37” (rare, I believe Panasonic), so their lack of smaller options didn’t help their popularity. They did have a glass panel but their bright room performance wasn’t any better or worse than higher-end LED and OLED that have a high gloss panel now. I have a Sony A1E and I see every light in my house when they're on. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it accurate to say the S8 has a &quot;more retina&quot; screen than the iPhone because of this?  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a marketing name, and Apple has defined it in a binary fashion. The S8 qualifies. The S8's PPI is higher than the iPhones, but this doesn't tell the whole story, due to the S8's different subpixel arrangement:</p>
<p>The iPhone 8 has an <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QTDpCTC.jpg" target="_blank">RGB-strip subpixel arrangement</a>. Every 'pixel' is made up of 3 subpixels, one red, one green, one blue. This is what people tend to expect a pixel to be.</p>
<p>The S8 has a <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/close-up-S8.jpg" target="_blank">pentile subpixel arrangement</a>. Every pixel contains only 2 subpixels -- one green subpixel, and <em>either</em> a red, or a blue subpixel. So, there are more pixels in the S8, but each pixel is 'incomplete'.</p>
<p>If you look at a purely black+blue or black+red image, the S8 can only resolve 283.5 pixels per inch. You won't see many images like that, of course. Outside of pathological cases, the combination of the pentile layout and some clever antialiasing in the software means that the 'brightness' resolution matches the stated DPI, while the 'colour' resolution is half that. And people notice the brightness resolution more than colour. </p>
<p>Nonetheless -- if they're both at the same DPI, the RGB layout has more detail. Thus, pentile displays need higher DPIs to be 'good enough'. OTOH, the RGB layout needs 1.5x the subpixels for a given DPI, so RGB is more difficult/expensive to produce at a given DPI.</p>
<p>In the end, Pentile makes sense in the context of Samsung's OLEDs, and the RGB strip makes sense in LCDs, and both phones are good enough that the pixels are undetectable in normal use. </p>
<p>Samsung certainly thinks so -- while the S8 has a 2960x1440 <em>panel</em>, it runs the OS at 2220x1080 [428ppi] by default. They wouldn't do that if the 1440p resolution was visibly 'better'.</p>
<p>You should be looking elsewhere for differentiation [EG: iPhone 8's better colour uniformity; S8's higher contrast ratio, or maybe Razer for 120Hz refresh, iOS vs Android, etc.].</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that’s because they came up with it back in 2010, with the iPhone 4, which had double the pixel density of previous iPhones, and most phones from other manufacturers at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can argue that above a certain DPI, more pixels don't translate into a better user experience. Just like &quot;Retina&quot; is just marketing, so is one-upping the competition by increasing the resolution for the purposes of the spec-sheet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to demostrate printers in large pc shops. At times there were other reps in claiming X dpi resolutions so I usually got everyone to have a copy of one print and let the customers battle it out. However the problem came when Epson tried to market HD printing which was a load of bollocks and buzzwords. I always won the print off as I was demoing a machine that used 6 inks as it had a greater range of colours but just not as a high resolution as another manufacturers which only had 4.</p></div>		</li>
