			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly right. I'm providing a source that we discussed in my wetland ecology class- because it's springer, you'd have to pay for it, but the summary does a decent job of explaining it. Good stuff!</p>

<p>C3 plants have the capability to grow more in the rising levels</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You mention that C3 plants have the <em>capability</em> to take advantage of rising CO2 levels, but I'm wondering if this actually happens in practice. </p>
<p>This is not my field, but as I understand it, CO2 is not the rate-limiting factor for most plants growing in nature, but rather nitrogen fixation. In that case, increasing CO2 levels won't matter even for C3 plants if soil nitrogen doesn't also increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you're absolutely right. Elevated CO2 levels will benefit C3 plants if the other conditions/inputs are optimal. In greenhouse plant productions use of supplemental CO2 is a common practice to boost growth rates. For example in greenhouse tomato production CO2 levels are elevated to 700-1200 ppm (ambient environmental CO2 levels are ~420 ppm).</p>
<p>Rising CO2 levels will benefit plants that do have excess NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium are the &quot;main&quot; plant macronutrients) and can take advantage of possible growth increases. You correctly mentioned nitrogen content as a major limiting factor. Nitrogen is actually critical in the synthesis of RuBisCO, the first enzyme I mentioned involved in photosynthesis. Without enough nitrogen to produce the RuBisCO required to take advantage of photosynthetic gains from elevated CO2, productivity remains the same. As with everything relating to climate change, it is difficult to calculate what type of impact the changing environmental conditions will have. Crop studies using Free Air CO2 Enrichment techniques (FACE) in optimal conditions have shown increased growth but also include unforseen negative consequences.</p>
<p>For example there is evidence suggesting that elevated CO2 can repress expression of genes involved in the production of jasmonic acid (JA), a plant defense compound used to deter pests and pathogens. Elevated CO2 can potentially increase(or potentially decrease) susceptibility to some pathogens/pests. The following is a free paper about the topic of CO2 fertilization and disease susceptibility: <a href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/04/jxb.eru538.full.pdf" target="_blank">http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/04/jxb.eru538.full.pdf</a></p></div>		</li>
