			<div class="markdown"><p>And it maybe should be noted that the step from &quot;breakeven&quot; to &quot;producing useful electricity&quot; is still a big one (much less economic viability, which is due to a lot of other external factors as well — e.g., competing with fossil fuels). We haven't yet got Q=1 much less the Q=20 or so that we would need to make fusion power a serious part of our energy requirements. </p>
<p>My usual line to people: fusion is an important long-term investment. But it's not likely to contribution in a big way our energy needs in yours or my lifetimes. That shouldn't discourage work on it, or discourage funding on it. But it isn't going to fix climate change or anything like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the advances in harnessing solar power, is it possible nuclear fusion may never become a worthwhile means of producing energy? Or is the potential Q-factor for fusion power so high that it's only a question of when, not if?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure we have really solid answers in this category or not. At large scales fusion reactions have phenomenal energy density — they are the most energy-dense form of power production we might have short of matter-antimatter. (Deuterium-tritium reactions is something like 3X more energy-dense than uranium fission — you get 3X more energy per gram of material than you do uranium in a reactor.) But can you make a machine that extracts that usefully, at cost? That's the big question. </p>
<p>We can make fusion reactions at a small scale, we can make them at a huge scale. What we want is many of them at a medium scale — more reactions than a lab experiment, but not so many that it becomes a bomb (much less a star). So far that's proven very difficult for reasons of both physics and engineering. Extracting useful power necessarily involves other inefficiencies as well. Again, I think it's worth pursuing, in the sense that we need to diversify our research into all manner of carbon-neutral power technologies. And hot fusion, unlike cold fusion, actually does clearly exist in the universe in ways that produce excess power (and we can do it, again, at very large scales, in weapons), so there's no <em>a priori</em> scientific reason it shouldn't be possible to accomplish it at a medium scale that we know of. But accomplishing that has been tricky as hell, despite a lot of very smart people working on the problem for a pretty long amount of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the key issues of Solar power is that while, no matter how good we get in sucking that sweet energy out of the sun, we are really, really not that great at saving power for later use.</p>
<p>This turns into a key problem with power sources that generate energy only for some hours a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fusion has the potential to be much more effective for longer and for significantly less environmental cost than solar. Solar is great, but it requires lots of mining and processing, and needs regular replacement and expansion, and takes up quite a bit of space.</p>
<p>An effective fusion strategy would offer far more energy, with fewer requirements. Solar might be able to meet most of the worlds energy needs when coupled with better batteries, if we really work at it. Fusion could meet all that and then have enough leftover energy to re-capture all this carbon we pumped into the atmosphere, with a bunch left over, and it runs on common and abundant materials.</p>
<p>&quot;could&quot; implying an element of chance that it won't. But it's still worth pursuing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a remarkably short sighted view. Nobody cared about solar in the 1980s either. It was an expensive, inefficient, niche technology. Most people laughed at the idea of grid scale solar and nobody thought it would be a reality in their lifetimes.</p>
<p>All fusion needs at this point is to be taken seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be happy to be proven wrong! But at the moment, practical fusion power has been overhyped for literally six decades. Yes, it could have been funded more, and maybe there would have been more progress if it had been. But even the big investments, the &quot;moon shots,&quot; the supposedly proofs-of-concept, have not performed as expected (case in point, NIF). So my attitude is: don't bank on it. Plan for it <em>not</em> to be available. Still research it! But it can't be part of a plan of things that we need in the next few decades — there is far too much uncertainty still, and we have options that don't require as many risks and hopes already on the table. If we get lucky and it seems like something is actually doable, by all means, invest heavily. But there is danger in over-investing, in over-hyping: when it doesn't pay off, people become cynical, and start saying the whole thing is rubbish. I don't think that. But I don't think it's right around the corner. Again, I would love to be wrong about that.</p>
<p>Also, I think you are being a little pessimistic on how solar was viewed in the 1980s — <a href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/solar_timeline.pdf" target="_blank">there were already active solar plants by 1982</a>. Proofs of concept that could feed active power into the grid. With plans to scale up. They were already using solar cells on spaceships, etc. We aren't in a situation like that with fusion — we still can't produce net energy. So there's a big difference there, in my view.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Technically, it doesn't need to be taken that seriously, it just needs to be funded as if it was. </p></div>		</li>
