			<div class="markdown"><p>I wondered if anyone would make that link, in jest or not. :)
Stansted apparently means &quot;stony place&quot;, &quot;stan&quot; being an old alternate word for stone in English.</p>
<p>A similar idea exists in the name of Torpenhow Hill, in Cumbria in the north of England. Apparently the different elements in it means it translates into modern English as &quot;Hillhillhill Hill&quot;, if broken down like so: &quot;tor&quot; is accepted to be an old Proto-Celtic word for hill, &quot;Pen&quot; is modern Welsh for hill (the people of Cumbria used to speak a form of Welsh), &quot;how&quot; (originally &quot;haugr&quot;) is Old Norse for Hill, and Hill is, well, hill. </p>
<p>While this explanation isn't fully accepted by all linguists, it's a nice illustration of how waves of migration and cultural and linguistic changes have left their mark on English place names.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The use of -stead in the english word &quot;instead&quot; is the same.  It literally means &quot;in place of&quot;.  stead means place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, Swedish words for town are both &quot;Stad&quot; and &quot;Stan,&quot; with slightly different connotations between the two.</p>
<p>So Ystad, is most likely Y-City. Afghanistan is most nearly directly translated to Afghani-Town. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on this, 'i' is Swedish for 'in', and 'staden' (the city) is often shortened to 'stan' in colloquial Swedish. So Afghanistan can also be translated as &quot;Afghan in the city&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have thought of that, considering I was walking around Gamla Stan a few years ago! It is interesting that Swedish kept the -n ending.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As Lingonfrost said, it's actually Staden that has been shortened to Stan. Where Staden means &quot;the city&quot; and stad means &quot;city&quot;</p></div>		</li>
