			<div class="markdown"><p>He was right. A series of tubes is actually a pretty good, high-level, analogy for the internet. It explains routing, information flow, and even bandwidth. The problem was that, if you listen to the rest of his speech, he clearly didn't understand the technology, which, given his position on the committee, was a problem.</p>
<p>Tldr </p>
<p>He got a lot of shit wrong, but his &quot;series of tubes&quot; analog was the closest thing to being right he said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The statement that &quot;it's a series of tubes&quot; is a good enough analogy for the context. It was the other nutbar stuff he was saying that a lot of us made fun of him for at the time. </p>
<p>In any event, I didn't post it to make fun of him. I thought the statement was appropriate here as part of an ELI5.</p></div>		</li>
