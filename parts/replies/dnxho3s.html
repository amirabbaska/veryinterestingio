			<div class="markdown"><p>gasoline in addition to containing hydrocarbons with various chain lengths (which would affect their exact freezing point) also contains other additives. They're all in solution together at room/normal temperatures, but they might not completely go back into solution together upon melting. I can imagine a scenario where you'd end up with little lumps or threads of some of these additives that got concentrated when the main body of the gasoline re-melted around them. This would be especially true if the additives had a much higher melting point than the hydrocarbons in gasoline itself, allowing them to gather into larger clumps as they remained solid floating in the hydrocarbon soup. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, its composition doesn't change. It may selectively freeze if you slowly lower the temperature, so that some of it is solid and other parts of it liquid, but when its all liquid it will be plain old gasoline. Dissolved gas content may change. Not all engines will operate at super low temps though, but that wouldn't be the gasolines fault.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually worried about a tiny part: gasoline is not a single element, but many compound disolved one in the other. For example, there is butane in good quantity in the gasoline. Butane is a gas, but can be disolved in the gasoline and stay liquid.</p>
<p>My concern is that due to the different freezing point of the elements that it separate the elements and you ends up with something else, that may also still burn, but less energy. I'm particularly concerned by the butane. If the liquid that hold it freeze before it, then it will release the butane. It may still freeze, but when it thraw it will most likelly then just go in gas and escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since gasoline is a homogenous solution you don't have to worry about. Homogenous means that the properties, including melting point, of the mixture are the same throughout the mixture. This happens when you have a mixture of liquids that are miscible with each other. Gasoline is a mixture of hydrocarbons and ethanol  (10% In US) and some additives which are miscible with each other. </p>
<p>Changing the temperature will have an impact on vapor pressures of the components which will change composition, but if the system is closed then you won't lose any butane and the vapor pressures will go back to where they were when you return to room temp.</p>
<p>If you had a heterogeneous liquid, or emulsion, (for example milk) then freezing would become an issue. If you've ever heard of curdled milk, it is when you break up the dispersion causing it to separate into two different liquids. This can be done my freezing it. Dispersions are a delicate balance and it can be nearly impossible to reverse curdling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't it only burn in its gaseous/vaporous state though? Like, when it's a liquid, it's the vapours/evaporate that are burning, not the liquid petrol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Gas needs a good amount of o2 which isn't contained in the frozen gas. So the vapor as it melts is what is lighting. </p></div>		</li>
