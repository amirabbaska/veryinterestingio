			<div class="markdown"><p><em>-20°C is just like any other frosty day</em>
????</p>
<p>Where I grew up in Australia, the coldest I ever saw was around -2°C, and that was in the middle of the night. During the day it was probably around 15-20°C</p>
<p>Right now it's around 5°C during the day (I live in France now), and I was prescribed 6 different creams and 2 types of medication because my skin gets all sorts of fucked up in the &quot;cold&quot;. I use quotation marks because it's fucking <em>5°C</em>, and here you are talking so nonchalantly about -20°C being just a classic frosty day</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all honesty, everything between -5°C and -20°C feels very much the same (apart from wind chill). It's only when you go colder that it starts to seep into your bones faster, and is definitely noticeable.</p>
<p>I go hiking with my friends and we sleep in hammocks or open lean-tos, and we consider -5°C to be our casual comfort limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya -5 C is a good temperature. Very comfortable to do outdoor activities and the dogs are pretty happy.</p>
<p>After -10 C dog jackets need to go on. -15 C and dog boots need to go on which is a pain in the ass for everyone involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After -30 the snow starts to change, it sounds different when you walk on it. It can become very pretty in the deep freeze of winter, sometimes you get almost absolute silence out in the woods.</p>
<p>Edit: That plus trees start to explode!</p></div>		</li>

The trees explode? Can you elaborate??</p>
<p>Hey, any of you guys been in 45 C and above?
What's worse? The extreme cold or the extreme heat?
I'd say the cold but that's because I'm not used to it </p></div>		</li>

<p>-40 F = -40 C btw<br />
-10 F = -23 C which is a pretty common temp for much of winter in the north.</p>
<p>literally -2 C tonight where I live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's not generally weather for sticking around, but it sure won't kill you. That same winter we hit -35°C, when normal cars would struggle to start, it was about -50°C in Moscow. I've no idea how they manage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They must all have engine block heaters, or indoor parking. I've only been out in temps below -40° (with windchill) once or twice, and it feels like we'll normally hover between 0 to 20°F highs in January with usually one or two 3-day stretches or so where we don't get above 0°F. It's never the cold that gets you though, it's the damn wind.</p>
<p>I actually love it though. It's one of the most beautiful and peaceful times of the year if you can stand going outside. </p>
<p>Just looked it up, we're coldest major metro in the US according to weather.com, go Twin Cities lol </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess they use block heaters (diesel/petrol or electric).<br />
The old method is to fire up a small fire beneath the engine. Not the safest of methods, but I guess you do what you have to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can confirm frosty eyelashes are super annoying. Usually during -20°C only my beard freezes but as soon as it's -30°C or lower my eyelashes freeze a bunch. The worst is when you blink and they get stuck together</p></div>		</li>
