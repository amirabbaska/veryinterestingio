			<div class="markdown"><p>Why can't every issue be explained like this across all media?  Why do we do it to ourselves, we cloud our own judgement on issues by making it seem like, at least on this issue, President Trump just signed a bill allowing coal miners to dump waste into streams.  And just to be clear, the right is no better.  There is 110% a real explanation, you sir have given it.  This should be the news. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a 110% real explanation. The above commenter does not have a sufficient grasp of the way federal law operates, so they have provided an oversimplified explanation that aligns with &quot;conservative&quot; ideas of limited government and everything anti-Obama. When you look at it more closely, this rule specifically covered a gap in federal law and was intended to (1) save money by preventing dumping and expensive litigation after the fact, (2) save lives before people are affected by mining slag leaching into groundwater, and (3) save the environment before dumping happens. Acting preemptively when mining companies are known for abusing the law is not overreach. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I understand it, they would have had to submit some sort of environmental impact study that included areas outside of the permit area, essentially downstream of their site.  Any impacts off site they would have to remediate and any streams that were affected during mining would have to be reclaimed with vegetative buffers for wildlife.  It also mentions the water table, which is more of a concern for underground mining than surface mining that actually mines through the water table in some places.  The quality of this plan would hinge their permit for approval, which could slow down the process of opening a new mine.  </p>
<p>Though I agree it was rushed through and is purposely vague, you can't write a bill dealing with reclamation very specifically.  Every stream and water table is different and it is up to the company to identify these areas and how they need to control runoff and how they will need to reclaim the site.  This is no different that just about any commercial operation dealing with run-off.  </p>
<p>Even shopping malls have to create run-off plans and every commercial facility has to create a monitoring program for stormwater leaving the site.  They test for all sorts of contaminants at outflow sites to make sure what they are releasing doesn't hurt the stream.  This would have just put coal operations in line with other businesses and added some assurances for downstream mitigation and reclamation of streams.  </p>
<p>When people say that it is now allowing waste to be placed in streams, that's not really true.  Coal mining companies don't really produce waste in the literal sense.  They create overburden which is just dirt and rock from above the coal seams.  These are handled in different ways but largely placed in &quot;hollow fills&quot; where they fill the head of a valley with the overburden.  This essentially fills in the upper most headwaters of a small stream.  Most would be intermittent streams.  </p>
<p>Coal mining can and does contaminate drinking water through the water table and run-off, but that is more to do with changing the aquifers through underground mining or seepage through certain types of rock that are saline or acidic in nature.  </p>
<p>Where the impacts from waste are is in the treatment side.  Unless a coal mining operation is huge or plans to be at one site for a very long time, the coal is shipped off to a treatment plant, called a tipple.  There the coal is further processes and treated to remove slate and rock from the coal.  This by product is placed in essentially landfills adjacent to the site.  These can be huge, like really huge.  And be in operation for 30-40 years without filling up.  The water from the treatment plants are run through settling ponds to let the fine particulate settle out.  These are slurry ponds.  The water discharges to a creek after these ponds and is monitored for discharge.  That's why it's such an issue when a dam of one of these ponds fails because it releases tons of fine particulates that are bad for streams.  </p>
<p>Any discharges from these sites is already regulated by the clean water act and by MSHA and OSM.  This bill I wouldn't say was unnecessary, it just added a few more steps.  I think it's categorically false to say it now allows them to put waste in the streams, because of the clean water act, that is already illegal.  And a clean water act violation is not a cheap fine.  Minimum 250K fine for intentional point source pollution. I had to testify in a Federal Clean water case last year and the guy was facing jail time for illegally dumping septic tank waste directly into a stream.  So if anything this move by the Trump administration is to curry favor with coal miners when really it didn't do anything to help jobs or coal mining.  </p></div>		</li>
