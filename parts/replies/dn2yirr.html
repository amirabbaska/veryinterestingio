<p>Picture the Chelyabinsk impactor from 2012. It was about 12 tons, and hit Earth's atmosphere at around 50000km/h. Cassini would have been less impactful than that.</p>

<p>Much, much less impactful. The Chelyabinsk meteor was actually estimated to have a mass of 12-13 <em>thousand</em> tons. <a href="http://cams.seti.org/Popova2013-ms.pdf" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>The shock-waves alone, even given how much it was weakened by its disintegration, still shattered windows 50 miles out. It knocked people off their feet in places, gave people sunburn and damaged peoples eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>12 <em> 10^6 kg </em> (14 <em> 10^3 m/s)^2 / 2 = 1176 </em> 10^12 Joules = 0.28 megatons or 280 kilotons. </p>
<p>So kinda like 15 Nagasaki bombs.</p>
<p>Tsar Bomb is 50 megatons though... You'd need more than 30 meteors like that to match it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's sort of hard to say, because any rocky meteor smaller than about 50m in diameter is most likely going to burst in the atmosphere and not reach the surface. The kinetic energy of the Chelyabinsk meteor was about 500 kilotons, so if a meteor of the same mass that was small and dense enough to reach the surface without breaking apart impacted, I suppose we could expect to see a similar sized explosion (in comparison, the bomb used on Hiroshima was around 15 kilotons).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer distorts the scale of the impact - the analogy of a human being shot is not (in my opinion) appropriate to the question at hand nor does it convey the impact of a tiny 5,000 lb spacecraft impacting the (edit: 3rd) heaviest object in the solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use it as an analogy to explain the damage a kinetic impactor can do. Then the rest of the post explains why it doesn't actually do as much damage as might be expected - basically, Saturn is <em>huge</em>.</p></div>		</li>
