			<div class="markdown"><p>Not going to lie. I put some cash in but didn’t consider it an investment. More of a lottery play. I’m ahead but again...I was and am prepared to write the initial investment off as a loss. </p>
<p>Edit: there seems to be some confusion. I did not invest in cryptoPonzi. Just the CryptoCurrencies themselves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree.  There are some blockchain based startups that have a real world value proposition. Personally I am invested in the Australian Power Ledger which is working to bring peer to peer trading of renewable energy.</p>
<p>A good book to read is called The Blockchain Revolution.</p>
<p>Of course there is no denying there are lot of sh*t coins and scam coins out there.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't blame them. Logically, not everyone can be rich, only some people. People who get it early on things. &quot;It's not what you know but who you know&quot;. Losing 10% of you life savings is bad but not nearly as bad as missing out on losing 10000% of your potential earnings. With the kinds of returns cryto brings, every transaction is too good to be true but it worked out for them. There's no way to know if you're getting in early or too late until it hits your account. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to be fair, plenty of people probably did say that to themselves. You just don't hear about the people that didn't do anything because they didn't do anything.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing happened&quot; doesn't make the news, only &quot;something happened&quot; does.</p></div>		</li>
