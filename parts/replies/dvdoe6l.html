			<div class="markdown"><p>To put a bit more simply:</p>
<p>Remember that for these purposes energy and mass are interchangeable (E=mc^2 and all that).  And it is ultimately the presence of mass/energy that creates gravity.  So, for instance, a compressed spring will actually have slightly higher mass than an uncompressed one.  Whenever you have energy in a system, for the purposes of gravity, you can consider it an equivalent amount of mass.</p></div>		</li>

Would it still be negligible then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangent:</p>
<p>I recall Xkcd was once asked about what would happen to a moon-sized ball of electrons. Then a physicist informed the author. It turns out, the binding energy required to form that structure (even if it's &quot;removed&quot; immediately for the purpose of the thought experiment) is on a relativistic scale of mass (via E=mc2) and would actually form a singularity. </p>
<p>Thus, &quot;energetically unfavorable&quot; on that scale can't really be interpreted with regard to a singularity. I don't know enough physics about charged black holes, so I'll step out here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetar#Magnetic_field" target="_blank">magnetar</a> has a magnetic field of about 10^8 to 10^11 Tesla. These are objects with the strongest known magnetic fields, and they have a corresponding energy density of around 4 x 10^25 J/m^(3). m = E/c^(2), so the mass density corresponding to this field is 10000 times that of lead. As a rough estimate, we could multiply that density by the volume of a neutron star of radius 15 km to <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(\(4*pi%2F3\)\(15+km\)%5E3\" target="_blank">obtain a &quot;mass&quot;</a>(mass+density+of+lead)(10%5E4)) of about 10^21 kg. A neutron star has mass of order 10^30 kg, so even though 10^21 is a big number, even a magnetar's magnetic field has an associated mass density that is negligible when compared to its actual mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it even appropriate to talk about a “gravitational field” isn’t gravity just a byproduct of spacetime deformations due to concentrated mass and to a much lesser degree EM?</p>
<p>If I sit down on my bed and deform the fabric of my sheets, my phone might slide towards me due to the topological deformation of the surface, but I’m not emitting a “field”.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gravity is modeled in general relativity as a phenomenon due to the curvature of spacetime. The gravitational field of a mass distribution is a term that is well-defined in Newtonian gravity, but we still the term in general relativity. In general, &quot;gravitational field&quot; in this context just means the gravity due to a mass distribution. Specifically, the term may refer to the (derivatives of the) metric tensor, which is a perfectly well-defined object.</p>
<p>None of this changes my top-level response.</p></div>		</li>
