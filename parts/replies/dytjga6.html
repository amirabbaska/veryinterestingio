			<div class="markdown"><p>A note (well, whats commonly incorrectly referred to as a note) is a single tone of an instrument. Like striking one piano key, or plucking one guitar string.</p>
<p>A chord is multiple different notes played simultaneously. The term is usually reserved for when this occurs on a single instrument, when two or more instruments are playing differing notes simultaneously it's called a harmony.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hang on. Why is it incorrectly referred to as a note?</p>
<p>Is it just because of the overtones?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my understanding, the strict definition of a “note” is the actual symbol on paper indicating what to play. The actual sound the instrument makes is a “tone” or “pitch.”</p>
<p>Somebody can correct me if I’m wrong though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there are 12 notes <a href="https://www.londonpianoinstitute.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/nature-of-the-piano-keyboard-7-white-and-5-black-notes1.jpg" target="_blank">Here you can see them on the piano.</a>. Here is a good little article <a href="https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/19696-digging-deeper-how-many-chords-are-there" target="_blank">HERE</a> which gives a number close to 4000 total chords. There are tons of variations and such that are a little more than ELI5 to explain why there are so many its not quite 2^^12</p>
<p>In general a chord is 3 or more notes played at once. However I think technically speaking a chord can be only two notes. To think of it better, when someone strums the guitar (hits all the strings simultaneously) that is a chord. When you hit one of the strings by itself that is a note. Depending on where your fingers are on the fret board you can change the notes and create different chords.  </p></div>		</li>
