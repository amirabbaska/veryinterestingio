Humans are at a physical disadvantage to most other animals but the thing we do have over most animals is our ability to maintain a jogging pace for long distances.  We can pick out weak or injured animals and just chase them for a few miles until they collapse from exhaustion.  We've been doing this before we invented the pointy stick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Among them is Harvard evolutionary biology professor Daniel Lieberman. Check out his book “The Story of the Human Body.” Fascinating read. This is also touched on in Christopher McDougal’s “Born to Run.”</p></div>		</li>
