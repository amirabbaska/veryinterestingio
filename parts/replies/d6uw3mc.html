<p>just took a quick look cuz i'm busy, but what will happen when these things hit interstellar medium, won't the light sail collapse or be pushed back towards the origination point?</p></div>		</li>

Because the sail would be minuscule, stellar winds/interstellar medium would have little effect on it</p></div>		</li>

<p>So like, basically never and not a real concern.  Especially when multiple probes are sent at the same time - seems like they are accounting for the fact that a lot of the probes might not make it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be a really horrible thing to attempt without any further knowledge of the planet. What if there is already life there? What if our life we send wipes out all the life that's already there? What gives us a right to contaminate the universe?<br />
That completely ignores the reality that sending any sort of life that distance in such a small package would likely result in the seeds and microbes arriving completely irradiated and dead. Even if they somehow arrived alive there's no way to slow them down so they'd hit the planet at a significant speed which would vaporize them. Even if that didn't happen, terraforming is a lot more than just sending some microbes and seeds to another planet hoping they somehow make it suitable for us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting question because if I had been asked one year ago the reply would have been quite different!</p>
<p>With current technology, assuming we got the spacecraft to travel at 56,000km/h (this was the velocity achieved by the Deep Space 1 mission),  it would take at least 81,000 years to get to Proxima Centauri. If we also use the gravity of some of the Solar System planets to perform a so-called slingshot maneuver to achieve higher speeds, we could get there in about 15,000 years (but then we would need to somehow slow down once we get there).</p>
<p>Proxima being the closest star to the solar system, it has been the &quot;natural&quot; target that people took when they wanted to propose prospective designs for spaceship aimed at interstellar travel (along with Barnard's star, like for the Project Daedalus). And last year I would have stopped here.</p>
<p>But more recently the Breakthrough Starshot project was launched. It was quite exciting for us to see that while we were analysing our radial velocity data and writing our publication, others were starting to invest money and propose designs to actually go there, in the alpha Centauri system! Of course this is quite a challenging project, but the mere fact that interstellar travel is being seriously considered, and that people are working on identifying and solving the limitations of present technology is just great.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, only if you want to actually stop there. A flyby mission is probably more realistic but still has the potential to be hugely valuable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For what it's worth, teams like yours making discoveries like this can only light a fire under the ass of interstellar travel. People like you make it more enticing, bring the idea in the spotlight, and give people reasons to want to travel out of the solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More realistically, we should definitely be able to have direct images of the planet within 20 years.</p>
<p>The semi-major axis of its orbit is 0.04 arcseconds - that is, about 0.0001 degrees. Space telescopes like the JWST and Hubble get down to a resolution of maybe 0.1 arcseconds at best. But the next generation of huge telescopes coming in the 2020s, like the Thirty Metre Telescope and the European Extremely Large Telescope, are supposed to have resolution of less the 0.01 arcsecond, and so might actually be able to separate the planet from the star, although there are some tricks required to image stuff that close to a star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also hope that we can get direct images of the planet in a few years, maybe only in 10 years!</p>
<p>To give the details of the problem, the angular separation between Proxima and Proxima b is indeed about 40 milli-arcsecond (mas, the unit we generally use).</p>
<p>If we consider a perfect optics used in vacuum, it is only limited by diffraction, and a 3.5m telescope is &quot;enough&quot; (still bigger than Hubble Space Telescope) to resolve 40 mas for visible wavelengths.
Now when we use a ground-based telescope the images are blurred by atmospheric motions and often degrade the achievable resolution to 500 mas at best. This can be partly corrected for with adaptive optics (AO), and with the Very Large Telescope it is possible to reach 50 mas.  </p>
<p>The final problem is that this resolution is achieved for sources of similar brightness, and this is definitely not the case for Proxima and Proxima b, and the the planet is completely outshone by its parent star. So one needs to use coronagraphic instruments which can mask the light from the star to be able to see the planet, such as SPHERE on the VLT.</p>
<p>So we hope that with the 30-40m class telescopes such as E-ELT equipped with appropriate AO systems and coronagraphs it will be possible in the next decade </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been trying to ask about this on AskReddit, but my posts keep getting taken down...</p>
<p>What are the theoretical limits of telescopes like this? Could we someday look at other planets with Google Earth-like resolution? If not, what are the constraining factors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The absolute theoretical constraint is the diffraction limit. There's a point where light just diffracts and mixes too much for you to see anything, and you can't stop it from happening, even in theory, because it's just an inherent part of being a wave.</p>
<p>At a distance of 1 parsec - about the distance to Alpha Centauri - the most a 30m telescope can do is a resolution of ~500,000 km in optical wavelengths. In practice, we often get worse than that, because of the limits of technology and the precision of our instruments and equipment.</p>
<p>The only way to beat the diffraction limit is to build a bigger telescope. To get 1 km resolution at a distance of 1 pc, you need a telescope that's ~15,000 km across - larger than the diameter of the Earth. To get Google Earth level resolution, down to 1m or so, you need a telescope that's ~15,000,000 km across. That's 1/10th of the way to the Sun.</p>
<p>One thing that makes this easier is that you can use interferometry. With this technique, instead of one giant telescope, you use a series of smaller telescopes spread out over some distance, and this gives you the high resolution without needing to build a single 15,000 km telescope.</p>
<p>So with a network of satellites, it could eventually be possible to build something that could produce high resolution images of distant planets.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Short and long answer: No</p>
<p>Did you see the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/gallery/album/solar_system/pluto/" target="_blank">Hubble pictures of Pluto</a> before NH did a flyby? Now imagine an image a pixel or two across. Of course, pictures won't be what the scientists want. That would be a spectrograph of the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think things aren't as hopeless as the other replies made it out to be. A conceptual future project is to use the gravitational lensing of our own sun to focus the light from distant targets. The project would still require some herculean efforts but if we continue to develop it will be an obvious project for some future generation. Although still not google earth good...

<p>We aren't close to resolving the planet as more than a point. We're only just about getting to the stage where the planet and the star aren't in the same pixel. When we can separate them, that's &quot;direct imaging&quot;, and that would be considered a major achievement.</p></div>		</li>
