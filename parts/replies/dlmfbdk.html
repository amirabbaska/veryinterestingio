			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it kind of like a hose made of very thin rubber. If you put pressure on it, it reduces the amount of water coming out. With a thin enough material, that pressure could be very small, and stop a lot of water from flowing through it. </p>
<p>Transistors start to get into pretty advanced physics if you get much deeper than that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of different kinds of transistor and how they work varies. The thing that unites them is that they have a main input, and a turn on/off input.</p>
<p>The earliest transistors were vacuum tubes. They work by having the electrons travel through a vacuum inside a glass bulb. The electrons travel from an emitter to a destination, both inside the tube. This was turned into a transistor by putting an obstacle, a grid, in the way of the beam. When the grid is charged, the electrons get stuck.</p>
<p>Modern transistors are nanometres across. They are on the order of 100 atoms wide. Isn't that crazy? They can work in a number of ways, one of which is that a tiny current applied to them can make a set of atoms that block the electricity pathway jump aside.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, your question is very broad and involves a lot of different technologies that work in different ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Respectfully I have to disagree with your statement that the earliest transistors were vacuum tubes.   Both tubes and transistors can perform similar (or even identical) functions, but they are very different things.  Conflating the two is an error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the way transistors work is they make a sandwich of p-type semiconductors (material that has fewer electrons than it would like) and n-type semiconductors (material that have more electrons than it would like). Electrons can easily flow from N to P type materials (remember electrons flow opposite of current), but they cannot easily flow from P to N. </p>
<p>In a FET (field effect transistor), you essentially charge a capacitor above the center zone of a sandwich. What this does is repel or attract electrons in the semiconductor opposite. So in an NPN sandwich, when a charge is applied a small N-type channel forms in the P-type material, so while the charge is present you have an NNN sandwich, which conducts rather easily as there is no barrier to overcome. Remove the charge and it returns to NPN, which does not conduct.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of you guys are thinking of a transistor as used in a computer. A transistor isnt always an on off switch. It has a linear region where it acts as a variable resistor. For a very small current at the base it can control, in an analog fashion, a current through its collector and emitter. This is how a transistor works in an amplifier of radio circuit.</p>
<p>Most of you guys are describing a digital latch circuit.</p>
<p>In your analogy you would need varying degrees between the red and green of a traffic light...........its only valid for a transistor in saturation </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the issue is that it's hard for laypersons like me to understand how electrical signals can become so many different things. While at a basic level it's easy to understand how a transistor functions, extrapolating that out to &quot;if you combine millions of them you can do all sorts of things&quot; just seems like a massive gap, and I think that gap is really what we want to understand but I'm not sure if it can be explained concisely, as processors have evolved significantly over time. </p>
<p>For example, I would be interested to know these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the design/layout of a circuit board what defines what the device can do, or is there another layer connected to just loads of transistors, and the transistors represent the bandwidth of the calculation possibilities?</li>
<li>Whose job is it to establish the programming level between hardware and the very first layer of software, on top of which sits an operating system (I assume there is some kind of BIOS)? And what skills are required for this?</li>
<li>Does the pattern/timing/pulse of inputs determine what current is run through the chip (e.g. if I press 'K' on my keyboard, what signal does that send to the processor?)</li>

<p>Depends on the device. If it is something designed to have software, then the circuit will contain components that other circuits, like the inside of your toaster, would not have. A toaster doesn't need memory (usually), or microprocessor. These are components required to interface hardware with software. But even a toaster can have transistors, used in operational amplifiers that are probably used to heat the coils.</p>
<p>To be clear, a board with <em>just</em> transistors on it won't do anything. There are supporting components, such as resistors, the size of which is calculated in order to &quot;tune&quot; the transistors performance characteristics. Also power - a power source is required to run all these circuits, and usually electronic power supplies need support circuitry to condition the power signal - smooth out peaks, regulate voltage, step down voltage, whatever.</p>

<p>Youre talking about firmware here, if you mean something like the programming stored on and interfaces with the hardware inside your Xbox Remote. Otherwise, we can use the term Hardware Abstractions and Hardware Abstraction Layer, or HAL. </p>
<p>In any case, it's the job of the hardware manufacturer to develop the necessary basic software tools required to make their hardware <em>useful</em> with the world around it. This can be an embedded systems engineer, computer scientist, software engineer, electrical engineer - but they need to understand the design of the hardware to implement software access to it. It can be a challenging job - and lots of firmware doesn't work too good all the time (looking at you, printer paper cartridge sensors). </p>
<p>HAL exists so that a programmer writing in a high language (C for example) can make a program that doesn't have to know how the hardware it runs on works. It makes the most general Abstractions of what the hardware's designed functions could be, so that the API layer can give it more general commands and have it be executed, regardless of the manufacturer (everyone does stuff a little different, so it's important that high level programs don't have to been written to work on a bunch of different standards.</p>
<p>In computers, the HAL exists as the BIOS, and is built by the motherboard company. Of course all the components have some other basic firmware so that they can talk with the motherboard when you are still setting up the computer. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure what you're asking here.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Not sure never dealt with this side of things. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If you press K, it sends a signal in a pattern the computer recognizes (usually an 8 bit number, like 01001101 or something like that) it switches between 0 and 1 based on the clock input. (Which is what your processor speed is telling you! So a 1 gigahertz processor switches from 0 to 1 100 million times per second). A bunch of transistors are linked together to get the output you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For my first point, I meant how much of the operation of the device is dictated by hardware and how much is about what the programming layer does with that hardware? I guess it's not a great question but I am basically curious about the role of the BIOS and OS and how they use the hardware underneath (like, how much capability is inherent in the chip vs programmed). I'm guessing that the BIOS and OS are what really makes the chip useful, rather than the chip itself knowing/being designed for what it's intended to do?</p>
<p>For context, an analog guitar effects pedal has a circuit board, but it has no programming (I assume). It's just a circuit board that you pass a signal through and it modifies the signal before it comes out the other side. But with a computer, I get the sense that it's like a toolkit, and the programming determines what it can do.</p>
<p>And I assume that 'programming' at the base level is essentially someone defining what strings can be understood as inputs and what strings are outputs, and translating those signal strings into something else (e.g. Several layers up, showing a letter in a word processing document because you pressed 'K').</p></div>		</li>
