			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.</p>
<p>And the reason is simply economy: use the simplest solution to the problem.</p>
<p>You can't waste time and energy and survive better than another creature that can conserve time and energy decoding and encoding the simplest solution to the problem.</p>
<p>The creature that can solve the problem with the least amount of time and energy has more offspring, and inherits the earth.</p>
<p>Evolution at its finest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i feel like it's important to stress that one reason examples of the golden ratio are found in nature is because people <em>look</em> for examples of the golden ratio and only record when they find an example.  plenty of ratios found in nature are not examples of the golden ratio - like the ratio of the size of my toes to the size of my teeth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the literally millions of things in nature that don't have that relationship. A male's waist to hip ratio, the segments of my arm, nose shape?</p>
<p>You're choosing to count only the things that conform roughly to the ratio and ignoring the many things that don't. It's confirmation bias. </p></div>		</li>
