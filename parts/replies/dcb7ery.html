			<div class="markdown"><p>The bankers sold the financial products by noting &quot;these are great investments unless all the housing markets in the US fall at the same time, and that isn't likely to happen!&quot; Plus the sales contracts were filled with legal disclaimers up the wazoo. And the bankers knew not to sell them with ironclad guarantees. </p>
<p>So the sales just came down to &quot;these are good products and it's my opinion that based on current market conditions, it will be a good investment, but all investments have risk.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. You have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that they were committing fraud and not simply being greedy or overoptimistic.</p>
<p>Given that a lot of the people involved <em>could have</em> made a lot of money by betting that the housing market would tank, but didn't, it suggests that they either didn't know it was going to tank, or didn't know it was going to tank when it did.</p>
<p>Instead, they ended up losing a lot of money, which is pretty good evidence against fraud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your point, MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) were created on the &quot;stability&quot; of the housing market and were originally solid investments because the underlying loans were underwritten and sold appropriately. This was the assumption that allowed them to become such a problem. </p>
<p>The MBS product became very profitable and large sales incentives were tied to them so that facilitated the desire to create more. Like most things valuable, good mortgages became scarce. To fill the void, at first, a few lower rated credits were added in. In total the credit rating remained essentially the same because the majority were still good mortgages. </p>
<p>Eventually, the poor quality loans became the majority of the asset and the market continued to assume they were quality rated credits and everyone continued to sell them as such. </p>
<p>A very minute group of bankers actually knew how poor the credits were. The majority, especially the people selling them, had no idea what the underlying assets actually looked like. </p>
<p>Technically, they didn't defraud, they just assumed, ignorantly, that because they historically were good quality investments, that they would always be good quality. </p>
<p>You can't really prosecute based on stupidity. If we could, there would be a lot less people walking around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not exactly illegal, the pressure was that they would take their business elsewhere.  It's tough to pass a law that restricts purchasers from taking people buying from another vender.  </p>
<p>It's like not advertising with the magazine that gave your game a poor review.  Shady but not illegal.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He big short is obviously dumbed down. It was less of a direct gun to the head ultimatum, and more of &quot;why would I give S&amp;P my business if moody will rate my security higher.&quot; Obviously the agencies knew this and probably gave higher ratings in order to get current and future business. It's a huge misalignment of interests (the company receiving the rating is the one paying for it) but not as direct or criminal as the movie portrays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The beauty of those financial products that they were indeed rated as triple A. They were hatched together by the smartest kids out there and on the other side of the table were the rating agencies who in all fairness aren't to brilliant.</p>
<p>Another issue is even internally banks had and still have a hard time assessing risk. This isn't surprising, when you got historical data never showing the likelyhood of a certain risk because it never happened, how can you calculate it. Now it isn't as if they have no risk assessment in place, but even today their methods in general are flaky at best. And while every bank have risk managers you should wonder who has the overhand, the guy making millions taking risk, or the guy holding the moneymaker back because of risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real problem was that there was a common belief in the industry that housing prices could go nowhere but up - basically, the idea behind the low-risk on these mortgages was that <em>even if</em> someone defaulted, the price of the home would have gone up in the intervening time, so after you repossessed it, you could then just resell it and make even <em>more</em> money, or at the very least, not <em>lose</em> money.</p>
<p>That belief is fundamentally what powered the mortgage crisis - as long as housing prices are going up, a mortgage is low-risk, because even if they default, you can just resell it for the same or more.</p>
<p>When the housing market tanked, the whole thing fell apart.</p>
<p>This also makes it a lot harder to charge any individual with malfeasance, because a lot of people <em>did</em> believe that housing prices couldn't fall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it doesn't matter if the home can be repossessed and resold. When a mortgager defaults, the mortgage insurance pays out the rest to the bondholders (if the mortgage was securitized). From their perspective, it's literally the same as if the mortgage payer prepaid their mortgage in full, which is the real risk. If they prepay, then you lose out on a bunch of years of interest. If your bond pays less interest than expected, the price falls. Etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say you're wrong on the evaluating risk part. Our monetary policy incentives them not to assess risk properly, or at least not care.  Many small banks felt the collapse very differently because they assessed risk, didn't give loans to people willy nilly,  and have some moral hazard because the Fed isn't bailing them out with taxpayer dollars regardless of what they invest in. </p></div>		</li>
