			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that this question was one of the most upvoted is so cool, because it shows just how much of a connection we have with dogs, and how much we want our dogs to care about us. </p>
<p>Sadly the tough thing for scientists is that we don’t yet have great ways to measure dogs' emotions. As scientists, we have great ways to measure how dogs think— what decisions they make and how they think through problems— but testing dogs' emotions— what they feel— has been harder for scientists (despite the obvious anecdotal evidence that dogs obviously feel and experience emotions). The good news is that even though we can’t yet empirically test dogs’ emotions directly, there’s lots of circumstantial evidence that dogs do in fact feel something for us and think of us as more than a food dispenser. My favorite example comes from some work by Nagasawa and colleagues showing that dogs have hacked into the neuroendocrine responses we humans use to bond with our children. When human parents look at their beloved children, we release a hormone called oxytocin that helps with social bonding (at least in this situation.. oxytocin isn't always about being nice). It turns out the same things happens when we look at dogs and when dogs look at us— we both show increased oxytocin levels. Again, this effect isn’t a direct measure of what dogs feel (sadly we don’t have such a measure yet), but it suggests they’re experiencing and looking at us in at least some of the same ways we look at and experience them. They’ve become part of the very same care-taking circuit we use to bond with our own kids. So I take heart in that. These date make me think that dogs think of us as lovingly as we think of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't ot fair to say that oxytocin induces a certain feeling of trust in humans, and therefore dogs, so it <em>should</em> affect the way they feel towards us?</p>
<p>I always assumed hormones like oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine helped control our feelings since they literally change how we feel when released into our bodies from their respective glands, in a sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the difficulty comes in being sure of it and/or saying what feeling those chemicals are creating. I'm not entirely sure about oxytocin, but I know that serotonin and dopamine, for example, are used by neurons for lots of different purposes. Yes, they are involved in your mood and emotions, but they can also control circuits involved in reward/achievement, learning, sleep/wake cycles, pain, etc. So I think the answer is hesitant because we can make the jump to say, yeah, it's probably affecting some of our feelings, but we can't exactly say what kind of feelings or how. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting! Is this maybe why we see dogs being so sweet, careful, protective and overall gentle with babies and young children? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Change the word ‘dogs’ for ‘children’ and you have a real corker of a question. Your dog loves you like no one else can. They are the purest. You see the happiness a dog displays when you’ve been gone for long enough for it to think you died (a few days). Do you really think it is even possible that when it sees you again, it’s remembering all those resources you give that it’s still getting anyway, or that it remembers the love it had for you and is now rushing back all at once. If an animal lived in fear that you are its resource controller, would it not defeat you the first chance it gets? </p>
<p>Dogs are the physical embodiment of the response of the emotions you supply them. They are the insight to your influence to everything around you and can help you grow as a human being, if you just ‘see’. </p>
<p>Would a dog stay with a homeless person, let alone be ‘owned’ by one if they saw us as resources? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think humans are in fact not capable of ‘thinking’ like dogs if you want to call it that. It’s the difference between knowing why you’re here and doubting why you’re here, and while for dogs it’s not even a question, people get side tracked far too easily and far too early to be able to recover. But this thread is about dogs and not people :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real question is: do you think that our overall emotions are not resource based? Isn't love some kind of reward punishment system? Maybe a more cautious approach with less romanticism would be more sober</p></div>		</li>
