			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/cerdz addressed this. Basically, it is substantially easier to copy when you are copying the same dimensions.</p>
<p>So 2D photo to 2D photorealistic and 3D model to 3D sculpture are both easier than 3D subject to 2D medium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer lies somewhere in how much you can imitate the visual impression of a real life scene by painting it, versus what you can achieve chiseling something out of a block of marble. </p>
<p>For paintings, your comparison is practically what you see with your naked eye. When it comes to sculptures, you don't really expect some lifelike stone figure - you rather expect the artist bringing everything possible out of the medium. However lifelike it is, it's still grey stone with no chance to make you believe it's human skin.</p>
<p>Moreover I reckon it is different standing before a life sized marble figure, walking around it and seeing it from different angles, as opposed to seeing a flat painting, however realistic it may seem.</p></div>		</li>
