<p>Most carbohydrates lower stomach acid production, which will effect digestion. So don't eat ice cream before you eat your steak.</p>

<p>This is not true. All food consumption stimulates gastric acid release. High Fat consumption delays release and high protein consumption increases the amount of gastric acid release (in response to the fact that amino acids are strongly buffering)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A salad with greens/vinegar/olive oil will provide the stomach with ample amounts of hydrogen and chloride (from vinegar and greens, respectively</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I honestly don't know what this means. Chloride is the ion of chlorine and enters out diet mostly through the salts we consume. Do you mean chlorophyll? That is abundantly present in green veg.  The important ion in chlorophyll is iron and this is somewhat moot as we can't digest chlorophyll </p>
<blockquote>
<p>while the fatty acids from olive oil act as a stimulant of stomach acid production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned fats typically inhibit gastric acid secretion </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course all food consumption acutely increases gastric acid release. We are talking about what happens after though. Glucose suppresses gastric acid levels below baseline 1-2 hours after consumption. Protein significantly raises it. I was wrong on fat and mostly going from memory, I was right about gallbladder secretions and wrong about HCl. Lipase inhibits HCl as the enzyme's function is suited for higher pH.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC333221/pdf/jcinvest00645-0095.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC333221/pdf/jcinvest00645-0095.pdf</a></p>
<p>Yes, I mean chloride (I guess in foods it would be chlorine, but when it's in the body it would be ionized to chloride, so I treat the terms interchangeably). Many greens are high in chloride. Chloride is a constituent of hydrochloric acid. The other part is the hydrogen ion, which is provided in excess by acetic acid. Fatty acids can provide a proton from their carboxylic acid constituent as well. I'm not saying that these things will immediately release and be absorbed in the stomach (they won't), but that after an hour+ and they have been absorbed in the intestine, they can donate H+ and Cl-, and especially over the long run, this can increase stomach acidity. I did this instead of taking Betaine HCl to fix my hypochloridia/poor digestion and hypochloremia (low blood Cl). It works.</p></div>		</li>

<p>would you say huge variation in food/drink combinations is best? or some good routine?</p></div>		</li>
