<p>&quot;Every time there's a new way to investigate the universe, we discover things we didn't expect&quot;</p>
<p>I'm wondering how widely these measurements can be applied? As others have said in the thread, gravitational waves are only detected from massive objects like black holes and neutron stars orbiting each other, otherwise the the waves are too small to detect.  Is there a chance the detection methods can improve further in future, or are we limited to a small number of systems that can be studied?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The measurements by LIGO can probably only be applied to colliding compact objects in the near future, but we can learn a lot from studying those objects. For instance, studying gravity waves from neutron star collisions can give us insight into the behavior of matter above nuclear densities-which only exists in their cores. This would in turn improve our understanding of the strong nuclear force- the only non-gravitational force that is currently not well understood at low energies. That would be huge! </p>
<p>In the future, we may be able to use gravity wave detectors like LISA to find out information about the population of more ordinary binary compact objects and single asymmetric neutron stars.  Future cosmic microwave background studies may find gravity waves that constrain inflation in the early universe (as BICEP tried but failed to do).</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, if I'm understanding you correctly, this could potentially lead us down the path of unifying the Strong and Electroweak forces?</p></div>		</li>

And their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Tstyqz2g7o" target="_blank">information on the current detection</a>, released a few minutes after the official announcement. I guess they knew something.</p></div>		</li>
