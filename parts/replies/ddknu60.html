			<div class="markdown"><p>I decided to do a lazy solution by just going into Wolfram Alpha and throwing some values at the wall to see what stuck. Turns out <a href="http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=black+hole+lifetime+3.5*10%5E6+kg&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">a mass of 3.5 million kg</a> would produce a black hole with a lifetime of about 60.1 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.5*10%5E6+kg&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">WA also informs me</a> that this is about 29% of New York City's daily garbage production. So, perhaps the professor's Smell-O-Scope could be used to search for miniature black holes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't this be lethal?  I get 300ug seed = 2.6963e+10 joules  via e=mc^2</p>
<p>And the release would be nearly instantaneous, right?</p>
<p>I could see three aspects of damage effect- penetrating radiation, thermal, and creating overpressure by heating the air, but that's limited by the amount of air.  If it were in a container and suddenly dumped 27 gigajoules I'd expect the container's interior to vaporize, pressurizing the interior, and shatter, throwing shrapnel.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would evaporate before it could capture anything. Also keep in mind that the gravitational force depends on the mass (and distance) only. A black hole with the mass of a poppy seed has the same gravitational force as a regular poppy seed: utterly negligible, even for atoms just a nanometer away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring the massive radiation dose you get from Hawking radiation, you would experience as much gravitational attraction as you would from the poppy seed. The big difference is that you can get much closer to the black hole than the poppy seed. If you were holding it in your left hand, your right hand wouldn't feel anything, but it would cut through your left hand like the thinnest needle imaginable, tearing each cell it comes in contact with apart along its path towards the Earth's center of gravity.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really confused by the Planck Mass now, having read it.</p>
<p>What is it about the mass ~0.021 milligrams that allows it and smaller masses to keep only a single unit of charge and not two?  A single unit of (Positive?) charge in this case would mean that the mass has shed a single electron, and there is one more proton than electrons in the mass.  Right?</p>
<p>What prevents that mass from shedding more electrons under various / extreme circumstances?  Wouldn't the ability of the mass to support a positive charge depend on the elements and compounds involved?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Planck mass is large <em>because</em> Planck length and time are so small. Both can be seen as effects of a very weak gravity. Elementary particles would need masses of the order of the Planck mass to have gravity as strong as the other interactions. For particles that heavy, the Planck length and time would be natural scales for distances and interactions.</p></div>		</li>
