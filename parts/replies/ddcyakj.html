			<div class="markdown"><p>Absence of nucleation sites (impurities where  the first bubbles can form). So pure H2O heated uniformly combined with a very smooth cup will guarantee superheated water. Also a temperature below about 300 deg C is required (as from there on, it will boil spontanously. This is called homogeneous nucleation).</p>
<p>Please note that you can definitely get superheated water without meeting all those conditions, but it would be less predictable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very smooth container in the microwave. Use distilled water. Wouldn't really recommend though, it's pretty dangerous. Once something disturbs it, it will violently boil, splashing boiling water everywhere</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you have a metal pipe where it is 1m long and the mouth the size of a normal cup (Similar to a really long pot). By heating it evenly such as a furnace where the last 20cm is not heated. Will the water at the middle or towards the bottom be hotter than 100 degrees C?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, 100 C is the boiling temperature at atmospheric pressure. Increasing pressure (by, for example, heating water at the bottom of long tube) will increase boiling temperature. Here's the graph: <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/boiling-point-water-d_926.html" target="_blank">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/boiling-point-water-d_926.html</a></p>
<p>So, yes. 1 m of water equals to about 0.1 atm, so boiling temperature would increase by about 2 degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of, except the water will only boil at the surface and so therefore still boil at 100C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This kind of non-uniform heating would cause convection currents to form. The heat would not stay concentrated in the lower portion of the tube because fluids expand when heated, lowering their density and causing them to rise. Cooler fluid concurrently sinks to replace it. There would practically be cooler temperatures at the exposed top end of the pipe because the heat could radiate away there, and also because some of the &quot;hottest&quot; molecules would evaporate away, leaving behind a slightly cooler liquid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this when microwaving filtered water in pyrex. If it's not bubbling when the timer elapses I always poke at it from a distance. Usually once you stir it a bit it starts bubbling quite a lot. Sometimes it doesn't, though, and I've always wondered what was going on those times.</p></div>		</li>
