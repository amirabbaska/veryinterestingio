<p>Your central nervous system only receives the same information you do. You cannot see UV light, even subconsciously, so the pupils would not respond to it.</p>

<p>This was exactly the type of answer I was hoping for! Thanks so much!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Most forms of EMR other than the visible won't trigger rod/cone cells, but people who have been exposed to high levels of high-energy EMR like gamma rays have reported visual artifacts that suggest their rods/cones were being triggered by the radiation.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're in a position to observe this phenomenon, whether it causes your pupils to constrict is likely to be the least of your worries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a little different. </p>
<p>I would speculate that it is <em>not</em> their rods and cones being &quot;triggered,&quot; per se, but the result of ion flow induced by structural damage caused by the radiation that mimicked a graded potential electrically, and was dutifully relayed to the brain as stimulation, somewhat like the mechanical stimulation I mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possible, but I can't think of any reason why the retinal couldn't be kicked out by a really, really, really intense burst of hard gamma.  Obviously, the process is adapted to visible light, but again, I can't think of any reason why it's physically impossible, just unlikely in the extreme, which is why it takes such a hugely intense burst of gamma to make it happen.</p>
<p>Of course, there's also no reason why both of these things couldn't happen at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
