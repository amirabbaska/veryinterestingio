			<div class="markdown"><p>You're speaking about carbon based, water solvent life. The OP's question is why aren't we examining the root question of what exactly it means to be alive. If you define life in terms of thermodynamics and information theory, you find many chemistries that can support it, and the chances of abiogenesis go way up.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn't discount panspermia. However, that's a question we won't be able to answer until we explore places outside  our solar system (as Earth could have easily contaminated all the planets and asteroids by now.)</p></div>		</li>
