			<div class="markdown"><p>And therein lies the difference for the definition of &quot;significant&quot;. To people writing a paper it means &quot;the paper will be published&quot; to the lay public reading a paper (or more often an article about a paper) it means &quot;does this matter.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>even though inhibiting inflammatory responses may slow the body's healing processes, isn't the main purpose of using NSAIDs be to provide symptomatic relief?</p>
<p>i imagine it's kind of like taking allergy medication. Histamine release is one of the ways that the body reacts to allergens, and using antihistamines may block the body's normal defense mechanisms, however the main purpose is to provide relief from the &quot;side-effects&quot; of runny nose, watering eyes, itchiness etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between the two examples (infections vs allergies) is the benefit of the &quot;symptoms&quot;. Symptoms of fever and inflammation in an infection help to fight it off. The infection is actually a threat to your body. Allergens aren't, and the symptoms are just a nuisance. </p>
<p>But like others are saying in here, the inflammation reduction from NSAID use during an infection likely doesn't have any clinical significance. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That is not the <em>only</em> function of inflammation. It's important to always think of things from the perspective of evolution: what purposes could these mechanisms serve to promote survival?</p>
<p>Obviously healing is one. But prevention of further harm is another. Inflammation is painful because when you're sick or injured it is a VERY good idea not to exert yourself.</p>
<p>Anti-inflammatory medication targets <em>pain</em>, so it always makes sense to ask <em>why is something painful</em>?</p>
<p>Evolutionarily, pain is <em>incredibly</em> important for survival. Every species has extremely fine-tuned pain responses to all sorts of things because there is <em>massive</em> evolutionary pressure on pain mechanisms. Inflammation is no exception.</p>
<p>Flip side: congenital insensitivity to pain is a real condition - people who cannot feel pain. And people unfortunate enough to inherit it are NOT lucky that they can't feel pain! They typically die in their 20s (!), because they incur so much damage without realizing it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you explain what you mean by this? This doesn't make any sense.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Evolutionarily, the function of pain is to protect the individual animal from incurring additional damage prior to healing/recovery. This is well-established in both the scientific literature and common sense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, it does not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course it does, don't be daft. NSAIDs are prescribed overwhelmingly as painkillers - for everything from headache to sore throat to arthritis.</p></div>		</li>
