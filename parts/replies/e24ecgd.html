			<div class="markdown"><p>Another great question. There's less work in animals looking at these kinds of individual differences. Sadly, this is because we don't often study populations of animals big enough to show these differences. Many animal studies test 10-50 individuals, but if we picked that many people at random we might not be lucky enough to find ones that showed non-neurotypical traits. Right now, we have a project at my field site in Cayo Santiago Puerto Rico to look for traits like autism in monkeys. At that site, we have \~1500 individual rhesus monkeys, so we might have a population large enough to see traits like this in an animal species. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the analogy, which works for some of dogs' traits relative to wolves (e.g., more social, more attention to human social cues), but it doesn't capture all the other amazing things that domestication built into dogs. So I think the real story is a bit more complicated.</p></div>		</li>
