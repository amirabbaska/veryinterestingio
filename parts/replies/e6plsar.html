<p>Indispensable/invaluable.</p>
<p>Without constant exposure to fluor, the remineralization process would be diminished. You can find evidence of this in any underdeveloped isolated area ,  or even  nations where government does not facilitate fluor to the populace.  Their teeth are much more prone to suffering decay, micro-fractures and even full linear fractures. </p>
<p>The hysteria that surrounds fluor in modernity is completely unjustified. Even a hard, persistent overdose [Fluorosis] over a long period of time just yields some deep staining and this is the outlier case, the normal case is upsides across the board.</p>

<p>There is no need to go to such extremes.</p>
<p>As I said, even a long term, persistent overdose has very insignificant consequences compared to, say mercury or lead.</p></div>		</li>
