			<div class="markdown"><p>While the materials in teeth and bone are very similar their arrangement is different. Bone is somewhat similar to a composite material made up of a mixture of collagen fibers and hydroxyapatite crystals with living cells that manage both materials. Teeth have a very similar structure inside (dentin) but in order to have the strength and toughness to serve their purpose and avoid infection the outside of the tooth (enamel) is made up of pretty much entirely hydroxyapatite with no living cells. This is why teeth can't heal like bones can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This hasnt been said yet, but evolution doesnt make plans. It isnt guided by some desire to be the best. If a trait works it sticks around. Some animals have teeth that constantly grow and that has its own set of consequences. Our system worked enough to pass the trait on to offspring. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  The same process also happens when you get braces to realign your teeth.  With even small, but consistent pressure, the bone around a tooth being pushed on will disintegrate while new bone forms on the other side where a void is left behind as the tooth moves.</p>
<p>This is also why it is somewhat detrimental to your bite if you lose a tooth and don't put an implant in its place, or if you don't wear your retainer as instructed after taking off your braces.  Teeth will slowly drift wherever there is no opposing force to counteract it.  That also somewhat explains why peoples' bottom front teeth especially seem to rotate slightly as they age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, actually, bone building in the mandible and zygomatic (jaws) is what causes the adult teeth to erupt.  The body begins to build bone at the base of the adult teeth, as the bone builds and solidifies it pushes the adult teeth further towards the gum line and keeps on pushing them until they erupt, eventually the jaws fully solidify and anchor the adult teeth in place. </p></div>		</li>
