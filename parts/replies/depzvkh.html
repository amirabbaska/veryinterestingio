			<div class="markdown"><p>All bottled waters have salt in them. Dasani just does you the favor of out right saying &quot;salt&quot; as opposed to sodium chloride or hiding it in the nutritional info.</p>
<p>Also, the amount of salt they do add is so negligible, it's almost not even worth mentioning. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMh1lyeNsPc" target="_blank">There are reasons they add in things like that. Pure h2o will not only strip your body of its minerals but will taste like nothing.</a></p>
<p>I'm not backing coke in any way nor do I even drink bottled water (I refill from the fridge), I just hate people spreading ignorance because they heard someone say it and never figured to look into it themselves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dasani was heaviest and saltiest </p>

<p>Not that you tasted them, but that you say it was the saltiest when in fact they all have pretty much the same amount of salt.</p>
<p>If you're telling me you can taste the difference between .1 mg of salt, you should work for a taste testing company.</p></div>		</li>
