			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been pulled over before knowing that my tail light was out and when he asked I said I assumed that it was because of that (it was). He wrote me a &quot;fix-it ticket&quot;, I changed the bulb the next day, and went to the station to get it ticket taken care of afterward.</p>
<p>So that's one situation I can think of where it doesn't hurt to be honest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got pulled over after running a red left turn light.</p>
<p>I pull into the nearest parking lot and the cop walls up to my window and states at me for a second.  I say, &quot;Kinda missed the light, didn't I?&quot;  He says, &quot;Just a bit.&quot;  He let it slide.</p>
<p>Disclosure: This was before I became a dispatcher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually admit to the cop why i thought he pulled me over, i've never had a ticket.  </p>
<p>I also don't break the law that much.  If is was doing like twenty over the limit i would probably keep my mouth shut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been pulled over 3 times and everytime told them why they pulled me over except for one (Speeding, not a full stop, right turn where I wasn't allowed to: the one I didn't know) All 3 times I was given a warning because I have no previous tickets and did not put others in danger. Lots of officers just want you to know it was wrong and that you learn a lesson.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. After receiving a ticket you ALWAYS have the right to plead not guilty to the charge, regardless of what you said at the scene. Now whether you will prevail in court....that's another matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. The second sentence is what I was referring to with the &quot;can't&quot;. Should have added &quot;easily&quot; or something after that. You can officially challenge it. You probably won't win though (&quot;can't&quot;) if the cop has you on record as saying you admitted to the violation. </p></div>		</li>
