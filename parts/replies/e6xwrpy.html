			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand why people make that statement, but it's far too simplistic.  A HD or a SSD uses what we would call &quot;grandmother cell&quot; encoding, meaning that the memory of your grandmother is in a single bit or group of bits.  Memory in the human brain uses distributed encoding, meaning that it's not the bits (neurons) that are the memory, but the pattern of neuronal activity across a specific network of neurons that is the memory. That allows you to store far more information than if each neuron was just a bit like on an HD or SSD. That pattern is not just on and off, but also the speed of on/off, as well as inhibitory and excitatory connections. So, while bits describe capacity on an SSD, synapses are a better representation in the brain, and even then don't fully capture capacity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, the hippocampus is far more active during the encoding and retrieval of new memories than old.  Older memories seem to be less dependent on it.  Also, damage to the hippocampus seems to impair the formation of new memories more than the recall of older ones.  So, it's important, but it's likely part of the process of memory.  Some people seem to confuse it with the location of memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anyone is interested in more on the topic, there is a really great and early episode from Radiolab about memory wherein they explain in layman’s terms how you can’t think of your brain as an HDD or SSD since that implies that actual “space” is being used up. </p>
<p>IIRC they explained that memory is an affect of your brain constantly repeating the story in your head. It’s not like putting a file away for later. This is why some memories fade (by being accessed the least) and some last, as well as why we often have divergent details in a shared memory with our friends and family. The constantly “moving” aspect of memory was pretty fascinating to me when I first listened to the episode.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the bioelectric signals caused by the triggering of various neurotranmitters allows for a vastly more complex pattern...Humans have upwards of 100 neurotransmitters (though not necessarily at all synapses), so the complexity of the neural network is orders of magnitude more complex than if the encoding were just of a single bioelectric signal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What’s the deal with eye movements being tied to memory? This is something I was skimming through earlier today. Up to today I thought there were directions your eyes would look that effectively indicated what part of the brain was being accessed to reconstitute a memory. </p>
<p>But after reading a bit it doesn’t seem there is any clear rules, such as ‘Up -left is recollection/recall’ ‘Up-right is imagination/lying’ etc. Instead my understanding is that eye movement <em>is</em> tied to what your brain is accessing, but they’re just mimicking the neural pathway your brain is taking to reconstitute a memory experience. </p>
<p>Is that anything you’re familiar with? If so, is there a boilerplate explanation you could write? Or is what I wrote close enough to ballpark?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Associating REM direction with a certain function such as lying or affection or fear is akin to phrenology (mental ability strength is determined by the size of the skull at a certain location - Google images can give you some idea of what I mean). It's a heaping cow patty that's been sitting in the sun for hours.</p>
<p>REM or &quot;dream sleep&quot; is essentially your brain playing memories in reverse order to encode them into long term storage (retrograde consolidation). During this process, you're going through the memories of your day. The way your eyes move is likely just mimicking any movement your brain recorded during memory formation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're saying the brain stores eye movement data during the day and then plays that data <em>in reverse</em> like winding back a VHS tape during retrograde consolidation? Do you have any proof of that? I've never heard such a thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s been suggested that smells are one of the strongest triggers of memory because the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus practically touch one another in the brain. </p>
