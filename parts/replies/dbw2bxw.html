			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Forget&quot; is being used loosely in this instance. The autonomic system regulates breathing, but it's still a system of communication among many areas of the nervous system in conjunction with muscles, etc. There are lots of opportunities for interruptions in signal sending/processing, which can degrade the pathways of communication, thereby &quot;unwiring&quot; or &quot;rewiring&quot; the autonomic system. So, in essence, the body can &quot;forget&quot; how to breathe, if the system is somehow degraded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not knowledgable about this(highschool psychology, go!), but breathing is regulated in the brainstem(particularly, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulla_oblongata" target="_blank">medulla</a>). Maybe the disease affects the brainstem in a way.</p></div>		</li>
