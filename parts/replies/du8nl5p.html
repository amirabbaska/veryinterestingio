			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that heat can cause chemicals to leach into samples in lab grade plastics. I sell high quality plastic polypropylene for a living and even our stuff has a little leaching into samples. I am positive the low grade mass produced plastic bottles are leeching chemcials into your water if there is heat or even just enough time.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about degrading it's about leeching of impurities in the plastic itself. The primary contaminate in PET is acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde isn't a very healthy compound, like most volatile organics, but is naturally occurring in many things like fruit so you tend to ingest a bit of it anyways on a regular basis. The compound itself is not very pleasant tasting and mishandling of the plastic in the production process can cause more to be produced and eventually leech into whatever is being stored in the bottle. This isn't as much of an issue with sodas or fruit juices, but can be tasted in water, especially something that has been left out in the sun or heated for long periods of time. </p>
<p>Bio-plastics can see more of these impurities since they tend to come from processes that are a little more complex than just distilling and/or cracking crude oil, which is why some don't ever make it to market or are limited in application.  The pH of some of the wonderful things we consume plays a part in durability and degradation as well. </p></div>		</li>
