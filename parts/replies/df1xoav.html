			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but I don't think a difference of at most 100K when everything is already about room temperature is going to lead to minutes vs hours like the OP suggests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point. It looks like that change in temperature (assuming an activation energy of diffusion for starch gelatinization of 17.6 kJ/mol that I got from some article) would only make diffusion 4-5 times faster, so it definitely can't account for all of it. I was just trying to explain how the impact that temperature and diffusion has on a system like that in general. Didn't mean to mislead!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're giving thermodynamics full credit for osmosis.</p>
<p>Osmosis would occur even if the temperature of the pasta and the water were the same, it would just take longer.   </p>
<p>The thing that heat DOES do is increase the amount the starch itself soaks up water (geletanization).</p>
<p>Most people are cooking their pastas at too high a temp, you really want to cook it at a simmer, not a boil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I did say that it would still occur at low temperature, and that it would take longer. I didn't know about gelatinization before though, thanks! I think a simmer is at around 94 C, whereas a full on boil would be around 100 C, so I wonder why that difference in temperature is important. In rice I would say that if the water is boiling too fast, it may evaporate from under the lid and there would be less water for the rice to absorb, but in pasta there is plenty of water, so the difference in temperature must affect either how quickly it absorbs water, or the manner in which it absorbs water. Very interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Osmosis is a biological event. Osmosis refers to the transport of water inside/outside the cell. This is not the case with the rice and water situation. </p>
<p>However I am also not positive that thermodynamics is the proper title either, but it makes more sense than osmosis. </p>
<p>That being said, the vibration of molecules and absorption time is most definitely a chemistry/physics topic of conversation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Osmosis is the spontaneous net movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from a region of low solute concentration to a more concentrated solution, up a concentration gradient.</p>
<p>You can have osmosis in a lab environment with 0 organic material.  All you need is a membrane separating two different concentrations of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah. So the way entropy was taught to me is that it's the measure of order or randomness in a system. A closed system in the universe, unless acted on by another energy or force, will always tend toward disorder. The big example people use is let's say you pour coffee into cream. They're going to mix together, right? But why? Because of entropy. If you picture a big pocket of cream particles within the coffee that are all randomly vibrating and bouncing off each other, they will not be moving as one cohesive unit through out the coffee, each particle will bounce in different directions, bouncing off of coffee particles and eventually fully mixing with coffee particles. Where there was once a full separation between the two groups of particles, which is referred to as &quot;ordering&quot;, now they are fully mixed and in their most &quot;disordered&quot; state. This reflects an overall increase in entropy and is a spontaneous process, meaning it happens without the input of another energy source. Spontaneous processes like this are happening all the time, since the entropy of the universe is constantly increasing. Does that make sense? If not I can clarify further!</p></div>		</li>
