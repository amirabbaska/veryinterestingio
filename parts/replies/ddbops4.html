<p>Unfortunately, I think most of America is either too busy watching <em>Honey Boo Boo On The Rampage</em> to care, or are otherwise thinking &quot;Yeah, stick it to them libs, Donnie!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case it's a bit of both.</p>
<p>Because the US is so big financially it gets to call the shots. If most other nations were to impose regulations the finance industry will simply say &quot;Fine, we'll go elsewhere&quot;. Hence the US can impose regulations that the rest of the world can only dream of!</p>
<p>This has actually worked pretty well, business in the US is generally open honest and corruption free. (with a few notable exceptions, particularly money-and-politics, and consumer-protection where the US rules seem woefully weak). However it is fair to say the regulation is expensive and has the effect of reducing competition / profitability. </p>
<p>It's hard to know where to draw the line here. Few would advocate a return to the greed-is-good days of the 80s with rife insider trading and other corrupt practicies. But equally it would be good to open up finance to new business models and more competition which is tricky to do when the cost of complying runs to many millions.</p>
<p>Sadly a nuanced view doesn't seem to go far in today's world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm very pro-nuance.... but I disagree that the US has huge flexibility to choose sensible regulations for the country. </p>
<p>My current view is that the US seems to have a weaker regulatory regime (and stronger lobbying regime) than most countries, and thus you actually end up with weak/pro-industry regulations, written by the industry itself. You end up in this vicious cycle of banks being aggressive,  making massive profits (and risks) until everything crashes and the taxpayers have to come in and bail out the losses.</p>
<p>This cycle, understandably, would lead to accelerating wealth inequality, with profits going to the investor class and losses being paid by the middle class.</p>
<p>Let me know if I've missed something, seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that compared to large parts of the world, the US has open companies and fair markets. The legal system is honest too. This is massively beneficial to everyone (except the corrupt).</p>
<p>Sure the benefits of this are mostly seen by the wealthy, and little effort is made to redistribute this to the poor. But that's a separate problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as will all Trump policies, so far it's all show and no substance - so it's impossible to comment yet.</p>
<p>If you asked me what I'd do: I'd genuinely make distinctions so that rules applied differently to small / medium sized enterprises than to the huge multinational banks. However I'd be extremely careful to preserve and enhance consumer / retail protections. I'd also look to centralise (socialise?) various services [clearing, KYC / AML checks, ...]. Some parts of Dodd-Frank (and similar regulations) particularly to do with Fiduciary duty, best price guarantees, price transparency are definitely worth keeping - though could surely be implemented more simply.</p></div>		</li>
