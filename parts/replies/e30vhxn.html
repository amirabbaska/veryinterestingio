			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite a lot! We want to send seismometers to the Moon and Mars, it's just a matter of getting the missions approved. You don't actually need an energy source for many measurements, planets (and moons) are pretty noisy, so you can listen to things like impacts and &quot;earth&quot;quakes instead of bringing a source with you. The <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/overview/" target="_blank">Mars InSight</a> mission actually is taking a seismometer as part of it's primary science package. We should learn quite a bit if everything goes well!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was done on the moon during the Apollo missions with a mortar. Photos and more info <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/HamishALSEP.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I don't know if it offers significant advantages over radar tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depth of penetration and spatial resolution are the main differences. With radar, you're limited to the upper crust. Seismometers can be designed for high resolution surface measurements or for looking all the way through the planet. Additionally, radar is only sensitive to changes in the electrical properties of the material whereas seismology detects the &quot;acoustic&quot; or mechanical properties. Since these differences can be caused by different things, depending on what you want to study, you may chose one technique over the other.</p></div>		</li>
