			<div class="markdown"><p>COPD comes with a lot of comorbidity. By the time your lungs are bad enough to need a transplant, your heart is pretty jacked up and your peripheral circulation is pretty bad as well.</p>
<p>Lungs are also harder to find a matching donor since you need to find someone who not only shares your blood type, but also is pretty damn close to the same size as you. You couldn't put the lungs of a 5'2&quot; woman into the body of a 6'4&quot; man and expect him to have any quality of life trying to breath with such small lungs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So for a friend of our family who was on oxygen at all times, had a very low functioning right lung and a left lung with probably just over half capacity, was he extremely lucky to have received a lung? </p>
<p>He looks amazing now - colour returned to his face, and I’d never seen the guy really smile before so I’d say it was worth it to him for sure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also got to consider age. Those with CF tend to only live til mid 30s with out a transplant and thus a transplant will allow them to live out their lives. </p>
<p>Those with COPD, as well as being a relatively self inflicted disease (in no way suggesting it means their lives have less value) they tend to be a lot older when they are diagnosed with it and thus the amount of years a transplant is useful is less. </p>
<p>Also COPD can be managed a lot easier than CF. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Median survival post lung transplant is a bit over 5 years. You're not living out your life, but compared to dying in your 20s you might make early 30s. Nasty disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a form of “genetic” COPD.  It is caused by the disease Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.  I was diagnosed with COPD at 49, due to Alpha 1. (It is the lack of a protein in your blood, that protects your lungs. Can also cause liver disease.). Alpha 1 is not really rare, just rarely diagnosed.  Many Alphas do get lung transplants, when their capacity is low enough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom has COPD. She went through all the testing required to see if she could get a transplant. If you're over... 70 or 72? They won't transplant you. My mom was 68 when she went through the testing, and the only reason she didn't get approved is because they don't think she would survive getting put under for surgery. Making her quality of life better was the main reason they were considering a transplant. </p>
<p>It's not always just about extending your life, but making the rest of your life better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>COPD Patients do receive lung transplants if they are otherwise acceptable candidates. Here's a powerpoint that shows how many patients in the ISHLT (international society of heart and lung transplantation) registries who receive transplants by the disease they have (e.g. slide 12) </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Age factors in as well and is a big reason why more years are added on to the lifespan of a CF patient post transplant. As CF is something you're born with, chances are you'll get a transplant at a younger age in general. Cystic Fibrosis is a lot more debilitating sooner, and how sick a person is, or how near death said person is, usually determines who gets the transplant over someone else. Often down to the last minutes.</p>
<p>COPD is a disease that develops over a period of time, usually due to a lifetime of smoking. Found most often in older generations of patients. Survivability during and post surgery count for a lot, and people with COPD have much more working against them. Including weakened hearts and other organs and bodily functions, as was pointed out elsewhere here. CF can be debilitating, and transplant surgeries are high risk as is, but CF patients at a younger age are usually less critical than older COPD patient. Quitting smoking isn't always guaranteed either in COPDers.</p></div>		</li>
