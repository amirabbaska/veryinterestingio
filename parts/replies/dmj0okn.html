			<div class="markdown"><p>I love how they explain the source for the whale (given the unusual circumstance and sad nature of the cellular collection) and make a nice attempt to also do the same for the common lab mouse. Those little lab mice never get the recognition they deserve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool stuff, but that's talking about stem cells. What about differentiated cells? Maybe a comparison of the skin/internal organ? Also maybe a comparison of cell volume (if even possible) since some cell shapes are maintained by cytoskeleton and others might be elongated/flat. I ask this because cell hypertrophy is a thing and some cells might be larger than the others because of certain reasons. Biological sciences major btw, just curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this paper because it's simple but leads to so many questions - and there are certainly shortcomings in the experimental design that limits its applicability - choosing the same undifferentiated cell type to measure and making those measurements after growing the cells under the same culture conditions certainly predisposes the comparison to show similarity.</p>
<p>There's definitely more allometric variation in differentiated cells than in stem cells - as cells specialize they take on more unique functional characteristics, hence more unique structural characteristics. Vertebrate blood cells are a great example - lots of variation in size, shape, nucleation (for erythrocytes), chemical composition (for leukocytes). There is some cool research on the factors which affect cell volume across species - <a href="http://jcs.biologists.org/content/joces/34/1/247.full.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> is a nice (if a bit old) article that addresses genomic composition in relation to cell size.</p></div>		</li>
