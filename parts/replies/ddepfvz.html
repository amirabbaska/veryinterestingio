			<div class="markdown"><p>Related to its cheapness, is also the fact that it is <em>fungible</em>. Break a beaker? No big deal, you need cullet to make new glass anyway. You lose a little glass each time, and you spend energy, but that broken glass actually lowers the melting point of the raw materials used to make new glass, so you save some energy too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So very cheap.  At my job, a semi trailer load of glassware was trucked about 8 hours from the factory to a packing facility where 2/3 of it was found to be out of spec.  The factory has trucks coming and going and typically they go back empty.  They said it wasn't worth hauling the bad glass back for them to reuse.  Not worth the time to load/unload, and not worth the fuel use from the extra weight.</p></div>		</li>
