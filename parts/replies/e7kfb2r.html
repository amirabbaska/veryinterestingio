			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, embryo development is so complicated and cool.  How all the proteins need to be produced in the right place at the right time (which is dictated by DNA) relying on diffusion and physics so that their delicate interplay creates structure through cell differentiation and directed apoptosis and cell movement. I loved that subject in college.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: To be more clear, the clump of cells &quot;knows&quot; what to make based on the DNA it recieves from both parents. Its literally a blueprint with very detailed instructions on how to make a living organism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A blueprint...  how do you read it?  Is there a way to read a DNA strand to know what's encoded?  Also, what part of the cell/how does the cell read and process the DNA and thus follow the instructions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically the problem of Embryology can be divided into two: the Blueprint, and Reading the Blueprint part. We already know the former, and we have an idea how to Read the Blueprint, but the Reading part can go wrong in so many ways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All your cells have the exact same set of DNA instructions (except your B and T cells) but somehow they can differentiate into everything. Your muscles have the exact same genetic code as your neurons yet somehow they know what to become and what genes they should express. </p>
<p>How that happens is a complicated process and there’s tons of regulatory transcription factors and proteins that degrade transcription factors or secrete signals to nearby cells etc. Just saying “it’s DNA” is honestly just incorrect since the cell have the same set of DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well sure, but this is an explain like im 5 thread. I didnt really want to recite my college biology and genetics courses. Yes all our cells have the same DNA and the processes on how a cell decides on which part of the DNA to read to become a specific cell is a very complex process and thats why we have scientists that dedicate decades to studying it. For an explaination on a reddit forum that is designed to give super basic and understandable explainations &quot;its DNA&quot; works just fine. </p></div>		</li>
