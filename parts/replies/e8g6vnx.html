			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! the thermal conductivity of graphite varies wildly depending on the direction of transport, from ~400 W/(m·K) in plane down to 2 W/(m·K) out of plane! additionally, single sheet Graphite has an even higher  measured thermal conductivity of between 3000 and 5000 W/(m·K)! . for comparison, Diamonds have a thermal conductivity of around 2200 W/(m·K) and copper has a thermal conductivity of around 400 W/(m·K)</p></div>		</li>
