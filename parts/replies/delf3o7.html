			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha well obviously that is true plants achieve this.  Perhaps I should have been a little more specific about what I meant.</p>
<p>There is almost entirely CO2 in Venus atmosphere and very little Nitrogen and water vapour, which life on Earth needs. Venus doesn't have a magnetosphere which means it is constantly blasted by solar winds, stripping away Hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The early atmospheres of all the terrestrials were pretty similar. The main difference between Earth and Venus is that Earth was far enough from the Sun to keep its oceans, so it could sustain a proper carbon cycle. Venus' oceans evaporated pretty quickly, so the photodissocated oxygen got trapped up in CO2 and triggered a runaway greenhouse effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phobos is tiny, and its gravitational strength is dwarfed by Venus so much that it might as well be zero for the purpose of your question. It would not draw any significant portion of Venus' atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>
