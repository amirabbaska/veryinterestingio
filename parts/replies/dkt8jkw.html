<p>On average over any 30 year period ever the increase in value of the market beats the interest rate they'd be paying.</p>
<p>And even if something that's never happend in hundreds of years happens they'll <em>still</em> (probably) have enough left to pay the loans and still live like kings.</p>
<p>The super rich spend a tiny, insignificant portion of their income on living. Bill Gates spends maybe 20 million a year and the dividends on his stock amount to half a billion a year.</p>
<p>Unless the world ends in a 'bullets and MREs are the only things of value' scenario the super rich will be fine - and one of the popular things for them to buy is a fortified bunker with 20 years of food and alcohol for a couple million.</p>
<p>Also, they can buy puts to protect themselves from a failure of their stock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is something that I've been thinking about.. but aren't the rich essentially at least partly responsible for inflation? Since the money they spend never goes back into the economy, since they're just generating more of it from stock and tax loopholes, isn't this like just printing cash to spend it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have it backwards. Taking money out of the economy causes 'deflation' unless you want to measure inflation by the things rich people buy - like Mona Lisas and stocks and investment rental housing. And the things rich people buy <em>HAVE</em> inflated.</p>
<p>Inflation is, by definition, not going to increase if the price of a Mona Lisa doubles because that's not included in the basket of goods we use to measure inflation.</p>
<p>So food has actually decreased substantially in terms of the median paycheck because billionaires don't eat a billion times more food than a homeless person. And food is considered a large chunk of the basket of goods used to determine inflation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile housing is considered to be a smaller part of that basket of goods, but it's increased much faster than the median wage. Because rich people can buy houses and rent them out and pay someone else to maintain them. This is especially troublesome because the inflation rate assumes you own your house...and only consideres the cost of maintaining the house.</p>
<p>It's arguable that the real inflation rate has been higher than the declared one for decades, so people are on median even poorer than they are told they are.</p>
<p>But no. Printing a trillion dollars in money, buying a mona lisa with it, then burying the cash in the ground does not cause inflation. Which is more or less what the rich do with their money.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>First you'd need a personal banker. That is - a higher-level professional banker dedicated to your account. They aren't going to hire a 6 figure professional to handle a 20k account, so for one you don't have enough money...</p>
<p>And the terms can vary greatly. If you go in for a car loan there's the standard form and that's all you get. A super-rich person would hire a team of lawyers and bankers to write a contract and the bank's team would look over it and negotiate the finer points.</p>
<p>As for the terms, they could go either way. Perhaps borrowing a huge sum against some stock to be held in escrow and then simply making the regular payments from that and spending the rest, then taking a new loan to pay off the old one when you start to run out of money or it comes due. Or in fact a lifetime loan that perpetually acrues interest. It really depends on what the rich guy's team thinks is the best deal it can get.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>1) They represent enough profit to the bank for it to actually care enough to negotiate terms.
2) They have so much money the amount they borrow is a tiny fraction of their net wealth.
3) You can do something similar, you can take out a personal loan for 2000$ then make the payments with it and spend perhaps half of it, then take out another for 4000$. But the interest rate you get will be horrible because you represent a risk of default - you do not have a personal banker that can vouch to the bank that you own a trillion dollars and will never go bankrupt. All the bank cares about for you is your credit score. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regards to paragraph 3, you'd put $50 million with of stock in escrow and borrow the $50 million cash from the bank at $1,400,000 interest per year (2.8% annual interest).</p>
<p>Then, you use, say, $10 mill to buy a condo in downtown Manhattan, set aside $7 million to pay off the next five years of interest, and then you blow the remaining $33,000,000 on Lambourghini garages, blackjack and hookers, and whatever else floats your boat?</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p></div>		</li>
