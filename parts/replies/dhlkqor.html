			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally curious, I believe it was Kansas or Missouri that did a massive cut to all their state programs and from what I understand it's killed their market, industry, and state credit capabilities. Are they still going through a rough patch or are they completely fucked?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck it, I'll do the actual numbers specifically because of the dude who replied twice with Kansas City's GDP (the one in Missouri) through 2011. It's both irrelevant data <em>and</em> the wrong range, nice work. </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/d6iQ1EK.jpg" target="_blank"><strong>Kansas vs. national GDP, 2002-2016</strong></a></p>
<p>Data source is the St. Louis Fed's FRED tool (<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/KSNGSP" target="_blank">Kansas</a>, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP" target="_blank">National</a>), 2011 GDP is set to 100% for each series, in recognition of Brownback taking office that year. </p>
<p>Edit: If you'd prefer, you can look at the GDPs <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lD7LvID.jpg" target="_blank">anchored to 2010, before he takes office</a>. Same story, basically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the stat is for the % of the states budget funded by the federal government.  So if all states were to get the same &quot;amount&quot; (whether by per person or by state GDP) then all the conservative state would have to do is to just tax their citizens less and the effect would be what we see here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is true and an important point, fairer measures of what this statistic is trying to get at show much the same thing, if less dramatically. The darker states here take in more money from the federal government than they pay back in taxes. It's been argued that it is precisely this imbalance that allows them to keep their taxes low, which would lead to a worse value of this statistic.</p></div>		</li>
