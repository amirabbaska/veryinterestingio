			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would you skip?  For half a century processor manufacturing has known the direction it is heading (that is literally the point of Moores law) but has been hazy on how exactly to get there.  When you get to a point where things can be made reasonably better you put it into production and get some commercial advantage.</p>
<p>Also worth adding that the better tools help you get further.  I shudder to imagine anyone trying to design a modern CPU on a 386  machine.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't you just skip from a biplane to an F16? </p>
<p>At the time when biplanes were king, we didn't have the materials, manufacturing, computing power and other tools to make F16s. It would have been so far away that it would be inconceivable, why on earth would you have such small wings? Where are the propellers? How do you control a plane going that fast?</p>
<p>Have you heard the expression &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot;? It's giants all the way back down to the stone age and we're constantly adding more on top of that stack.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are asking, were larger size shrinks still difficult or did the difficulty start when we hit the infinitesimal scales today.</p>
<p>Absolutely it was very difficult. My grandfather worked as an engineer when they were shrinking from multiple micrometers (x1000 nanometers) to 600 nanometers in the 70s through the 90s and the difficulties were massive. Every step was essential and filled with new issues that quickly went into deeper and deeper levels of physics, engineering problems, requiring brand new facilities and processes that had never existed before, sensitivities, build tolerances, design principles, heat dissipation, etc, nothing could be taken for granted.</p>
<p>They thought they were at the cutting edge working at the size of bacteria cells, and now we are working at the thickness of a bacteria cell wall. At every stage we were working at the limits of our abilities and thought it was pretty damn impressive in the day, and I'm still blown away when I see the work that went in to these early chips with such rudimentary tools.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The example with the Wright brothers made me realize there are millions of things to think about along the way and each one has to be solved iteratively.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nothing would stop them, although they'd be slowed down because they'd also need to develop all the tech that the current semiconductor industry depends on.<br />
It's really all about acquiring knowledge on top of previously acquired knowledge, and acquiring knowledge just takes time. Aka &quot;it's hard&quot;.  </p></div>		</li>
