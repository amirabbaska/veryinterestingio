Cool-toned people will have veins that appear blue, warm-toned people will have veins that appear greenish, and neutral-toned people will have veins that look blue-ish in some places and greenish in others. It isn't a matter of whether your skin is light or dark; it's the undertones that determine how veins look.</p></div>		</li>
