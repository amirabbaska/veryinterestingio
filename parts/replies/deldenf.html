Case in point: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomaltulose" target="_blank">Isomaltulose</a> is indigestible to most bacteria (better for your teeth), has a much slower blood sugar spike (better for preventing insulin resistance).</p>
<p>I'm sure there are other sugars similar to isomaltulose that are also better for us that are also found naturally. Getting a mix of sugars and getting them in natural sources is much better for your health.</p>
<p>Fruit is fine, refined sugar isn't. Coca leaves are fine, cocaine isn't. Marijuana is fine, pure THC isn't. Beer is fine, pure ethanol isn't. Notice a pattern? When we refine a food/edible thing/drug into its purest form it becomes harmful because previously the concentration was so low you couldn't eat enough to really hurt yourself or it was a lot harder to do so. It's possible to drink a whole 2 liter of pepsi but a lot less so to eat 25 medium or larger apples. They have the same sugar content though. Besides in pure liquid/powder form it is much more easily absorbed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Indeed.  One of the earliest studies about saturated fat failed to account for sugar intake.  Saturated fat and refined sugar are quite bad for you in conjunction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another one used artificial trans fats in place of naturally occurring saturated fats. It was used to sell cereal. They knew people wouldn't stop eating meat anyway.</p></div>		</li>
