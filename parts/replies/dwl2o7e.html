It's not a line in space where weird shit starts to happen, it's just where the escape velocity increases from just below light speed to just above light speed. You would not know when you crossed that line as a first hand observer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No the electromagnetic force can’t act across the event horizon (that would be equivalent to light escaping).</p>
<p>What you are missing is that the event horizon isn’t a flat, hard barrier; it’s a point of interest on a smooth gradient.  The strength of gravity increases with the 1/r^2 law continuously.  The electromagnetic force didn’t really work even before it hit the event horizon.  Your atom was already shredded into subatomic particles before it hit the event horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see how they'd lose interaction. In the atom's frame of reference, there is no such thing as slightly inside and slightly outside the event horizon. It's pretty much uniform because of relativity. Given a sufficiently large BH, you could cross the horizon without noticing it (larger = less tidal forces).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why I assumed they did.</p>
<p>So if you took two hugely powerful magnets, aligned as to attract one another, and sent them towards the event horizon of a smbh so that by the time the first one was about to cross the horizon the trailing magnet still had not caught up but was within 10 metres or so. </p>
<p>As the first magnet crosses the horizon an outside observer wouldn't notice any dip in the trailing magnet's magnitude of acceleration due to loss of magnetic attraction force which had been acting to further accelerate the magnet on top of the gravitational force? </p>
<p>Though couldn't you then infer that the other magnet is still intact and interacting electromagnetically with the other magnet? Is that allowed?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does the electrons remain in their original energy states throughout the crossing despite temporarily losing interaction with each other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't lose interaction, at least if the atom is falling. Since the atom is falling inward, the outer edge of the atom will intercept a lightspeed signal emitted from the inner edge even though the light doesn't escape the horizon. By the time the light is absorbed, the whole atom is inside the horizon, so there's no need for the light to escape to interact across the atom.</p></div>		</li>
