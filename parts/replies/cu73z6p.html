			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone has a talent for being the showman. Stan embraced the spotlight and  I have to say its been as much a part of Marvel's success as their products. It was his job to sound as excited about the properties as the ten year olds who supported the industry for decades. As a kid it was neat to see someone older talk about these characters with the same glee as my friends. You didn't feel ashamed or shy about it because there was Stan Lee spouting off EXCELSIOR.  I know there is a whole business side to these things but such is life -Stan became the face and the heart whether or not that was by crafty machinations or other factors never mattered to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing a grown man be excited about comic did more than just get the kids excited, it kept them excited in their later year of life. Comic books, just like some other things, are sometimes labeled as something you are meant to grow out of. But seeing Stan, a full grown man, excited about these comics helped end that. That meant marvels customers weren't just made for kids anymore, but for all ages. </p>
<p>If you're strictly talking business, expanding your target audience can help sales immensely.</p>
<p>PS if this isn't making sense, I'm very sorry, I just had my wisdom teeth removed a few hours ago....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it not true that he also devised a way for stories to be written at a far quicker rate than before. He would have a number of artists draw out a general plot of a couple of hundred words and then come back and fill in speech bubbles. This resulted in pointless frames but meant he could keep churning out multiple story lines for various superheros.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly.   The Marvel Method was Stan ( or whoever was writing) coming up with the plot then handing it over to the artist to break down into pages and panels.  Then the writer takes the pages and scripts out the dialouge and narration</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.  Marvel was called Timely back then and it was owned by a businessman that treated writers and artists as independent contractors and basically disposable &quot;help.&quot;  This pulp publishing was a very competitive and low margin business back then and everything was run very cheaply.  Stan Lee was a relative, basically a cousin to the owner's wife, and became a staff writer and eventually into management.  He is the &quot;face&quot; because he was in a position to be and made himself the face and artists were still just the &quot;help.&quot;  It wasn't like they were just working for Marvel either, or just in comics.  They had a lot of other projects for different people.  This wasn't the era where the names of the artists were used to promote sales.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stan gets most of the credit because he stuck around. </p>
<p>Kirby refused to join Marvel as an employee which eventually lead to contract disputes. Ditko quit and now refuses to do any main-stream comic-book work. Bill Everett unfortunately got sick and passed away. Don Heck and Larry Lieber both jumped ship in the late 60s.</p>
<p>Other than Stan Lee, John Romita Sr. is the only other one I can think of from Marvel's silver age who stuck around. However he didn't join Marvel until 1965. So while he did have a major impact on Marvel (it was his work, much more than Lee's or Ditko's, that really defined Spider-Man), he's a bit too late to be called a creator.</p>
<p>Same thing with Chris Claremont. It's really Claremont's work that defines the X-Men, but 13 years after it was created. When giving creator credit you still need to go with Lee and Kirby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but to be fair: Claremont reinvented the X-Men almost entirely. He is absolutely the creator of the modern X-Men.</p>
<p>When Claremont took over, they weren't even producing new X-Men content; they were just reprinting old stories. Claremont essentially relaunched X-Men with Giant Size X-Men #1, creating an almost entirely new team. True, he did bring some Lee/Kirby characters back (Notably Cyclops) and, of course, Professor X was always there. Hecreated a lot of characters for X-Men and used some mostly unknown ones as well. (Notably Wolverine. Yes, there was a point where Wolverine was an obscure character who had appeared in two issues of The Incredible Hulk and that's about it. It's weird to think he was virtually unknown to all but people who had read those two issues of Hulk. I will also note Wolverine was created by Len Wein and John Romita, Sr.)</p>
<p>However, the reason I say Claremont deserves creator credit is because his X-Men had a dynamic that hadn't previously existed, he did things that hadn't been done before. Yes, he was only able to reach greater heights by standing on the shoulders of Lee, Kirby and everyone else who had worked on the original X-Men, but that's true of all Marvel. Everyone is standing on Lee &amp; Kirby's shoulders to some degree. (Much like all science fiction writers stand upon HG Wells.)</p>
<p>My point is, he created a team so wildly different from what had existed prior, I feel he must get a creator credit.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Romita, Ditko, etc should have been mentioned as well, but my brain was in X-Men mode. The others helped shape Marvel as much as Lee &amp; Kirby. I'm just a massive Lee/Kirby fanboy as Avengers, Hulk &amp; Fantastic Four were my favorite growing up and they're all Lee/Kirby creations.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>.. and Jules Verne and George MacDonald and if you really want to dig back Sir Thomas Malory wrote Le Morte d'Arthur which is basically the prose version of &quot;Sword in the Stone&quot;. Honestly if modern authors are standing on Wells shoulders it's because he was already standing on the 100's of authors before him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was waiting for someone to mention John Romita Sr. - for me, he was the standout Marvel artist in the comics I read as a kid growing up in the '70s (especially <em>Spiderman</em>), and its Romita's work (with all due respect to Jack Kirby) that I personally associate most with Marvel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Romita certainly defined Spider-Man more than any other person. I think what you read most as a kid defines who you see as the most associated artist with Marvel. I was a gigantic Hulk &amp; Avengers fan, so when I read their old stuff (which, honestly, has always interested me more than their modern stuff, even as a 14 year old.) I saw Kirby's art in both, I saw Stan Lee's name everywhere, thus Kirby/Lee came to define Marvel for me.</p>
<p>As a side note, ironically, the stuff I was less interested in in the late 80s is now interesting to me as history. Dont' get me wrong, I read plenty of (then) current stuff from 1988 (when I started reading comics) and on, but the 60s and 70s were always more interesting to me. Now I find myself totally uninterested in modern Marvel (though I know enough of what's going on to bitch about Secret Wars 3) and find everything from about 1995 and earlier tremendously better.</p>
<p>Though, to be fair, I was absolutely enamored by Marvel's &quot;cosmic age&quot; (starting with Infinity Gauntlet) in the mid 90s while it was happening. I was in the perfect target demographic (17) they were aiming at that for (mid teens to early 20s readers) and it sucked me in like nothing else has short of the early 60's Avengers. (Which I found absolutely fascinating for whatever reason.)</p>
<p>tl;dr: What you read as a kid defines who you see as the face of Marvel, I think.</p>
<p><em>Edit: I was 17 when Infinity Gauntlet came out, not 15. Oops.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been reading the earliest issues of X-Men from when it was still Lee and Kirby, and I am surprised by how much of the mythos is there from the beginning.  The basic conflict with Magneto is there, as are characters I would have thought were introduced much later, from Jean Gray and the Beast (even if he's barely, well, bestial) to Juggernaut, the Sentinels, and even Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch!  Yes, the series hit its true stride later, and it would not be the same without later additions from Wolverine to Jubilee.  But there's a charm in the simplicity of those earliest issues before the series started sagging under the weight of its convoluted, well, everything, and the dynamic illustrations are classic Kirby.</p></div>		</li>

<p>His kindness to everyone while enjoying these events really makes everyone look fondly on him as a great man. He is comicdoms Mr.Rogers.</p></div>		</li>
