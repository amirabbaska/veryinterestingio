<p>I may be remembering this wrong, but I think I've also read that some people (men and women alike) believed that politics was vulgar and voting was therefore beneath the dignity of women. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes I think there is a famous quote in an American debate about that. Which does bring up the point the politics of those times were nasty.. like dudes would have fist-fights and the 'town halls' were barns and basically large saloons. But there was a quote like that basically saying it would be beneath a woman to subject them to such indignity.</p>
<p>btw: I'm just going from what I remember from my college days. I long since forget the names of books or anything so I did a google and...
...there is nearly zero on this topic??</p>
<p>Im tempted to say this is because of 'identity politics' or something but basically google doesn't return much :(</p></div>		</li>

<p>That wasn't far off the mark...</p>
<p>Prohibition largely came about due to a women's movement.  Well, that and the fact that John D. Rockefeller really wanted cars to be designed to run on something made from oil rather than alcohol.</p></div>		</li>
