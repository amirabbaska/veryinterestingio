			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done this forever too. I've seen a lot people my age with that completely pocked face and wonder if that's going to be me when I'm 40. Maybe it just takes longer for some people? As of right now I don't have any issues or scaring, but I wonder if it's coming... :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP suggests using a needle to make a hole for the contents of the pimple to exit. However, if the pimple is at the stage where it has a hard plug, it's unlikely that you'll need the needle, because just by squeezing it with the Q-Tips the plug should exit the skin via the pore it's currently filling.
I will note that I consider using a needle a poor idea; it forces bacteria filled pus to leave the pore through a random hole in the skin instead of the top of the pore, which leads to a bloodier extraction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Needle seems like it would be less damaging to the skin tissue by forcing the hole rather than bruising the skin around it with pressure and force to surface the pus. But I've found the needle method is bloodier and not always effective at releasing the infected area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a 4x4 patch. So ideally, you'd just cut a small piece off of it - The entire patch is like a solid gelatin with a sticky underside. So you just cut it to shape, peel off the back, and stick it down. You could honestly cut little squares out of it, to potentially get 10 or 15 uses out of a single patch. Remember that it only needs to cover the popped pimple, which is basically a tiny pinprick.</p></div>		</li>
