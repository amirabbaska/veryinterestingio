			<div class="markdown"><p>That may have something to do with their heritage - dogs descended from northern wolves tend to like hugs, because large dog piles were necessary to maintain body heat and stay alive, while being fully submerged in water was almost certainly a death sentence, if it was cold enough.</p></div>		</li>
