			<div class="markdown"><p>The radioactive leaks have, for the most part, been contained. The contaminated groundwater and the coolant water that still leaks from the reactors is captured and filtered on site. When they mention radioactive water being stored on site, they are talking about water that contains tritium, the rest of the radioactive elements have been removed and captured. </p>
<p>Tritium is a form of unstable hydrogen that has two neutrons instead of zero. It bonds with oxygen to form water the same way regular hydrogen does. Its very difficult to filter out of water without using complicated and very energy intensive processes. </p>
<p>The thing is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium#Cosmic_rays" target="_blank">tritium is a naturally occurring element that is formed in the upper atmosphere when nitrogen interacts with radiation from space</a>. It falls into the ocean as rain and then naturally decays with a half life of 12 years or so. </p>
<p>To put it into perspective, the water being filtered at Fukushima Daiichi is increasing the stored inventory of 2.45 grams of Tritium (in Jan 2014) by about 0.64 grams each year. Natural production in the atmosphere is about 414.4 grams per year, with the natural environmental equilibrium being about 7,252 grams.</p>
<p>What should be done with the tritiated water at Fukushima? </p>
<p>It should be highly diluted with seawater and dumped into the Pacific far out where the ocean currents would disperse it fast enough that it would have no chance of causing harm to wildlife. It would increase amount of tritium in the ocean by 0.07% or so.</p>
<p>There's still a lot of very expensive decommissioning work and cleanup on land that is an ongoing process, but its mostly an economic problem now. Its going to be a challenge to tear down the old reactor containment buildings and remove the damaged fuel material within. </p>
<p>Consider this. When a fuel rod is &quot;used up&quot; and gets removed from a reactor, it typically spends about 10 years in a cooling pool where water keeps it at a safe temperature. After those ten years have passed, it is removed from the pool and put into &quot;dry cask storage&quot; meaning it is producing so little heat at that point that a giant concrete and steel container can radiate the heat to the air without damage. The damaged fuel still in the reactors is still extremely radioactive, but the heat coming off of it is almost to the point that that the water kept covering it in containment will only be there to block the radiation, not to keep things cool. Fukushima isn't going to start melting down again anytime soon, that risk has passed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a specific additional question related to this:  I've read, heard, and seen a lot of reporting on how the reactor is dumping radioactive materials into the ocean, still, and every day.  That this radioactive material is causing things like fur loss, skin lesions, etc, in polar bears, seals, walruses, sea lions, and fish.</p>
<p>I assume some of this kind of stuff is purely alarmist, since it's reported in the news, but...  I mean, they're definitely finding increased cesium (at least) in California, Alaska, Hawaii, and all around Japan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a fan on the Youtube channel Goddard's Journal. He's very good at investigating a claim, looking at a wide variety of actual scientific literature, and confirming or debunking that claim while linking to all the sources and clearly explaining his reasoning.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5mMX3t70I" target="_blank">This video</a> mentions the skin lesions on Seals at about 7 minutes in. The scientists that wrote the paper hypothesized that Fukushima may have contributed, so they tested for contamination, and concluded that radiation probably wasn't a significant factor. </p>
<p>There are so many other things that can cause health issues with sealife, and people tend to forget that things like bacterial infections, viruses, toxic chemical run-off from human activity, parasites, and so on are still in the Pacific and (aside from human impacts) always have been. </p>
<p>The only conclusive evidence of harm to sea life from Fukushima is limited to the inter-tidal zone immediately adjacent to the power plant and the worst impacts were in the months and years immediately after the disaster.</p>
<p>So much of the hysteria on &quot;green&quot; news sites or alternate news sources is completely fabricated, because fear sells advertising.</p></div>		</li>
