			<div class="markdown"><p>If this deal effects intellectual property the way it sounds, it will certainly impact our everyday lives. There are already ridiculous patents that seriously hold back a lot of companies from operating at peak efficiency, this deal will probably expand their likelihood. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much the one place where I agree.  Our patent laws are already ridiculous, and before we start thinking about multi-national expansion with them, we really need to clean them the fuck up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why the TPP needs to be stopped. Common sense reform should not be coupled with controversial new laws, especially in an up/down scenario. We need to separate the stuff (basically) everyone agrees on and pass it (undoing tariffs on good and services), and start discussing publicly the controversial new items (intellectual property). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Malaysia already respects US and other countries' intellectual property like patents and copyrights, so do all the western-pacific countries that I know of that are part of the TPP. This is done through the WHO. So what are you saying here?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All western pacific countries do not respect all American copyright and patents. The America patent and copyright system is overreaching and harmful to innovation. Extending the system as is is asinine. We need to reform our system before extending it to the world. </p>

<p>Our tax system and copyright and patent laws are ridiculously overcomplicated, and require huge amounts of effort and resources to appropriately navigate. These systems need to be reformed and simplified before extending them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You only touched the free-trade part of this... which from what I recall, comprises a few pages of the hundreds of pages this agreement is contained in. The bulk of this agreement is about intellectual property and the bypass of national sovereignty.</p>
<p>It's intellectually dishonest to ignore the majority of what this agreement entails, without even making an attempt to mention it in any detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah sorry about that. Was trying to maintain ELI5 level. Europe and Canada recently signed a deal with all of the same IP and foreign acquisition components. US and EU are negotiating a similar deal as we speak. It will be interesting if we can use these deals as precedents, but data or legal challenges will likely not be available soon enough, unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>
