			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we have a way to measure if they are tidally locked? Or are we just inferring that due to the tidal forces based on how close they are. Couldn't they be spinning if some somewhat recent event hit them and caused them to spin? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chances of something hitting them that significantly changes the rotation of the planet on its axis is remarkably small, though not impossible. As of right now, proximity is the main reason they think it is tidally locked, but as the entire world focuses their telescopes there over the next few weeks, we should be able to see if they really are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting hit isn't the only thing that can cause spin...gravitational interactions between planets and atmospheric effects can also impact locking.  Neither Mercury nor Venus are locked, after all.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to see if any of these planets have similarly not-entirely-locked rotational patterns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury isn't tidally locked in the typical sense of its rotational and orbital periods being equal, but there is a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance there, which may be related to its highly elliptical orbit (although the ellipticity of its orbit probably changes over long timescales).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both solar sails and fission have absolutely not been tested on any sort of large scale mission, and it's impossible to accelerate anything to the speeds you're suggesting without absolutely insanely large, staged spaceships. Even with fusion rockets, which are potentially most efficient rockets available, it's almost impossible to reach relativistic speeds, regardless of the hazards of such flight. </p>
<p>For example, for a pretty ideal Orion (nuclear pulse) starship, to reach 1% of c (with 120 km/s effective exhaust velocity), you need a mass ratio (initial/final mass of the vessel) of <strong>7,200,000,000 or 7.2 billion</strong>. This is equivalent to launching a few ants to 0.01 c using something the size of a Mercury-Redstone rocket, if you could somehow scale the technology to that size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite - we would reach 10-20% the speed of light at exactly halfway through the trip, so half the trip would be spent accelerating, and the other half decelerating, resulting in a much longer trip in reality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. You could go from 0 to 0.3c and back down to 0 and your average speed could be 0.15c, if you spend the whole time accelerating and decelerating, or 0.2c or 0.25c or higher if you accelerate and decelerate more quickly and spend most of your time coasting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just a few generations!</p>
<p>I've also got a question. Does that 0.1c - 0.2c range also account for drag from interstellar particles?</p>
<p>Cuz after the ship gets out of the heliosphere, won't the craft experience drag, and no more thrust?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: it depends.</p>
<p>How much speed do you lose when you hit a grain weighing less than a microgram at 0.2c at a rate of 10-20 impacts per square meter over the mission? If you weigh a microgram, a lot. If you weigh 50000 tons, not much. Not much compared to the amount of energy it takes to get to 0.2c.</p>
<p>But even these tiny grains and their tiny number mean you need shielding about a meter thick on the front of the craft, and most of it will be gone when you get there!</p></div>		</li>
