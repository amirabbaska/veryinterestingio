			<div class="markdown"><p>So just to clarify: when I log into my school's website to see my grades or my bank's website to pay bills, I'm seeing a website (after login) that exists, but no one else would be easily able to find it because you can't google someone's username to find their specific personalized sites like these. If a school has a website with a log in, the number of specific pages might be 1% on general information and 99% pages specific to individual users.</p>
<p>Is that what constitutes [a lot of] the deep web?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured this out a really long time ago, when I noticed I can't search some stuff I came across before.</p>
<p>Maybe the easiest example is trying to find a picture on facebook by google images - it just doesn't work.</p>
<p>Weird thing is, I once enteted my ID number in google and it found a .pdf of a list of pupils from elementary school on that school's website. That was a really weird search, my home adress was there too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.</p>
<p>I can go to a publicly available website to visit my work stuff, but afterward it opens a kind of vpn that I have to have physical credentials to get through. All of that stuff is inaccessible to anyone without a correct card and card reader.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. In fact, Tor is heavily subsidized by the US government. <a href="https://pando.com/2014/07/16/tor-spooks/" target="_blank">We have the US government to thank for Tor's initial existence</a>. Tor can be used by criminals to get away with crimes, but it can also be used by whistleblowers to protect themselves, such as is the case (I believe) with the person who leaked the &quot;Panama Papers&quot;. It's a double-edged sword.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard the point made that because the US government subsidizes/created TOR we should be suspicious on whether or not we're actually anonymous while using it. I'm wondering if that's really a valid concern or if those people are just being overly paranoid...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your question has already been answered by numerous commentors below you, but if you're still looking for my response:</p>
<p><em>Accessing</em> and <em>using</em> TOR is perfectly legal, but <em>committing other crimes</em> with it is still illegal. The TOR browser application can be used to browse web pages like your normal web browser; it just anonymizes (to a degree) your web traffic and also happens to be able to access <em>.onion</em> dark net extensions.</p></div>		</li>
