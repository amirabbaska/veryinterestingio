			<div class="markdown"><p>Go watch the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUwsrapJcA0" target="_blank">Reds</a>. An amazing followup to anyone who's seen or read Doctor Zhivago. It's a biopic about an American journalist/author on the front lines during the Russian Revolution. It's long and takes a long time to get to Russia but there's lots of great detail about the period from an American perspective.</p></div>		</li>

Very interesting, especially if you would like a first-hand account from a journalist of that era.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Source? What source? </p>
<p>/u/jbak31 said that lots of soldiers and officers in &quot;what was at the time known as the White Army were depressed&quot; during the October Revolution (what he called &quot;the Bolshevik Revolution&quot; for some reason,) but the White Army did not even exist at the time. It was founded after the October Revolution. Was he referring to the Imperial Russian Army? That does not fit either. The army of the Russian Empire dissolved before the October Revolution. &quot;Grandpa served in the Russian army?&quot; That can only be true if he served before 1919 or in 1992 or later. So that's extremely unlikely. If the &quot;grandpa&quot; had served in the Soviet army, /u/jbak31 would have most likely pointed it out. In other words, this fairytale is a load of crock.</p>
<p>If members of the White movement shot themselves in the head, the Reds would have abused that in their propaganda, there would be more serious sources than someone's grandpa, and OP wouldn't have posted in this subreddit. Who would the Red Army fight in the Russian Civil War without the White Army?</p></div>		</li>
