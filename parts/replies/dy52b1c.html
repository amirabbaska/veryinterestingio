			<div class="markdown"><p>As a heads-up for women reading this thread: <em>some</em> research shows that <a href="https://endocrinenews.endocrine.org/august-2014-pregnant-pause/" target="_blank">emergency contraceptives are significantly less effective for overweight women</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Women with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher experienced decreased efficacy, and the pill stopped working entirely in obese women with a BMI of 30 or higher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, on the bright side, research has not shown decreased efficacy for regular birth control in overweight women.</p></div>		</li>
