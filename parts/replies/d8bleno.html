			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up on that eggs can also hitch rides on the feathers of birds that hang out in ponds. So if you have a new pond it can spontaneously have fish start growing in it due to birds dropping fish eggs in it from other nearby ponds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a boy I discovered an abandoned cattle-pond out in the desert of the Southwest USA in a very remote area that had filled up from a particularly intense storm. The pond was absolutely seething with life, and very scary life at that. Among the throngs of invertebrates were Triops, tiny crustaceans that lay dormant for decades at a time.</p>
<p>It's absolutely amazing to think that these creatures had been surviving between rare events of showers that would fill the basins in the desert since the desert was ocean, millions of years ago. I have no idea what the other creatures were, some appeared to look like giant water fleas, others like little alien face-huggers and others still I can barely remember. If I had been older I would have had the presence of mind to take some to the University for identification. I returned to the site many times over the years after rain storms but never saw any of the creatures again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember pumping out the water from a hole dug by an excavator that had filled over the weekend from a storm. This hole was dug on a Saturday. Filled by rain Saturday night and Sunday. And on Monday when draining it there were turtles, snakes, and I kid you not, 3 ft long gar. It was the darndest thing I'd ever seen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did scoop up a few &quot;things&quot; in a water bottle, but most of them ate each other by the time I got home or didn't live very long. Again I was a small kid and my parents didn't seem to get the significance so I didn't have much support to go back and get segregated samples. (It was about 30 - 40 miles into the deep desert from where I lived, down roads impassable in normal vehicles) I went back a many times when I was older but didn't see anything alive, or the pond was no longer holding water for whatever reasons.</p></div>		</li>
