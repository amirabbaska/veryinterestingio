			<div class="markdown"><p>Efference copy, also called corollary discharge. Basically whenever you move a muscle a motor command must first be produced by the brain and sent to the activating neurons in your muscle. A copy of that command is sent to other brain regions that compute sensations.  The brain knows what you and the world will look like after you made a movement. This is very important for the visual system because you don't want to perceive the world as whooshing around all the time but to appear stable. Also, if you pick something up that you know or imagine has a certain weight, the brain predicts how the muscle strength has to change in order for you to be successful and not spill your tea all over the place. Try picking up a bottle that you think is full that is actually empty. </p>
<p>Now as to why tickling or head scratching doesn't give you the same sensation as when somebody else does it... nobody knows for sure (: It likely has to do with the fact that you know that this is somebody else touching you, which is something we all enjoy if it's someone we trust and like.</p></div>		</li>

<h1>how the fuck does that explain anything, and what's he's going to do when the kid thinks he can poke himself in the eye and not have hurt, because it's him doing it.</h1>
<p>You're one classy motherfucker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can tickle myself... I've actually showed this to doctors, neurologists and psychiatrists... They all say I'm &quot;special&quot;, I just figured that it's something to do with my autism and the fact that I don't identify with my body at all (my body is just a vessel, like a car).</p>
<p>I mean. I don't try to tickle myself, but I'm more than capable of tickling myself to laughing/crying/peeing (when younger) point and beyond. </p></div>		</li>
