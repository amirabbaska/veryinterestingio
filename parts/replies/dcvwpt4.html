			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the mass of the observable universe isn't easily detectable. Wikipedia quites it as being around 10^(53) kg (factor 10 smaller than what WA uses) and the lower bound of the mass is 10^(50) kg</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia's source for the mass is from 2006. Using the density and volume provided by wikipedia(the density being from WMAP published in 2012) yields <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4*10%5E80m%5E3+*+9.9*10%5E-30g%2Fcm%5E3" target="_blank">3.96*10^54kg</a>. That said wolfram list lower estimates at 10^50 kg and high estimates at 10^60 kg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm probably wrong, but here goes: Currently if I emit a photon from point A, it will eventually reach some point B very far away. But if the universe is expanding, and expansion is accelerating, then at some time in the future, light starting at point A will not be able to reach a certain point B. That sounds black-holey to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed I like it.</p>
<p>Just to be clear though, I didn't know it was an argument that was made often. I just fooled around with queries in WA to marvel at their magic sauce natural language processing, and when I saw 500+bn light years I thought something was off.</p>
<p>My physics teacher always told us to sanity check our results, and my reaction to this one was <em>yeah, doesn't work for this then</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you EL15 how it can have zero volume?
In my head that means nothing, not even an atom.
I really don't get this, I thought a black hole was huge?</p>
<p>Edit: I'd like to say thanks to everyone that replied, I don't think one explanation was a enough for me but after reading all I think by Jove I might have got it!
At the the basics anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the biggest probem with us understanding them is the fact that quantum mechanics and general relativity just break down for black holes. Lots of paradoxes and infinities arise with either theory. Often contradicting ones from the two different theories. <strong>It's a mess.</strong> We need a theory that makes QM and GR work together, a quantum theory of gravity. String theory is achieving this, slowly. Good news: the theory has already made some amazing discoveries when it comes to black holes. Bad news: it's weird. String theory suggests that black holes (the objects themselves, not the event horizon) is shaped like a circle. Not a sphere, a circle. Two dimensional.</p>
<p>The zero volume thing is just a result of GR being incomplete. It predicts that the density and space-time curvature tend to infinity, to a single point. It's probably wrong because history has shown that each time we encounter an infinity, we fixed it by completely changing our view of the universe.</p>
<p>I really can't explain <em>why</em> string theory makes this prediction because it's very complicated. To put it simply, the universe has 7 spacial dimensions that you cannot see and that are curled up into a mathematical shape called a Calabi-Yau shape. Space-time can tear apart and re-attach itself on small scales. A sphere inside of a Calabi-Yau shape can kind of collapse and turn into a two dimensionsal circle if these tears are a thing and under the right conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A black hole's apparent size (event horizon) is totally dependant on it's mass - AKA all the matter it has sucked up. This is the bending of space-time and light around the singularity. </p>
<p>All of the mass inside of a black hole is compressed into a single point (the singularity), therefore has no volume. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The event horizon is a stellar scale object, in practice.</p>
<p>The actual clump of mass inside it might have no radius, but the only reason some people think so is that we don't know what would be powerful enough to keep particles apart. It's more likely, imo, that matter just degenerates until exclusion principles kick in and information approaches maximal spatial efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The event horizon radius is what is usually thought of as the size of a black hole. After all, the singularity (if it exists) is not part of spacetime, and there are severe theoretical problems with understanding the interior structure of realistic Kerr black holes.</p></div>		</li>
