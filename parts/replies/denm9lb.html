			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thank you. I definitely didn't assume that it was okay for my eyes though, because it hurts in a really bizarre way and I figured it had to do with circulation... But yeah I only asked this because I was falling asleep with a light on, and when I tried to bury my eyes into my arms I felt that pressure, and saw those weird illusions. Definitely not something you wanna get in a habit of doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's interesting but I thought it was important that people wouldn't start mashing their eyes en masse to see what you're talking about, so I put a big fat warning up there. It's easy to assume that it's safe because it doesn't hurt a lot, but it's not safe. </p>
<p>Couldn't give an ELI5 answer though!</p></div>		</li>
