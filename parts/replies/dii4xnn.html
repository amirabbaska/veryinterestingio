			<div class="markdown"><p>First, it depends on the perjury statute where you are. Second, likely not because random jury nullification without a basis other than that you know about it is not a reason you &quot;can't&quot; render a verdict according to the law. You don't HAVE TO nullify, you can choose to. You CAN render a verdict according to the law. The question is if there's a reason you could not. For example, if you were a religious objector to the draft and knew that, no matter what, you could never convict someone of failing to register for the draft so you had to nullify despite all the evidence of guilt, then you should speak up. Or if you personally object to marijuana laws so stringently that you literally can't convict someone of possessing a joint, then you speak up. But just &quot;knowing&quot; that jury nullification is a thing in general isn't the same as being ethically or morally or personally outraged enough about the state of the law to be unable to render a verdict consistent with the law and facts of the case. </p>
<p>Personally, I think you SHOULD speak up in jury selection about nullification. In most states, defense attorneys aren't able to talk about it, and you talking about it makes sure the people who are picked for the jury (even if it's not you) will know about it. I think that it's unfair that some juries contain people who know about jury nullification and some, with similarly situated defendants, don't know about it at all. </p>
<p>There is also a legal rule called the &quot;rule of lenity&quot; which construes the law, when written in an ambiguous way, to the favor of the defendant. The law has to actually be ambiguously written, though. Basically, you're presumed to be &quot;on notice&quot; of the things that are illegal because there are public publications of criminal codes. If the codes are written in an overbroad or ambiguous way, you can argue that as a defense. </p>
<p>I also have a feeling that the judges you've asked are not so much stymied by your question as they are trying to keep things moving and not giving you a lot of attention. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I work for a court of law. I didn't ask the judges during a trial. I e-mailed them using internal court e-mail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a juror, you are protected by law from issuing the &quot;wrong&quot; verdict. You cannot be prosecuted for voting &quot;not guilty&quot; even if the evidence shows that the defendant is guilty. If a jury disagrees with the law or with the specifics of the case that in can render a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict without any of the jurors being in legal trouble for voting that way. People generally don't know that this is a thing. Those of us who do MIGHT be considered to possibly not render a &quot;legal&quot; verdict because we disagree with the law to begin with. Then again, we use the legal process of jury nullification to make that verdict.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A jury can't be convicted for knowingly passing a verdict they know to be incorrect, and a defendant can't be put on the bench for the same thing twice. </p>
<p>Given those two facts, imagine if a jury said &quot;not guilty&quot; despite overwhelming evidence that the perp is in fact guilty. That is jury nullification.  The jury is in essence, nullifying the law. It can happen when someone does something like murder the molester of his child.</p>
<p>Or it can happen when the bench is pretty racist, and someone murdered a person of the color they hate. </p>
<p>Jury nullification is not an intended thing though, and lawyers + judges don't like it, it undermines the law system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nullification is still a verdict (not guilty, edit: also could go guilty, I suppose, depending on the case), and is in accordance with the law.  You can answer truthfully: &quot;No there is no reason I cannot render a verdict according to the law.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>in accordance with the law. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The California Supreme Court has ruled that if you suspect another juror using jury nullification in determining their decision, then you have an obligation to report it.    </p>
<p>In 1997, in U.S. v. Thomas,[29] the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that jurors can be removed if there is evidence that they intend to nullify the law. </p>
<p>It really depends where you are. And you definitely shouldn't ever mention you are using jury nullification if you intend to use it. </p>
<p>It also has a long dark history. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The general idea is probably &quot;maybe you didn't know, but you could have and you should have.&quot;</p>
<p>Suppose there is a circumstance where it was literally impossible to know the law though?</p>
<p>Like if you're driving in a 65mph zone, then it turns into a 30mph zone, and back to a 65mph zone.  Except it's your first time on that road, and the only signage is now completely obscured by an overgrown bush (can't even tell there IS a sign, let alone what it says).</p>
<p>I would think that would be a pretty decent defense, but it's not &quot;I didn't know!&quot; it's &quot;No one <em>could</em> know&quot; which is obviously different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The law doesn't say &quot;you are not allowed to drive faster than  30mph on that particular road&quot;, the law says &quot;you have to abide to the speed limits/traffic rules <em>indicated</em> to you&quot; (or something like this). So If there is reasonable proof that the sign indicating the speed limit was obstructed then you should get out of the speeding ticket (and at least in Germany it works). Reasonable proof is, for example, a tree growing in front of it, a missing sign or there was a snow storm earlier and the sign might still have been covered by snow. On the other hand if you are a local and this street is close to your home or on your typical daily commute route the judge might decide that you still should have known about this particular speed limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true in the US. The problem becomes you have to pay to prove your innocence. </p>
<p>In some thing cut and dry as some brush just covering a sign it may be as simple as sending in a letter with the picture to the judge in others you might have to miss work to plead your case costing you a days wages to other where you need to actually pay court fees just to defend yourself or even hire a lawyer. </p>
<p>One could easily spend hundreds of dollars on a minor violation they are clearly innocent of.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something similar happened to me in the US. i was driving a country road and ran a stop sign because .... it was backwards. And it was a road i had never been on. The way that it reflected made it very difficult for me to tell it was a stop sign until i looked in my rear view mirror. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing is literally the reason you have a right to a hearing prior to a conviction - a chance to clarify not only what the law is, but should it apply in this specific situation (in your case, speed limits are generally required to be posted to put the public on notice - obstructed sign = inadequate notice). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if, though, the defense was one you had to provide some sort of proof for? That is, you could not merely assert &quot;I didn't know it was illegal&quot; and have that accepted like magic, rather you'd have to actually show that given the circumstances you could not have reasonably either known the law or suspected a legal problem might exist so as to prompt and investigation into the law surrounding it. For example, you almost certainly could not use an ignorance defense against a law forbidding murder, because an ordinary person could be expected to know you don't murder, regardless of whether they knew all the niggling little tiny ins and outs of the law. It would probably not apply to the majority of simple crimes, like murder, theft, rape, assault and so forth because &quot;common sense&quot; should tell you you don't do those things unless perhaps under some absolutely extraordinary circumstance like the person was confined for the entire time up to shortly before the crime by highly abusive parents growing up (such exceptional, hideous evils do and have occurred) so as to have no reasonable education at all or exposure to the world to which they could have formed the relevant moral ideas, something that would be utterly obvious were it the case and make proving the defense essentially trivial. Then again, such a person might not even be mentally sane enough to stand a trial in the first place so it may become kind of irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>
