			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why dollar/sub-run movie theaters can make money showing movies that have been out for months. They can often make more money per ticket than opening week, the customers are more likely to buy concessions, and they do it with a skeleton staff.</p>
<p>It's also why theaters don't mind bringing back award nominees. They can usually get a much larger percentage of ticket prices than their other movies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lots of things are a &quot;rip off&quot; if you look at them as a one off. 5 Star hotels are often a rip off if you just need a bed to crash in too. </p>
<p>Movie theatres need concession money to survive since opening weeks of movies give them very little money to survive on. They need the extra revenue, but it's voluntary. You don't have to pay it, but if no one does, the system will need to change (probably leading to higher ticket prices)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The theaters get all the money from concessions though, where their margin is much bigger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is actually a common Reddit myth. It's right to say that cinemas do rely on concession margin to stay afloat but the margin they get from the concessions makes up around 20-25% of their profit, ticket sales, even after the revenue share, is by far their biggest profit source, often 65-70%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I said margin not profits.  Those are different. The margins on concession sales are much larger as food and drink costs are minimal compared to the costs of displaying a film.  They make more overall on ticket sales but the margin is lower overall. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's ticket sales that generate most of their income... but overcharging for 'concessions' encourages people to stay away from the cinema, reducing their ticket sales.</p>
<p>Seems to be a winning business strategy!</p></div>		</li>
