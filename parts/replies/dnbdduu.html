			<div class="markdown"><p>Also make fonts and while we as a species (type designers) love to get into pedantic long arguments about everything, this is a really good ELI5 and I don't see any point in putting finer points on things.</p>
<p>I will add that <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/info/opentype-flavors-ps-tt/" target="_blank">the file extension doesn't necessarily tell you everything about the font</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It's really too damn confusing for users.</strong> Almost no professional graphic designers know these differences, and they're the customers who should if anyone does.</p>
<p>There's also a new spec for OpenType that was released about a year ago — <a href="https://medium.com/@tiro/https-medium-com-tiro-introducing-opentype-variable-fonts-12ba6cd2369" target="_blank">OpenType Variable Fonts</a>. At the moment, the big problem is settling on, or rather exploring, what UI would allow designers to actually use the variable features in fonts. To my knowledge, <a href="http://www.underware.nl/fonts/zeitung/features/Flex/#feature_info" target="_blank">Underware's Zeitung Flex</a> is really the only thing on the market with a fully functioning UI extension that allows you to actually use it professionally. Chrome and Safari are in the process of adding support, so I'd expect this format to proliferate in the decade ahead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So please use your allowance to buy fonts and don't steal. </p>

<p>What's your opinion on all the &quot;free&quot; font sites out there?  As a user of online fonts for various personal and small-scale projects, it's incredibly easy to just browse for something I'm looking for and download it under the personal use license.  With so many fonts out there, it's often trivial to use a free copycat font if a specific &quot;pro font&quot; I'm looking for isn't available.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Buying a font from a foundry supports the industry and you generally will have a better product. But, not everyone cares about or will use things like tabular figures. Something a free font probably wouldnt bother with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an awesome font site I use a lot called LostType and they have a Pay-What-You-Want model for everything. From what they describe, the money goes directly to the font artists, but I admit that I haven't really dug into it to try and verify.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like the difference between a self-published book and a book from a bestselling author (with a publisher, editor, etc). Sure, there are some good self-published books, but most are crap.</p>
<p>There are a lot of decent free fonts out there.</p>
<p>Most of the time, though, you'll be getting amateur work with lousy quality. The outlines will be heavier in some parts and lighter in other parts, you'll get limited glyph sets, and there's rarely any kerning.</p>
<p>If you want to use a free knock-off font for your professional work that's up to you. A font from a type foundry runs about $50, so its not breaking the bank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah; you got around to it in the Adults section, but it's worth highlighting:</p>
<p>There are different container formats at play here; back when the TrueType specification was developed to replace PostScript Type 1 and bitmapped fonts, the internal outline description and hinting and kerning info were all standardized, but a number of container formats were created -- notably Apple's version that used resource forks to store the data and Microsoft's flat file format.  When Apple moved to OS X, they switched to using Microsoft's flat file format for the container.</p>
<p>But work was already underway to unify Postscript Type 1 and Truetype packaging, and that work was in the OpenType specification.</p>
<p>The beauty of OpenType packaging is that it could contain a TrueType font description and/or a bitmap, and/or a postscript font description.  It would then be left up to the rendering system which of these would be used, defaulting to TrueType first, then PostScriptT1, then bitmap.</p>
<p>THEN came along the idea to improve Type 1 and make it easier to package, and from this we got CFF-OTF, which has for the most part replaced T1 as an embedded format.</p>
<p>So in answer to the original question: if you're talking about .otf and .ttf files, go for the .otf files if available; they're likely more modern and more complete.  They may contain any combination of TrueType, CFF-OTF/T1, and bitmapped fonts, although nobody's really done bitmapped fonts since bitmap/T1 pairs fell out of favor due to the introduction of OTF containers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Was there any work on adding svg into otf, or would svgs always be separate?</p></div>		</li>
