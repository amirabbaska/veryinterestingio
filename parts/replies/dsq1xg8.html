			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, man. I kinda figured that most civilians don't really know a lot about this, hence the reason I went into such detail. Especially the bit about the T+time on the forehead (that's straight outta military first-responder/trauma training, actually). Glad to know it was appreciated!</p>
<p>Something else you might find helpful - if you have to administer an injection of something to a patient - for civilians it'd most likely be epinephrine or perhaps insulin, but this applies to any injections, such as morphine - stick the needle through the flap of their breast-pocket or shirt lapel, and bend the needle downward in a 'U', to hold it in place. Or if it's a retractable needle, then just leave it secured prominently on their person. Doctors and EMT are trained to universally recognize this as evidence that the victim was treated with &quot;X,&quot; so they know what they can further treat them with (or what they cannot, since some medicines cannot be mixed).</p></div>		</li>

<p>TL;DR If nothing else remember to place ice either directly on the wound after bandaging or directly above the wound.  Most people have never even heard of this and it can save a life.  In an extreme emergency where time is of such essence where infection is of no concern, ice may even be packed directly into the wound.  The coldness constricts the blood vessels and so reduces blood flow.</p>
<p><strong>PRESSURE:</strong> Apply direct, continuous, firm pressure for at least 20 minutes. For severe bleeding, a tourniquet can be applied above the site, but take caution when doing so as it can cause loss of an extremity if applied improperly.</p>
<p><strong>REST:</strong> Immobilize the injured extremity to control blood loss, especially after bandages have been applied and secured. Resting the bleeding extremity is especially important during transport as movement can encourage additional bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>ICE:</strong> Applying ice promotes constriction of the blood vessels. This means less blood can be lost from the site of injury. Ice packs are generally placed directly over a covered wound or above the wound.  In extreme situations I've seen ice packed directly into a wound though.</p>
<p><strong>CHECK:</strong> Checking the patient and injury are the most important thing during bleeding emergencies. Signs and symptoms of shock should be identified and if present, the patient must be immediately brought to the nearest emergency room for treatment. </p>
<p><strong>ELEVATE:</strong>  Elevate the injured part to stop bleeding from the veins and capillaries. If it is also possible, the patient should be placed so that the head is positioned lower than the trunk, this may be done by elevating the legs. You do this to hopefully keep oxygenated blood flowing to the brain even if blood pressure is lost in other areas of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Signs &amp; Symptoms of Shock Include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Confusion</li>
<li>Cool, moist or clammy skin</li>
<li>Increased or rapid heart rate</li>
<li>Increased or rapid breathing</li>
<li>Low blood pressure</li>
<li>Decreased urine output</li>
<li>Pale skin or pallor</li>
<li>Thirst</li>
<li>Increased sweating</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I didn't know about the ice (probably because I was trained by the Army, and they just assumed it wouldn't be on-hand), but it makes perfect sense. Good to know. Thanks, man. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah emergency medicine is a little different when you can expect an ambulance and have supplies on hand instead of bullets flying overhead.  Good advice on writing the time you put the tourniquet on though, that's really important information for the doctor.</p></div>		</li>
