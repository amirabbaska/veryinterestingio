<p>I can't quote numbers, but basically your brain limits muscle force output to protect bones, connective tissue, prevent tears and rips, etc. This is why people are stronger when experiencing an adrenaline rush - that neural limit is tempered. The skinnier man may have a more generous neural limit on his muscles, and therefore recruit a greater percentage of myofibrils for any given lift. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What you're referring to is called autogenic inhibition, and can be the reason why someone may garner the strength to lift a heavy object off of a child who may die from being underneath, but it plays essentially no role in the question described. </p>
<p>I think the majority of your answer does a disservice to the question. Biomechanics and lever arm length are hugely important factors for why some people can generate more force through rotation (torque) compared to someone else, but again, I believe that's not what this person is asking. It's &quot;why can a guy who looks big and strong only lift 20% more than a skinny guy&quot; - I just assume same size and lifting proficiency, but maybe the OP can clarify.</p></div>		</li>
