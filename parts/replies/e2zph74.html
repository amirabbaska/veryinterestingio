			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that it was exceptionally rare to have women onboard ships which were sailing to find new lands, let alone kissing sailors... Unless the sailors were kissing other sailors which makes sense why native peoples may have found that strange. But I believe they will follow through with sources to put this to rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right! Sorry, I originally learned this from one of my history of sexuality and gender courses in college. But you don’t have to dig too deep online find contemporary accounts from Europeans talking about Native American culture: </p>
<p>Here’s a brief reference from 1700 in Pennsylvania:   <a href="http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/becomingamer/peoples/text3/indianscolonists.pdf" target="_blank">http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/becomingamer/peoples/text3/indianscolonists.pdf</a></p>
<p>There are also current hunter gatherer societies that don’t have where kissing does not play a noticeable role.</p>
<p>Here’s a fun little secondary source on that:
<a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/sex/the-cultures-where-kissing-doesnt-exist/news-story/6d8abedd8aaf30f4b0203a64cacefda4" target="_blank">https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/sex/the-cultures-where-kissing-doesnt-exist/news-story/6d8abedd8aaf30f4b0203a64cacefda4</a></p>
<p>On a personal note I found it adorable while living in Southeast Asia that parents don’t typically kiss their children like we would in the US, but instead it’s more common to give infants and young children little “sniffs” around their cheeks.</p></div>		</li>
