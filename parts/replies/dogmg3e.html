<p>It will have a diameter of 40m (compared to a diameter of 8.2m for the VLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put that into perspective, look at the area: It will have a mirror area of 978 m^(2), compared to 53 m^(2) for each of the 4 VLT mirrors, a factor 19 in terms of light collection.</p>
<p>The ELT mirror area is as large as the 20 largest existing telescopes combined. It is not just a larger telescope. It is a new type of telescope.</p></div>		</li>

I mean they could have gone for some prestigious name that stands out, or at least some vague descriptive title like &quot;Deep Space Observatory&quot;, but <em>noooooo</em> Bob the Builder called it a Very Large Telescope and that kind of stuck or something, hahaha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think it's because it makes the job of naming future telescopes easier. I mean, you can call it the Grand Reticulating Monumental Array of Eternal Joy, but then the next one needs even more superlatives. Where will it end?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, there's nothing different about that and the current naming convention. Where do you go after extremely large telescope? When you start using adjectives in names it all becomes a mess. Should just name them after mythical deities or prominent females like we do everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for providing these interesting examples!  Do you know how these projects are chosen over other possibilities? For example what projects did LISA have to compete with to get selected?</p>
<p>Iâ€™m curious how many big proposals like these come up each year, how they are created and how many are passed over due to lack of consensus or funding.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I didn't find the direct LISA competitors now, but they were proposed telescopes and space missions with other science goals.</p>
<p>Typically tens of ideas are studied for every mission that actually gets funded. They start as side-projects without funding, if they get interesting the scientists apply to get some small amount of funding for dedicated studies, if that research looks promising there is another funding round for more detailed development, and if that looks promising as well there is a chance that the mission gets approved and funded. In every step most proposals fail or get merged with other proposals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So scientist just make these proposals on their free time because what else could they spend their time on? Or is it more like they do it hoping to get future income from it?</p></div>		</li>
