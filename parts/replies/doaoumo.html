			<div class="markdown"><p>It has less to do with pelvis size and more to do with the baby needing more energy (to grow its brain). While it’s true that babies heads would struggle to fit through the birth canal, there are other primates who have the same issue despite having relatively much smaller brains. This evidence may suggest that another factor besides size is at play. If you look at energy expenditures of the fetus, it happens to be that birth occurs at the moment they require more energy than they are getting via the placenta. They are essentially hungry for breast milk. This mechanism may be how birth is regulated in all mammals, but I only learned it in the context of human evolution. </p>
<p>Now, there are two types of genes which are battling against each other: one to ensure the baby is small enough to be safely birthed, and one to ensure the baby is big and strong. Either the mother or father pass on one of these types, and there are common genetic diseases related to the malfunction of their expression. These would be Prader Willi (father gene turned off) or Angelman (mother gene turned off) syndromes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To look at it another more simplistic way, consider that humans are all born premature. Ideally we would spend another few months in womb to grow to a more advanced state, but because of your previously mentioned size limitations we've adapted to being born earlier than ideal, and compensate by having a slower start and being even more helpless at birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on his point about language:</p>
<p>Most of our communication is nonverbal (that's why people often misunderstand when communicating digitally) so we need to learn to understand not only a language and grammar, but context as well. A good example of this is irony. Verbal irony is when the intended meaning is the opposite of what is actually said (or written); humans are usually able to recognize when something spoken is ironic. This takes an incredible amount of intelligence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, twitter is a shithole because it gives every moron with thumbs a voice, no matter how idiotic their opinions are. Luckily our brains are able to filter through information pretty well and block out the dipshits. Twitter is pretty handy because by only reading the hashtags you can gauge how stupid a post is; anything with the hashtag #woke is probably nonsense with no basis in fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 types of irony: Verbal, Situational, and Dramatic. Verbal and Situational are the 2 types of irony encountered in everyday life. </p>
<p>Verbal irony is when the words spoken are the exact opposite of the person's intended meaning. Sometimes verbal irony is also sarcastic, but a common misconception is that sarcasm is always ironic. A sarcastic remark is intended to offend, mock, and ridicule; it is indicated by a specific vocal inflection. In many cases a sarcastic statement is also ironic, however the two are not mutually inclusive. </p>
<p>Situational irony is when the opposite of an expected outcome occurs. Often, people misinterpret coincidence as irony. For something to be ironic, it can't just be an unlikely outcome; the outcome must be the opposite of what is expected. If you need an example of this mistake, look at the Alanis Morissette song <em>Ironic</em>; not one of the situations she describes is ironic. Each is just coincidence. What is ironic, is that not one example of irony is described in the song. It is irony because the opposite of what is expected occurs. </p>
<p>Dramatic irony does not exist in real life. It exists only in film, theater, and literature. Dramatic irony is when the audience is more aware of what is happening than the characters. One place we see dramatic irony is in horror movies. The audience already knows that the killer/demon is in the basement, and inevitably the main character goes downstairs to hide and they die. </p></div>		</li>
