			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just as a fuck-you to the Communists, but to shore up support for anti-Communism at home. As strange as this sounds at this late date, there was a lot of fear that, because communism promises a higher standard of living for working people (whether it delivers or not), working people might eventually vote communist.</p>
<p>So &quot;under God&quot; was added to the pledge, and similar changes were made to the money, to remind the American people that Communism was anti-God. Which was a bit of an exaggeration, but it worked; after that propaganda campaign, &quot;godless communism&quot; practically became one word in American English.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kind of fitting, considering they were trying to bring about Heaven on Earth.</p>
<p>Ended up making a good facsimile of the other place, but their original intent was a Godless Utopia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it was all part of &quot;the red scare&quot;... propaganda against the Soviets.  same reason &quot;in god we trust&quot; was added to our money (edit:  apparently it was on coins long before the 50s and was only added to paper money at that time).  It has been challenged before and I believe it went to the supreme court, which came up with some ridiculous justification for allowing it.  </p>
<p>here is the relevant part of the wiki article on the money issue specifically... which was used as justification for the national anthem as well.</p>
<p>Advocates of separation of church and state have questioned the legality of this motto, asserting that it is a violation of the United States Constitution, prohibiting the government from passing any law respecting the establishment of religion.[30] Religious accommodationists state that this entrenched practice has not historically presented any constitutional difficulty, is not coercive, and does not prefer one religious denomination over another.[30]
&quot;In God We Trust&quot; as a national motto and on U.S. currency has been the subject of numerous unsuccessful lawsuits.[31] The motto was first challenged in Aronow v. United States in 1970, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled: &quot;It is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage and currency 'In God We Trust' has nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment of religion. Its use is of patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise.&quot;[32] The decision was cited in Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, a 2004 case on the Pledge of Allegiance. These acts of &quot;ceremonial deism&quot; are &quot;protected from Establishment Clause scrutiny chiefly because they have lost through rote repetition any significant religious content&quot;.[33] In Zorach v. Clauson (1952), the Supreme Court also held that the nation's &quot;institutions presuppose a Supreme Being&quot; and that government recognition of God does not constitute the establishment of a state church as the Constitution's authors intended to prohibit.[34]
Aside from constitutional objections, President Theodore Roosevelt took issue with using the motto on coinage as he considered using God's name on money to be sacrilege.[35]</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of course it's an issue, and that's why it's always in the courts.  &quot;God&quot; in English has always meant the Judeo-Christian god.  (Other gods are referred to by name.. If you doubt me, just Google &quot;Who is God&quot;).  And it means that atheists and polytheists are visibly ostracized because there is not a pledge they can take without submitting themselves under someone else's god concept, which is plainly a violation of their First Amendment rights.  How coincidental, then, that all the Supreme Court justices who permit this are Christian  or Jewish.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just another kind of &quot;separate but equal.&quot; Most of the lawsuits around the pledge are instigated exactly because either teachers think it IS compulsory, or decide it should be regardless of the law, as well as fellow students who harass or attack those who don't conform. </p>
<p>And, yes, a lot of those assholes will be assholes on some other pretext, but why hand them one?</p></div>		</li>
