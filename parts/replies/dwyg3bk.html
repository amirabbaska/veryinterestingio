Soaps cannot act on hard water, whereas detergents can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is that why it stings when we have a cut and wash it with soap?  There's a break in the keratin layer, and the detergent to stick to our cells?  Obviously this results in picking up whatever bad stuff is in the cut, but would it cause slight damage to the good cells around it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, actually. It's also why the detergent kills the good cells in our body when ingested, such as laundry detergent pods, and why they're so deadly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soap doesn't kill <em>all</em> bacteria.</p>
<p>I'm not much of an expert on biology, but most Gram-negative bacteria have a very thin peptidoglycan layer, unlike Gram-positive bacteria which have thicker peptidoglycan layers. Gram-negative bacteria, however, do not have their peptidoglycan layer exposed, and have many layers protecting the cell membrane, making them harder to kill as detergents can't easily go through these layers. Gram-positive bacteria, however, have ONLY the thick peptidoglycan layer. The thick layer makes it so that detergents are easily absorbed through the layer, and permeate through to the cell membrane. </p>
<p>Edit: How washing rinses a lot of the bacteria, even the resistant ones, on our hands is because most of the bacteria cling to the dirt or the dead skin cells that easily wash off.</p>
<p>Edit #2: Can someone with a Microbio background confirm this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, actually in micro right now as part of pre-med stuff.</p>
<p>Bottom line: soap doesn't really <em>kill</em> any bacteria. Soap is a surfactant (in industrial - not medical - terms). Basically it helps break down the barrier between lipids/oils and water, making it easier for water to carry off microbes. In addition to that, it holds the oils and any additional particles - e.g. dirt - in suspension (wrapping it up in soap molecules like a rubber ducky germ suit.) This all makes it easier for the water to wash the microbes off your hands. You're furthering this removal mechanically when you wipe your hands on a paper-towel or whatever (actually why a paper towel is better for your 'cleanliness' than an air-dryer).</p>
<p>In fact, if you culture someone's hands immediately following a hand washing you'll find a large and lovely assortment of microbiota growing on your plate the next day. This is not a bad thing, the normal microbiota are pretty standard across most humans and generally aren't anything to be worried about. To further assuage your concerns about soap, think of it as a washing off what doesn't belong (and keeping what does). If you truly want to destroy the life on your hands use ~70% or higher concentration alcohol-based hand sanitizer. I personally recommend you don't - unless you're actually in the medical field - because really the bacteria on your hands don't matter (edit: and washing your hands is more than sufficient). But you do you.</p>
<p>As far as confirming/denying /u/Loki_123 's statement. Yes G- bacteria have a very thin PG layer sandwiched by an inner and outer membrane; whereas G+ have a thick PG layer and singular inner membrane. The gram negative/positive notation comes from the fact that the thick PG layer in G+ strains is what actually holds the gram stain in place (it collapses in on itself during staining, trapping the violet stain while the thin membrane of the G- permits the violet stain to be drawn out by alcohol during the process).</p>
<p>Edit: /u/celo753 that's a big ol' negative. Bacteria do not have protein coats, peptidoglycan is a fancy polysaccharide (sugar). Viruses - on the other hand - do have a protein based coat that's known as a capsid.</p></div>		</li>
