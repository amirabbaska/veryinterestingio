			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand how your answer is the top answer here as it is very flawed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's much more expensive and difficult to automate trains, because of regulations, the lifespan of the rolling stock, and the infrastructure involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trucks are also heavily regulated, their lifespan is also quite long (not as long as trains of course, but longer than cars) and the infrastructure is a lot more hostile compared to tracks. Your summary explains nothing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As others have already mentioned, a huge chunk (if not everything in someplaces) of the actual railway infrastructure is already automated, such as signals and switches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the only part where your answer is correct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Europe strives to have an unified system (ETCS) which controls trains (and their safety measures), which means that a train can go from one point of Europe to the other without having to switch engines or even drivers. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This system has nothing to do with automation. It dictates <em>where</em> a certain train can drive, it poses no problem to automation. That the <em>interface</em> to the signal is differente from one country to the other, is not relevant as long as the information is there in some form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are multiple levels, which bluntly put refer to the available technology on the rolling stock and the infrastructure. The lowest level is still using the &quot;normal&quot; signals, whereas the highest levels are not using signals at all, but requires trains to have a constant radio connection to a control center.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, how the information gets to the train is irrelevant (modern automation is advanced enough to recognize pretty much everything a human can recognize, including signs and audible alerts).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lower ETCS levels do not offer you much choice in the way of automation, higher levels do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are not talking about signaling automation. We are talking about automating the train itself (i.e. the job the driver does).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, this is costly, as you need to upgrade your engines (which can easily last 50 or more years, and are expensive to replace) and add additional security infrastructure (cell towers to provide the radio connectivity). Depending on your geography, the latter can be tricky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, automation is good enough that it can somewhat drive a car. Automating the train driver is trivial and can be done autonomously (with no need to communicate with things outside of the train itself).</p>
<p>I do agree that this is a cost-problem (more on that later).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put differently, when asked &quot;Would you like to enter a metal box that's going very fast next to other boxes that are going very fast, and all these boxes are controlled by some computer very far away?&quot;, the answers you would get would probably be rather... conservative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is wrong. We already asked this question and the answer is: yes.</p>
<p>There are passenger transportation vehicles that are 100% automated. There are passenger transportation vehicles where the &quot;driver&quot; is just a glorified kill-switch operator. And there are passenger transportation vehicles that are a lot more automated that your run-of-the-mill freight train while moving in a lot more dimensions and in a much greater speed.</p>
<p>An example for each:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_guideway_transit" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_guideway_transit</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Metro" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Metro</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even with the amount of security we have these days, the software still has (smaller) flukes from time to time. A trained human operator can notice these mistakes and question the computer's decision, something that computers themselves have a harder time to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Computers are better at driving things than humans. Is our current technology advanced enough that driving stuff with no humans is less dangerous than having humans driving it?</p>
<p>Planes: in a few years, probably.
Cars: probably yes.
Trains: certainly yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another one is the security bit. Train tracks are often exposed due to their nature, and might even include dangerous zones such as railroad crossings or stations without under-/overpasses. A human driver can see those dangers and act accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All solved problems. LIDARS exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One part of being a train driver is to check the train for anything suspicious during the journey, especially on freight waggons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>During</em> the journey, drivers have the same information that a computer would have. Trains need to stop for such checks. No need for drivers.</p>
<p>My view: The reason that trains are not automated is because the salary of the driver is a small fraction of the cost of operating a train (trains are big and carry a lot of stuff). When sensors become cheap enough, then we will see trains getting automated.</p>
<p>There is no research being done because there is no research to do. This is a solved problem. All problems solved with car automation automatically solve train automation problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one concern we should have is hacking. The more computerized we build trains the more network security required. Somebody being able to shut down a whole grid or crash trains all with a laptop would be very very bad. So far people have figured out how to hack into most any modern day electronic and im sure someone would explore doing it to trains.</p>
<p>Many governments both on the left and right would most likely explore this. Random people who find it as a challenge. Random people looking to harm others. People acting out violence against humans to drive a politcal or religious point. This sort of stuff worries me about the upcoming techno future </p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends on the implementation. As I am not particularly familiar with the current control systems for trains, I cannot precisely say now full automation would be done. But following the current model for cars, there would be limited O/I for high level guidance (GPS or similar), which is subservient to a closed system that uses sensors to make low level decisions. This type of system is difficult to impossible to infiltrate depending on implementation. The primary danger is fake objects created with EM that the automation may take dangerous behavior to avoid (say, slamming the brakes to avoid a virtual object with causes a crash with cars from behind). Assuming redundant sensors and proper error handling, for trains this would most often result in erroneous stopping at worst. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick rebuttal.</p>
<p>Trucks are much less expensive and don't last nearly as long.  It makes a rather obvious difference in the cost benefit analysis.  Another is that trains will be largely involved in subsidiaries.  For example, in Texas, TXDOT operates much of the railways while independent companies own and operate their portions (typically by city/county/intermunicipal jurisdiction) and the state provides typically a 80/20 match on these projects.  Therefore, while trucks are more or less privately owned, rail systems are commonly tax subsidized even when privately owned and operated.  That makes replacing something in the name of future benefits more difficult to move forward with from a political/planning/financial standpoint.</p>
<p>LIDAR would not be adequate as he mentioned posts and signs along the track rather than in the path of the vehicle.  I assume this indicates that the system would have a difficult time discerning a post vs a potential hazard.  How will it know whether someone is standing next to the track or if it's a sign?  There are obvious solutions but as with most obvious solutions, I believe it would be massively expensive.  What I imagine is that the network's geomap would eventually include all possible infrastructure to communicate to the system when something is in fact not a hazard.</p>
<p>I believe you are correct that the salary is a drop in the bucket with this mode of transportation.  I read somewhere that a city-wide bus network typical reaches 40% of its budget in wages (and is almost always over budget too) where as a metro rail is typically under 7%.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mentioned LIDARs as an example. While I am a professional in the automation sector, I do not have any expertise in autonomous driving. Computer vision can easily discern a person from a pole (at least a lot better than a human can in 99.9% of cases). Keep in mind that a human propably will not even see the person if it is night time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How far can automated sensing equipment work reliably? Because my first thought was that unlike cars, trains need a lot of room to slow down or stop, and if a human can more reliably identify an obstruction or has a better feel for visibility in upcoming areas than an automated sensor can, then that's a clear point in favor of the human.</p>
<p>In addition, where a car crash can screw up the lives of a few people and bog down a commute, a train crash has the potential to ruin hundreds of lives and create traffic issues that reverberate through the state (as happened in my state some years back when an asshole tried to commit suicide by parking his car on train tracks), meaning that safety is going to be even more critical for a train than a car.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Whilst you make many good points, on this one the answer is no.</p>
<p>A mainline (&gt;100tonne) train doing 120mph has a stopping distance measured in miles, certainly Beyond-Visual-Range of the driver.</p>
<p>The only way a driver will be aware of a problem with a crossing or people on the line is if they receive a radio call from control, who in turn have received a report of said hazard. There is little advantage in this case compared with a computer-controlled train because the notification of the hazard ahead necessarily has to go through a central control point before it can be passed to the train - whether it's a human or computer doing the driving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point about safety is more about the <em>perception</em> of safety than actual safety.</p>
<p>We can make cars and trains that can drive more safely than humans and that will only get better. These automated systems can do complex physics calculations in a fraction of a second to determine the &quot;safe route&quot; through a threat. These systems don't have to rely on the visible spectrum of light and can instead use frequencies that can see through snow and fog. These systems can wirelessly coordinate complex responses with other such vehicles (e.g. &quot;hey car, I'm going to swerve 23.5 degrees and I'm decelerating at this rate. Adjust your path accordingly.&quot;) These systems don't have the same attentional limits as humans who studies show can only pay attention to one thing at a time. Instead, these systems can actively incorporate readings about the inside and outside of their vehicle, GPS/maps, remote communications and data from other vehicles. All in all, as they stand now, automated vehicles have substantially better capacity for attention, substantially better capacity to strictly comply with protocol and often substantially more powerful or honed senses for the task at hand.</p>
<p>The &quot;trust&quot; component you speak about relates less to that fact and more to the <em>perception</em> of safety. People are uncomfortable trusting automated drivers <em>despite</em> the fact that they're often safer. People are uncomfortable with not having control during an accident, despite the fact that that will make accidents much less common.</p>
<p>The real downside to automated vehicles is the &quot;last mile&quot; problem. Trains can't get you to every doorstep and outside of major cities that means that you often have a prohibitively long walk to rely on a train to get everywhere you need to go. Meanwhile, the complexity involved in figuring out where to park or how to go down the unmarked or dirt driveway or road, etc. are very difficult problems for self-driving cars and the best solution may rely a lot on the opinion of the driver and the owner of the property they're going to. So, while automated cars can get you most of the way to many destinations, there are still many cases in the world, especially outside of cities and highways, where you have to switch to manual mode. The difference is, unlike a train, with a self-driving car you CAN switch it to manual mode whenever necessary, so it's not a problem that it can only handle 50% or 90% or even 99% of the trip because you can always fill in the gaps of its capability in manual mode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There will always be errors. We can't even make an error proof operating system. Random bugs or memory events will always happen. Wireless communication with other cars doesn't seem practical. How would it be secure against outside attacks? You may say encryption but is every automaker going to use the same encryption. There will always be a fault in the chain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are <em>already</em> way less errors in many of these automated systems than in human operated systems. Even with errors included, automated systems are often safer than human operated systems. That gap will grow and grow over time. That doesn't mean they don't have errors. It just means that those errors can reliably be less frequent than the &quot;errors&quot; that humans make. Humans operate on heuristics so, they can make poor judgements which is compounded when they have to act quickly. Humans are also susceptible to things like optical illusions and have limited senses (e.g. EM spectrum and what materials you can see though, how far you can see). Additionally, humans have virtually no ability to communicate with other drivers fast enough to negotiate an outcome. It's a fitting metaphor that humans have a horn while computers have whatever they can send to each other by radio signals. This really changes how much computers can coordinate in emergency events to get a safe outcome. In the second before a crash a human could yell &quot;HEY!&quot; while a computer could send a thousand character message of its evasive maneuvers. The list goes on. But, humans have a lot of sources of fault on their own. Even their capacity for free will (i.e. their capacity to break the rules of the road, which makes them unpredictable to other drivers) counts against them.</p>
<p>Also, we know how to make extremely reliable systems, we often choose not to because of the trade off between reliability and other features. In cases where reliability is crucial, we can make substantially more reliable systems and systems with fail-safes. Look at areas where reliability is actually important (like NASA's 40+ year Voyager probes or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/" target="_blank">this server</a> that was taken down after 16 years) to see what we can achieve when we actually try in terms of reliability. And given that this isn't a PC that you're installing all sorts of software on, but a car or train automated driver that will stay pretty stable in what it has to do over its lifetime, it's a lot easier in this regard.</p></div>		</li>
