			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. </p>
<p>Also speed comes largely from two main areas once you know about thirty algorithms. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Finger tricks. You can learn how to do four face turns in a tenth of a second even as a complete beginner if you are shown where and how to push the cube. Practice allows speed on all transformations. </p>
</li>
<li>Looking ahead. Being able to know what to do next and where the appropriate pieces are is how someone largely gets from 45 seconds to 15. </li>
</ol>
<p>I can solve the cube in 46 seconds. And I don't use memorized algorithms for the first two thirds of the solve. Intuitive f2l is typical actually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you don't learn them online or from a book, doing the last layer by yourself will end up meaning that you figured out algorithms for it. Potentially suboptimal ones, but still. A friend of mine actually did that for many cube-like puzzles: he never looked up any solution and just tried to figure out how to do simple things without messing up the rest of the cube. In the end, what he learned by doing this is the same thing you learn online, only more satisfying because you find it yourself and usually less optimal because, well, he wasn't looking for optimality anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now it's getting into what &quot;intuition&quot; actually means here.</p>
<p>In this scope, knowing how to solve parts of the cube by intuition means not that there was nothing to memorize, but rather you understand how the steps work.  You can see the pieces move and why the algorithm works to the point that you can piece it back together by simply knowing what &quot;needs&quot; to happen.  E.g. a person that says they solve the bottom two layers &quot;intuitively&quot; still internally has short sets of turns (a.k.a. algorithms) committed to memory, but understands it to the point of being able to modify it on demand (such as performing the reflection of the algorithm on the opposite side, or adding in a step to deal with a different initial position of the pieces in question).</p>
<p>That said, there is a method to solve the cube that involves two algorithms only, by solving all of the edges, and then all of the corners.  One moves three edges and flips one, another moves three corners and rotates them.  By first transforming the cube so that the corners/edges you need to move are in the right spot, doing this algorithm, and then backtracking the original transformation, the entire cube can be solved.  Moreover, the algorithms are short and sweet (4 and 8 moves for the edge and corner algorithm respectively), and one could easily take note of the corners and see how the algorithm works.</p>
<p>If you understand how those two algorithms work, and understand how to manipulate the cube in order to leverage only those two algorithms, I would consider that being able to solve the cube intuitively.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can absolutely do it by just figuring it out. But it's crazy difficult. </p>
<p>To a dude who has done the cube enough.. the first two &quot;layers&quot; are just straight intuition. You know what the cube needs to look like and make it look like that. Then the last &quot;layer&quot; or slice or third of the cube is left. I've seen a very smart person figure out that last third but I bet it was straight luck. </p>
<p>Also I doubt anyone can solve even a 3x3 cube without already learning some type of method or trick. 4x4 gets harder, but larger generally just means more time. 3x3 is probably just as hard as 7x7, just takes more time. Even numbers  (6x6 or even 4x4 for example) are practically impossible unless you know a method. EDIT: this is because some weird shit happens with pairs in the middle (i think) EDIT2: Nah it's on the edges . Basically what happens is you get super close to 'solving' and then you find our these two neighborhood cubes are wrong and you're starting all over. Apparently it happens 50% of the time for even numbered cubes. I spent days trying to figure it out but (as you might be able to tell) I'm not smart enough.</p>
<p>Also I'm fucked up so I'm sorry for replying with all these words to your message.</p></div>		</li>
