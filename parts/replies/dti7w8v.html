			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a camera op as well, and what you said is definitely true. It’s much more comfortable and you get better results with a shoulder mounted camera than having a 1 pound rinky dink camcorder. </p>
<p>Though I do have to say, I’m glad when they got rid of those tape decks because a new 12lb digital media camera is way easier to cart around than that 28lb Betacam behemoth!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern high end photo/video cameras are extremely customizable and you can rig them to your needs. You could use a small camera handheld with in body stabilization for candid/stealthy shots and you blend in like a tourist or won't even be noticed. You might even get better interviews, because people don't get intimidated by a smaller camera. You could put it on a gimbal or shoulder mount, add a cage and then add a better grip, a light, a screen or better recorder with more in&amp;out-puts. You could even add a cine lens and a follow focus if you wanted to.</p>
<p>So, you don't necessarily have to get a bulky 'tv camera' or something like a canon c300 (which are fairly small too, well depending on the lens/rig) instead you could use a 'dslr' or smaller.</p>
<p>I think that's what OP means, that there are a lot of options compared to the typical bulky camera and they see a lot of use in documentaries, budget movies or things like youtube with very good results. But I guess tv stations don't really care and they'd rather buy those cameras in bulk regardless of the price/features, because then you can train people for that model and to get the job done, also they may be intentionally be that bulky to take more abuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overheating is a prevalent problem with DSLR and mirrorless cameras. The larger body means the designers get more room to allow for cooling.</p>
<p>I started out with mirrorless but now use prosumer camcorders (VG30 sony) because overheating is not a problem for medium sized camcorders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newton's second law fully encapsulates the first law but not the other way around. The first law doesn't mention mass at all so isn't really relevant when comparing the smoothness of different cameras.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point u/Difshu is making is that Newton's first law doesn't say anything about mass, so from the first law alone it's impossible to deduce that a heavier camera will be more stable, only that it requires an outside force to shake it but that's true regardless of the mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s closer to momentum and inertia, but all of Newton’s laws of motion are derived from the same basic principle. Come at the problem from 3 different angles and get to the same answer.</p></div>		</li>
