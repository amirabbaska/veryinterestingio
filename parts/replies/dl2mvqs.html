			<div class="markdown"><p>This also might make the US South in some ways more resilient to the health impact of climate change.  If weather changes such that there are significant  increases in heat waves, the South already has AC all over the place to protect people.  So people in northern states are at a greater risk for negative health outcomes from heat waves despite the generally cooler temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'll never forget my first year at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. At the time (not that long ago) most dorms didn't have AC (and this particular one still doesn't). Plus they hadn't been built for that kind of heat. That August was the hottest and most miserable I'd been in my entire life and I'm from near Atlanta. </p>
<p>Also heat waves in Illinois tend to kill people since a lot of people don't have AC. There was one in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Chicago_heat_wave" target="_blank">1995 that killed 739 people in Chicago</a>. They open special &quot;cooling centers&quot; here now, but a lot of older people are still in danger if they can't get to one.</p></div>		</li>
