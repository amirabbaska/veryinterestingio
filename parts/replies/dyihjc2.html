<p>This has happened. Am from Argentina, the inflation started with the 2001 crisis and never stopped. Meaning that there are young adults today that have never known what a stable price is like. Increases are a part of our lives now.</p></div>		</li>

The first people tends to do is buying USD, making the price even higher and because of culture reasons, a lot of everyday items rise the price even if they are not imported or USD related at all.

<p>Money now is worth less than 1800, and prices now are higher than 1800 - regardless of current interest rates. Why has the value of money (specifically USD) kept decreasing over the years? Why are there no years with <del>&quot;negative inflation&quot;</del> deflation?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One part of the answer is that deflation can be disastrous, so the central bank avoids it at all costs.  If the value of currency was likely to increase with time, people would delay spending, and the economy would wither.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, bunching your and another comment together... The government purposely prints more money to force inflation into existence (or stop printing to try to delay it, if natural inflation is over their target) so that the economy can at the very least remain stable?</p>
<p>Why then wouldn't target inflation be nearer 0%. If inflation devalues money (I'm sure there are some other detriments, but I'm an engineery person ) and deflation kills markets, then why wouldn't their target be nearer &quot;money today equals money years from now&quot;? Does the 2% encourage spending while introducing as little of those detriments as possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are examples, most notably Japan, of deflation in the modern world. Inflation and employment are somewhat tied together - there are no 'laws' in the sense that there are 'laws of physics' that are inviolable. </p>
<p>The term is usually an 'Effect' or a 'Curve' in relevance to some kind of mathematical derivation of economics. In the above example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve" target="_blank">Phillips Curve</a> describes the mathematical relationship between inflation and unemployment, given a set of pre-existing conditions (&quot;assumptions&quot;) and all other factors held constant. </p>
<p>In my undergrad education, we were taught that a low background level of inflation is a good compromise that allows unemployment to remain low. The Fed targets 2%, I believe. They can change the amount of money they print to achieve that target, as well as mess with other things (in the news today that's the federal interest rate, which affects all other loans in the market).</p>
<p>As far as why money always devalues, again see Japan - it doesn't - but it can affect the ability of the government to finance itself, through not just increasing the supply of money but also affecting its ability to borrow from its citizens and other governments. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think what /u/DavidFRZ meant is that the inflation influences the habits of consumers and businesses to the point where the high inflation rate is self-sustaining. High inflation is OK if it's related to a growing economy and high employment, because those things are good and outweigh negative effects of high inflation (devaluation of pensions for example) but not if it's just there because it's been there for years.</p>
<p>Yes, the historic devaluation of money is there to stay because deflation is to be avoided and hence very rare. But persistently high rates of inflation are not a given.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a combination of things. Deregulation, lowering tax rates, and lowering of interest rates.  If any one is going to get the most credit I would chose deregulation. This allowed banks to take on riskier loans and corporations finacing through junk bonds. This sudden injection of capital with lower interest rates and lower tax implication caused the economy to become red hot. It also eventually led to other issues.</p></div>		</li>

That being said, a lot of money was freed up, allowing it to be invested into the overall economy (especially in the lowering of tariffs, which are almost universally terrible).</p></div>		</li>
