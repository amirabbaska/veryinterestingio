			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, do you think  there is a way to condition your brain to not be bothered by something that is not necessarily a real danger, for instance I have OCD tendencies and high humidity really interferes with my day where I will almost avoid doing what needs to be done.  Maybe Too much info lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is, but it might not help you specifically- your body gets used to the stimulus if it remains constant.</p>
<p>Basically, if you just put up with it and don't think about it, you get used to it and it stops bothering you.</p>
<p>If you have OCD tendancies, it could prevent you from not thinking about it, so you can't let yourself get used to the sensation and acclimate to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the <em>stickiness</em>, due to dirt-encrusted sweat or some viscous substance, was widespread, it would also interfere with our ability to control our body temperature, through the evaporation of perspiration, and our brains would let us know that was a less-then-optimum condition that needed to be rectified.</p></div>		</li>
