<p>If you eat, say, a steak, your body won't use most of it for energy or fat storage, and it won't waste it. It will largely use it to repair broken cells, make new cells, and so on. As most cells consist of protein and fat in about the same ratio as found in steak, this is the most efficient use of those nutrients, so it's what the body does. It's different if, for example, you drink a can of cola. There's nothing much in there that can be used to maintain the body, and so it will all be used as energy or stored as fat for later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often wondered this very same thing during holidays.  Can the human body only process X amount of calories in one go? Like, if I go back for that fourth helping of stuffing and mashed potatoes, will I end up with less calories processed in that fourth helping than I did on my first?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the bound and the diminishing returns are both high and slow enough that it shouldn't affect your decisions.</p>
<p>As we can see from endurance athletes, it's very possible to take in close to 10,000 kCal per diem on a regular basis; this would translate to more than two pounds of weight gain <em>per day</em> for a sedentary individual at or below 2000 kCal maintenance.</p>
<p>A number of the very calorically dense nutrients are enzymatically limited, to be sure; you can find stories (even videos; thanks, Internet) of people drinking entire liters (1000ml ~= 8500 fat kCal) of olive oil. Lipases don't keep up with this and the experimenters are made eminently aware of this fact once elimination comes around.</p>
<p>Actually, in general, elimination gives you a pretty reasonable picture of how dysfunctional your absorption is. </p>
<p>But in the end, the fourth helping still &quot;counts.&quot; It's OK to gain weight some days, though, so don't necessarily let that stop you; just don't gain weight <em>most</em> days and you're fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some can be wasted, well at least some newer research is showing this to be the case. It's also got a genetic component to it, so will be different depending on the person and how much their bod has been effected by glucose. Carbohydrates for instance, create glucose in the blood stream which causes insulin spikes to compensate. Unused energy there can turn to fats. Where Proteins tend to have excess excreted. </p></div>		</li>
