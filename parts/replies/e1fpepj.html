			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.  I'm a teacher.  I had the option of joining the union at $N, or not joining the union...and still having $0.8N removed from my paychecks.</p>
<p>Joining the union included a few broader perks, a sick leave bank system, and legal representation should it be necessary - basically, insurance.  Member or not, you get the same pay and contract from the school system.</p>
<p>So while <em>joining</em> is technically voluntary, 80% of the dues are mandatory, anyway.</p>
<p>Given that the union is politically active, I don't think it's right that they can require 80% of the dues from <em>all</em> [teacher] employees.  That I happen to agree with 90+% of their political stances is immaterial.  On the other hand, I recognize that the collective bargaining benefits apply universally.  The simple answer, as I see it, is that the union shouldn't be political, but good luck getting them to agree to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, I <em>chose</em> to pay full dues, rather than being forced to pay the agency fee.  My objection is on principle.</p>
<p><em>In theory</em>, dues vs agency fees addresses much of the problem.</p>
<p><em>In practice</em>, the distinction is ridiculous.</p>
<p>The union leadership are the same people, whether they're conducting bargaining or political action.  Their selection depends on their stances on <em>both</em> of those (and other) factors.  Those leaders' political action and stances therefore have an impact on the collective bargaining that's supposedly independent from the partisan side, and employees only paying agency fees have no say in their selection.  If the union maintained two <em>wholly separate</em> staffs, one unit <em>strictly</em> for collective bargaining and another for all political action and member-specific benefits, that would be another story.</p>
<p>Or brass tacks, albeit without hard data: from what funds come the money covering benefits to members which aren't extended to non-members, e.g., sick bank management (and related bargaining) and representation?  All of that, <em>plus</em> political action, is in the 20%?  I find that difficult to swallow.  How about keeping the lights on in the building?  Ink for the printers?  Custodial staff?  Only 20% of <em>time</em> is spent on the combination of political action and benefits afforded only to members?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really don’t understand your reasoning. The in-house council alone is worth the price of a union. Especially as a teacher in a time where teachers and districts are getting sued, or being threatened with lawsuit, more and more. You’re upset because unions are political, but under Citizens United, companies are people and can back politicians, so if you worked for a company that didn’t have a union, the company could pack a politician that you don’t like and be representing you as an employee without your consent either. The difference is, that with a union, you garner benefits that benefit you now, and have a better chance of holding onto those benefits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My reasoning is a matter of principle.</p>
<p><em>I</em> think the benefits of the union are worth the cost - the full cost, not just the agency fee - and <em>I</em> support the vast majority of political action my union chooses to take.</p>
<p>However, I do not believe it's reasonable to require as a condition of employment that public sector workers pay into a <del>political</del> partisan organization.</p>
<p>As I discussed <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/8uj4qw/eli5_why_cant_unions_just_stop_bargaining_on/e1ft7fb/" target="_blank">here</a>, I'd be happy with things moving in <em>either</em> direction.  Either continue to collect from non-members, but suspend political action; or collect only voluntarily, and continue political action.  Both have drawbacks, but you can't have your cake and eat it, too.</p>
<p>As I further discussed down that chain, I'd be fine with the union putting out <em>strictly factual</em> documents regarding each candidate's professed stance on unions and school funding.  &quot;Teacher say, 'Vote for Candidate B!',&quot; from an organization public employees are <em>required</em> to pay into, is what crosses the line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When someone complains about unions being political, it's not this. Many unions wind up taking sides on divisive social issues. The opinion is that being forced to pay dues is fine, but why should the union be allowed to use those dues to lobby for issues like abortion, immigration, Israel, etc. There's no way that 100% of the union agrees on this, so it's now working against the political interests of someone with their own money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAL.  I would suggest, however, that there's a difference between bargaining over a specific work contract with current public officials and <em>heavily</em> publicizing endorsements for specific candidates.  Which the union does, for every office from Governor and Congress down to County Council and School Board.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope so, but I have some serious doubts. Given the option people would obviously rather not pay and receive the benefits. People are extremely shortsighted and would happily keep their money now. I've been in a union since I started working and it's going to be very interesting to see how it plays out. Anytime something becomes optional enrollment will suffer and once participation hits below 50% no more union </p></div>		</li>

<p>This was not the case in my wife's state agency.  She said a lot of employees didn't like being forced to pay union dues and don't like working with bad employees who couldn't be fired because they were union-protected.  She's relieved that they won't be able to reach into her paycheck against her will anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the case at my union job too. A ton of useless employees that made our jobs so much harder, couldn't get fired. And our pay never changed once the union got there anyway. We actually made less, because they were taking some of it. </p></div>		</li>
