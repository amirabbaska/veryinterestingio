<p>I worked in convenience store deliveries and one 7-11 owner with an Audi S8 told me that this is exactly why so many small C-stores in the area were owned by people from the middle east. Once one gets established, they have the collateral to back a second. From there it snowballs until they don't even use banks to finance any more, they just all contribute a little bit but together it's more than enough to get buildings, franchise rights, distribution deals, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most of why lower income whites and blacks are having problems is that they have no access to capital and live in a capitalist country.  Low interest rates don't mean anything if you don't have anything the bank wants to secure a loan.  </p>
<p>Out of the house at 18 and no network to help you.  Military, trade school or three part time jobs because job creators don't pay full time for high school grads anymore.  </p>

<p>Doesn't even need to be intentional. It's exactly the kind of job where you can hire someone to work for you, then they can figure out how to run their own small nail shop after they work there for a couple of years and want to make more than you are paying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I befriended a local Bodega owner and had this discussion with him. He said that back when he lived in Pakistan, he had a few friends who saved ~20,000 u.s. dollars then came to America and bought a Bodega or gas station. He said it was a much talked about dream out there. Better lives for their wives, and better education for their kids. So he did the same. I think once the precedent has been set among whatever ethnic community, it seems far more accessible to others of that community. Now his wife runs one up the road and their kids have a great home and cars. Pretty awesome. </p></div>		</li>
