			<div class="markdown"><p>Columbia broke up at 12,500 mph in atmosphere, exposing that paper to 12,500 mph winds.  Essentially Columbia punched through the thin upper atmosphere that would have decelerated the paper well below that speed.  And still the paper survived.  I'd say that makes the case even better for a feather de-orbiting from ISS altitude surviving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but 20km high is roughly where the atmosphere starts getting noticeable.  Pretty much anything will survive from LEO down to about 20 km.  Question is will it make it into the thick lower atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Weird then that Columbia broke up at ~60km when it lost control and rolled. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The height doesn't matter a whole lot in this question. What matters when coming back from orbit is <em>speed</em>. In orbit just before the de-orbit burn Columbia was moving at 7.8 km/s. Just before the breakup, they were traveling at 6.6 km/s. They still had 85% of their orbital energy when the breakup happened, so in terms of a test of this theory, it's at <em>least</em> 85% accurate.</p>
<p>I'd say that paper's survival odds coming from higher in the atmosphere are drastically improved over paper being released at 20 km at 6.6 km/s. That's 80-260 km of very thin atmosphere that could more gently slow the paper down compared to the &quot;slamming into the atmosphere after the orbiter suddenly lets it loose&quot;.</p>
<p>That whole paragraph felt very morbid to write.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Columbia dissipated much of the re-entry energy long before it broke up and the paper got exposed.  If you wrapped the feather in thermal tiles, it would survive too.</p></div>		</li>
