			<div class="markdown"><p>Same price range, read above. There are also unaged (clear e.g vodka, same price range) that are smooth and some that are harsh. Assume we're just talking about 80 proof/40% ABV. Which chemicals or parts of the distilling process are responsible for covering-up (for lack of a better word) the harshness of the alcohol? To reiterate: it still is 80 proof when it goes into the bottle, all are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aging is definitely a part of it.  Some of the 'harsh' flavors are removed via this process, (and un-harsh flavors added) and age doesn't directly correlate with price.  For example, Elijah Craig until last year or so had a $30, 12-year bottle, where a lot of bourbons at $30 are only aged for 3-4 years.  So within a given price range, you would see a significant variation in bourbon smoothness, some of which would be due to aging. </p>
<p>As u/knockoutcpfreshsmart said, a lot is down to the distillation. </p>
<p>There is also generally a filtration process that removes other organic compounds that lead to an off-putting or harsh taste/feel.  You can test this yourself with the college student's favorite project, filtering bad vokda through a brita filter to make semi-decent vodka.  The activated charcoal pulls out some organic compounds (I don't know which exactly, but this is how activated charcoal works on all liquids), thus improving the flavor and &quot;smoothness&quot;. </p>
<p>You also have the huge factor of personal taste / experience.  As someone who has made a point of drinking neat whiskey for years, it takes some pretty powerful stuff for me to think something is &quot;harsh&quot;.    Over time, you supposedly kill off the nerve endings that perceive &quot;alcohol harshness&quot; in your mouth / throat in the same way that spice fans kill off the nerve endings that detect capsaicin. </p>
<p>So, to sum up, as far as I know, harshness is a subjective factor that's influenced by: </p>
<ol>
<li>Presence of undesirable alcohols and fusel oils</li>
<li>Presence (or lack thereof) of desirable flavor compounds </li>
<li>Overall ABV</li>
<li>Individual variations among the drinkers themselves</li>
<li>Presence (or lack thereof) of undesirable flavor compounds</li>
