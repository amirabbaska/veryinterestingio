			<div class="markdown"><p>Then there is the second step: BCVS gets bigger and gets complacentâ€”it has little competition, so it puts little effort into developing new services or new products or into otherwise innovating. Somebody realizes a lot of people would like new feature X or that function Y can be provided, so they start another new service. But their service does not have free streaming, so not as many people sign up for it.</p>
<p>The result is that your Internet provider is also in charge of your video service and your news media and everything else you access on the Internet. Alternatives dwindle.</p>
<p>With an open Internet, web sites and various providers can generate revenue in proportion to their audience. Are there people who like modern westerns? You can sell to them. Are there people who want evidence-based journalism? You can sell to them. Even businesses in niche markets can survive. With a walled Internet, small businesses get <strong>less</strong> money than their proportion of customers. It gets harder for minorities to come together; it decreases diversity, variation, experimentation, innovation, and progress.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now, let's have BigCorp ISP give everyone FREE internet - especially for the poor who cannot afford Internet. Wait... only approved sites and services are free - if you go elsewhere, please provide credit card.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who don't know, this is a real thing that Mark Zuckerberg has been doing in less developed countries. It's a partnered initiative called Internet.org/Free Basics by Facebook, which grants free access to a specifically chosen selection of sites to anyone who can get the signal and offers paid plans for full Internet access. It sounds great on paper (free access to Wikipedia and other general sources of knowledge in places that wouldn't otherwise get any Internet connectivity for potentially decades.) But India banned it for violating net neutrality, and it's clear why. When you teach hundreds of millions of people that the internet is Facebook, Wikipedia, ESPN, etc, you can start shaping the views of a large part of humanity. How can Indian weather services compete with the one foreign weather service that anyone can get freely? If Facebook's news feed favours a certain Indian political candidate and a large part of the population uses Facebook because the alternatives are expensive, Facebook can start influencing their elections.</p>
<p>The Indian government understands what a unique and precarious situation this is, and that Internet.org has selfish and selfless reasosn for wanting to provide non-neutral internet service to their people. It's a really interesting issue that could determine a lot about India in the next 100 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation. One thing I would add to &quot;dumb it down&quot; even more, is imagine Walmart owns access to all the streets in your town. You can go to Target if you want, but all of the roads leading to Target require a toll, whereas the roads leading to Walmart are free.</p></div>		</li>
