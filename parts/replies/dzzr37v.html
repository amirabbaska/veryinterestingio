			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, i have to ask. How do we measure the amount of any/all particles in the universe? Is it just a calculation derived from the known density of the universe? And if that's right, how do we measure the density of the universe?</p>
<p>I have no education in astronomy, i just love everything about it and have read a lot of pop-science books so please be gentle if there's math involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the error is too <em>small</em> to be a statistical fluke. Huh. Are there any theories about what it could be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes... it very likely means that we started with almost equal amount of matter (baryon) and anti-matter, and that any process taking place <em>almost</em> preserves this symmetry.  If you start with &quot;pure energy&quot;, it is natural to end up with almost as much matter and anti-matter. Having segregation one from another (statistical fluctuations) giving rise to large differences would be difficult to explain.</p></div>		</li>
