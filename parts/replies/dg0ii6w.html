			<div class="markdown"><p>as i said i worked as supermarket employee many years ago and we were specifically told at training it's ok and we can't bother customers, unless they pass through cashiers without paying, only then they would break a law</p>
<p>personally i was not aware of this before since it was not that common 20 years ago in my country, so they had to instruct old schools not to jump at customers</p></div>		</li>
