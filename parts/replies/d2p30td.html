			<div class="markdown"><p>Wolves naturally have carrion as part of their diet, so their immune systems are more robust when dealing with gut infections. Which is why you can see dogs eating poop and only throwing up a little bit. Poop smells especially bad for humans because we aren't as good at not dying from worms or dysentery. We react strongly to poop smell because it encourages us to not shit where we eat.</p></div>		</li>

And in fact, smelling butts (and having a head close to poop on the ground) is probably a big part of the reason why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A marked difference between the noses of primates and other mammals is that in nearly all nonprimate mammals, the nasal cavities contain at the front a much-convoluted filtering apparatus (formed by the ethmo- and maxillo-turbinals) covered with respiratory membrane. This filtering apparatus is a biological air conditioner (Negus 1958) with three key functions: cleaning, warming, and humidifying the inspired air. An important function of the filtering apparatus is presumably to protect the nasal cavity from infections. In many mammals, air drawn into the nose is often highly contaminated with bacteria from fecal material, decaying animal and plant material, and noxious fumes from the environment, all of which attack the olfactory epithelium. Rodents are susceptible to chronic rhinitis, which causes substantial loss of functioning olfactory receptor cells (Hinds et al. 1984).</p>
<p>This filtering, however, might have negative consequences for odor detection. Warming and humidification presumably enhance the odor-stimulating capacity of the inhaled air, but cleaning would remove odor molecules by absorbing them into the lining of the epithelium, an effect which could be large depending on the size of the filtering apparatus. If so, mammals with large snouts might have a large inventory of olfactory receptors at least in part to offset the loss of odor molecules absorbed by the filtering apparatus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparing the data on smell detection thresholds shows that humans not only perform as well or better than other primates, they also perform as well or better than other mammals. When tested for thresholds to the odors of a series of straight-chain (aliphatic) aldehydes, dogs do better on the short chain compounds, but humans perform as well or slightly better than dogs on the longer chain compounds, and humans perform significantly better than rats (Laska et al. 2000). Similar results have been obtained with other types of odors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TL; DR; ELI5: Dogs have wet noses to filter out germs from poop, as well as a lot of the smell of poop and everything else, so they need a lot more nose to get to smell as well as we do. They are better at smelling some things which are good at getting by their wet noses, but worse at smelling stuff that sticks to their wet nose.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine human smell as like looking through frosted glass.  We can identify contrasting colours and general shapes.  Dogs would see all the details.  Not magnification, less blurry.</p></div>		</li>
