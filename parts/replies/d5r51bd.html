			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's different but after reading the article above a bit, a closer example that still applies to us seems to be one where you for example would be asked to only activate one of the muscles when swallowing. Swallowing actually involves around twenty muscles which also have to work in sync and there's apparently a CPG involved here too, this time located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulla_oblongata" target="_blank">medulla</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distributed control is kind of the norm for neuron networks. We have ganglions in our spine that handle motions and reactions such as blinking when something approaches your eyes. Our guts more or less have an entire mini-brain worth of neurons coordinating all sorts of things so our main brain doesn't need to get involved.</p>
<p>The problem with the brain controlling everything is that routing information to the brain, making a &quot;decision&quot;, and routing a response back to the location of action takes a lot of time. Better to offload that kind of coordination to a circuit that is closer to the action.</p>
<p>Something like the patterning of moving a centipede leg up and down doesn't really need any decision making during the process so the action of actually moving of the leg can be coordinated by a more local circuit. While the decision making about when and where to move stays in the main brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two. There's plenty of evidence for their existence in rat hindlimbs, for example. There's likely a CPG or CPG-like mechanism at play for our own walking. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here a fun fact: the octopus can't really know what its arms are doing at most times unless it directly observes them. It just send the general &quot;I wanna grab that thing&quot; command and its arm works out a large part of the action itself. Which also explains why their actions don't seem too precise. Near the tip of their arms.  It almost looks like direct arm control detoriates further down the arm length. They seem to have pretty precise controls over parts that are closer to the body and it becomes more erratic the further down the signal travels and the arm's own nervous system seems to take over. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Scholarpedia in general is pretty cool. It's a peer reviewed wiki for science.</p>
<p>If you are interested in implementing a distributed, neuro-inspired walking controller, I suggest looking at walknet.</p></div>		</li>
