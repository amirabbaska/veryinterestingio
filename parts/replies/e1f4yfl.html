			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. So there is a huge myth about dopamine that even academics get it wrong: dopamine does NOT bring you the feeling of euphoria/pleasure. Euphoria is delivered mainly by opioid or cannabinoid.
Your brain uses dopamine to convey to neurons how much you “want” certain event to happen. It’s a neurotransmitter for motivation. Drugs tend to hijack both the mesolimbic dopamine system and activate opioid or cannabinoid receptors, allowing dopamine release to co-occur with feeling of euphoria although this temporal correlation does not imply causality. This correlation breaks down when addiction becomes severe enough that the addicts no longer feel euphoric but still have tremendous motivation to seek out drugs. This is because although these pleasure receptors eventually downregulate after repeated exposure, the large amount of dopamine release during drug intake tricks the brain to mark this activity with high motivation score and remove relevant mental barriers in order to succeed in this activity.</p>
<p>Edit: im only referring to dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right for drugs like opiates and cannabis, but you’re being a bit misleading leaving out amphetamines and some other stimulants which simply prevent the reuptake ad/or dump norepinephrine and dopamine all over the place, including the substantia nigra.  The euphoria from meth has almost nothing to do with the Mu opiate euphoria pathway... you could argue it just skips it though and it’s still  hijacking that pathway.... but then why refer to it at all?   I’m also not sure what you’re referring to about academics getting it wrong... you mean academics in areas that aren’t neuroscience?   Also I’m curious why you agree with the fact that there is a common misconception but then group dopamine as the neurotransmitter that governs “want” when this is again a huge generalization and only refers to the role dopamine plays in the reward pathway.  It plays other roles in other parts of the nervous system that have nothing to do with the mesolimbic pathway at all.  But back to my first point , an example of NT playing tons of different rolls, Amphetamine induced psychosis is thought to be the closest we’ve ever gotten reproducing schizophrenia symptoms.  All that dopamine and norepinephrine releases globally.  Jitters, tremors, hallucinations (lack of sleep helps this) and paranoia.  I’m a Neuro major undergrad, PhD student in biology specializing in pharmacology of venoms if you want to know why I claim to know all this stuff but our understanding does change rapidly when in comes to neuroscience.  I’m not trying to say you don’t make some really good points, just that I think you either explained it in a way that sounds different than you intended or you still have a few misconceptions... or maybe you know something I don’t.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, you’re misunderstanding. Look into hedonic hotspots and the demarcation between wanting (incentive salience) and liking (pleasure). The dopamine, even in the case of meth, doesn’t mediate euphoria. He even stated it’s the coordinate production of other transmitters (ie endogenous opioids, cannabinoids, orexin) impinging on their receptors to cause pleasure, not dopamine. In that instance, the dopamine is more-so playing the role of prediction (reward prediction error signaling) and reinforcement. There have been several hedonic hotspots identified, many of which are also within the mesolimbic reward pathway (nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum), but many are not (parabrachial nucleus, insula, orbitofrontal cortex). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the input. Sorry I was mainly referring to the dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway. You probably know that early literature all suggested that dopamine is the “pleasure” NT based on flawed assumptions from animal self-stimulation experiments. I’ve been to talks where Ivy League professors specialized in addiction still introduce dopamine that way. I didn’t mean all academics if that wasn’t clear. Regarding your point about substantia nigra, can you say dopamine release in that area causes euphoria or just associates with euphoria? I don’t believe there is conclusive evidence that euphoria directly comes from SN dopamine release and not some downstream euphoria pathways (e.g. opioid) activated by SN dopamine. Meth can certainly activate these downstream pathways as well. Most addiction research was conducted in animals. It is difficult for us to infer euphoria, a subjective experience, from animals who can’t communicate (or maybe there is monkey research that Im not aware of?). Yet we can quantitatively measure motivation based on how hard the animal is willing to work for reward. Even if you are allowed to directly manipulate SN dopamine in human, it is difficult to draw causality because you would need to block all downstream non-dopaminergic pathways to remove confounds. My main point is that although we can eventually figure out all the biological pathways involved in reward, it is incredibly difficult to draw causality between biological pathways and a subjective experience in an ethical manner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I find reward too abstract and ambiguous. I know some people interpret it as pleasure which is inaccurate. Abstract terms are good when you refer to the whole system, like reward pathway. But in research it’s much better to make claims about something you can objectively measure, like motivation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't dopamine signalling in the shell of the nucleus accumbens cause opioid signalling there and consequently causes feelings of satisfaction? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting.  Do anti psychotics acting as dopamine antagonists target specific areas of the brain?  I assumed they had a system wide effect and induce some level of dysphoria or depression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re dead on with typical anti dopaminergic antipsychotics.  We are really, really bad at directing targeting of drug delivery, but it’s a huge area of research and we are getting better.  One of the main areas of my research is figuring out why a certain toxin in cobra venom binds universally to all acetylcholine receptors of a certain type, while a very similar protein from another snake only causes paralysis in lizards and birds... not mammals.  Understanding things like this might help us design drugs that flip one switch as opposed to the whole breaker if you want to stick to my not very accurate wiring analogy.  With pharmacology we have only been trying to work backwards from the receptor to desired effect for a very short time... and we still usually approach problems by finding something that seems to work first and figuring out why after.</p></div>		</li>
