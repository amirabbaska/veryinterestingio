			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the type of storage. All data is stored as &quot;bits&quot; - binary digits, which can only be &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; (1 or 0). </p>
<p>&quot;Spinning rust&quot; disks use magnetism. The state of each bit is represented by the magnetic polarisation of a physical region of magnetic material coated on the disk.</p>
<p>Flash drives SSD &quot;disks&quot; and USB memory sticks use a kind of static charge. Each bit is stored as an electrical charge in a very stable electrical circuit, which decays <em>very slowly</em>. A charge above a threshold level is a &quot;1&quot;, and below it, a &quot;0&quot;.</p>
<p>CD drives use altered optical properties. Read-only, pressed CDs containing music or software from a large manufacturer use &quot;pits&quot; etched into a shiny substrate to represent the 0s and 1s, at the time of manufacture. Writable CDs use a laser to literally burn the pits into a different, but optically similar substrate. REwritable CDs use a substrate that can have its state reversed a small number of times.</p></div>		</li>
