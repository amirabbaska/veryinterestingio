<p>The external kidney, the adrenal gland, produces adrenaline. Adrenaline acts to stim blood flow away from non-essential parts of your body to your lungs and heart so you can do things faster (important to note NOT LONGER). It primarily pulls it away from the gastro-intestinal region, the extremities, etc. </p>

<p>Well this is interesting. I wonder what affect such a process would have on someone with gastro-intestinal issues (ex: Colitis or Crohn's). Or, I wonder how much an adrenal reaction could contribute to Colitis or Crohn's in some people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so this says to me that when anxious, your body is a heightened sense in some areas which could actually help prolong your anxiety, instead of actually helping it? So that to me says again, that the only way to avoid this sort of thing is to focus on the mind first so that the body doesnt have to be confused with it's own physical reality? If that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way I can put it is that it seems anxiety (caused by society and the way of the world) is foreign to our bodies in that the way it tricks our bodies into thinking something is happening when it's really not. Wanting to live a natural lifestyle (assuming this is what an emotionally successful person would do), wouldn't you spend hours upon hours working on your own mind and thinking about things, and less time on reactionary measure to anxiety like fitness, or eating? I don't know, this whole post has made me think about how often what we seem to do with anxiety and treatments is a whole lot of bandaids on broken arms...</p></div>		</li>
