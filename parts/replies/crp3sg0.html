<p>It would cause the exchange rate to rise, making the purchasing power of the yuan larger, meaning peoples wages would be able to purchase more.</p>

<p>I struggle with this sometimes. So their <em>international</em> buying power increases, but the local loop stays the same. A goat isn't any cheaper than yesterday, until the farmer buys feed over the border, or the feed they buy is shipped cheaper because of oil imports or something. Buying power stays the same until the cheaper international goods work their way down businesses to local consumers?</p>
<p>Is that the idea?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes. For actual goods, when your currency becomes worth more (other goods in the world become cheaper for you to purchase relative before the increase in purchasing power). Say that the dollar appreciates to the Euro, imports are now cheaper (you start to buy wine from france that is now cheaper). The wine may still be 4 euro, but since you are converting from dollars you are paying less than when the exchange rate was lower. Intermediate macro economics classes teach us that this increase in imports will then in turn lower the price of domestic goods and increase consumption of the now cheaper domestic goods.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As long as the demand is fairly elastic, right? Like if the price for wine goes down then I'll buy more? On the other hand if demand is fairly inelastic, such that I'll buy one bottle of wine regardless of how cheap they get, cheaper imports would result in less domestic wine being bought since people would get their one bottle from imports instead. In that case decreases in domestic wine prices would only reflect the decrease in demand without implying an increase in sales.</p>
<p>Of course, if you assume that consumer spending would remain the same then it's going to be spent on something else, even if it doesn't increase the consumption of certain goods that have an inelastic demand. So maybe I don't buy more wine, but I buy some cheese to go with it using the extra money I would have spent on the more-expensive wine previously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of prices like heat. They want to spread out until they're the same everywhere. This happens by arbitrage: People buy low and sell high until everything's worked out. In one currency zone, this is straightforward.</p>
<p>If there's a difference in prices (in cars) between two currency zones ($ and 元, say), however, now the people arbitraging have to make two transactions. First, they buy cheap cars for $ in America. Then they travel to China and sell the cars expensively in 元. They travel back to America, where they have to sell their 元  for $. Then they can buy cars with $ and continue the cycle. These transactions in the currency market change the exchange rate (increased demand for $, increased supply of 元) even as the transactions in the car market change the $-prices in America and the 元 -prices in China.</p>
<p>So the exchange rate helps to even out price differences. It's like a thermal paste; it helps conduct price changes from one currency zone to another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you are playing monopoly that has two currencies. One turn around the board gets you $200, and your friend gets 50 squiggle bucks (~50). So a squiggle is worth $4 and they can be traded equally and buy the same things after doing the same amount of work. A $100 house would cost ~25, and both of you can buy two after a turn around the board.</p>
<p>Well our banker is a jerk, and he says that oh, you can actually buy a squiggle buck for $2. So if you make $200 on your turn, you can buy ~50 for only $100 and get your two houses and still have half your money leftover, but your friend still has to use his entire turn of money for two houses. You have no reason to buy houses in dollars anymore, because buying them in squiggles (and paying $10 to ship them around the board to you) is still way cheaper than buying them locally.</p>
<p>This is artificial inflation. A squiggle is not worth only two dollars, it is worth four if you compare what the two can buy. But because the person in charge of the money is changing prices around, the currencies are not equal to people making different currencies. You can call the banker out on his shenanigans and have him fix the exchange rate, but that will cause you to not be able to buy things as cheaply, and the squiggle buck banker won't be getting as much of your money because you no longer have a reason to convert your money to squiggles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the absolute best explanation thank you so much.  I still have a question though, so why would China want to continue doing this?  Forget worldwide ramifications how does this affect china specifically? It makes sense to do this to in a way build up a market, but why would you continue to do this after you have established a strong market?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the effect of China keeping their exchange rate artificially low is very beneficial to the rest of the world, and to the companies producing exports in China. However their population suffers as the artificially low wage, coupled with no savings or access to credit, means the people suffer as a result. Declaring China as a currency manipulator would result in large tariffs, and restrictions to imports until they correct the peg to a more suitable standard. </p>
<p>However this a trigger you can only pull once and would have world wide repercussions. It could potentially hurt the people of china more than help. One of the largest benefits of companies like GE moving production to places like China is that they not only bring infrastructure, but access to credit as well. Labeling them officially as a currency manipulator could halt all of this (I'm not saying it would, but it is certainly a possibility)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an artificially low wage <em>internationally</em> but still a better wage domestically than what they'd get normally -- which is why so many people have migrated from villages to do factory  work and then support entire families on it. </p>
<p>If China's manufacturing moved elsewhere (like the current trend to Bangladesh) the poor would suffer more because although their money would be worth more there would be less jobs available for them to earn it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, if only half the people in china profit from this, the other half are still backwards farmers. </p>
<p>What they try to do is, move as much manufacturing over to China, and THEN let the currency move up in value slowly (what they are starting to do now).</p>
<p>For example 50% of the world's TV's are made in China. If you stop manipulating too soon, it will kill the momentum, and as a country you might not have enough time to adjust your population from low level workers to higher level workers, and you still have too many peasants that now cannot get cheap paying low level jobs in factories because the currency is too expensive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>China manufactures a lot of the goods we use today. When a country manufactures goods, they make profits. These profits cause the value of that country's currency to rise. If China's currency rises in value, then everyone outsourcing there will start paying more. If their currency rises enough in value, corporations will stop outsourcing and China will lose jobs. China doesn't want to lose jobs, so they print more of their currency to cause inflation, bringing the value of their money back down.</p></div>		</li>
