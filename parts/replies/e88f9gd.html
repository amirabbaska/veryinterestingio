			<div class="markdown"><p>I do think whatever population of wolves gave rise to wolves is extinct, but I would be surprised if they were differentiated enough from other wolf populations that they would have not been considered a subspecies of Canis lupus. The latest genetic estimates of the TMRCA between extant wolves and dogs is around 35-45 kya whereas dogs probably didn't become domesticated until more recently (20 kya or even a bit later). The Himalayan wolf is even more differentiated than that, but I try not to take sides when it comes to taxonomic debates.</p>
<p>I did cross paths with Dan while I was a postdoc getting started on the village dog project. He gave me some great advice but I never worked with him on his coyote project.</p>
<p>I don't think a lack of coursework is going to be a huge issue, especially if you have other coursework showing you're not &quot;math-phobic&quot;. You do need a good GPA overall, but PhD programs really want to know about your passion for research and your research experience. Admissions committee worry that someone who excels at science coursework without research experience might burn out when the coursework is done and the grind of lab work (or fieldwork) begins.</p></div>		</li>
