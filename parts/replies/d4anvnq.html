			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the issue that major sites like Facebook and Youtube, and even smaller sites by way of providers like Cloudfront and Akamai, <strong>already pay extra to the major ISPs</strong> through colocating servers in the ISPs' facilities to transmit content.</p>
<p>Most of this seemed to be an attempt by the cable companies to screw over YouTube and Netflix.  They want you paying $150/mo for a bunch of bundled cable channels you don't want, not picking-and-choosing only the content you do want for only $100/mo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's even another point that hasn't been made, at least as far as I've read: the big ISPs are also cable service providers, and therefore have a <strong>massive conflict of interest</strong>. Comcast hates Netflix because the service they offer is competitive with Comcast's own media services. And so by allowing them to prioritize traffic based on where it's going to and coming from, you let Comcast (and Time-Warner) completely choke Netflix out of business, by throttling their traffic to the point where it's unusable. </p>
<p>How can you know that this is a likely outcome? Because Netflix has tried to make offers to colocate servers with the ISPs (which would reduce the load on the ISPs' networks), even offering to pay the full cost of setting it up - and been completely rebuffed. </p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>Exactly. Fucking you over by charging you tiered data rates for your cell phone isn't enough. These greedy bastards want to do the same shit with your internet connection at home.</strong></p></div>		</li>

<p>The difference is, this is good for everybody. It means the traffic is closer to the end consumer, the ISP doesn't have to pay for that bandwidth to go through another ISP first, and the service pays less for their internet bill by already having their content on the ISP's network.</p>
<p>ISPs generally want to get Google, Netflix, etc. caching servers and the people offering the services are generally happy to provide them. Both save money and both get to offer a better service. I don't see this at all being equivalent to arbitrarily charging more for some services just to not de-prioritize them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The consumer will end up paying all of it. You pay for diwnload speed then netflix raises its prices and you pay again. They do this while they abuse 100 year old laws that make it hard for competitors like google fiber.</p>
<p>All those bullshit laws about banning public private cooperation for internet? They give campaign contributions to state legislators and run misleading adds. There are ridiculous regilations in place that make it near impossible for competitors to buils networks. There are detailed descriptions online.</p>
<p>So they want to play you are oppressing us with socialist policies then they protect socialist policies to block competition.</p>
<p>Here is the dirty secret. They still have massive amounts of unused and unlit fiber in the ground from the 1990s. They so overbuilt back then they have not used it all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also! The ISPs claimed common carrier status (common carrier meaning subject to neutrality) when it benefitted them financially (Verizon in NJ did this for tax breaks to improve its FIOS network). And then once it was financially advantageous for them to not be a CC they claimed they weren't a common carrier. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Can't say I'm surprised. Verizon already rapes us all with the expensive data plans.. all they wanna do is come up with more ways to financially rape us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly what Comcast was doing to Netflix.  Comcast was holding their own customers hostage from Netflix with artifical speed caps to the Netflix domain.  The caps would remain in place unless Netflix payed a hefty fee for Comcast to give Netflix access to their customers.  This practice would have increased with ISP's holding their own customers hostage from various popular domains unless the ransom was paid.  Once Netflix paid, Google could have been the next, then Facebook, Amazon, etc.</p>
<p>Netflix however took a stand, and pretty much posted a message to all of their subscribers that Comcast was at fault for the artificial connection problems.  Comcast was willing to do this to their own customers because of their monopoly in a number of  markets.</p>
<p>If certain ISP's had their way, the internet as we know it would cease to exist.  Fast lanes would have been provided to giant sites that could afford to pay, and any new startup would be crushed at birth.  Just imagine if during the myspace era, facebook, twitter, or youtube couldn't afford to pay for fast lanes.  It is difficult to know if any of them would have grown to what they are now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, no. It's worse. Comcast would be able to strangle google and Amazon and YouTube and replace their services with shitty overpriced Comcast versions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's possible. Also possible - the large players are able to pay for the best service (Google, Facebook, etc) and the scrappy startups can't compete because the barrier to entry in the Internet communications space becomes too expensive, killing innovation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had to wipe a tear away, there. </p>
<p>The thought that there are parties with power significant enough to (almost) turn the internet into rations—the very thing that has allowed the world to come together as one on solving its mysteries—to be sold just crushed my hope for human achievement. To turn something as fundamental to the development of humanity as the internet into a bargaining chip is indeed exactly like selling water—or even oxygen—to the highest bidder. </p>
<p>To bottleneck such a thing for the purpose of profit thoroughly disgusts me. Des-pi-ca-ble. Shame on them.</p>
<p>And a thousand tears of happiness to those that prevented this. I only hope more people realise how monumental a decision this has been, and how monumental this issue in fact is, until it is permanently covered by law.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's truly sad isn't it? Can't say I'm surprised either that it's companies like Verizon, Time Warner, and Comcast leading the charge either. Greedy, rich bastards looking to do nothing other than rape you financially and destroy one of the most fundamental tools today. No fucking humanity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at the history of Enron. They did just this exact thing. The executives purposely caused rolling blackouts throughout California after taking control of the power infrastructure after pushing through deregulatory policies that allowed them to take that control. A company caused a state of millions of people to continually lose electricity, to schools, hospitals, homes, and businesses, just so that they could turn a profit. And the government regulators and investors knew something was fishy, they just didn't want to stop it because too many important people were making too much money. The profit motive sure is motivating.</p></div>		</li>
