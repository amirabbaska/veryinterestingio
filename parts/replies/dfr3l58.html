			<div class="markdown"><p>They also have something called a &quot;booster&quot; that heat the water to a much higher temperature. The other thing (I have been a chef for ten years) you have people who are technically the dish washers who should spray the dishes in their entirety, that machine is more of a sanitization unit. </p>
<p>Edit: Thank you to all the dish washers who work in the most difficult and most often disgusting conditions to keep the restaurant running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did my share of dishes back in the day, I wish I had a sprayer at home like we had in the dish pit where I worked.  That thing had so much pressure and the water was so hot that it could blast anything off of dishes other than stuff that was really baked on.</p>
<p>That said, I was typically soaked head to toe after a while, so I guess a home sprayer of the same power wouldn't be the greatest idea after all...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dishroom manager for 3 years. Not all machines have a heater booster. There are basically two types: Hot water sanitizing, and chemical sanitizing. Most &quot;conveyor&quot; types (e.g. the ADC44) have a heater booster, but single door (e.g. Ecolab ES2000) use a chemical sanitizer. The water needs to be around 180Â°F in order to sanitize. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not the real reason why they clean dishes quicker. The reason commercial dishwashers complete the cycle and dry the dishes so quickly is because the water is heated to a much higher temperature, which is better for cleaning and drys the dishes much quicker.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Commercial Dishwashers are more so sterilizers than &quot;washers&quot;. They use chemical treatment and just below boiling water to in a sense pressure wash and sterilize the plate.</p>
<p>Oftentimes there's food particles still on the plates when they come out and depending on the busboy and how busy it is, they either put them back in the pile or re-wash them. (Cheese was the worst offender for this...)</p>
<p>The kitchen I worked at the cook would check the plate before using it and had a reject pile for the busboy. </p>
<p>When you're super busy and putting through trays of dishes at a time, you don't have the time to inspect all the dishes when there's one of you and hundreds of dishes. </p>
<p>Notice next time you sit at the bar how the bartender checks (should if trained right) the glass before using it. It's the same in the kitchen. </p>
<p>Also, most restuants use <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melamine" target="_blank">Synthetic Dishes</a> and not glass, this allows them to withstand the high heat and are more resistant to breaking.</p>
<p>The liquor and wine glasses however had to be run on a different cycle as they could break with the heat shock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also use huge barrels of chemicals for the washy bits that are far stronger than what you're using at home. You're able to handle your home dishwasher detergent barehanded. I would not recommend doing this with an industrial dishwasher.</p>
<p>For a little hint, one of the chemicals used (most industrial washers use three different ones) is a highly concentrated bleach.</p>
<p>The wash is a lot hotter too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Commercial dish washers operate at much higher temperatures and with much more volume than home units. They're essentially steam blasting the dishes. It's fast, but requires a much more heavily built machine, much more electrical power (they basically all at least 220 one phase, and most require 3 phase), and a lot of water volume. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure that's true about the quick wash setting - at least on my model, it's intended for relatively lightly soiled dishes, and uses less water than a normal cycle. Check your owner's manual. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dishwashers in bars tend to be fairly light washing by default, since it doesn't take much to clean beer out of a glass.</p>
<p>When people throw up what i can only assume is concrete into a pint glass it doesn't tend to wash properly.</p>

<p>really?  My quick wash just has me turn the dial further clockwise skipping other cycles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern appliances don't just go straight through the cycles, but it's still laid out that way for familiarity.</p>
<p>In old washers, for example, the dial turning completed different connections based on where the dial was in its rotation, and those different connections told the washer to do different parts of the cycle.</p>
<p>On new washers, everything is controlled by a microprocessor which uses the initial dial setting as input, then controls where the dial is pointed for a visual indicator.</p></div>		</li>
