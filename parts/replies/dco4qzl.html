			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, there are a lot of Blue Laws that are based off of religion as well. Some of the first ones that come to mind are laws such as in certain states liquor stores can't open until after a certain time on Sundays, the same for Car dealerships. This is due to church normally being Sunday mornings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...or liquor stores not being open at all on Sunday. And when the chance came about to strike that law from the books, a few vocal liquor store owners said it would hurt their business if they had to find someone to work that day, so keep it illegal to sell booze on Sundays. Yay Minnesota! :-\ The argument, that just because it was no longer illegal to sell on Sunday does not mean you have to be open on Sunday, went right over their heads, or with the response &quot;our competitors will take our business away that should have been ours&quot;. At least Wisconsin isn't too far away for me if I forgot to buy beer the day before. But I feel for the rest of the state.</p>
<p>The car dealership law is still on the books here as well. Many dealers will hold huge sales every once in a while, right up to midnight Saturday, then close the doors until Monday morning. Of course this has a benefit if you just want to look at cars up close, and not being hounded by a commission induced liar, you can do that on Sunday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read the first couple lines of your post, and thought, &quot;Hmm.  Pretty sure this dude is from MN.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeup.</p>
<p>It's somewhat perplexing that our bassackwards liquor laws have stuck around so long, even though we're one of the bluest states in the US.</p>
<p>And this is coming from someone who strongly identifies as moderate, and hates both parties.  But FFS, those Dems need to let us get more drunk!</p>
<p>Also, I pretty much bailed on the US completely and moved to Japan, but that's not really relevant.  I'm just drunk and rambling, since I'm in the sticks and no one here can speak English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in PA and our liquor stores are (mostly) closed on Sundays. It wasn't until recently that some flagship stores started open with reduced hours on Sunday. PA is also unique in that the state government own an entire liquor monopoly. Only state stores can sell liquor here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is still a religious requirement for office in many states. In Texas you have to believe in a higher power to run for office. This statute isn't legal, but it's still on the books. </p>
<p>Of course in Texas we have theocrats like Dan Patrick that are constantly pushing to have more evangelical Christianity pushed into our laws. </p></div>		</li>
