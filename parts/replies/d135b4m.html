			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetics plays very little role, with a few exceptions where genetic screening is possible. Lifestyle factors are hugely contributory towards alzheimer's development. Diabetics get it at a much greater rate than the general population, telling us high blood sugar is a likely causative factor. In fact, alzheimer's is often referred to as type 3 diabetes. It's likely a consequence of brain insulin resistance; the result of widespread glycation due to high blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>In fact, it's becoming increasingly clear, most diseases of aging, like heart disease, alzheimer's, cataracts, glaucoma, osteoporosis, and even skin aging has a great deal to do with AGEs, which primarily form when our average blood sugar is elevated above the level our bodies can routinely deal with, likely around 4.5mmol/l</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually disagree with you on the genetics front. A large percentage of those below the age of 90 that develop AD have the ApoE4 risk allele. You are correct that with time, many people without this risk factor will also develop AD but this hugely impacts the epidemiology and overall number of people with the disease. It's also troublesome when trying to put together coherent clinical trials with proper controls - you can't really age match people that have AD beyond a certain point because too many people with ApoE4 already have the disease (aka you can't find proper negative controls that have ApoE4 but don't have AD).</p>
<p>Edit: I have also posted recently on my issues with calling AD type 3 diabetes (see comment history for details).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree; dozens of genetic variants have been reproducibly associated with sporadic LOAD, and while the environment definitely plays a role (perhaps the driving role), there is certainly also some role that genetics plays. Twin studies showed about 60% heritability if I remember right..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youre right, but 60% badically means the environment is the important factor most people should be xoncerned with. All but the most genetically predisposed will avoid serious alzheimers with the xorrect lifestyle choices.</p></div>		</li>
