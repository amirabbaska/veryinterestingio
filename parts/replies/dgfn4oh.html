			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. I would like to add that if the barrel was parallel to the ground instead of pointing slightly upward, the bullet starts to fall as soon as it leaves the barrel, and would hit the ground very close to the same amount of time it would take for an object to hit the ground if just dropped from the height of the barrel. The difference in this case would be that the bullet is pushed at a high velocity out of the barrel and at a slight angle upward giving it an arc shaped trajectory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat and spin? So they are saying that a hot bullet defies gravity? Why does the spin make the bullet go up? Why not to the side, or down?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is accurate (pun intended?)</p>
<p>I have an old rifle and the sight is adjustable to a range of 2km (for volley fire, of course)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know much about guns, but that makes sense. When a shooter is adjusting a scope by rotating the thingy on the scope (the part on the end they look through) is that just adjusting the angle of the scope relative to the barrel? Or is it doing something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.</p>
<p>Scopes (and often iron sights as well) have adjustment for elevation (up/down) and windage (left/right). To get your sights adjusted properly (zeroed) you get a nice stable shooting position, pick a target at a known distance, and then start shooting and adjusting until the bullets hit where you're aiming.</p>
<p>For some guns this can be fairly easy because they are very flat shooters. This means the bullet doesn't drop much at all over the distance you're shooting. For some it can be quite challenging as the bullet drops a lot.</p>
<p>For a ridiculous comparison .22LR (suitable for hunting squirrels and rabbits inside 100y) will drop about 8 feet at 300yds, whereas .338 Lapua (suitable for hunting any game in North America at 1000+y) drops about 4 inches over the same distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neat. I've wondered exactly what characters in movies were doing when they rotated the thing on the scopeâ€”now I know. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding that wind needs an adjustment up/down as well.
Wind from any direction, front/back, left/right all needs up/down adjustment.</p>
<p>Most will adjust the sights to the most common wind, and move the spot you aim to adjust for random changing wind. Or wait if you can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the scope usually has adjustments based on some portion of a minute of angle (1/60th of a degree) with clicks to indicate how far you've changed the angle.  </p>
<p>Most (probably all) scopes also have a windage adjustment screw or knob that allows adjustment of the lateral angle (to compensate for wind velocity).  </p>
<p>Iron sights usually have less specific adjustments or are marked for various ranges (doing the conversion from angle to range for the shooter).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While MOA is common, some scopes and sighting systems use mil (milliradian - 1/1000th of a radian) adjustments.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty nice. Because of the small angle approximation, 1 mil is 1/1000th the distance to the target. At 100m, 1 mil is 10 cm.</p></div>		</li>
