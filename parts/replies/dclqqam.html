			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the partial derivative. I was keeping it simple for the OP as the formula I stated is valid for ideal gases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, no, it is just the speed of sound, not change of speed.  It is key to remember that it isn't the nominal Pressure divided by the nominal density, but rather the amount the pressure changes when you squeeze or expand the material divided by the density change of the squeezing or expansion that matters.</p>
<p>It is a measure of how stiff the item is in response to a change of density.  The stiffer the substance, like steel (6100 m/sec) the higher the speed of sound, the less stiff the substance like air (343 m/sec) the lower the speed.</p>
<p>The OP may have been confused, because when you do those derivatives for the ideal gas law, you get square root of gamma*Pressure/density (where gamma is the isentropic expansion factor).   However, that answer only applies to things that can be modeled with the gas laws.</p></div>		</li>
