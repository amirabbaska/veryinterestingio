<p>To actually manage a THC overdose you'd have to spend a lot of effort to first purify a sizable quantity of THC and then ingest it rapidly. This would never happen accidentally.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/VA8ZYalgXpA" target="_blank">video of Mountain Man</a> doing a 22 gram dab (~80% concentrated THC roughly equivalent to a couple ounces of bud) just to prove that you couldn't overdose on THC.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lets see, if that dab was equivalent to a quarter pound of bud, and an above post said the ld50 was something like smoking 1500 pounds of normal bud, then you would need 6000x that dab. 6000x 22g would be 132000g dab. Thats 132 kg. Or like 290 pounds of thc concentrate in a dab</p>
<p>Edit: i have no idea if the info like the ld50 is correct, just doing rough calcs off the above comments. The overall point is that it is basically impossible to consume a lethal dose of thc from any realistic use. Even if you were trying to kill yourself with pot it would be very difficult and you would probably die from something else related to the attempt rather than from a thc overdose </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit:  I've been contacted by four big media outlets wanting me to correct my quote, it is actually 3. They do not want any liability due to a misquote leading people to believe that one more dab could not hurt when in fact it could mean certain death. Please be careful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think consuming concentrated forms of something is making it unsafe by magic, but rather because it's concentrated and you're consuming more. It's reducing the amount required to ingest in order to overdose. You can still overdose from THC. It's just really, really difficult to do so when consuming it through cannabis. Not that 4 dabs is going to be enough to OD on.</p></div>		</li>
