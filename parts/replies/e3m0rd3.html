			<div class="markdown"><p>I also just view gambling at casinos as paying money to have fun with the added bonus that I may come out with more money but that’s not really the goal. </p>
<p>A lot of people just want to gamble for the entertainment it provides just like any other hobby you pay money for enjoying your time. It just has the illusion that you are winning money most of the time. </p>
<p>This makes me do suboptimal betting patterns because at the end of the day I would rather have the thrill of that big bet than just causal grind out small victories. </p>
<p>Pros and casinos feed off players like me and I’m fine with that they provide me entertainment I provide them cash. Just like going to a movie. The difference is that on any given day there is a chance I walk out with entertainment and all my money or even more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly my attitude. If you play thinking you're gonna win, it's not going to end well. I'd happily sit and play poker with friends just for bragging rights, but a couple of dollars in the pot focuses everyone's attention a bit more. It's mostly just an excuse to sit around, talking shit, and drinking beer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly getting just adds a nice spice to things. If I’m watching a sports game and  I don’t really care about the sport or teams I will usually throw down a few bucks with a friend and instantly the game is 10x more interesting. $5 for 2 hours of entertainment is a good deal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I do to, and over years playing with the sane guys, the money has been  exchanged back and forth so many times that it's impossible to tell if any one person is winning more or losing more (except for Adam, you lucky son of a bitch). But that's pretty small scale though. At casinos you're talking about thousands of dollars per hand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine being able to play against LeBron James and while you get a lot of points on him you almost always lose. But once in a while...you win. It would be a great experience that wealthy people would love to have. Poker is that way. You can play poker against a professional and because of the nature of the game do well and even occasionally win. Overall though the professional is going to clean your clock. </p>
<p>But that one time out of 300 times that you beat the pro is a story you can tell forever and something you can chase to repeat. Source: I once beat a professional poker player and all my friends know the story. As does anyone else that I've played poker with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I'm just imagining LeBron playing 1v1 against some old white rich dude, lifting him up near the rim so he can dunk and telling him &quot;Nice moves, Peter. You're so good, you boomed me!&quot;.</p>
<p>Then the old white guy telling him how he used to play ball in high school and could have played at college etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A better example would be the old white guy inbounding the ball and then making 3/4 court baskets while LeBron only does layups. When the stars align the guy makes all his 3 point shots and beats LeBron.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's poker, so it's more like 100 out of 300 times.</p></div>		</li>
