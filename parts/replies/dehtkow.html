			<div class="markdown"><p>The smaller a black hole the quicker it evaporates, with blackholes of several thousand tonnes only lasting a few miliseconds, making them effectively just insanely gigantic nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The photon required to do this however would have an actual energy of about 10^10 joules, which is utterly insane for a single photon, so good luck making it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pardon my ignorance, but is 10^10 joules a lot, or did you mean to write something else? Cause 100 joules doesn't seem like a ton of energy, but maybe it is when dealing with photons? </p>
<p>Edit - I have been informed that I forgot how to do basic grade school math. I shall now hang my head in shame, and play Math Blaster as penance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, we don't need to actually absorb them into a sustaining black hole. That would be super dangerous for us, the shooter.</p>
<p>So instead we want a wavelength that creates a black hole that can damage the target, which is definitely far less energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a common misconception about black holes. They aren't things that suck stuff in. They're just really really massive objects that have strong gravity. So if you made a black hole big enough to pull you stronger than Earth does, it would fall down really fast towards the center of the Earth, but not without cooking everything around it (including the shooter) with loads of hawking radiation first.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The interaction of a 2 E_planck photon with an electron at rest leads to a center of mass energy way below the Planck scale. I don't see why you would expect a black hole here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ah, because the COM energy is <code>[; \sqrt{2 E_\gamma m_e} ;]</code> right? I think I've oversimplified, sorry. Using a single photon you don't get a black hole, but you also are unable to use it to perform a position measurement on the electron because you give it a large linear momentum kick. To actually perform this measurement you need two such post-Planckian photons from opposite directions, for an overall zero momentum, and you get your post-Planckian COM energy allright.</p>
<p>Let me fix my top answer...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why such a convenient coincidence? These two things, Planck length and Schwarzschild radius come from (currently) entirely unrelated theories, so logically one should be able to imagine a universe where Planck length is ten or twenty orders of magnitude larger so that GR doesn't conveniently hide such photons from prying eyes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a coincidence</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No? The Planck length is relevant for quantum gravity. It depends on G! In natural units, l_P = G^(1/2)</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>no, because of the relationship between Planck length and mass with G, the formula for the Schwarzschild radius can be written as</p>
<p>R/l_P = 2 (M/M_P)</p>
<p>If the mass is greater than M_P, the radius of the black hole is also greater than l_P. Moving l_P (and M_P alongside) is equivalent to changing G.</p></div>		</li>
