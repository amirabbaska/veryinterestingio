			<div class="markdown"><p>Brushing helps. I never bathe them. They keep pretty clean on their own. I also have these cat wipes that are like baby wipes but for cat fur and it makes them smell like cucumber. Helps clean the dust off them. I just deal with it now knowing that it's not an actual allergy. </p></div>		</li>
