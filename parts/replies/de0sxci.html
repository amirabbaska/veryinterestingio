<p>What do they constitute as the &quot;full retail value&quot;?  The price on the shelf or the price the guy behind the counter told me it costs?  What if the item says $10 on the shelf but the guy behind the counter tells me I can have it for $5?  Is it the price that the item is sold to majority of people?</p></div>		</li>
