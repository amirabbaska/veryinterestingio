			<div class="markdown"><p>All I could find was a example lower and upper limit for cyclical burning. For a solar mass white dwarf it is 0.003-0.03 Earth masses a year. Below it novas and above it steadily burns. The time is really dependent on mass inflow and the white dwarf's mass.</p></div>		</li>
