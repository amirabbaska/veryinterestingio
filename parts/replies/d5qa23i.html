			<div class="markdown"><p>The ozone hole isn't really an area that 'ran out' of ozone because the ozone layer isn't a permanent collection of ozone molecules.</p>
<p>Ozone is continuously generated when O2 molecules high in the atmosphere absorb a UV photon (specifically UVC, I think). Ozone is already pretty unstable, so it breaks down on its own. The relative production and decomposition rates determines the steady-state ozone concentration. CFCs (chloroflourocarbons) offer an additional decomposition pathway for ozone, which speeds up the overall decomposition rate, which results in a lower steady-state concentration.</p>
<p>So if you took a crapload of ozone and sent it into the hole, the concentration would settle back towards the same levels. (If you are comfortable with some math, think of it in terms of an ODE: dC/dt = production - decomposition. No matter the initial conditions, the system will always settle to a situation where production = decomposition.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>@doppelbach - just wanted to clarify for people who hadn't taken calc or college chem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We are. It's called the Montreal Protocol and so far it's working.</p>

<p>Grab some ozone, throw it in the hole, there is no longer a hole. I realise someone else thought of that &amp; that it doesn't work that way, but why does it not work that way?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about continental sized holes of ozone. And it needs to be 12-19 miles above the ground. </p>
<p>So, you must produce a crazy, crazy amount of ozone (if released at the ground by accident, lots and lots of people prolly die) and then deliver that crazy crazy amount of ozone to altitudes that are mostly reserved for spy planes, aka low earth orbit. </p>
<p>It's just not a viable solution. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe you were being hyperbolic, but spy planes are nowhere near LEO. They're separated by a factor of ~4-5.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was trying to drive home that it's so high, you need a special plane just to get there.</p></div>		</li>
