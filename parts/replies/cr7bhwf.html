			<p>A good percentage, which is why advertisers have become very interested in content marketing - producing vaguely articles, videos, etc. that aren't served through ad networks and aren't blocked. A huge chunk of the stuff people share is actually advertising in disguise. </p>		</li>

			<p>Static images can be counted perfectly, you just need to count it on the server that serves the image, and on the server that receives the user when he clicks the image. The web browsers sends a &quot;referer&quot; parameter in the header with the address the request came from. And I don't see how would it change the amount of people that would see them.</p>		</li>

			<p>Though in terms of impressions you technically have to subtract the impressions received for the overlaying ad when it is displayed, since those are the cases where the background ad isn't visible. But not all ad blocking happens at that stage (before the request is made to the ad server), so your numbers aren't particularly accurate. Plus click rate is low anyway so the slot isn't worth much.</p>		</li>

			<p>most ads run for a certain amount of time and then get changed. Some ads are targeted, which means based on the profile Google (or other ad networks have of you) different ads are shown for different people. Instead of implementing those complex systems into each website and keep those up to date, they rather 'link' to the ad from the ad networks server and this server loads the ad. Adblock blocks the loading from known ad network server.  <br>  <br><strong>Edit to keep it ELI5-ish:</strong> Imagine a hairdresser with a new business model. Instead of paying for the haircut, you have to watch ads on a screen behind a semi-transparent mirror in front of you during the haircut. Of course, advertisers want their ads to be shown to people who are interested in their stuff. So car ads should be shown to persons who are currently looking for a new car, makeup ads are shown to women and baby stuff is shown to young mothers, fathers and pregnant women. So the hairdresser gives the customers a card where they specify their hobbies, interests and current situation.  <br>  <br>Now there are two options.  <br>Number one, the hairdresser scans your card, and the computer shows the interests. The hairdresser now has to chose, which ads he has to show, how many of them, and report afterwards to the advertisers. He also has to delete old ads and get new ones from the advertisers and ask advertisers if they are interested in advertising on his business. This is a lot of additional work for the hairdresser. He could make mistakes and lose money or even advertisers. This would be showing a 'static image'.  <br>Number two, the card is scanned and the interests are send over the internet (anonymised) to an advertisement company. This company selects the videos , streams them to the screen at the hairdresser and counts the views. They also manage all the ads, remove old ones, get new ones and so on. So the hairdresser can concentrate on what he does best, making haircuts without having to deal with managing ads. This would be the 'overlay' from the ad network.  <br>What would an adblock be in this example? You, as a customer, have a magical device that can somehow block the video stream to the monitor in front of you. The hairdresser only concentrates on cutting your hair, so he doesn't notice. But instead of showing some error message on the screen, like 'cannot connect to stream' it shows a message like 'please don't use an adblock' instead.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for the thorough explanation, and I understand why it is easier to have an ad from an ad network rather than host the ad yourself, but I was saying in the hypothetical scenario where you are going to place a static image ad underneath the same overlaying ad, it would make more sense to just get rid of the overlaying ad altogether.</p>		</li>

			<p>I realized my response to you was better fitted as a response to the question of OP, therefore I posted it as a direct answer to OP as well.  <br>  <br>If you want to show an ad underneath the 'network' ad, you would also have to go through all the hassle of 'number one'. And you're right, in this case it would be rather redundant to use both number one and number two. It isn't worth the trouble to use <em>both</em> an ad network <em>and</em> hosting the ads yourself. It is far easier to just show a generic 'please turn of your adblock' picture and hoping to convince at least some visitors.  <br>  <br>I misunderstood your comment in this regard and I fully agree with you.</p>		</li>

			<p>Hehe, when I came up with the example, I thought that many people would probably prefer such a hairdresser. Based on calculations of my own hair cut times vs. price, ads would have to make between 1€/min and 0.66€/min. I don't think that would work. I think on Youtube about 1000 views of one ad (around 1.5 - 2.5 minutes) give you $1. So unfortunately, such a hairdresser wouldn't be profitable. And yeah, I thought way to much about this...</p>		</li>

			<p>I think your hairdressers ads would command a massive premium though.<br><br>1) the ads are more targeted than your average adsense ad, when a survey is used before surveying.<br><br>2) you know for sure the person is watching the ads, they dont have a choice.<br><br>3) the person is likely paying attention to the ads as they have nothing better to do.<br><br>oh and the more likely outcome is the hairdresser would use these ads to just boost their profit, not actually give the customer any a discount :)</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, i think I have to check what ads can make before trying to open such a business. Unfortunately I'm not a hairdresser.  <br>But even lowering the prices substantially without underpaying the employees could be an incentive enough. Are people willing to watch ads for half an hour or more to get a cheap or free haircut?</p>		</li>

			<p>Much more. If you want to know what google alone tracks you can download the google analytics debugger extension for chrome. It shows (after pressing F12 and, if not preselected, selecting &quot;console&quot;) you every bit of data sent to google. I implemented googles ecommerce tracking for a conpany I work for and it, if done correctly, even tracks you LOOKING at a product as well as when, why (the item's position in a list, pronotions etc.) and how you click anything.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's wrong and I'm not talking about the one word or the spelling mistake.<br><br>It can be easily counted and everyone will see it unless you overlay it with a dynamic ad, because it is just like a normal image on your page. If you host the image on your own servers and dynamically generate pages that don't have identifiers which an be used to block the image, it's doable and almost impossible to block. But this is harder to maintain and possibly outweighs the ad revenue loss from adblock users.</p>		</li>

			<p>Easily counted from the server hosting it, but there's no easy way to reliably prove to your ad buyer what the count is. With AdSense and other ad providers, they keep a count of how many times an ad was served, and bill their customers accordingly. If you hosted the ad on your own server, you couldn't just tell the ad provider, as you wouldn't be able to prove it. The only solution I can really think of off the top of my head is to let the ad provider have some kind of direct access to your server backend, and at that point it's definitely more trouble than it's worth.</p>		</li>

			<p>You are forgetting one thing, the ad itself is almost worthless. The ad provider wants one thing more than the ad, all the websites you visit. If you visited a 'static' site, you'd just get a cookie for that site and it would only be trackable on sites that ended in that domain. <em>But</em>, when you visit a site with a doubleclick.net script injected in it, every single site with a script from doubleclick can read that cookie and now the provder can track you over the entire internet. </p>		</li>

			<p>Tell me, why would the the ad buyer have more reason to trust the numbers of an ad provider than the ones of the company running the site?  <br>The ad provider is just a middle man. The benefit is that they provide user profiling and distribute the ads over several sites. But if they say &quot;We show your ad 100.000 times for x amount of money.&quot; it is no different to the hosting site selling the ad space directly to ad buyers and saying &quot;We show your ad 100.000 times for x amount of money.&quot; Just because the counting is deferred to the server of an ad provider, the numbers are not more valid to the ad buyer. </p>		</li>

			<p>Fair enough. Most of the contracts are as you describe, paying for simple visibility and not clicks (called CPM) but you still have to trust the publisher to report impressions accurately. This is true of any business relationship, you have to trust that the other party will have to provide the service they claim.

			<p>Actually they could be and based on the recent reports of the number of people using ad-block a fair amount of people could see it. <br><br>Ad-Block basically works by blacklisting domains, specifically the ad service domains, e.g. AdWords/AdSense, and preventing that domain serve the ad into the block in the website. You could setup a small piece of code on the site to detect the referrer and log that to a database which is then tallied based on who you know you have an ad agreement like this with.<br><br>It also doesn't need to be a &quot;static&quot; image per say. Look at Reddit. When you use Ad-block it replaces the ad with a image/link to a subreddit at semi-random. <br><br>The main reason they don't bother is its a lot of work both to maintain the code and database on your end and to maintain the legal contracts with these sites. It's just not worth it to show ads to people who most likely aren't going to even look at it since they obviously don't want to see ads since they are using ad-block. </p>		</li>

			<p>Think about it this way.  Ad services work by serving the ad images from their servers,  not the server hosting the content.  Ad blockers work by stopping the browser for  being able to download from the ad servers while leaving the access to the content server intact.  So what's happening is that the Web site operator is putting a placeholder  image on that spot hosted from the content server (unblocked) which says &quot;don't block me please&quot;.  Since you can't talk to the ad server to download the image that gets loaded over it,  you see the message,  not the ad.<br><br>You're right,  the site operator could put an ad there instead,  but they they'd have to hire someone to sell the ad space,  someone to make the images and keep the rotated to be in compliance with all the relevant contracts,  etc. It's easier to outsource that to the ad company and link to their servers and wait for the checks to roll in.</p>		</li>

In order to get it up there I'd have to establish an agreement with every single site, which is a heck of a lot of work.

			<p>Because when a webpage loads no one knows which ad will show up. At that moment different ads compete for that space. Ultimately one of them will win (whoever is paying more). The ad pricing can depend on a large number of factors like who's browsing, which website you came from, which country you are in etc. So if you keep a static ad it will be very expensive for the advertiser, plus he won't be able to target his audience because his ad will be shown to whoever visits the page with adblock and that could be anyone.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ads are purchased on an auction, completely automated. An ad agency will pick a target audience based on location, interests, age, language, etc...<br><br>The exchange where the bids happen (Google has one called Double click Bid Manager, or DBM - just for an example), then has lists, or what we call channels, which cater to those sets of demographics. It also judges a user's age, and interests based on previous behaviour, using cookies, and pixels.<br><br>There are literally millions of transactions happening every second, all electronically, the ad agency places a maximum bid for a certain ad in a certain environment, this agency then instructs google that this particular ad can serve on this and that kind of website, and is willing to do so at up to $3 (example) per 1000 impressions (views). If the bid wins at the auction, the ad is then placed on a website for that one particular impression (view) on the user's end. This cycle goes on and on and on.<br><br>An advertiser could potentially organize a takeover, and take up all the ad space on a site for X amount of time, this tends to be very costly. <br><br>Now could an advertiser target specifically users who's ads are blocked? Theoretically yes, but few advertisers do not go through an agency, and an agency simply would not be able to make the standard margin on it. You also have to keep in mind that people with adblock, really don't want to see an ad, would it create a positive image of the advertiser in their head? Probably not. <br><br>Lastly, because of privacy laws, there is no way for the publisher (website the ad is placed on), the exchange (DBM in this example), the advertiser, or agency, to track which user it was that went to the website, and saw the ad (though you could technically track clicks - I'm pretty sure you would be breaking a few laws if you did though). As such, it is basically useless without the proper tracking information.<br><br>Side note: if an exchange attempts to publish an ad on a site, but it cannot because it is blocked, neither the agency nor advertiser are charged, it is literally like nothing happened, except for the publisher, they missed out on about $0.0001-$0.0005.<br><br>Sorry if I'm a bit unclear, its 1am and I have to be up for work in 5 hours.<br><br>Source: work in online advertising.</p>		</li>

			<p>From AdBlock Plus's 'Acceptable Ads' guidelines (Websites need to sign up to this to go on ABP's whitelist):<br><br>'<strong>Which ads are &quot;acceptable&quot;?</strong><br><br>We currently have the following requirements:<br><br>- Static advertisements only (no animations, sounds or similar)<br><br>- Preferably text only, no attention-grabbing images<br><br>Ad placement:<br><br>- Ads should never obscure page content (e.g. require users to click a button to close the ad before viewing the page).<br><br>- For pages featuring a reading text ads should not be placed in the middle, where they interrupt the reading flow. However, they can be placed above the text content, below it or on the sides. The same applies to search results pages: paid search results cannot be mixed with organic results.<br><br>- When ads are placed above the content of a main page, they should not require the user to scroll down. The available vertical space is likely to be at least 700 pixels. Advertising should not occupy more than one-third of that height. Paid search results on search pages are allowed to occupy more space, but they should never outnumber organic results.<br><br>- When placed on the side ads should leave enough space for the main content. The available horizontal space can be expected to be at least 1000 pixels, and advertising should not occupy more than a third of that width.<br><br>- Advertising should be clearly marked as such with the word &quot;advertising&quot; or its equivalent, and it should be distinguishable from page content, for instance via a border and/or different a background color.'</p>		</li>

			<p>Ad companies would have to negotiate with individual websites and web developers to do the work on a per site basis.  They would have to send the ad to the website and the website would have to update their code to include it. If the ad changed, they'd have to change it. And you'd have to do that with thousands of websites, and the ad would be the same every time. <br>Real ads are served up by a company like google who host the content, manages the pricing and payment, tracks clicks, rotates ads and does it with hundreds of sites simultaneously. etc. AdBlock stops this, so people put static images in their HTML code to say &quot;please don't block ads&quot;. Having that static image say &quot;buy coke&quot; is possible, but would be extremely difficult to scale that up enough to be practical for advertisers and websites.<br><br>TLDR: Wouldn't be scalable</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm talking about a situation where the URL <em>is</em> indistinguishable from the names of the actual image content.<br><br>If we ignore the random URL concept for a moment, a easy, simple solution would be to have all the media stored in a database with each image across the site given an incrementing id.<br><br>    +----+-------+------------------------------+<br>    | id | type  |             url              |<br>    +----+-------+------------------------------+<br>    |  1 | local | ~/media/dog.png              |<br>    |  2 | adv   | <a href="http://some.ad.server.com/ad" target="_blank">http://some.ad.server.com/ad</a> |<br>    +----+-------+------------------------------+<br><br>Then have all images loaded from /media/&lt;id&gt;.png where the id is then looked up and the local or remote image is loaded and cached before being served to the user. The actual file needn't exist on the webserver, the script simply needs to be able to retrieve it somehow.<br><br>Then in the page, images are embedded as:<br><br>    &lt;img src=&quot;/media/1.png&quot;&gt;<br><br>    &lt;img src=&quot;/media/2.png&quot;&gt;<br><br>I'd be very interested to see a regular expression which can match the latter URL without having access to the database.</p>		</li>

			<p>It is scalable because you can charge a lot more for ads via direct sale. That's because the sites that do it have reached a traffic level, or have a specialized enough community, that they can sell access to for a premium. The higher costs justifies the additional work. Look at any reputable tech blog and see if they use Adsense - the ones that do only use it as backup when they can't book sales. </p>		</li>

			<p>Would it be possible for a website to give some control of the HTML to an ad company and have the HTML dynamically change upon refresh, or change at certain times?</p>		</li>

			<p>In the HTML itself, ads on webpages are basically placeholders that say &quot;Browser, please download the image that is at <a href="http://adcompany.com/xyz" target="_blank">http://adcompany.com/xyz</a>&quot;.<br><br>Adblock works by saying, &quot;psst, hey browser.  Don't download anything from <a href="http://adcompany.com" target="_blank">http://adcompany.com</a>&quot;<br><br>It is entirely possible for websites to give control of a specific section of HTML to an ad company. The problem is, the easiest way to do that is to insert a placeholder that says &quot;Browser, please download the HTML at <a href="http://adcompany.com/xyz" target="_blank">http://adcompany.com/xyz</a>&quot;.  It would work basically the same as ads do now and so can be blocked the same way.<br><br>There <em>are</em> other ways to serve ads that aren't able to be blocked.  The ad company can take the ad and give it to the web designer of every single website that wants to use the ad.  This is problematic because it means every website has to be kept updated by the operator of said website.  That takes some work to maintain, even if the update process can be automated.<br><br>Alternatively, the web server itself can rewrite the HTML.  In that case, the placeholder would say &quot;Browser, please download the image at <a href="http://website.com/xyz" target="_blank">http://website.com/xyz</a>&quot;.  When the browser asks website.com for image xyz, website.com asks adcompany.com for image xyz, then sends that image to the browser.  This would be done invisibly behind the scenes, and so the browser never knows the image comes from adcompany.com.  This can't be blocked by adblock using the same method, but it requires website.com to run a server-side framework that can do this sort of dynamic translation work, such as PHP or NodeJS.  This means it won't work on every web server, and it requires the web server to be properly configured in order to work.<br><br>Both of those methods would get around the method that Adblock currently uses to block ads.  However, they both require more work to be done by the owners of the website, and so they are much less popular.  Additionally, there are other ways to block ads that wouldn't be affected, such as by blocking every image that links to adcompany.com (since ads almost always link to whatever they're advertising), or by comparing the size of the image or a hash of it with a list of known advertisements.  Ultimately, because the HTML has to be interpreted by the browser, and because the browser gets to chose how to interpret the HTML, the only way to circumvent every possible kind of ad-blocking is to make the ad indistinguishable from the rest of the website.  Doing so would severely limit what ads can do (such as tracking users and dynamically displaying ads based on websites they've visited), make it much more difficult to dynamically distribute them, and would require the ads to be tailored to each and every single website on the internet.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not quite sure what you're referring to.  Do you mean the video ads that play before or in the middle of youtube videos?  Or the text ads that pop up inside the video?  Or some third thing?<br><br>If it's one of the first two, those are still delivered via advertisement delivery networks.  The system did require a bit more work for YouTube to set up compared to traditional ads, but they don't take any more effort to run now that the initial work is done.   In any case, YouTube is a bit of a special case.  YouTube is by far the largest video distribution website and gets a massive amount of views every day.  Because of how popular it is, Google (who owns YouTube) can afford to put the special effort into embedding ads into the videos themselves.  Most websites aren't nearly as popular.</p>		</li>

			<p>They could, in theory, block all images on the website. Or the website itself. <br><br>They don't because people don't want an adblocker which hides images on the sites they visit. So what you're asking for is your adblocker to block specific images on the site. That's possible usually. You can right click on an image and tell AdBlock to block it. AdBlock won't block it by default though because<br>a) Why would they want to  <br>b) They try to avoid false positives so they don't get that strict with blocking  </p>		</li>

			<p>What if, for example, a website makes all the content on a webpage, like, preload onto one image or something like that. Something where the ad literally isn't separate from the content, baked into an essential picture or the writing itself. That obviously causes other problems, but in theory, couldn't websites start doing that?</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/i_lack_imagination" target="_blank">i_lack_imagination</a>
			<p>Yes they could, but unless they dynamically alter the ad placement, then another easy method would be to simply block out the location where ads are placed, adblockers could simply overlay a black box if they wanted. This should be very easy for the website designer to get around, but I point it out to show that each time you come up with a way that beats the previous method of blocking ads, another one crops up. <br><br>Of course at some point it would become much more difficult for adblocking to work. Videos with video ads attached directly to the video stream aren't really easily blocked, because from a technical point of view, if it's all one video, how can you tell which parts are the commercials and which parts are the real video? Think about standard TV for example, how would a consumer automatically block commercials? Of course, Dish did come out with a method to do so, though I'm not sure on the technical details as to how they accomplished it.</p>		</li>

			<p>One thing adblock is detecting is where the content is served from. <br>If you serve the ad from your website then AdBlock wouldn't really be able to tell the difference between the ad and an image (like a cat picture).

			<p>What if it's not the HTML that's dynamic but the webpage manually but auto-updating with variants of, say, the background picture or the entire pages content. Kinda like every hour or so every web page gets sent to a server and gets a watermark-sorta ad printed into it, gets a redirect tied to it in the HTML for the area where the ad is, and then sends out those altered pages and the website automatically replaces all pages with the new baked in ad?</p>		</li>

			<p>That's not much different than self-hosted static ads.<br><br>The problem is that once you generalize a method of serving ads, then an adblocker can generalize against you.

Unless you can make a system that is nigh impossible to block any new ads you would be putting in, or at least make it much more difficult, then its highly likely that those people will just find a way to block any new ads, or the software they are using to block your ads will adapt to block your new method of advertising if possible without any extra effort on the part of the user. </p>		</li>

			<p>In 2015, an ad is more than a static image. That ship has sailed.

			<p>At some point the adsense says &quot;this is the image to display for this person on this webpage; go&quot;. As I understand it, right now when you visit a page with ads your browser is instructed to load the ads from such-and-such and adblock just tells your browser to ignore that. I'm saying why they couldn't then send that to the website host where it would be incorporated into the page before the page is actually sent to the person requesting it. What they'd get would just be one big image with all the ads &quot;sewn in&quot;. What you aren't explaining is shy that isn't feasible. </p>		</li>

			<p>That would be a huge burden on the servers of the website being viewed, particularly high traffic websites.  As it stands, the image we see embedded into a webpage as an ad is a link to a file being stored on the advertiser's servers.  As you stated, Adblock tells your browser to ignore requests to display that image.  In order for the ad's image to be &quot;sewn in&quot; to the web page being viewed and bypass Adblock's code, it would have to be stored somewhere on the server of the web site being visited.  The web site's server would have to either A)  Store hundreds or possibly thousands of images on its limited and costly server storage space or B)  Instantly download the image to its server, display it from its new storage location and then immediately delete it upon navigation away from the site which would be a huge, huge tax on the web site's bandwidth.</p>		</li>

			<p>It could, and it would work, the ad network could send the image to the Web host and then send it to the site user. There are technical difficulties, like how do you display the ad to &quot;this specific user&quot;, not &quot;everyone&quot;. The ad network also wants to know the click rate and view rate so they know whom to charge money. And ad networks have many different ads to display, some only pay for so and so many views or so many clicks. <br><br>All this is stuff that the host server now have to handle, which means computing time, which is not free. Also, how do the ad company know that the data is correct? Nothing prevents a site from saying &quot;I've displayed this ad a billion times and every viewer clicked on it!&quot; (which is not possible using frames like it's done now). <br><br>Another thing is network cost. A site can generate thousands of views a second, the bigger sites (reddit) many times more. A small image (100k) on a site with 10000 hits per second is a Gb of data every second. And network traffic is not always free.<br><br>Another thing is that hosts get punished for poorly optimised content. If the ad network can upload images to your server and you host them to the users blindly, then if the image is too big - only you suffer, there is zero stress on anywhere else. You now have to make sure your Internet isfast enough to handle the ad networks content in addition to your own. </p>		</li>

			<p>Doing that would require every website that wants to use Adsense to either manually update their website or to run some kind of server-side framework such as PHP.

When certain guests show up (ads) that aren't on the &quot;list&quot; Adblock tells them to take a hike, so new ads could keep showing up and being turned around and you wouldn't know any different because only guests on the list came in. As far as you know, no unwanted guests showed up. </p>		</li>

			<p>Ads are usually hosted on a server different than the one hosting the web page you are viewing. AdBlock takes note of those servers and instructs your browser to not load any information from those servers. The web site can be coded to notice if the content isn't loaded, and assume AdBlock is in use in some form (you can also blacklist those servers in your router for the same effect, even on devices that can't install AdBlock, like Xbox and PS3) and then display the message insetad, which is hosted in teh web page code itself, so it won't be blocked. AdBlock primarily blocks content that is externally hosted, relative to the web site you are viewing.<br><br>Ad networks aren't going to get access credentials to modify the site directly, so they won't be able to build the ads into the web page, and thus won't be able to block them. The way they are now is more efficient, because they only have to put an ad in the pool, and the site can make a call to the pool for the next ad in the rotation, instead of having to modify billions of web pages every time the ads update. This centralization also makes blocking an efficient process, as you only have to block a small number of the domains on the entire internet.</p>		</li>

			<p>There seems to be a misunderstanding with how ad blocking works. When the web page is served to you, it has been served, with however many pictures are hanging on that wall (to extend the analogy). Ad block will remove all the pictures on the wall, regardless of how many there are, so even if there's a picture behind the picture, ad block sees all of them and removes all of them. Ad block isn't fooled by your shitty interior decorating.</p>		</li>

			<p>AdBlock blocks the thing that loads the ad. If you put another one there, it would be blocked as well. An ad that doesn't need a loader would be something simple, like a text-based ad or a non-moving picture. AdBlock is OK with non-intrusive ads like that, and so if a website only has those simple ones and they are out of the way so they don't make your time on the website worse, they can be put on a list to be allowed though the Adblock filter.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't think anyone has really answered your question yet.<br><br>Ads get blocked because they are objectionable. Sometimes they flash or make noise or are distracting in another way. Sometimes they follow the old adage that ads should take away the viewer's self esteem so they can sell it back to them for the price of the product. Some simply dislike receiving sales pitches.<br><br>If there were another ad back there, people would figure out how to block it, pass their changes on to everyone else, and nobody would see the second ad.<br><br>On the other hand, if it's replaced with a message that the site depends on ad revenue to survive, that's not as objectionable. If it's unobjectionable enough, nobody may ever take the time to figure out how to block it, and the message may be seen by people who would otherwise see nothing.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Individual websites don't host ad content themselves. They sell space on their websites to big marketing companies, who then provide the website owners with code to insert into that part of the page. The remotely hosted code is what displays the ad itself. That's how AdBlock knows what to block. If it sees content on a page that is hosted by a known advertising provider, boom--blocked.<br><br>Because of this, putting an ad behind an ad wouldn't be enough to fool AdBlock. It would just block both ads.<br><br>You do have the right concept, though. Those parts on pages that say, &quot;Hi! Our website depends on ad revenue. Please consider disabling AdBlock for our site,&quot; actually <em>are</em> ads placed behind ads like you describe. AdBlock does not block these locally hosted ads, though, because AdBlock will not block content hosted on the same website you're visiting. If it did, it would totally muck up your browsing experience.</p>		</li>

			<p>You CAN put an ad there that would not be blocked, but the company showing the ad wouldn't make any money from it.<br><br>The ads displayed are not usually promoting something on the originating site. For example, an ad on cnn.com won't usually promote a show on CNN. It'll be an ad for something like an Apple Watch (Apple being another company). <br><br>So if Apple is paying CNN to show their ads, how would Apple know about it?<br><br>It CAN'T be hosted by CNN. If it were, they'd just say &quot;We showed your ad a BILLION times and a BILLION people clicked on it so pay us a BILLION dollars.&quot;<br><br>It can't be hosted by Apple. If it were, they'd just say &quot;You never showed our ad, so we're not paying you.&quot;<br><br>So to keep both companies honest, they host the ads through a third party company that they both trust. This might be a company or product like Google AdSense. Since there is a very limited number of these third party companies, all AdBlock has to do is blacklist these companies and the range of servers that they are known to serve content from. New servers pop up all the time and AdBlock updates their lists to block them, too.<br><br>AdBlock does not block content from the content providers like CNN. There are too many of them and you wouldn't be able to see the original content you wanted to actually see (e.g. the CNN article). </p>		</li>

			<p>Ads have a specific bit of code that makes them ads. Adblock works the same way your antivirus works, it compares that code with an existing database. Adblock disables ads by hiding that code. In web design, you can make it so if an image or element doesn't work, you can place whats called alt-text, which is text you write that shows up instead. This text isn't an ad so it's not blocked.<br><br>tl;dr The site can't tell if you're using adblock, they just have that alt-text behind the ad.

			<p>Ads are images (most of the time) or recognizable pieces of code because of how they have to be embedded (think adsense for google).

			<p>AdBlock and similar tools are built around a list of criteria. They use these criteria to look at elements on the page and try to find what is an ad.<br><br>Some of these can easily be fooled if you are in complete control of the ad. So:<br><br>- Since Adblock looks at <strong>the name of things in the page's code</strong>, you can avoid naming it <code>ad</code>, <code>advertisement</code>, <code>sponsor</code>, etc. AdBlock will block it if you do.<br><br>- Since AdBlock looks at <strong>the links's URL</strong>, you could remove something called a &quot;referral&quot; in it, which tells the advertisers who sent you to their website when you click. AdBlock will block this.<br><br>- Since AdBlock looks at <strong>where links send you</strong>, you could avoid linking back to advertisers' websites at all. Otherwise, AdBlock will block it.<br><br>But advertisers actually give you scripts, not ads. These scripts fetch ads from <em>their</em> servers, and you have no control over the code they insert in the page, the link's address, or the presence of a referral in it. And all these things will probably be caught by AdBlock.<br><br>So, if you put an ad behind the ad, they'll both be blocked. AdBlock doesn't care if it's &quot;behind&quot; another thing, in the code they're both equally easy to spot.<br><br>And, if you <em>are</em> able to display an ad – which is very possible if it's not served by an advertising network – then you don't need to &quot;hide&quot; it behind another ad to start with.<br><br><em>(For you technical folks, by &quot;looks at&quot;, I mean AdBlock filtering is <a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/faq_internal#filters" target="_blank">based on regular expressions</a>)</em></p>		</li>

There is a large system of personalization, analytics, and metrics that are used to support ads.

			<p>This just came full circle, exactly wtf OP was posting in the first place. Short answer is that it's damn easy to set up even the shittiest router out there to block domains such as &quot;clickthisadnow.net&quot;. Or use a hosts file on your computer alone (mine has nothing on it, and way better if you do it on your router anyways, and I have never met a single person who has their internet connection plugged directly into just one computer, at least at home, and if it's somewhere else, that computer is already acting as a router anyways). But I guess, the answer is being able to read/send cookies, facebook info, things like that. We've moved beyond generic ads now, it's all about targeting.<br><br>...although, they think I speak french and spanish, and am interested in tampon ads, so not really a success.</p>		</li>

			<p>Because usually the ad comes from another company's server.  Some companies, using very strict guidelines on what is in the ad, are able to serve the ad themselves.  A good example of this is how Facebook ads used to be.  They all had three lines of text and a picture of an exact size.  These restrictions allowed Facebook to easily serve the ads natively as opposed to fetching them.  Most advertisers wouldn't dream of going through this much trouble or giving up this much control over the ad, but Facebook is Facebook and people spend a fuck ton of time there so the advertisers were willing to jump through hoops to be on Facebook ads.</p>		</li>

			<p>To ad(d) to this as the question asks &quot;why not show them another ad if you know that they have adblock&quot;<br><br>Imagine adblock is like a pair of sunglasses that make people look through pictures on the wall and see what is behind the picture on the wall (safe, message, dirt). You can see that people have those sunglasses on, but every time you want to show them a picture, they will see right through it. So showing a new ad to adblock users just makes them see through it (not see the ad).<br><br>Obviously, there is a bit more to it, but this should be the intuition in ELI5 style.</p>		</li>

			<p>To correct the analogy a little, it's not that the picture is taken down, but that it was never put up in the first place. The designer was anticipating a picture to go on the wall, but he also thought you might stop it from being put up, so he wrote &quot;please let me put a painting here on the wall&quot;, text that only shows up if you stop the picture from appearing. Basically if you don't run adblock, the ad goes up and covers the space reserved for the ad. If you have adblock, the ad never goes up and you can see what was below the ad. In some cases, it could be a request to turn off adblock. </p>		</li>

			<p>That is a good explanation, however, it's important to understand that usually the visited website and the ads are served from different domains. So, the ad blocker doesn't block content served directly from the visited website, it blocks content from the ad website. The visited website can detect that content from the ad website is not shown but it usually[1] cannot serve ads.<br><br>[1]: Technically the visited website can serve ads but that means that the developers must implement a way to display ads without them blocked. They have to be really careful to achieve that since ad blockers are really advanced now. The pornhub network websites used to do it and it would escape from AdBlockPlus. The way this is achieved is if the content of the website and the content of the ads is indistinguishable. It seems that ublock detects and blocks those ads now.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sorry, but it's not entirely correct.<br><br>You <em>could</em> put up a background picture and some may do. The newer techniques however, for detecting adblock looks at elements expected <em>after</em> an ad should have been loaded and does their anti anti ad features at this point.<br><br>Now the reason why you can't just detect something and load a new add in place of the old, when adblocking is detected is due to the way adblocking is done. While you can detect the ad is missing, you can't force the browser to load a new image from the resource, since they browser is being told to block requests to the host.</p>		</li>

			<p>Technically, those &quot;hello adblocks&quot; could be blocked, too, since modern adblockers can also block by DOM element. But since they're not ads, the adblockers usually let them stay up. If they were to replace them with ads, then we can expect that the adblockers would block them again.<br><br>So they can't put an ad there. The best they can hope for is convincing users to whitelist them.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't think this is quite right. There are times where the &quot;yo you should stop using adblock&quot; message appears in a different location than where the ad would normally be.  <br><br>For example even though the ad is normally on the right side on the page <em>next to</em> the content, the &quot;pls don't use adblock&quot; message appears at the top of the page, <em>above</em> the content.

			<p>Ads are delivered using special advertisement delivery networks (it's done this way for a number of reasons, but the biggest is because it makes it super easy to deliver the same ad to hundreds of thousands of different websites at the same time).<br><br>Adblock kills the connection to this advertisement delivery network.  Any ad that is loaded through this network won't load.  If an ad isn't loaded through this network it <em>will</em> show up, but most people don't bother doing ads that way because it takes a lot more effort.<br><br>Imagine ads were like water.  An advertisement delivery network is like the water main, and adblock blocks ads by turning off the main shutoff valve.  You could still get more water (ads) if you wanted, but you have to take a bucket and walk down to the nearest river or lake and fetch it yourself every time you needed some.  Most websites don't bother because the water main is so convenient and only a portion of users know how to use the shutoff valve anyway.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ok, so why isn't the wall behind the picture also an ad?  Seems like this would be marketable ... &quot;If a user visits our site and they're using ad blocking software, you can also pay us directly (oldschool style) to have your ad embedded directly to our page.&quot;  This is how ads used to work, adblock just blocks ads that are otherwise &quot;routed&quot; to the page from an external source, right?</p>		</li>

			<p>With internet ads this would work well saying an ad is a TV hanging on a wall showing nothing but loud annoying commercials all day long. Ad blockers unplug the TV and then take it down to hide it from you and behind it is a poster saying please don't unplug and remove the TV.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yup, the message is in the background. When an ad is not loaded (whether from AdBlock or the ad just messing up), you see the message. Basically, if you're seeing these messages, you're either using AdBlock to remove the &quot;pictures&quot; (ads), or the &quot;picture&quot; (ad) fell down while you were away (i.e. glitched).</p>		</li>

			<p>And the ad picture is not hosted on the web site owner. It's hosted on the ad server that gets linked to the creator website. This is why it's important to remove them, because if the ad server gets compromised (it happens a lot), you can be infected by visiting a safe site.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ads are rarely background properties, since backgrounds aren't clickable, but you're on the right track. Ads are usually image or iframe elements in a container with a<code>background-image</code> property saying something like &quot;Please don't block our ads.&quot;. When the image or iframe element is deleted (or isn't being loaded), the background of the container element will be visible.</p>		</li>

			<p>When you first enter a page, an algorithm runs that allows companies to bid on serving you an ad. This takes place during a few milliseconds, and then you are served an ad from a server somewhere. These are large systems that look uniform on each webpage. Adblock knows what these elements look like and stops them from displaying. <br><br>If someone were to create an ad on a webpage that was simply a static image with a link in it, it would display exactly the same as a normal image. However that image can't be tailored towards a user, cannot have a milliseconds long auction for the right to display the ad, and can ultimately not be tracked as well, therefore there is no money in it. </p>		</li>

			<p>How do those &quot;auctions&quot; work? The company's whose Ad wins couldn't be quick enough to actually &quot;bid&quot; against other companies. <br>Do they just have predetermined rates, and the server checks which relevant ad has the hugest rate, then chooses that one?</p>		</li>

			<p>Companies well put a certain amount of money in an account, and then enter certain criteria about demographics and max bids. An algorithm takes care of all the magic underneath to make sure everyone gets their ads served and the ad company makes the max amount of money. The winning bidder typically winds up paying the 2nd place price, as sort of a gesture of good faith that the algorithm isn't robbing them. <br><br>Source: used to work in marketing, am now a webdev applying for a position with an ad tech company</p>		</li>

			<p>That's not why. It's just a hard sell.<br><br>&gt; Hey Sprint, I know you like your ads. I have some space on my website to sell, a 300x400 ad. I get, like, 40,000,000 unique hits a month.

			<p>I think the larger reason why this doesn't happen is that Sprint can't use an Ad Network's served ads that have all the nice cookie tracking and behavioral data built in. Since AdBlock prevents the third party from delivering their content, Sprint would have to trust that the hosting website would count hits correctly, would show the right ad, etc. </p>		</li>

			<p>That's definitely a factor, but it boils down to trust, and the advertiser (Sprint) might decide to contract with a large site they trust.<br><br>So, I think specifically trying to sell space that no one will see, except people that don't like ads, is the harder sell.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's bullshit. If that was the case, you could just put the same ad both &quot;in front and behind&quot; and sell it with &quot;AdBlock bypass guarantee&quot;. The problem is that AdBlock not only removes certain elements, but also tells your browser to not load any external resources from ad sites.<br><br>If you scroll down in this <a href="https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt" target="_blank">AdBlock EasyList file</a> for instance, you'll see that nothing from <code>advert.ee</code> will ever get downloaded.

			<p>Did you mean to reply to my post? Because you seem confused.</p>
<p>In my hypothetical, the site owner is contracting directly with the person wanting to buy ad space (Sprint). If they come to a deal, Sprint gives them the image (jpg, png) and a check. The site owner hosts the image, and adblock can't tell the difference between it and the site's logo.</p>		</li>

			<p>Talking directly to the company who wants to buy an ad space is very rare. Usually you would talk with an advertising company who has people place ads on the page for you. The advertising company is the one who talks directly to the people trying to get their ads out there. This method involves delivering the image as the page loads, making it easy to remove.</p>		</li>
