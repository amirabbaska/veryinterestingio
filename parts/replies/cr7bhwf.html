			<p>Because ads are additional overlays that change periodically based on adsense. It's not just a static image that the web host decides to put on. </p>		</li>

			<p>Why don't the people paying for the ads pay a bit more or work out an agreement to set up a static image ad?</p>		</li>

			<p>Static image add can't be counted, and only very VERY small people will see it.<br><br>Edit: oh boy, didn't notice that error.</p>		</li>

			<p>it would also have to be painstakingly updated as the ad runs its course. i'd imagine the system is set up for easily swapping traditional ads, but a static image that few people are going to see anyway, probably not</p>		</li>

			<p>Because google does this and centralizes the whole process. It would take years of work every day to do it statically on 100,000 websites for 10,000 advertisers.</p>		</li>

			<p>There are people paying Ad block to unblock their ads. Ad Block isn't in the business to make your web experience better. They are in the business to make advertisers pay them.</p>		</li>

			<p>Because that'd probably be unnecessarily expensive. Why spend that large of an amount of extra money just so the group of people using Adblock and on that specific website who just so happened to have that specific ad of theirs pop up on that visit. It's very minuscule. That money could be spent putting up a bunch of ads through Adsense on various sites.</p>		</li>

			<p>Right, but that is across every website that that users views. This guy is talking about paying one single site to keep your ad up as a static image. </p>		</li>

			<p>Adblocks block based on page elements. All they would have to do is randomly change the selectors with gibberish.</p>		</li>

			<p>Most companies will rent out add space to different businesses, and also cookies provide insight into the types of ads that some users may respond to better.<br><br>So it doesn't make sense to have that there...<br><br>What they could do, is advertise their own ad banner on there. So it could be &quot;If you don't see an ad here, then maybe you should contact us about advertising you in our space.&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Adblock is a doorman at your popular club. When certain guests show up (ads) that aren't on the &quot;list&quot; Adblock tells them to take a hike, so new ads could keep showing up and being turned around and you wouldn't know any different because only guests on the list came in. As far as you know, no unwanted guests showed up. </p>		</li>

			<p>Web Developer here. Basically there's an imaginary container (typically called a &quot;div&quot; in html code) that holds the ad. You can tell the container to have a background image. When the ad gets removed, the background image is revealed. </p>		</li>

			<p>Because nobody pays to show a picture. They pay to show the picture X times. And if you're not using an ad-network counting the impressions gets too hard.</p>		</li>
