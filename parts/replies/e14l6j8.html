			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a joke but the answer is no. The little hairs in your ear that are required for hearing are in the cochlea which is a fluid filled sac. In order for the Nair to get into there and cause damage, it would need to travel through the tempanic membrane (eardrum) and the oval window which likely wouldn't happen. P.S.: Dont be stupid, Nair in your ears would be a very painful, dumb thing to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mechanics behind hearing are so interesting!</p>
<p>I majored in EE but I spoke with a researcher at NYU at a science fair in depth on the topic - turns out, those hairs are pretty tricky to simulate! With cochlear implants, we can correctly simulate the naturally generated signals, but have a very difficult time pinning down frequencies and amplitudes. Interestingly enough, it turns out that both depth into the cochlear organ (inwards of the spiral) AND artificially generated signal frequencies can be  perceived as loudness AND pitch. Turns out it's not exactly like a xylophphone, but something much weirder. It's part of the reason why cochlear implants make music awful to listen to!</p></div>		</li>
