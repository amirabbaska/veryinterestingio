			<div class="markdown"><p>In high gravity situations elements decay slower due to gravitational time dilation. </p>
<p>Although, exactly in the middle of jupiter (or any other planet) there is no gravity at all. This is due to Newtons shell theorem which states that in such situations the gravitational forces from all directions cancel each other out exactly but it increases the further you go away from the center. </p>
<p>In the middle of Jupiter there is extremely high pressure though. This should not effect the halftime either but I am not completely sure about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. You are right. That is interesting, I did not think about that. This is a bit like the Aharanov-Bohm effect in which there is also a physical consequence due to the potential even though the magnetic field strength vanishes.</p>
<p>Until now this was the only effect I knew in which that happens.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A few years ago, it was reported that there was evidence that our sun somehow affected radioactive decay rates.<br />

<p>More recently, it was disproven: <a href="https://phys.org/news/2014-10-textbook-knowledge-reconfirmed-radioactive-substances.html" target="_blank">https://phys.org/news/2014-10-textbook-knowledge-reconfirmed-radioactive-substances.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time dilation has definitely an effect. For example: Without taking time dilation into account, atmospheric muons would (on average) not live long enough to reach the ground with a velocity of 0.99c. But one observes muons with such velocities in detectors on the ground. If one considers time dilations in the calculation, the amount of measured muons is consistent again. This is one of the classical (1940s) experiments which supports special relativity. </p>
<p>Muon decay and atomic decay work essentially on the same principle. Therefore this argument applies to both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also awnser to /u/holdmynuutz kinda</p>
<p>Time diliation caused by both gravity and movement does slow down decay from the point of view of an outside observer. Remember that from the reference frame of the atom, it decays normally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually thats one of the ways time dilation was proven experimentally.  Radioactive materials were put in particle accelerators and had noticable slower decay rates, matching predictions precisely.</p></div>		</li>
