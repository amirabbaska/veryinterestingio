<p>Many companies in America make money by buying up debt for cheaper than the debt is actually worth</p>

<p>But then if they pay less than what the loan is worth, doesn't the bank (let's a bank gave out the initial loan) go in a loss? Is he supposed to share some of the debt collect with the bank?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's a loss, but it's not as much of a loss as it would be trying to collect the debts themselves and not getting anything in return because the debtors are unwilling or unable to pay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh. Ok. But then if the person is unable to pay anything, how do the debt collectors make money?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you bought 40 bushels of apples to sell at market, you found out 1 bushel was rotten and you couldn't sell it at market, but someone offered to buy it from you at 1/10th price to feed to their pigs.  You took a loss on that barrel being rotten, not on selling it to someone.</p>
<p>The debt he bought is 'bad' debt, basically debts that the banks never expect to be payed back on for whatever reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He paid 0.4 cents on the dollar for this debt. That is insane, pretty much giving it away.  I've done this in the past and at best paid 30-50% of what I owed total.  Not 0.004%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't get how he paid so little for this.  That really is an extremely low price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the risk of that particular debt. If the debt is $5k for a person that has been unemployed for the last 3 years and has no potential income in sight, they're probably not going to collect ANYthing for it, so they'll sell it for 5%. Sending your own lawyers after it is going to end up costing you more than any profit you'd make on that $5k anyway.</p>
<p>Take another person who owes the same amount, but makes $80k / year? The odds of that recovery are much, much higher. The contingency rate on that one would be 40-50% possibly.</p>
<p>My assumption is that Oliver bought a bundle of debt that matches the profile of the first example I gave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is debt that creditors have completely written off as debt they were never going to recoup because the debtors probably have no means to pay it.  That's why it's so cheap.  There are various levels of debt and the more likely you are to collect, the higher percentage it commands.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The debts he bought were out of statute, iirc.  So he couldn't have ever sued the debtors for the money, he could only ever have nagged them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this could only happen once since it seems unlikely that the hospitals would sell the rights to that company again. Or I guess they may not care since that's what they're selling the debt for anyway? Still requires someone dropping the 60k in the first place. Course if the company just changed their collective debt from 15mil to 60k it could be sustainable possibly.</p></div>		</li>
