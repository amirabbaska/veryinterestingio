			<div class="markdown"><p>There is almost no possible way we could push the earth off its orbit away from the sun and keep a stable orbit. Also that would put us  us through an astriod belt that'd for sure spell our destruction. </p>
<p>I can't answer your question though, So I'd be interested in that figure. It'll be billions of years though, maybe more. The planet won't be around that long though anyways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true.  In fact, there used to be some speculation that the sun growing might be enough to push the Earth out to a farther orbit.  Life would still get fried, but at least the Earth would still be there.  No idea what the current thought on this is though.  The question seems to have only been if the increased drag caused by an expanding sun would offset the gravitational push. </p>
<p>Obviously this kind of engineering task is beyond us right now, but I assume a Type 1 Civilization would probably be able to do it.  One way would be to use asteroids to give small gravitational kicks.  It would take a <em>ton</em> of these kicks, but there are more than enough asteroids and more than enough time.  That would have the added benefit of clearing out the asteroid belt as well :)</p>
<p>Although, any civilization that is capable of doing anything of this nature will be able to easily handle the asteroids as well, regardless of whether we use them for gravitational kicks or not.  Another thing worth noting is that it's not as if asteroids are all bunched together like in Star Wars, in case that is what you are envisioning.  They still present a challenge, but not as great of one as you might think.</p>
<p>Assuming that we aren't using asteroids for gravitational kicks and we aren't mining them to the point of non-existence at that point, I suppose we could get enough of them together to create a kind of shepherd dwarf planet.  Again, beyond us right now, but we're talking about a civilization that has successfully moved a planet out to the belt.  Then we use that shepherd dwarf planet to clear out the belt.  We have billions of years to get on this.  When we are done, maybe we then use this dwarf planet as a kind of moon, or we just kick it on out of the system.  </p>
<p>Edit: I was considering the problem a bit deeper.  We might possibly start to run into gravitational interference from Mars and/or Jupiter if we got out far enough.  I don't see this as a showstopper, but it would complicate things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't see moving earth being our response though. I bet we just build spacecraft and fly away. </p>
<p>I've played games where you are supposed to balance a solar system and even cheating on them and entering in parameters it was still almost impossible to make a balanced system. </p></div>		</li>
