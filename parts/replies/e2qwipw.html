			<div class="markdown"><p>We use spectra! Specifically, we look at the far violet side of the visible spectrum (about 393 and 396 nm). At these wavelengths, there are absorption lines in the spectra caused by singly ionized calcium (Ca II), which is super useful because Ca II shines brightly in magnetically active regions of stars!</p>
<p>On this graph (<a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/spectrohelio/images/Ca-K.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.astrosurf.com/spectrohelio/images/Ca-K.jpg</a>), it's zoomed in so that we're looking just at the 393 nm absorption line. the black line on the bottom is spectra taken of sun at a quiet region (no magnetic activity), and the red was taken at the same time, but it was pointed at a facula (a magnetically active region). At the very center of the absorption line, it's obvious that something is emitting a lot of Ca II, so basically we use Ca II emission as a proxy for magnetic activity!</p>
<p>When we look at far away stars, though, we can't just zoom in on magnetically active regions, we have to look at the full star. This (<a href="https://imgur.com/a/xJEUhmT" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/xJEUhmT</a>) is the 393 nm absorption line again but this time, we're looking at the whole sun and the bottom spectra was taken during solar minimum, while the top was taken at solar maximum. You can see the difference in the absorption line isn't as dramatic, but this is much more accurate to the kind of spectra that I work with (although I would KILL for spectra with such a high signal to noise lol).</p>
<p>Basically we just watch to see how the Ca II emission for these stars are varying over time and use that to look for periods similar the 11 year cycle (or 22 year if you're a stickler).</p>
<p>Hope this answered you're question and wasn't too long! I just get very excited talking about my research :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to observe the magnetic field of other stars (not our sun) we usually use either the splitting of absorption lines due to the zeeman effect or we use the polarization of absorption lines due to the zeeman effect. </p>
<p>With a good photo spectropolarimeter you can determine the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field. Combining this with the rotation of the star (if the stellar rotation is sufficiently fast for this) you can actually map the entire stellar magnetosphere. </p>
<p>Using the zeeman splitting of spectral lines you can determine the mean radial component of the surface magnetic field. </p>
<p>However both of these techniques require very high quality data and only recent advances in technology have allowed us to make more of these measurements. In a few years we should be able to have more reliable and faster measurements of stellar magnetic fields. Furthermore it should be noted that both of these methods require quite a bit of modeling and fitting parameters so that a lot of errors are still possible. Also it is important to know that both methods are sensitive to different parts of the magnetic field, so they can both only give small views into the magnetic field and the true magnetic field might look different. But it is impossible for us to directly observe any of this for now. So until we can start to spatially resolve stars (which will take a long time still), this is all we got. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I am not aware of any &quot;easy to read&quot; article about this stuff. But if you really want to know more about it, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.1938.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> there is a review paper that explains most of the techniques. But it is a pretty tough read. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I’m not an expert in that exactly but I think a few months for both poles to completely flip. I think the northern and southern poles can switch polarities at different rates, so while the polarities are switching I believe the sun isn’t a true dipole (there’s no mag field coming in one pole and out the other). </p>
<p>This (<a href="https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/images/magbfly.jpg" target="_blank">https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/images/magbfly.jpg</a>) is a magnetic polarity butterfly diagram (blue and yellow being opposite polarity) and you can see that the north and South Pole don’t always flip at the same time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure of this regarding the sun since my research focuses on far away sun-like Stars, but I can say that there seems to be a LOT of ~2 year periods present in these solar analogs.</p>
<p>Regarding how this affects life on earth, solar activity in the form of flares or CMEs certainly can affect us. Magnetic storms can interrupt GPS navigation which affects people from airline pilots to farmers. Animals that can detect the earths mag field are also affected, like birds. So as far as I know the solar cycle doesn’t /directly/ impact life on earth, but at solar maximum there’s a higher probability of geomagnetic storms, which in turn do affect us. </p></div>		</li>
