			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most satisfying answer to me. 1 is the identity element of multiplication, hence why it is considered the &quot;base case&quot;, so to speak.</p>
<p>In computing factorials, you do not multiply by all lower natural numbers including zero, that would be silly. Then 3! would equal 3<em>2</em>1*0, which is, of course, zero. And so would every factorial. So think of it less as 0! means &quot;Starting with zero&quot;, and more like &quot;n! = the product of all natural numbers between 1 and n&quot;, and thus, 0! equalling the identity element becomes more apparent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>1 is what you get when you have no numbers to multiply. 0 is what you get when you have no numbers to add.</p>

<p>This.</p>
<p>To use the technical terms: 0 is the <em>additive identity</em>. Add 0 to something keeps it the same. If you <em>add up zero things</em>, you'll always have zero.</p>
<p>In the same way, 1 is the <em>multiplicative identity</em>. Multiply 1 with anything keeps it the same. If you <em>multiply out zero things</em>, you'll have one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the empty product. I think it helps to multiply with another 1 to make the point, like 4! = 1*1*2*3*4. Decreasing, you end up with 1! = 1*1 and indeed 0! = 1. You can also divide like 3! = 4! / 4 and indeed 0! = 1! / 1 = 1. It's not nothing that you end up with. You may have lost all the terms but it's still a <em>product</em> that has no terms.</p></div>		</li>
