They wanted to address the problem of customer complaints of broken, greasy, and stale chips in the industry and came up with the shape while using dough so they could stack them. That way they wouldn't be broken and the shape actually makes them more crispy. The dough helped keep them from being greasy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a company that designs and manufactures potato chip fryers and finished product conveyors, don't believe there are any aerodynamics taken into consideration for us (we have a large market share of the industry). Typically we are moving large quantities of product, multiple layers deep and the biggest concern is product breakage so high speed is not preferable to high volume (cross sectional area). Speeds in the ~20 ft/min I want to say?</p>
<p>Pringles and the lays equivalent are potato doughs that are sheeted, cut, and run through the fryer inside a mold that causes its distinct shape</p></div>		</li>
