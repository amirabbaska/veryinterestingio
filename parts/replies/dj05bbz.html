			<div class="markdown"><p>some dinosaurs did walk on two legs and even the ancestors of birds were able to support their weight on two legs for long periods of time, but they do not use their legs as their main mobile unit. Even so, we are not descended from these semi-bipedal animals. Mammalian ancestors were all quadrupedal and used 4 legs to get around. So yes OPs comment is correct </p></div>		</li>
