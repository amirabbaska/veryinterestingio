			<div class="markdown"><p>One issue is that data transmitted over the internet is often kept as small as possible, which makes sense if you want to use your bandwidth efficiently but not if you want to disguise what you are transmitting.</p>
<p>In the postman analogy, it for example is the difference between the a big envelope of a company sending you your documents back and a small envelope that only contains a positive response letter. You don't have to open the envelopes to be able to tell which is which.</p>
<p>If you are security conscious you add padding so that all envelopes look the same wether their contents would fit in a small envelope or not and take care that envelopes are send back and forth regularly with the same timing no matter what. In the real world nobody has the postage for that sort of security and on the net nobody cares enough about encryption to waste bandwidth like that.</p>
<p>It could be done though.</p></div>		</li>
