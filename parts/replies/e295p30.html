			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, inherent to this is a field, which is the &quot;landscape&quot; that permeates everything regarding a force like gravity and electricity. </p>
<p>For something like gravity in this situation, height can serve as the field. For electricity, the relatively positive &quot;ground&quot; and the negative &quot;source&quot; create a field as soon (within the speed of light) as a electric potential is established. This takes into account all the stuff in between - air, obstacles, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow thank you for that, that was an awesome explanation. It just makes me wonder... in the case of say an audio signal. Wouldnt each branch of electricity be its own copy of the audio signal? And if each branch has its own resistance doesnt that mean they arrive at the end at slightly different times? And wouldnt that make the speaker wind up playing a big mess of slightly different signals? </p>
<p>Edit: I thought some more about it. Does each path have its own voltage? And would the way to handle the problem I asked be just to make it so the speaker only plays if it recieves a voltage over a certain limit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In typical cables signals travel at around 70% of the speed of light: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_factor#Typical_velocity_factors" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_factor#Typical_velocity_factors</a></p>
<p>Typical digital sound exists at 44.1 kilohertz, or one amplitude sample every 22.7 microseconds, so to get a one-sample offset one path would have to travel a distance of around <del>4700 kilometers</del> 4700 meters longer than the other path. You can imagine that the resistance along that path would inevitably be rather large compared to the shorter path.</p>
<p>Edit: Fixed brainfart with units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation. The 4700km figure is off by 1,000 though; 4.7km is what you want. Your point still stands though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If not, it's just neat to watch, then.</p>
