			<div class="markdown"><p>You used the word &quot;vulgar&quot;, which by it's own evolution shows how words can become undesirable. When we say vulgar, we generally mean obscene, but the word comes from the Latin vulgus, meaning &quot;common people&quot;. So vulgar things were the things that the common people did, and therefore the aristocracy wanted to find a way to set themselves apart. </p>
<p>Brandon Sanderson wrote a very interesting character, Wayne, in his second Mistborn series. Some of the lines he wrote for Wayne illustrate this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wayne walked into the governor’s fancy washroom. Only in his head it wasn’t the washroom. He just knew to call it that here.</p>
<p>You see, Wayne had figured out the code.</p>
<p>Rich folks, they had this code. All of them knew it, and they used it like a new language to weed out everyone who didn’t belong.</p>
<p>Regular folk, they called something after what it was.</p>
<p>You’d say, “What’s that, Kell?”</p>
<p>And they’d say, “That? That there’s the crapper.”</p>
<p>And you’d reply, “What do you do with it?”</p>
<p>And they’d say, “Well, Wayne, that’s where you put your crap.”</p>
<p>It made sense. But rich folk, they had a different word for the crapper. They’d call it a “commode” or a “washroom.” That way, when someone asked for the crapper, they knew it was a person they needed to oppress.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, anything can be turned into a swear word, it's all in the context.  If everyone started saying the word &quot;dude&quot; with the same tone one would say &quot;asshole&quot; then dude would start to become a swear word.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop being such a <em>dude</em>.&quot;  &quot;Did you see that <em>dude</em> last night?&quot;  &quot;Get away <em>dude</em>.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
