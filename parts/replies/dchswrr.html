			<div class="markdown"><p>I started thinking that, and now I believe that free will does not exist, because all of our actions are a result of nothing more than the combination of our environmental influences and our genetic programming. I've also come to believe that all of our actions are pre-determined, because they are just the eventuation of a previous state of the universe, beginning from the Big Bang. Everything that has happened did so because it had to - there was no other way. Therefore the future is already written, and was written at the birth of the universe. It just hasn't ... come to pass yet.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to feel about this conclusion that I've arrived at. Most people I discuss it with seem to find it depressing.</p>
<p>The belief is termed &quot;determinism&quot; in philosophy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that while everything is programmed through a mix of genetics and your environment (I don't want to get into a nature vs nurture debate though). We do have some choices. People can and have got themselves out of anger issues and depression and other emotional imbalances. Others have managed to do great things despite situations that most people would give up in.</p>
<p>I think most people are just reactive and aren't really in control of themselves but at the same time while it is hardwork we can get at least some control over ourselves and how we see the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand a bit... </p>
<p>Psychologists are still debating whether or not all facial expressions are universal at all. </p>
<p>And disgust is one facial expression which may illustrate the cultural contributions to facial expressions because it's an expression unique to humans and has acquired culturally specific meaning - people often describe things they find morally reprehensible as 'disgusting'. </p>
<p>I've always read about the adaptive function of the disgust expression in terms of pathogen avoidance. The nose crinkles up and the head shifts backwards to close off the nasal passages and prevent ingestion or inhalation of infectious things. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that what you meant by your last point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a therapeutic level--yes, the concepts are related. Zajonc wasn't necessarily looking at an application for what he studied. Psychology kind of has two schools. One is from a neurological standpoint (cranial nerves, lobes, neurons, neurotransmitters). The other is from a cognitive standpoint.</p>
<p>There are certainly some people who believe in absolutes. Chomsky is a pure nativist who thinks that we are born with everything we will EVER know, already in our head--waiting to be unlocked--every word, every song, every knock-knock joke. The opposite is the Blank Slate theory--which is that we are born with absolutely nothing! Whatever their focus , most modern psychologists agree with the biopsychosocial approach, which is that there is a biological element to happiness, a psychological element to happiness and a social influence on the two.</p>
<p>CBT or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a talk therapy that can use mindfulness strategies like forcing yourself to smile. Yes, it works. In fact, most insurance companies will ONLY pay for CBT (versus a psychodynamic approach) because it is measurable, time-bound and statistically much more likely to be effective.
The problem (as I see it) in a pure CBT approach, is that it doesn't care a fig (by design) for the fact that your husband is cheating on you, or that you were molested when you were a kid--it just wants to fix the sad thoughts by behavioral intervention.
So if you do see a result--the underlying problems are left untouched (but would be central to a Freudian approach).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I read an interesting Guardian article from a CBT practitioner who described a client who tried to commit suicide after having CBT. She hadn't told the therapist that the reason she was angry was because her husband was beating her (perhaps she separated the two in her mind and genuinely didn't know why she was angry - I do that, so I assume it's a common defense mechanism; or perhaps she was protecting him) so the therapist just helped her reduce the &quot;irrational&quot; anger. The article was pretty balanced rather than pro/anti-CBT but did point out that because there isn't much probing as to <em>why</em> a person is feeling the way they do, pure-CBT therapists can miss stuff like this should the patient themselves claim their emotions are irrational or unnecessary. I haven't had proper CBT personally, but my own experience is that therapists don't tend to stick to one theory absolutely and draw from many sources to fit their client, so hopefully there aren't many people out there that are so purist they would miss these things.</p>
<p>But it was a good criticism of CBT, I thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never read any psychology authors, but I always thought the relationship between &quot;mind state&quot; and &quot;face expression&quot; to be a two-way street based on the mirror neuron mechanism:</p>
<p>If a certain mind state induces a certain face expression, consciously producing that same face expression will cause a recognition of the expression and induce some of the same mind state that would have induced the face expression on its own.</p>
<p>Also to convincingly reproduce a face expression, since it is linked to a mind state, there needs to be a conscious effort to partially induce the same mind state in order to &quot;fake it&quot;... which actually makes part of the mind state to become the one that causes the expression, and over time with repetitions can cause the whole mind state to be closer to the one that produces the expression.</p>
<p>Does this make sense?</p></div>		</li>
