			<div class="markdown"><p>Intermittent fasting is NOT limiting your calories.  It's simply limiting when you eat.  </p>
<p>So I do a 16/8 cycle (which is pretty common).  I only eat 8 hours of the day, between 12:00 Noon and 8:00 PM.    </p>
<p>For me this was just a measure of control, to limit night-time snacking.   It was tough at first, not eating in the morning, but once your body adjusts (and it can adjust to almost anything - there are many very happy 23-1 Intermittent Fasters) to your new routine, you'll be hard-pressed to remember doing it any other way.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow, I didn't even realise I was doing this! I usually stop eating at 10pm and don't eat til 2pm or later... And went from 220lbs to 160 in about a year just by cutting out snacks and fast food. I never considered how much of an impact WHEN I was eating would have!
Thanks for the explanation! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Benefits are in many ways similar to keto in the lack of blood sugar spikes which prevents insulin resistance, and it reduces inflammation simply due to the fact that eating causes inflammation, so if you eat during set time periods, you'll have less inflammatory periods. People on keto and IF diets tend to show better biomarkers for long-term health, and experiments on mice show lifespan increases. I'm still learning about it so I don't have sources handy, sorry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been interested in I.f. for a awhile. I heard that if you have coffee in the morning it actually breaks your fast. Is this true? Would it still count if I had a cup of coffee before noon if that was when I planned on breaking the fast for the day?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is NOT true, in my opinion.  Lots of people in IF have lots of opinions.  Some people like to push their opinions as the &quot;one true way&quot;, but that's simply not my way.   </p>
<p>I definitely drink coffee, and I have no problem with people who do.  The /r/intermittentfasting people (a subreddit I no longer belong to) might claim differently though.  :)  </p>
<p>For me, it's just a measure of control, not a science.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I practice a lifestyle slash nutrition pattern called the warrior diet. It's a book written by Ori Hofmekler, worth a read. It's based off intermittent fasting, but this takes it a bit further into only eating once a day, dinner. I absolutely believe in drinking black coffee during a fast. It is a useful appetite suppressor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, coffee doesn't break your fast as long as it is black. Don't put anything in it and you'll be good to go.</p></div>		</li>
