			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t forget that molecules are constantly bouncing around, in and out of every random corner and substrate. If a particular molecule “likes” to bind to a particular substrate, the more likely it is to bind and stay there. But it doesn’t mean it stays there forever. Things like binding affinity, concentration, competitive binding and temperature can also affect how molecules bind, but it’s important to remember that at the molecular level, it appears as a massive random jumble of molecules causing cascades of redactions that facilitate life.</p>
<p>In other words, the higher the concentration of antagonists you have, the less likely (and thus less efficacious) agonists will be able to bind to the same substrate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes yes, I don’t know why when I initially read the post I thought the binding was sustained. Forgetting that yes, the are in constant binding/unbinding, allowing the inhibitor to take place. </p>
<p>Thanks for the explanation though! </p></div>		</li>
