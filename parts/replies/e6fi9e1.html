<p>If it were an atomic-scale side-effect, the effect would <strong>vary</strong> from one measuring device to another. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And we did measure this with a large variety of clocks and clock-like processes.</p>

<p>I'd like to echo some of the other comments and ask if you could you post some sources, please? Presumably the OP is looking for pointers to the respective experiments / results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is so basic that it is just taken into account today. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_redshift#Experimental_verification" target="_blank">Wikipedia lists a couple of explicit tests</a>. Redshift of various stars (absorption by many different elements), Pound–Rebka experiment (emission/absorption of x-rays), hydrogen masers, various atomic clocks including optical clocks, ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say you have 2 clocks, one orbiting the earth and one on the surface.  The  one on the surface will experience more gravity and because electrons have mass the orbit of the electrons in the atomic clock  will be slightly displaced by the gravity as compared to the one experiencing less gravity  in orbit.  Is this effect completely swamped by the more powerful nuclear force acting on the electrons so that it is impossible to measure or is it accounted for?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the binding forces inside atoms overwhelmingly swamp out gravitational effects. A common comparison is done for the attraction between an electron and a proton. Doing it quickly at ~1 femtometer, I get the electrostatic attraction at ≈3×10^(4) N and the gravitational attraction at ≈1×10^(-37) N. So gravity is around a factor of ≈3×10^(-42) weaker than electrostatic attraction. Even considering entire Earth's gravitational attraction, the ratio of that to the electrostatic attraction is ≈3×10^(-34). This is why gravity is so negligible at small scales.</p>
<p>We can also see that the properties of atoms in higher gravity environments - like the Sun - behave in exactly the same way as they do here on Earth.</p>
<p>With regards to Special Relativity, you can detect time dilation occurring in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_testing_of_time_dilation#Atmospheric_tests" target="_blank">Cosmic Muons</a>, which are fundamental particles as far as we can tell.</p>
<p>For General Relativity, we see other predicted effects like frame-dragging (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_B#Experimental_setup" target="_blank">Gravity Probe B</a>).</p>
<p>Edit: Just to clarify; atoms do behave differently under differing gravitational fields. This effect, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_redshift#Experimental_verification" target="_blank">gravitational redshift</a> is one of the tests of General Relativity. However, if you subtract this effect you see the same behaviour as in a lab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, if you have a clock on Earth, and a clock in low orbit, the clock in low orbit will run slower, despite the fact that earth's gravity well is slowing the clock on Earth more.  Puzzle that one out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is completely negligible. In addition the most precise clocks today use atoms in free fall - not because gravity would matter but because this allows measurements of ultra cold atoms with less Doppler effect.</p></div>		</li>
