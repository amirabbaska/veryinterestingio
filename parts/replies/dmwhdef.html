			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly in the post-fission kinetic energy of the fission fragments of uranium. You get about 200 MeV of thermal energy from each fission event. Most of that comes from the fission fragments being slowed down in the fuel/surrounding material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So from an earlier reply neutron-induced fission creates fragments(decay) that produces heat through kinetic energy from hitting surrounding material. Is that about right? Or am I missing something still? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: both</p>
<p>In most countries nuclear reactors are regulated such that no more than ~7% of their operating power can come from the decay of fission products (because you can't turn those off). Cores start at near 100% coming from fission, and drop to ~93% power directly from fission over the course of its life.</p>
<p>That's one of the limits on how big/long you can run a reactor on a single fuel load: you always have to be able to shut the rector down to a manageable power level. And as you build up fission products over the life of the core there becomes a minimum power which you can &quot;turn off&quot; to.</p>
<p>The fission process from the perspective of energy is:</p>
<ol>
<li>U-235 absorbs a neutron and becomes an excited U-236</li>
<li>80% of the time the excited U-236 fissions almost immediately  producing fission products, (prompt) neutrons, and energy. The rest becomes U-236 which is a long lived waste product.</li>
<li>The fission products are often unstable and later decay, releasing more energy, some can be fairly long lived. Some of the fission products also release neutrons during their decay (&quot;delayed neutrons&quot;). Often multiple decays will occur for each fission product.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to recall something in a documentary about a particular type of nuclear reactor that's able to recycle its waste down to nearly zero reactivity but I can't remember why the design isn't currently being investigated or expanded upon. I think it's in that &quot;Pandora's Promise&quot; doc. Does this idea hold merit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you're referring to LFTR (Liquid Flouride-Thorium Reactor) which is a type of molten-salt reactor. It theoretically can operate using existing nuclear waste as starter-fuel, but there are a lot of potential practical pitfalls. Salts are corrosive and chemically-unfriendly substances to begin with, making it molten means you need both chemically-inert and extremely-high-temp-resistant materials to contain it, and adding radioactivity into the mix means that the reactor system components need to be made out of a <a href="http://haynesintl.com/docs/default-source/pdfs/new-alloy-brochures/corrosion-resistant-alloys/brochures/n-brochure.pdf?sfvrsn=6" target="_blank">very specific and very expensive alloy</a>.</p>
<p>It's a definite possibility, and I'm pretty certain there is active research into the design - molten salt reactors were some of the first designs for energy production researched and built at <del>Los Alamos</del> Oak Ridge, but whether or not LFTRs can be built economically and in a way that produces more energy than they consume has yet to be demonstrated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But would that cost not be negligible when you consider the long term costs of a plant? Or is the power industry really that adverse to start up costs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pandora's promise featured a big section about the EBR-II, which was an experimental breeder reactor in Idaho. They had the guy in it reminiscing on how he had a working example of a passively-safe reactor and he was really sad that we didn't embrace it. That was a solid metal-fueled liquid sodium cooled fast neutron reactor (not a molten salt reactor like the LFTR).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The breeder? Yeah, it holds a lot of promise. In my opinion (and in the opinions of many nuclear engineers), it's the necessary next step in nuclear power. The fact that we haven't started it by now is seen by some as a travesty.</p></div>		</li>
