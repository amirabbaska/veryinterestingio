Give the capacitance of Earth as ~0.0007 F.</p></div>		</li>

<p>700uf sounds way small for a capacitor with a plate area of 200 million square miles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Talking about a potential or electrical insulation between celestial bodies doesn't entirely make that much sense because of the enormous amount of space in between them. </p>
<p>To answer your question of insulation... Insulation prevents electrons from moving across an electrical potential, which is something that perfect vacuums are pretty good at, since they have no charge carriers (electrons, positrons, protons, or ions). Space is not a perfect vacuum, but it's close enough that a voltage between the moon and earth is not going to cause a spontaneous discharge. The conductance of low pressure gas is governed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law" target="_blank">Paschen's Law</a></p>
<p>When people talk about moving charges in space, they're mostly talking about solar wind - a bunch of charged plasma goop flying off of the sun at crazy fast speeds. Those charges aren't accelerating across a voltage potential. They're merely moving at the speed that the sun imparted to them. What makes space different from other insulators is that particles can travel enormous distances in it without being obstructed, while materials like plastic have a good amount of stuff in the way that a rogue electron wouldn't make it too far before lodging itself in the material as static electricity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitpick to your nitpick: No, you certainly can have a difference in voltage between 2 points (or as marmz1 clarified - a difference in potential difference). There is no reason the word difference cant apply to a quantity that is already a difference. In the case of an implied common ground, which is usually assumed in conversation, giving (v1 - vg) - (v2 - vg), or v1 - v2, which makes it still correct to say a difference in voltage between 2 points.  Now if there wasnt a common ground, it might not make sense to say only between 2 points.</p>
<p>Just like when i say the velocity of my car is 5mph, this is relative, and the implied reference is Earth.  So this could be phrased as a question of the difference in velocity between my car and the Earth.  I can then still ask the question - What is the difference in velocity between my car and your car, which is a difference of differences and with the same implied reference works out to just the difference of the 2 vehicles.</p>
<p>Sure, in the OPs question, it would have to mean (vspace - vearth) - (vearth - vearth), which means its an inefficient way of saying: What is the voltage between space and Earth, but it isnt incorrect, as long as his implied common reference was vearth, which again is usually the case in conversation.</p></div>		</li>
