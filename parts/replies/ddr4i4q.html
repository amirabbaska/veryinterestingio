<p>A recent example would be Seattle where the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement tunnel caused sinkholes to open in the city</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sinkholes have been fairly minor in the grand scheme of things. The real problem that vexed that project was a TBM that failed (due to poor design or encountering unforeseen subsurface conditions depending on who you ask) and was out of commission for well over a year. Now, in all fairness the TBM in question was the largest diameter machine ever built up to that point. Watching how that was repaired was actually very cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you're right. But at the same time Sound Transit completed a load of small bore subway tunnels under Seattle. </p>
<p>Large bore of course does present more problems, not only from a geology point of view but also the design of the machine (cube square law). </p></div>		</li>

<p>The main issue is cost control. In the US you're looking at $200-1000 million a km! (Yes, a million dollars a meter). Spain on the other hand has managed to build subway systems well below $50 million/km. This is mostly a management/legal problem. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>could you elaborate more on the pricing issue?
what are the legal problems that cost 150-950 usd per km?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com is my favourite blog on this.</p>
<p>In the US it comes down to a mix of poor project management whoch is forced by a bad legal climate.</p>
<p>Both the US and UK have case law which increases legal costs and setbacks considerably. The US has Buy Americs rules which restricts access to working off the shelf solution from other countries. </p>
<p>Stations and tunnels tend to be overdesigned resulting in huge expense. There's also a massive bias towards concrete over upgraded signalling or improved operations. Eg adding platforms at significant expense when existing ones are wasted by long turn around times.</p>
<p>Legally transit agencies in the US have to be very paranoid with their contractors as courts tend to favour the latter. The result is very tight contracts with no wiggle room. That means even good contractors can't work well.</p>
<p>I'm just summarising, the blog has more details.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These kinds of infrastructure will be around for hundreds of years, too.  Just look at New York's underground tunnel systems.  Planning that far into the future requires a certain amount of over engineering.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you give me a reference to &quot;a meter of subway tunnel costing a million dollars&quot;?</p></div>		</li>
