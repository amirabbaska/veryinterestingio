			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with this %100
I personally work for four different auto brands currently. The avg &quot;front end profit&quot; is -600 to -800 depending on the brand. Avg &quot;back end&quot; or Finance profit is 700-900. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The global market strongly disagrees with you.
Also it is worth noting ford of the us only produce the luxury cars, commercial vehicles and car parts. Most cars such as the focus and fiesta are under subsidiary, such as ford of Europe which is entirely designed and manufactured in europe.
Im sure there are good American cars bit they are very much in the minority.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious about this as I've heard it's easier to haggle new car prices as opposed to used since dealers have to compete and you can buy the same new car at any dealer </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's how you buy on sale. No not every dealer will actually sell you their sale price cars. But in every Market there is one or two that dominate everything and they will sell you their sale price cars gladly. </p>
<p>So what you found a car you like just keep looking for it on sale and then contact a senior sales person somebody who's sold cars for a while and has really good online reviews. And don't discount them if they have a negative review everybody gets negative reviews because people make some major mistakes when they buy a car and they take it out on us on the internet. So call them up and say I want to buy the ad unit I promise to come in not on a busy Saturday but like Thursday night I will take a photograph and give you an online review or anything else that you need I promise to finance in house as long as you match or beat the rate I bring and it will be smooth sailing from there. Now that guy is only going to make 79 to 150 bucks selling you that car. But the pay structure is designed based on the number of units you sell. From 1 to 12 cars might be 20% 13 and 19 might be 25% and above 20 might be 30% of any of the deals that are profitable that you bring in. I have had months where I sold 13 cars and made less than minimum wage because I am taxed at a higher rate as a semi independent contractor b*<strong>**</strong> that they pull. I literally have worked 200 hours a month and made less than minimum wage.</p>
<p>I've made as low as $39 selling a brand new 60 k truck on sale, sinceIit took 2 people to sell the car. And there's no loyalty from customers anymore. They'll come in ask a bunch of questions say okay when do you work next Sunday alright I'll come in on Sunday then they'll come in the very next day instead when I'm off work and buy the car and never even mention my name.</p>
<p>A mini is any deal that is a negative deal, which is the majority of new car sales. So I'll sell 15 cars but there might be only one of them that was probable...but it was $2,000 profitable and I got 25% of it,  because I sold 15 instead of 14, where I was getting 20% of any positive deals.  So even for us our pay structure is somewhat artificial.</p>
<p>As I told my boss when I quit: you're supposed to screw the customers, not your employees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can usually haggle them on extras very easily for both, but actual price can be pretty hard. For used the biggest way you can change the price is to get them to drop any extra stuff they have to give you compared to an individual selling you one, things like warranty etc.</p></div>		</li>
