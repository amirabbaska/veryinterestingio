			<div class="markdown"><p>I am obsessed with understanding how domestication shapes psychology so I love your question.  What we know is that domestication is a result of selection, ie. being raised from birth, or tamed, is different from domestication, which is result of selection on genetics that leads to behavioral, and physical changes that takes place over generations. Domesticated animals carry the genes of domestication with them generation to generation. Dimitry Belyaev's work was the most powerful demonstration of this but even Darwin used domestication of dogs and other animals as a critical example of how evolution occurs through selection (artificial or natural).  If you mean how have feral dogs (domesticated but not socialized) changed from pet dogs (domesticated and socialized), then not very much. But if you mean have dogs changed from wolves, the answer is yes. Wolves don't seem to be able to read our gestures as well as dogs, or as flexibly as dogs, so there is at least one difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this a matter that they can't read them, or they are unwilling to cooperate/don't care enough about our gestures? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading once about a study involving dogs and wolves. The dogs had a better &quot;social&quot; intelligence than the wolves. The wolves were more likely to try to solve a problem ( I think, for the study, it was caged food.) on their own, whereas the dogs were much quicker to realize this was a problem for the humans to help with, and would subsequently appeal to them for aid. Whether seeking help from a known source or critically thinking through the problem on one's own is more intelligent than the other is it's own debate entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question b/c this IS the question.  It is likely a difference that occurs very early in development.  It is likely motivational.  Dogs raised with humans are attracted and want to interact with us.  Even the youngest wolves we have worked with who have been raised by people much prefer to be with other wolves - no people. This likely then plays out in all of their future interactions with people.  Dogs attend to humans and use our social information while wolves do not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to latch on to this response, but I was wondering if you could expand a bit on the section which mentions that wolves cannot read human gestures as well as domesticated dogs. The question I have is to the degree in which evolution has affected behaviours in dogs psychologically, specifically in regards to innate behaviours and learned behaviours. Does the ability to read gestures better indicate that dogs have evolved to display certain behaviours (i.e. gesture recognition) pertaining to human social interaction innately rather than through learning mechanisms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an awesome study where someone did just that! They raised a wolf and dog from birth at the same time, in the same home. After the wolf reached a certain age, it started ignoring the human's commands and became aggressive and destructive, while the dog turned into a normal dog. The animals were raised exactly the same and the wolf stayed pretty feral. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  dogs have evolved to live with humans and wolves have not. Domestication is a genetic process that has altered dogs so they are prepared to live with humans.  Having spent time with even young wolves the idea of hybridizing a dog and wolf doesn't make sense to me in the current context in which dogs tend to live in suburban and urban environments.  The strong prediction is these hybrids will suffer from higher stress and will be more likely to injure folks.  I do not know that there is a systematic study but there needs to be!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. Few have the insane land(50+ sq acres) in the rural environment (where they can safely roam for a day+) to give them the activity they need to not go nuts and cause someone harm. People can only foster a wolf/wolf-dog, you never own one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this suggest that physiologically, domestication causes a peter pan effect, arresting normal mental development at some stage of childhood?  Do feral dogs ever progress irreversibly to an adult wolf personality?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called &quot;pedomorphism&quot; and it's definitely the case, at least partially. Domesticated dogs are similar to cub in many ways: their generally shortened muzzles, larger eyes, their playfulness and non-aggressiveness, their learning capabilities, their shortened legs. By the way, humans also show signs of pedomorphism compared to other apes. Most likely this is a cause of manual selection, selecting for lower aggression and higher learning capabilities happens to correlate with other infant traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting interpretation and I'd love to hear Dr. Hare's input on that! I don't necessarily think that dogs mental development stops after infancy. I think it might have to do more with dogs viewing humans as a social partner, whereas wolves tend to view us as something else entirely? Just my guess though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I think it was done in either Australia or Austria I can't remember. It was really interesting, the dog basically became the, how should I say &quot;sexual favorite&quot; of the pack and was raised to be basically a prostitute and whored out. Male wolves sometimes groups would come and actually do favors such as offer protection and bring food in exchange for sex. Super interesting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I'm aware of, but there may be. As others have pointed out, there is a difference between being tame (raised by humans from birth) and domestication (genetic changes from selective breeding). In that scenario, I would guess that the dog would become feral (fear and/or agrees ion towards human) but would still be a domesticated dog. So a dog owned by humans is both domesticated/tamed, while a dog raised by wolves is domesticated/feral. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I have read, (specifically relating to silver foxes) animals can be domesticated but it takes more than a single generation in order to dismiss or override the natural aggression or fears. </p>
<p>With the Russian Fox experiment performed by Dmitry K. Belyaev, the researchers would break the tiers of foxes into 3 groups, tame/excited and friendly toward to people, friendly toward people (as in they would allow humans to pet them), and aggressive. </p>
<p>After a few generations of breeding tame foxes with tame foxes, the foxes became more relaxed and eventually would whine for human attention and interaction. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! And the AMA OP, Brian Hare, did cognitive research on the Belyaev silver foxes early in his career, comparing their responses to the responses of dogs and great apes, so I'm sure he has some interesting points to contribute on this specifically!</p></div>		</li>
