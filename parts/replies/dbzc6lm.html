<p>A campfire emits both infrared and visible light, but what percent of the heat felt (some distance away) is a result of the visible light hitting your skin? If the fire was invisible for example, would I realistically be able to tell a difference from 5 feet away?</p>
<p>Second part: More than half of the energy emitted by the sun is in infrared. What if the human race became blind, would the difference in heat felt on our skin be noticeable different if the sun gave off no visible light? How much energy does the visible spectrum really impart?</p></div>		</li>

<p>A fire can emit all sorts of electromagnetic radiation, including some microwaves and x-rays.  Of course, it will depend on what you are burning.  Burning certain metals will result in a very bright colored flame, as much of the radiation will be in a narrow band of visible light.  For a wood campfire, it's going to be mostly in the infrared and radio spectrum.  I'm not sure what the exact spectrograph of wood is.  Most of the spectrographs we have (I.e. graphs that show what types of light a given object will emit when burned) are for individual elements and molecules.  This allows us to look at starlight at be reasonably sure what elements are burning in the star.</p>

<p>It depends on the size of the fire.  Look up ethanol fires.  They are invisible fires that burn very hot into the ultraviolet spectrum.</p>

<p>Yes, it would be noticable.  Google the spectrograph of the sun.  It emits light across the entire spectrum, including x-rays.  Luckily, our atmosphere block much of the higher energy radiation and most of what makes it to the surface is ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and radio waves.  Visible light and ultraviolet have more energy than infrared waves, so they can create more heat with fewer photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one critical property to making the silver-gray and not silver-white relationship is absorption. Silver absorbs about 5% of the light that hits it. While surface finish can change the ratio of specular to diffuse reflection (aka shiny vs matte), it cannot change the amount of light that doesn't get reflected. Things that look white absorb pretty much no light, while things that look black absorb pretty much all of the light that hits them. Gray things absorb some of the light them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That would be true if it wasn't for sub-surface scattering.  Roughing the surface of an object creates more surface area and decreases the thickness of the ridges and bumps on the surface.  The ridges and bumps on the material are more transparent and allow light to pass through them, scatter, and slow down.  Slowing down light is the same as absorbing energy from it.  More energy will be absorbed and less will be reflected.  You can test this by placing a matte object and a reflective object of the same material in the sun.  The matte object will get hotter because it's absorbing more energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll agree that my earlier statement wasn't perfectly precise, but you could have an atomically smooth monocrystal and it would still be absorbing light. Just look at a fresh silicon wafer. Any explanation of why many mirrored surfaces look like really shiny gray instead of really shiny white cannot simply be reduced to just specular vs diffuse reflection. It certainly plays a critical role, but it is a complete answer even at an ELI5 level.</p></div>		</li>
