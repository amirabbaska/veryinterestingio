<p>But we don't have have a well defined &quot;no atmosphere&quot; height, because that doesn't exist.</p>
<p>The atmosphere gets thinner the higher you go. Exponentially so. This continues forever, at the same rate. Eventually it doesn't make sense to talk about it as the earths atmosphere anymore, but there simply isn't a cutoff point. If we want a sufficiently thin atmosphere, we calculate the height this level is reached, and go there. </p>
<p>The space line marks a height where atmospheric flight is impossible above it, and vacuum optimized flight is a bad idea below it. It's a pretty useful line, but it's not a cutoff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you mean the karman line? Or this 100,000km line?</p>
<p>Edit: now I'm thinking you meant that one and the same, and meant 100,000 meters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere pretty much just smoothly decreases in density. There isn't really an &quot;end&quot; to it. The closest to an end would be what's called the Karman Line at 100 km altitude, which is technically considered the beginning of space, because an aircraft at that altitude would need to be travelling at orbital speeds just to maintain enough lift to stay airborne. There's still plenty enough air at that level for a true spacecraft to worry about though, so the ISS orbits several hundred km higher, and even then it has to reboost itself every so often anyway.</p></div>		</li>
