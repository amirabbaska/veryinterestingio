After getting used to a lot of alcohol, the neurons in your brain that detect GABA (a neurotransmitter) start processing the alcohol (or the chemical that's being detected because of the alcohol) faster than usual.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, you add something important to the current top response!  The most important &quot;tolerance&quot; we think about occurs in the brain.  But it doesn't quite work just like that.  Generally, central nervous system tolerance of a psychoactive substance works by long-term upregulation of a system that &quot;opposes&quot; the substance.</p>
<p>Among the brain's soup of neurotransmitters, two of them have general inhibitory and excitatory functions: GABA and glutamate, respectively.  This is simplistic, but the dominance of either one represents, if you will, the opposite poles of &quot;coma and seizure.&quot;  There are opposed processes all over the body (insulin and glucagon are another example) which are kept in balance by many kinds of feedback and regulatory mechanisms, and this is one of them.  Picture GABA and glutamate in a tug-of-war.  If one team wins, coma, if the other wins, seizure.  There are many ways to &quot;help&quot; either team: by adding a member, by making their grip on the ground or the rope stronger, or by reducing the grip of the opposing team.  But if either team wins all of the way, we're kind of in trouble, and we have to provide immediate assistance to the other.  If you're having a seizure, with electrical activity jumping all over the place, someone may stick a needle in you and give you something that dings the GABA system hard to quiet down all that brain activity (likely, a benzodiazapine).  If, on a consistent basis, we drastically help one team (like with alcohol addiction), the other one eventually learns to fight back.</p>
<p>So, alcohol increases the activity of the GABA system significantly.  It does some of that directly, and some of that indirectly, by inhibiting glutamate activity.  The brain tries to maintain homeostasis by (among other things) upregulating the glutamate system to compensate, so you don't die.  (If I recall, there are also changes which reduce the sensitivity of GABA receptors to alcohol, but I think that's responsible for a smaller proportion of tolerance; others may correct if needed).  This is why long-term alcoholics can survive levels of alcohol which would kill others: because their brain has built in long-term compensatory changes, many of which within the glutamate system.  There are many ways to upregulate neurotransmitter activity: by making more of it, adjusting receptor affinities, presenting more receptors on the synaptic membrane, reducing reuptake from the synapse, etc.  There's some review of glutamate-system receptor changes in alcohol tolerance here: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645546/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645546/</a></p>
<p>So, this is, by the way, why withdrawal is dangerous: the brain becomes highly activated in a way that can't be immediately switched off, and that gets constantly regulated by an exogenous depressant.  When you remove that depressant (i.e., cease alcohol intake all at once), the brain's high level of activation has nothing to tamp it down, and you can end up with a lethal seizure.  When I explain this to patients, I make a visual display where I press my hands palm to palm, pressing down hard with my left arm (alcohol) and up hard with my right one (compensatory, mostly glutamate-system changes), abruptly remove my left hand, letting my right one shoot up in the air.</p>
<p>This is why acute alcohol and benzodiazapine withdrawal (because they both hit the GABA system and produce long-term changes to compensate) are the most dangerous ones we have.  Both of them can require medical management for a few days to taper and give the brain enough time to adjust itself.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was very informative. I didn't know that the benzos given during alcohol withdrawal played such an important role in the process. I thought that making the person in wothdrawal feel better was their primary goal.</p>
<p>Is the imbalance between the GABA and the glutamate system also what causes the hangover in non alcoholic people?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very well explained, thank you. I've had a lot of issues with alcohol in my life, so I find this information to be fascinating. (And much easier to understand than the library books on neuroscience!) I've talked to a lot of doctors who have said alcohol and benzos are the only drugs that can kill you from the withdrawals alone. Librium is what they usually prescribe as it's a powerful and long acting benzo. It's also commonly used for pre surgery anxiety. Anyway, I'm hoping you can help explain GABAb as I've had the hardest time learning about it? GABAa is where benzos, alcohol and a few anticonvulsants work, but the b side seems to be more of a mystery where some muscle relaxers operate. I'm currently taking Baclofen to help with drinking and anxiety (and I'm pleasantly surprised with the results) but it operates on the b, and while I'm sure there's some connection I just can't seem to find the link that brings it all together. Do you know why a drug that affects b, would in turn be beneficial for a? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew a fair bit about all these details before your post but your analogies are really good. I'm a science teacher and I'm trying to collect interesting case studies of specific real world diseases or conditions that high school kids can connect to.  Your analogies are really helpful for students to think about no matter what type of brain-related neurotransmitter interaction stuff gets brought up.  Not to mention it dovetails nicely with discussing differences between people with different genes.</p>
<p>Thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is reversible.  Besides scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and the changes to the arrangement and methylation/demethylation of certain genes in your liver's DNA that happen over very long term induction of the production of certain proteins your body is pretty plastic and cells will change depending on current needs.  Also your liver cells aren't permanent, old ones die and are replaced by younger ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some changes happen in &lt;day (if you take away ethanol you aren't actively inducing the production of the enzymes for its metabolism anymore). Some take months to years (if you've conditioned your liver cells to secrete more of the enzymes mentioned over a long period of time your cells have a way of changing the way our DNA is accessible leaving the areas coding for specific genes either more or less accessible, and are a pretty permanent change compared to others).  Scarring of the liver, cirrhosis, is permanent, and unlike simple death of a few liver cells, do not get replaced by new healthy liver cells.  My area of expertise is the toxicology of snake venom so I don't know the mechanism behind cirrhosis off the top of my head though, but it is probably very well researched.</p></div>		</li>
