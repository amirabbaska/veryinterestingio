			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your interest. I can honestly say it was my priviledge to serve. A lot of young people want to serve, but are turned away because of standards they can't help. As a bonus nugget; when i puked during the little combat i saw it was unlike puking at home. It was like my body knew i needed to pay attention more than heave so the puke just bubbled up. Ever have a burp that brings up stomach bile? It was that without the burp. My body knew i needed to be alert, and every now and then i would notice my mouth was full of that bile. Spit it out, focus, and repeat. Thousands of years of evolution functioning for 30 second periods that i wouldn't realize i had if i hadn't been in Afghanistan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome. My neighbor was in the army and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have beers on occasion. Once, I asked him to to check out my AR to see if it's decent. He ripped it apart in like 3 seconds down to the bolt. I was amazed, but still had to firmly ask that he put it back together before he left. Side note: He said its a real good one. Rock River Arms .223 with a quadrail. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still service, and that's very commendable.</p>
<p>I've considered joining the military if I am unable to pay for college, and as a career, but I've had more than one mental breakdown which caused me to take a leave of absence from school and I'm bipolar, so I guess it's not an option anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst I really mean to not belittle any of your experiences, like a few other commentors, I too really doubt that there would be any basis behind this hypothesis. Wounds that pierce into your abdomen or digestive tract have not really been very survivable at all until fairly recently, so there couldn't be any meaningful evolutional pressure. Furthermore, the amount of people who would suffer these wounds and survive them, is so small that it can't be enough from the perspective of the whole population.</p>
<p>I think it's been shown that adrenaline may induce an emetic response (i.e. vomiting) and it might be connected to our flight-or-fight mechanism (run faster on an empty stomach, all that) or it might just be an imperfection, a coincidence. Anxiety and stress on the other hand have been shown to put physical strain on our digestive systems, which can lead to diarrhea simply due to the failure of the system to properly process foodstuff. This, too, could have some evolutionary advantage such as redirecting our resources to muscles and brains.. or it could just be coincidental.</p>
<p>None of that is wholly conclusive, but I find those much more plausible explanations nevertheless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen serious injuries and thrown up.  Then you've got to keep on going.</p>
<p>No idea what the trigger is, other than seeing it as &quot;that is awful beyond words&quot;.</p>
<p>I've read that in the military when combat starts in earnest many people vomit at the carnage and nearly everyone dumps their bowels and bladder, and it has been a 'dirty little secret' for thousands of years of combat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure that pee, and pooping happens, but in my experience it never did. You live in such close proximity to those you serve with that such a thing couldn't be hidden. We had an epidemic of pooping the bed because of the rotten food we had to eat, and everyone knew who pooped the bed almost the same time that the guilty person woke up. It's hard to understand, but you live so closely that everyone knows everything. There are no secrets. That said, if one of my brothers had shit themselves i would not give it up as public info. You feel under a microscope without any thing like that involved. I would never give up personal struggles to the public when so much struggle was involved. That said, i can honestly say involuntary puke was the only thing i saw/experienced.
EDIT* in military training it is not a secret. They want you to expect all of the possibilities so you're prepared. Hence my training on why it's okay if you pee during a firefight. </p></div>		</li>
