			<div class="markdown"><p>The silly thing is that the downward firing seat was put in because they were worried about clearing the tail in case of ejection at the top right-hand corner of the envelope (given altitude, it's usually best to stay with the remains of the aircraft until the q problem goes away, so it's better to design the seat around the bottom of the envelope which lacks this fundamental advantage); Martin-Baker ultimately replaced all the Luftwaffe seats with <a href="http://www.ejectionsite.com/gq7aseat.htm" target="_blank">upward firing seats</a> without any great difficulty beyond those inherent in retrofitting work.</p></div>		</li>
