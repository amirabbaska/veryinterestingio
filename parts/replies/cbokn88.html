			<div class="markdown"><p>We originally chose to remove ourselves because being on default put a big load on the moderating team.</p>
<p>It's been a year now, and we feel that the mod team is better prepared to handle the influx of questions and comments, while still keeping the quality of the subreddit high. And while it may seem sudden to people on the outside, the topic of going back on default has been coming up among the moderators regularly since we first decided to leave.</p>
<p>Ultimately, more exposure but more work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure a lot of people like myself are worried that even with the great mod team here (and you guys do an amazing job) this subreddit will lose the quality that we subscribe to it for. I am wondering how absolute this change is. If things get too hectic will you guys be looking for more mods, consider leaving default again, impose new rules? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to pi's rational response, we have a <em>lot</em> of new moderating tools and capabilities that we'd been clamoring for for a long time from the admins*. It's now much easier to moderate a large reddit than it has been in the past. </p>
<p>I personally think it's a pretty neat story, that we had reddits growing outsized for so long, then AskScience came along and wanted to have a well-moderated large reddit. And we couldn't really do it, the tools just weren't there. So we went off default and in the meantime, better tools were made.</p>
<p>And you can't discount the larger ripples in the pond we made. I think we showed quite well that moderation (and not the absolute free-for-all many reddits had been) actually improved quality. I think there was a degree of a cultural shift on reddit towards increased moderation and the increased quality that came with it.</p>
<p>So now, with that change, I hope that we can go forth as being a real strong educational force on the internet.</p>
<p>*:edit: and not just admins. We have great chrome extensions and scripts by a bunch of people, I don't even know who all to credit.</p></div>		</li>
