			<div class="markdown"><p>My question has always been is the dosage enough to cause any significant change/harm?  If it's going to change who I am as a person or if it's going to harm me beyond my body's ability to repair itself then obviously I'm against it.  But I'm not against &quot;chemicals&quot; because that's a scary word to people with little to no scientific literacy.  The poison is in the dose, or whatever the saying is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The easiest entry point to the problems caused by Endocrine Disruptors in some plastics is the book <em>Our Stolen Future</em> by <a href="http://www.ourstolenfuture.org/Authors/authors.htm" target="_blank">Dr Theo Colburn, Dr John Peterson Myers and reporter Dianne Dumanowski</a>.  There is a website <a href="http://www.ourstolenfuture.org/new/recentimportant.htm" target="_blank">here</a> but the book is easier to read for the layman and puts it all in a coherent and interesting story.</p>
<p>Sadly we are already experiencing real world harms such as extreme rate rises in the numbers of infertility, intersex babies and hormonally mediated cancer rates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are there other possible sources that add to these problems?</p></div>		</li>
