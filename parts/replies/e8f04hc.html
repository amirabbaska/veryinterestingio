<li>So the world will always be full of things that are great and fantastic for us but also things that are dangerous and poisonous because they are all there for some other purpose that does not concern us.*</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sydney Funnel Web is highly venomous to primates, but not particularly venomous to other mammals. There were never any indigenous primates in Australia so itâ€™s just unfortunate that they are highly venomous to humans. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or maybe more accuratly: sometimes poisonous or venomous things are so by sheer coincidence.</p>
<p>Maybe this toxin allows them to survive better in cold, hot, dry, wet, etc. climate and they decided: hey that's a good thing to have, those who possessed that gene survived better or where chosen more frequently for reproduction and dominated the specie.</p>
<p>Then comes out a new predator and this specie is all like:</p>
<p>Well what d'you see there! It also kills those new predators... pretty sweet mutation if you ask me!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I think my point is: sometimes things happen by sheer luck and what we are seeing is not necessarily the reason for that evolution but the result of the world changing for millenials (or even more in certain cases) and species adapting to situations that are now unthinkable for humans because they are long gone but the results are still there. Just like part of virus we can't even identify are still embeded in our DNA and we have no clue why most of the time but the best bet is: well sometime ago it must have been beneficial (or at least not detrimental).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Evolution and the biology of animals and plants are not all going to be oriented and centered around us and our species. We are not the pinnacle of evolution, we are merely another step in a never ending chain. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, we are ultimately the only hope for all life on this planet. Even independent of human actions, this world, as far as life is concerned, is already 90-95% spent. Life has existed on this planet for perhaps 4 billion years. In 100-500 million years, the Sun's natural long term increase in brightness will render this planet uninhabitable. The oceans will boil and the Earth will become a second Venus.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we can absolutely prevent this. We could probably do so even with our current technology. For example, enough thin mirrors launched into orbit would completely negate this process. With current technology, we could extend this planet's lifespan right up until the Sun goes red giant in 5 billion years or so. If we ever figure out stellar engineering, we might even be able to extend the Sun's life into hundreds of trillions of years, though that is certainly well beyond our current technology. (Though not inconsistent with our current understanding of physics.)</p>
<p>We are children of a dying world. If we go extinct, it is highly unlikely that any intelligent species will rise to take our place. Any event that wipes us out completely would also likely wipe out any possible successor species. (For example, if all human beings just dropped dead magically tomorrow, chimps might be able to evolve into something at our level in a few million years.) Any event that completely wipes us out would also likely wipe out most or all large land-dwelling mammals.</p>
<p>If we went extinct, the most &quot;advanced&quot; organisms that survived would likely be things like mice or rats. True, civilization-producing intelligence appears to be a very rare thing. In the hundreds of millions of years of complex multicellular life, we are the only such species in our planet's history. For all our flaws, we are the single greatest light that our planet has ever produced. If we go, there likely simply isn't time for our equal to arrive via natural evolution.</p>
<p>And again, the long term crisis faced by life is something that only intelligence can solve. Without advanced, technological civilization, this planet will be devoid of anything but bacteria within 200 million years and completely sterile within 500 million.</p>
<p>We cannot relinquish ourselves to nihilism or the belief that our extinction is meaningless. We humans are truly unique in the entire history of this world. Yes, this uniqueness gives us the ability to recklessly devastate our planet. But it also gives us the ability to win for life a reprieve from absolute annihilation. Even with current technology, we have the ability to double the natural habitable lifespan of this world. There has not been a single species in the entire unfathomably ancient history of this planet that had such a capability. And there is not likely to be another before time has run out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is completely incorrect.<br />
The current main sequence (hydogen fusion) period will last another 5.4 billion years.  There won't be any major temperature shifts until helium fusion begins, and even then it won't be noticeable for another hundred million years at least.  </p>
<p><strong>5.4 billion years is longer than the earth has currently existed</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mid-sized yellow dwarf star, like the Sun, will remain on the main sequence for about 10 billion years. The Sun is thought to be in the middle of its main sequence lifespan. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completely incorrect. The core is slowly becoming denser and burning hydrogen faster. As a result, the luminosity of the sun has been ever so slowly increasing over time. Estimates vary that the sun's luminosity will increase somewhere between 6% to 10% in the next billion years, enough to cause the extinction of most if not all multi-cellular life by that time.</p></div>		</li>
