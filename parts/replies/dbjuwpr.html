They're regional monopolies, and in many areas specifically conspired to make it that way. The market itself has a huge barrier to entry - either put down your own infrastructure (unimaginably expensive) or rent it from the very monopoly you are trying to compete against (meaning they can screw you over constantly). </p></div>		</li>
