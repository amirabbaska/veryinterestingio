<p>They do this. They can't exaggerate to the government (or insurance), but they can to employees. I remember Lowes telling me how much of a problem theft was and the millions they claimed to lose didn't add up to the reality people weren't stealing half the inventory.</p>
<p>I also worked at a Subway where the owner claimed a pan of bread was worth $100, but that was more a comical outlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both. The only way he knew to deal with employees was by trying to intimidate them. So instead of &quot;please be careful with the bread&quot; it was &quot;that bread costs me $100 a pan&quot;. </p>
<p>The only reason I worked there for as long as I did is that the owner was so habitually abrasive it was highly entertaining to watch (after you learned to brush off him being an asshole to you) but eventually I couldn't watch him bully the underage kids he hired (everyone who worked there besides me it was their 1st job because anyone else quit) so I quit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you include the cost of labor, the pan itself, and a brief period of depreciation of the oven, you wouldn't hit $100 per pan of bread. If he's paying $10 per loaf, he's doing business wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the people in this thread are wrong. Insurance often covers lost revenue or the retail price of the item. It depends on the policy, business, and country.</p>
<p>When I had equipment stolen the insurance company provided the retail replacement cost of the item which was actually more than I was selling it for. </p>
<p>/u/MrNerd82 is also wrong about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Value can only be assigned once an actual transaction takes place, until then the only value associated with it is the $1 the company paid for it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends on the country, and it depends on cash or accrual method of accounting sometimes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Otherwise there's nothing to stop crazy/greedy people from saying &quot;This Coca-Cola bottle we have here for sale is worth $500, crap it got stolen, now we can declare a loss and not pay as much taxes&quot;. Nope, doesn't work like that .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yea, actually it can. Anyone dealing with this problem needs to consult a CPA and/or a tax attorney. This is not a simple area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was an independent operator for a major convenience store chain in Canada. (the one with the owl) </p>
<p>Corporate paid me, I paid my employees out of that. Every 8 weeks, an inventory company would come in and do a count. Every single RETAIL dollar that was missing due to theft, even if the inventory company missed counting something, would come out of what the company paid me. </p>
<p>It felt like getting robbed from the inside each time and made me wonder of the legalities involved. However, I was the idiot who signed the 30 page contract for the &quot;privilege&quot; of the &quot;independent&quot; operator title. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is where the RIAA comes up with their insane numbers.  I believe at the height of the file sharing fiasco, they claimed that the lost revenue was something more than the GDP of the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The RIAA cheats twice. First, by treating <em>copying</em> of an ephemeral good exactly the same as <em>theft</em> of a physical good; and second by measuring every technical copy as though it's equivalent to a sale.</p>
<p>In the first, it claims that copying a song without paying always represents a lost sale. Stealing a screwdriver arguably costs a sale (though still not 100%), because the seller no longer has it. Copying doesn't deprive the seller of the good, which means that its effect on the market is much harder to measure.</p>
<p>In the second, even if we assume that someone who downloads a song would have bought it, they would have only bought one copy. The RIAA looks at someone who downloads a song and puts it on their iPod and their computer as making two copies and thus losing them two sales, which is patently absurd.</p></div>		</li>
