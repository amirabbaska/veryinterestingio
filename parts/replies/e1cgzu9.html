			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an easy way around that - give 3 shots of local anaesthetic around the injection site first. When <em>that</em> pain subsides they won't feel the important one at all. Then next time no local and see which hurts less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got numbed up really good when they pulled my wisdom teeth. I was laughing the whole damn time because I couldn’t feel a damn thing anywhere on my face, even when he ripped <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EditMyReddit/" target="_blank">‘</a>em out. </p>
<p>Edit<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EditMyReddit/" target="_blank">:</a> (forgot to say) Burned like hell with the first two or three but very much worth the experience. 7/7 would do again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Numbing shots always hurt more than the actual pain that I'm about to experience imo... Especially since it takes me more than most people to get numb... doctors are always amazed by it. </p>
<p>Doc expected me to be numb with 2 shots and 15 minutes, took 7 shots and 45 minutes. I kept saying &quot;eh its probably okay, let's get the stitches over with&quot;... &quot;Well, hold on, I'm sure one more should do it&quot;... Dude was going for a record or something.</p>
<p>I've been told me being a (sort of) redhead has something to do with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  Lidocaine patches were marketed for kids vaccinations about 15 years ago, and I made the mistake of asking the pediatrician about it in front of my son.  He explained the patch numbs the skin and its the muscle that hurts, he had tried it on himself and noticed no difference. My 5 year old son wanted the patch so badly I couldn't refuse. I should post that story on TIFU, the poor kid thought he would feel nothing and I think the shock made it so much worse.  I had to help the nurses hold him down for the last shot (normally he barely reacted).  Yeah, the only way to numb the injection site would be with a shot, and I can guarantee the actual shot you need hurts less than a shot of local anesthetic.</p></div>		</li>
