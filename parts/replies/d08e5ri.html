			<div class="markdown"><p>Recovering from a wound like that and living 12 years more is very impressive, especially considering he was an old horse in the first place. People really underestimate the connection one can have with a horse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope the person that took him out for a ride got an earful. Personally, I would probably have done something legally to that person. We had a 10 year old school pony break his shoulder a few years ago, just running out in pasture. You think they're tough animals so you always forget how easily they can get hurt.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, what bone was broken?
Glad to hear he lived a very long life. Wish all horses could have owners like you and vets like Geoff</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was the cannon bone in his near side foreleg. Initially they intended to pin it together, but when they got inside it was worse than it looked on the X - Ray's so quite a lot of metal ended up in there. The vets at AHT fell in love with him too. Bertie was a one in a billion bless him. </p>
<p>We had a riding school pony, called (named by previous owner) beefburger. He did much the same, he was a very fine little thing, and when he fell his leg completely shattered. Sadly he couldn't be saved. We had a bench next to one of the sand-schools so I had a plaque put on it saying 'In memory of our much loved Beefburger'. It caused more than a few confused faces!</p></div>		</li>
