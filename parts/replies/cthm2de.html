<p>Yeah, this feeling really gets to me too, and I moved from Estonia. </p>
<p>I can chat with people, I know a thing or two about my neighbors, but they really just keep to their Finnish group/s, and don't accept outsiders very easily at all.</p>
<p>I tried with first but I was shunned out because my poor language skills and I don't even wanna try anymore, just keeping in contact with my old friends in estonia and such for my social interaction now.
People who haven't moved countries like this say that they are basically the same country/language/culture. No it isn't. It is very different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You guys should probably hook up? In all seriousness though this probably doesn't have anything to do with lack of communication by you guys, as most Finns speak English fluently. As a Finn, I've often told my foreign friends that in order for a foreigner to get close to a Finn is to initiate contact themselves. It's not that Finns are racist (most of us are NOT), it's just that we are so closed, shy even, that we simply don't want to be bothersome. The greatest fear of a Finn is making a fool of himself in public, and one of the easiest ways to do this (in his mind), is say something stupid to a foreigner. So while you might be &quot;the guest&quot;, it's actually you who has to encourage the &quot;host&quot; that it's ok to sometimes misunderstand or not get what you're saying. </p>
<p>Got any colleagues or student friends? Get past the &quot;hello, I'm Mike&quot; phase then ask them out for a beer. Ask about places to go, then ask them if they want to come along. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, good point, about the whole shyness thing.It just feels backwards thats all, but Im getting used to it and everyday getting better are reading you guys.  Finns love a good invite and usually provide with better intellectual company than I could get where I am from. Which is really nice. I love that Finns are all mostly well traveled and dont make opinions about things that they dont know much about. Finns are all very good people (In my expierence thus far) just have to figure out the puzzle first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more I read, the more Fins sound like Japanese. This is the problem I face daily. It's only a little different, because Japanese has so many layers of politeness and how you address someone is based greatly on station, so they assume English (or any language) is the same, so they're deathly afraid of coming across too casual and insulting the foreigner.</p>
<p>The way to break this tension is just like you said - make the first move. And I usually use my shitty broken Japanese (that I know is the wrong tense and way too casual, maybe even completely wrong for the time of day) in addition to my English. The thought is if I muck it up, they can give English a go without fear of mucking it up.</p>
<p>And I have no idea why I'm rambling. I should really just go to sleep. </p>
<p>Oh yeah, Finland sounds pretty nice! At least it's not fucking roasting (we just hit 36 today, fuck that). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Many people say it but those who say it usually haven't tried to live in a foreign country where they don't speak the language. I've lived in Denmark for a yea. Most Danes speak fluent English, so you'd think you could just live without learning the language and it would be exactly the same. But it's not. If you don't learn the language, you'll always be foreign there and not quite fit it. You'll probably still make some  friends, but it's not the same - often when you're with a group of friends, now matter how nice they are to you, a lot of the time they'll still be talking Danish to one another and you'll feel excluded, even if later they'll translate it to you. And no matter how good their English is, for most people it stil feels more natural to speak their native language and actually feels weird to have all the conversations with their other friends in English just because of you, and while you can playfully say &quot;Hey c'mon guys, English please!&quot; it feels rude to demand them to speak only English all the time just for you.</p>
<p>Danish isn't a hard language, especially since I already new German and it's gramatically similar. At the end of the year I felt more or less fluent. It got much easier making friends then. And Danes are said to be more social than Fins, so maybe in Finland it's even more important to speak the language. And I've heard that Finnish grammar is crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Swedish speaking Finn here! I don't agree with you. Yes, there are alot of places in Finland where people are more introvert. However if you go to a city by the sea, close to Sweden, there are alot of Swedish speking people, and there the mentality is much more like in Sweden. People are open mindes, even talk to each other on the busstation. We have just moved and today my little brother ran to our neighbours. They let him in and offered him candy, then they watched TV together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Finnish guy (27) from Helsinki and I find it interesting you haven't made <em>any</em> close friends even in two years. Of course (just as anywhere else I guess) I met most of my current friends in school/work, but I also have few very close friends I basically met in the streets (while drunk or something). And being Finnish can't be one of the main reasons for it. My friends met a Portuguese guy in a karaoke bar who became their best friend and was gladly welcomed into our friend circle.  </p>
<p>I'm trying to say that if there is some good setting, a hobby or a festival or an art exhibition or something, and you're just lucky enough to meet the kind of people who are more open minded that average Finnish people, it's not entirely impossible to make friends outside of school, work or through mutual friends. It is surely easier if we are drunk though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only time I felt like a daredevil/risk taker/international super-criminal was in Belgium when I walked across a very narrow road that you could see up and down for at least 100 yards with no traffic coming whilst 40 Belgians patiently waited for the green man.</p>
<p>There were audible gasps and dropped jaws. Jaywalking is practically a national sport in Ireland. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From Amsterdam, had the same experience in Canada... was super weird. Then after like 3 months of crossing red lights I suddenly got stopped by a police car, woman rolls down her window and I was like 'oh shit, I'm fucked now... these Canadians can't be waiting at red lights for no reason, the fine must be up there' and she was like 'don't do it again' and drove off lol. Absolutely amazed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I do this in Germany as well, and there's a very good logic to it.</p>
<p>The other people driving a car <em>expect</em> a green light to mean no pedestrian crossing when it's red for them. Just like I <em>expect</em> a car to not jump a red light while I'm crossing and kill me. It's simple and sensible social contract, everybody is relying on everybody else following the rules.</p>
<p>I'm a foreigner here, but it makes absolute sense to wait, especially at night, when there's low visibility, for you, and for any potential driver.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's just a light, not a cop. You can use your own judgement and tell if its safe or not to cross...</p>
