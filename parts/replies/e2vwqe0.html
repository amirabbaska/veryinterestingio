			<div class="markdown"><p>whenever I start wondering about insects brain power, I recall that intro to an episode of radiolab where the person narrating swore that one of the insects under his care during an experiment was exceptional in some way. One day after forming some sort of endearment, he accidentally injured it while opening its cage. He felt so horrible but then saw it eating its own insides that were pouring out of the injury because the insides probably smelled like a glucose based food. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm looking around for it, I have a feeling that the episode wasn't about insects but about humans forming endearments or something so it's a bit harder to find than you'd think. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually can remember food at a certain spot is dangerous. It's called fear conditioning and fruit flies (Drosophila) are extensively researched to understand the mechanisms for that. It involves a wide range of protein synthesis to form long-term plastic changes in the nervous system. </p>
<p>They can learn to associate a stimulus with fear and avoid it.

<p>It might just not perceive your slow human reflexes to be dangerous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think i taugth a fly to stay away from me once. I didnt have a good thing to kill it with, only a sofa pillow. I kept trying to hit it, but it got blowen out of the way by wind before the sofa pillow. Eventually i relised i didnt want dead fly on the sofa pillow and stopped even trying to hit it. After a while of just scareing it away it would keep away from my face and anywhere my arms could quickly reach. It would however still try to sit on my feet as it got plenty warning before i reached it. In the process of tameing the fly it would allways keep trying to push my boundarys, but eventually give up and give me more space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really remarkable, how similar most AI in video games is to typical insects. We can convincingly replicate schooling behaviors that fish possess, as well as the behavior of flies...though the latter is rather harder thanks to the the complexities of flight, small-scale air current behavior, and so on. </p>
<p>Then again, I'm only on the wetware side--I know biology, I'm not so big on the computers part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on the computer side of things, and you are pretty much correct. Most video game AIs have a &quot;bag of tricks&quot; with various behaviors, such as patrolling, taking cover, flanking, shooting, using grenades, etc. Then there is the main loop that decides what behavior is the most appropriate for the situation, using simple conditions and sometimes a little bit of math, and invokes it.</p>
<p>This does sound similar to how the post above describes fly behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, ants are absolutely fascinating. Thank you for the recommendation! I'll add it to my list, since I'm fascinated by large systems. I'd have gone into entomology, if not for my revulsion and vague phobia of insects. </p></div>		</li>
