			<div class="markdown"><p>I never thought about it, but when you suffer a heart attack are you still breathing? And if not, how much of a benefit is CPR, especially if it goes on for a long time? Is there enough oxygen stored in the blood to make a difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually one of the things people don't get about CPR in my experience- the breathing is sorta secondary to your heart beating. Our bodies generally don't use up all the oxygen in our cells on a single trip through the circulatory system so you get some left over.</p>
<p>What I want to know though is why the bother telling people to breath for the other person when doing CPR. I mean why are you forcing a poisonous gas into someone's lungs when your goal is to save them? We breathe in O2 and exhale CO2. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't breathe out pure CO2, there's still plenty of oxygen left in the air. Just as we don't use all the oxygen in a single breath, we don't exhale all the waste in a single breath either. The person is also not breathing so anything is better than nothing.</p></div>		</li>
