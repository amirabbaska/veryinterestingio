<p>It may be correct, but it doesn't answer the question of why people say &quot;Pardon my French&quot; after using an English swear word. there's no mystery as to why someone would use the phrase after using a French word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple. The phrase became common and people started referring to it in a jocular manner when saying a word that was perceived as impolite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's interesting that everyone tried to explain the origin of the phrase rather than explaining what it currently means. I personally think it's intuitively obvious, all the OP needed to do if they seriously didn't know is to type &quot;pardon my French&quot; into Google or Wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Pardon my French&quot; or &quot;Excuse my French&quot; is a common English language phrase ostensibly disguising profanity as French. The phrase is uttered in an attempt to excuse the user of profanity, swearing, or curses in the presence of those offended by it under the pretense of the words being part of a foreign language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: I guess the ELI5 would be that the person swearing is joking that they are actually saying French words that just happen to sound like English swear words.</p></div>		</li>
