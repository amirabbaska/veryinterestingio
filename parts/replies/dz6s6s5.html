			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom always looks at mugshots. It's like checking reddit for her. Idk what she gets out of it. I think she just likes judging people. She gets a kick out of seeing people she knows. She always has to tell me when she sees someone I know. &quot;Did you know John Smith got arrested?&quot; No I didn't mom and I don't care.</p>
<p>Edit: I think the habit started when my brother started getting arrested a lot.</p></div>		</li>
