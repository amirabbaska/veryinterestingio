			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The Dictator's Handbook&quot; has an amazing insight into the resource trap. It's a bit rough to boil down to a reddit post, but the gist is that all leaders require treasure to buy the loyalty of key people to stay in power. When ruling a resource-rich country, not only do they not need the support of the commoners, It's actually in the leaders best interest to keep them oppressed, as any treasure spent to improve the lives of the people is treasure NOT spent buying key supporters. As an added bonus, poor, illiterate starving people who lack shelter education clean water etc. are far less likely to be able to beat you in an election/stage a coup etc as all their time and energy is spent trying to stay alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, this is an interesting theory. I'm a bit confused about how Europe was able to emerge as an economic power seeing as it seems the were at constant war with each other, yet they were able to build companies like the Dutch east India company valued at 50 trillion dollars. </p>
<p>Additionally many European nations were plagued by corruption, yet many were able to survive it. </p>
<p>Weren't there many citysates like Novgorod that were land locked but still very successful with trade? </p>
<p>I can definitely see the resource traps, but many northern African nations were able to be very successful even with a non diverse set of resources. Is it because they were in close proximity to the Mediterranean? </p>
<p>And finally how come groups like Samoans weren't successful at trade when they had all of these things going for them including at one point the most technologically advanced sailing techniques. They just seemed to stagnate after settling their island nations.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for posting. Definitely going to give this a read.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Look up a map of ocean currents and then Samoan colonization patterns. Their sailing technique was advanced for the time but it was very limited by where the currents would send them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a lot of has to do with the Bubonic Plague.
Simply put, the Bubonic Plague killed a ton of people. For Western Europe, this made all the poor people realize how much power they had.
In Eastern Europe, it made the elites realize how easy it would be to expand their power, since their was now less people who could oppose them, and less people they had to conquer.
Thus, Western Europe was set on a path that allowed it to develop fair and free institutions. Eastern Europe was shifted back.
You can't generalize Europe's success. Yes, it's better then Africa, in terms of living standards. But, there are nuances. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but these are all the current factors keeping it poor (though it should include diseases such as malaria and AIDS/HIV). </p>
<p>For the historic factors (why it has lagged behind Europe and other continents), you'll want to start by reading &quot;Guns, germs and steel&quot; by Jared Diamond. The whole premise of the book is to explore why some countries ended up richer than others. </p>
<p>Diamond outlines a couple of factors making Sub-Saharan Africa quite unique in geographic terms. </p>
<ol>
<li>Agriculture (needed to build larger civilisations) was established way later than in other places. Because:</li>
</ol>
<p>A. Africa's North-South axis made it harder to spread plants across the continent (South America suffered from the same problem, while Europe and Asia did not to the same degree). </p>
<p>B. There were fewer good indigenous animals and plants available to use for farming. </p>
<ol>
<li>The lack of good rivers for transport encouraging trade and exchange of ideas </li>
</ol>
<p>One might also add: </p>
<p>A lot of the soil is quite low in nutrients since it's source material is old, naturally this differs a lot, but the classic red soil is an example of this </p>
<p>European techniques of farming proved much better suited to e.g. Latin America and Australia than Africa (with the exception of South Africa and Zimbabwe)</p>
<p>Also:  the Europeans came along and colonised the continent, including selling slaves that diminished population densities needed for more intense agriculture. </p>
<p>All in all if you want to have a big civilisation with plenty of resources to invent, build armies, explore and invade with - you have to start with a good food source (plants or animals). </p>
<p>Africa was given a shitty hand for this to happen, although it did to some degree before the Europeans came along and messed stuff up. By the time of decolonisation Asia and Africa were equally poor, but Asia could use its farming to build a stable foundation (look up the Green Revolution) while Africa couldn't. </p>
