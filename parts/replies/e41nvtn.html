			<div class="markdown"><p>Cholera secretes a toxin that causes diarrhoea in an attempt to get your body to flush it out of your system (it likes living in brackish water and doesn't like living inside your gut).</p>
<p>Presumably the thicker mucus layer caused by the heterozygous condition of the CF gene resists the toxin getting into your body until the cholera organism can be excreted normally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I searched around a bit, both CT and CF involve messing up the function of chloride channels, so probably if the chloride channels don’t work or have reduced functionality due to CF, they can’t be activated by CT, so I don’t get diarrhea. Makes sense </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The choleea toxin attacks a chlorine transporter (CFTR) on your cells jamming it open. This causes chlorine to flow out of the cell followed by water hence the diarrhea that accompanies cholera. If you have the cystic fibrosis mutation in CFTR then these transporters don't function correctly and the cholera toxin can't affect them.</p></div>		</li>
