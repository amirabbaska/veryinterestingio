			<div class="markdown"><p>LOL! I had a good 12 hours before he came home from work to prepare and get rid of the evidence. I laid out this ugly ass old lady doily over the burned spot on the counter and hung a new, bigger towel on the towel bar to cover the blackened drywall behind it. Since the bathroom was basically only used by me I hoped I could buy some time before I got caught. Didn't work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, well I was all deer in the headlights (I knew I was in trouble) as I was getting the dad stare so I was all 'I think I did this' and he was like 'Nope! Burn patterns prove otherwise.' and then went on to explain why my recollection was inaccurate because my version wasn't possible. Truth be told I was in my bedroom in a furious makeout/dry  humping session (no bueno in the Mouthlove household) while I kept hearing all these funny pops and crackles (ya know, the sound of fire). So I kind of was lying as to what I was doing <em>while</em> the fire was going. I get a pretty distinct lying face (it's not my forte) so he knew there was a lie somewhere. Good times. </p></div>		</li>
