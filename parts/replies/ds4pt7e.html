			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m glad someone asked this question because I took a class called Modern Geometry which was supposed to be about non-Euclidean geometry and learned 0 Non-Euclidean geometry. Like not even a basic idea. We never got past Euclidean the whole semester. I’m fairly certain it was because the teacher had never taught it before and either didn’t know it or was just really bad at teaching/planning.  I feel like I know more after reading this comment than taking the class. I want a refund. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, I can guarantee you learned proofs in non-euclidean geometry, whether they were presented as such or not. Any proof that doesn't need the parallel postulate to be true is a proof in non-euclidean geometry. For example, <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI1.html" target="_blank">Euclid's first proposition</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A similar thing happened to me when I took AP Calculus in High School, though it wasn't the teacher's fault.  The entire first semester was taken up with review of Algebra 2 and Trig stuff because like 3/4 of the students in the class had somehow forgotten almost the entirety of what they had learned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In reference to the Manhattan thing, I feel like that isn't true unless you mean actually walking. I could walk 3 blocks north and 2 blocks west. According to what youre saying, that means I walked 5 blocks and I can't go any shorter distance. But what I could fly and just fly over the hypotenuse , couldn't I only travel ✓13 blocks based on the Pythagorean theorem?</p></div>		</li>
