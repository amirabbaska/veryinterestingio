			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the lego anology:</p>
<p>Say you only have yellow and blue lego pieces (atoms), and there's a lego shop nearby (the earth from where we can dig minerals). Now to make a blue house, you can do two things: You can either go to the shop and buy the specific lego set for a blue house (dig in the earth for diamons), or you can search between your own lego pieces, take the blue bricks from there, and combine them into a house (making industrial diamonds). Both are doable, and depending on the situation you may choose either one.</p>
<p>Now you want, with the same restrictions as before, to create a green house. You only have yellow and blue pieces, and there's a shop. Theoretically it's possible to melt your lego pieces, blend the yellow and blue till you get green, and them form them into green pieces. However, this is extremely highly impractical: It'll take huge amounts of time, knowledge and resources, and result in a lot of waste. While it's technically not impossible, it's way easier to just go to the shop and get a green house lego set.</p>
<p>Same goes for gold: It's extremely inefficient to create gold with nuclear reactions, and they it's very, very costly. While it's technically possible, nobody in his right mind would ever attempt to create gold that way. Except of course, researchers who study this subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not familiar with star trek, but besides energy consumption there would be other limitations. Most importantly would be the incredibly low efficiency, it would only be possible to create gold in another metal in incredibly low concentrations (especially if you only count the stable gold isotopes, the unstable ones would decay into other metals anyway). So one would need a LOT of starting material, and a very good purification process. Technically possible? Yes, but even in a &quot;unlimted-energ&quot; future I highly doubt this would be within the realm of being economically useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a misconception that diamonds are expensive because they might be rare or hard to get. But it's a false / created economy. Most diamonds are common - it's usually clarity and how it's cut that makes it expensive. But we can make them because carbon is easy to find and compress. We can even turn people's remains into a diamond. I guess that's another way of giving them 'value'?</p></div>		</li>
