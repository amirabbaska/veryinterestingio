The idea is to create a smooth clear layer atop of a textured surface to reduce light scattering, which pulls out the true colors underneath as much as possible. With paintings, that means you get colors that are closer to how they looked when they were first laid down by the brush. With wood, you pump up the natural saturation and contrast of the wood and stain. </p>
<p>The chemical differences basically come down to &quot;is this going to destroy the thing I'm putting it onto?&quot; Poly is pretty much a straight-up clear plastic resin. It's basically a water-tight clear shell, so it's great for furniture. Varnish is also a resin, but it has oils and solvents in it to protect from UV damage, slow down the drying time, and generally make the coats more thin, flexible, and manageable. If you were to poly a painting you'd probably get a stiff and brittle sheet of canvas with an uneven coat. </p></div>		</li>
