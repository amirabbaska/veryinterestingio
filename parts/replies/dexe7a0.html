			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, a chi square test cannot confirm the null hypothesis. However, A Bayesian analysis will find that the credible interval of proportions is extremely highly centered around uniform. With even a very weak prior favoring uniformity (reasonable given our experience with other numbers) we will find that our posterior belief is almost entirely placed on the uniform hypothesis. That is to say, this is very good evidence that each digit occurs with equal frequency in Pi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the sample size is still 10 million. It is a statistically valid sample size regardless of the population. The problem is that we simply took the first 10 million digits, which means it is not a true simple random sample</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say it's not 10 million. u/lewie said &quot;...it is a large sample size,&quot; which is subjective.  I'm saying it's a conundrum because, in the face of infinity, it's entirely possible that there is no such thing as a valid sample size.  999 quadrillion is still infinitesimally small compared to infinity.</p></div>		</li>
