			<div class="markdown"><p>When I signed up for a baseball dream week several years ago, I came down with a version of the &quot;yips&quot; which kept me from pitching.  Something I had done for years I all of a sudden couldn't do.  I could only throw a ball a long distance; up close I'd be wild.  To this day I can't overcome it.  What you just said makes a lot of sense, though.  Thanks.</p></div>		</li>
