			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I wonder if this also leads them to find women in general more attractive when hungry? Do we interpret heavier women and larger breasts as people who have access to more resources and hence more attracted to them when resources are scarce? I was expecting people to be more judgemental of other people's looks when hungry. Similar to <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.abstract" target="_blank">this study</a> where judges were more lenient after being fed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Copying from the first paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were overall significant differences between ratings made by participants from the two groups, with the satiated group having a significantly smaller peak attractiveness than the hungry group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hungry men were more likely to rate every woman more attractive, but still had a preference for heavier women</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do we interpret heavier women and larger breasts as people who have access to more resources and hence more attracted to them when resources are scarce?</p>

<p>That seems to be the prevailing theory. </p>
