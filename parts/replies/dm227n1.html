			<div class="markdown"><p>Artery blockage can happen in the absence of a heart attack, even though blockage is the main cause of heart attack.  </p>
<p>7 years ago I had strong chest pain, they tested me, enzyme test to see if I had a heart attack, nope.  EKG and ultrasound all came back normal.  Doc said to me, &quot;You may have a minor blockage so I can send you home with medication or we can schedule you for a angiogram.&quot; </p>
<p>I told him you've got me here now doc, let's go look.  End up was, 99% blockage of my LAD that wasn't detected otherwise.  Didn't have a heart attack but had he sent me home just with medications I could have easily had a fast one and not made it to the hospital in time.  </p>
<p>Just wanted to be clear, a blockage and heart attack can be tricky to differentiate, but they are different. :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing the phrase &quot;dying of old age&quot; is also used a lot because people tend to accumulate various conditions the older they get so it's not easy or worth while to tell what one was the cause. If they had a weak liver, high blood pressure, had back surgery 3 months ago, and were 90 years old then they would just say it was old age. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention that &quot;dying of old age&quot; is a more graceful description of someone passing, depicting that they've lived their life until the very end, rather than focusing on the specific condition that ends the life.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So more or less &quot;He/she has reached the finish line&quot; vibe instead of &quot;something stopped him/her from living on&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, actually just attended my wife's grandfather's funeral. He was mid 90s. </p>
<p>'Dying of old age' for him meant a fall in his kitchen 3-4 weeks ago, rehabilitation, followed by pneumonia and eventually congestive heart failure. </p>
<p>His lungs were going out towards the end, as well. I've seen hospice care in bad times for my own family, but for him... it provided 2 weeks of comfort while he said what were essentially goodbyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An old saying was &quot;pneumonia is the old man's friend&quot; because so many older people die from it while they have other chronic problems. A fall and then pneumonia is an extremely common &quot;natural cause&quot; of death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't even a consensus on what the definition of old age should be. Like at what point does one move from being adult to geriatric? In some of the cases I've read, the definition is as simple as having two or more comorbidities present at the same time, which goes hand in hand with your idea, that dying of old age is just a way of saying that one of the multiple issues finally made life impossible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Happened with my G'ma last year. She was 98. Wasn't on any prescription medication ever, great health. Got a cold that wouldn't go away so they did a chest scan - little bits of lung cancer. Never smoked, though my grandpa did but he's been dead for 37 years. It's like her body just needed to come up with some reason to end it. Decided not to do any treatment, being 98 and ready to go (something she had expressed in the last few years), and she passed peacefully at home about a month later. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds similar to my pap. He is 97 and just had a stroke. The first thing he's ever had go wrong with his body.
He's still so strong they discharged him from inpatient rehab and he's doing at home rehab.
He's so tired, once he found out he had a stroke he thought it was the end.
Now he's getting strong and is so frustrated with having been around for so long that his kids are starting to pass away.
I'm glad your grandma got to have a peaceful death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that is really messing with my head. I'm 26 bu this woman met someone and spent a super long time sharing her life with that man, creating a family. This guy was her everything. Then he dies and she continues to live another 37 years... what the fuck thats an entire lifetime after losing the person who was her secon half. Thats effectively twice my whole life if you dont count the first 10 years of life like I do.</p>
<p>Damn that really is a nasty though. Holy shit thats such a long time wtf.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't die of something else, cancer will eventually kill you.</p>
<p>I don't mean that in a flippant way. It is just as we improve healthcare for organ disease, diabetes, etc, you live longer. If you live longer, those DNA mistakes accumulate greatly increasing your odds for cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened to my great grandma a couple years ago. She got luekimia (I know I butchered that spelling) a month after her 103rd bday. They gave her 3 months - she died 12 days shy of her 104th. We had a birthday party for her instead of a funeral. Birthday cake, hats, noisemakers - the youngest generation sang Happy birthday after all the eulogies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens a lot. I work in cancer research, and we collect cancer data. It's extremely common for cancers in older people (85+) to be reported on the death certificate or by a nursing home or hospice and for that patient to have no treatment. It's rare for them to even have a biopsy or even get staging workup done. Sometimes even a small surgery is enough to push a relatively healthy 90 year old over the edge and kill them, so anything beyond an X-ray or a CT scan won't be done if a doctor suspects cancer.</p></div>		</li>
