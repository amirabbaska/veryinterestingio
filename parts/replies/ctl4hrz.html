			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Morado&quot; (berry-like) is the common word in Spanish for purple or violet, although there's also &quot;p√∫rpura&quot; and &quot;violeta&quot;. It also exists as a last name, although it isn't too common.</p>
<p>Rojo (red) and Rojas (female reds), as well as Naranjo (orange tree) are fairly common last names. On the other hand, I've never heard Negro (black) or Verde (green) as last names, although some related names do exist, like Negrete (little black) or Verduzco (greenish).</p></div>		</li>
