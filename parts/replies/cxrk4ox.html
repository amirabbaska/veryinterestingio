			<p>&gt;One thing that a lot of people are skipping over is...<br><br>Also the age of the patient. My wounds take twice as long to heal than they did 20 years ago. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>Is that relevant to the multiple vs single wounds question though? I mean one of my wounds might heal faster than two of yours, but will one of yours heal much slower, if at all then two of yours? That's the heart of the question. </p>		</li>

			<p>True. My job's cutting out skin cancers. Heal times are as follows: Face 1 week. Torso and upper limbs 2 weeks. Lower leg 3 weeks. This of course assumes a non infected wound with clean edges</p>		</li>
