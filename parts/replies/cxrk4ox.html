<p>Also the age of the patient. My wounds take twice as long to heal than they did 20 years ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that relevant to the multiple vs single wounds question though? I mean one of my wounds might heal faster than two of yours, but will one of yours heal much slower, if at all then two of yours? That's the heart of the question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. My job's cutting out skin cancers. Heal times are as follows: Face 1 week. Torso and upper limbs 2 weeks. Lower leg 3 weeks. This of course assumes a non infected wound with clean edges</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry but why is that relevant? Obviously many factors affect healing rate, so why is this more relevant than bringing up whether the wound had an infection, or whether the wound is larger or smaller? The question is whether two wounds heal more slowly than either individually, holding the location, size, depth, etc. fixed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it is relevant to what OP was wondering, asking if three identical wounds spread across the body would heal as quickly as a single wound. However, each wound location around the body will vary the specific healing time, so a cut on your hand will heal quicker than a cut on the arm (etc, etc). Because OP specified that the wound locations would be &quot;in other regions of the body&quot;, and everyone else was getting technical, figured I would get technical as well. </p></div>		</li>
