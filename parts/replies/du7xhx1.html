			<div class="markdown"><p>It's meant to be played in a movie theater where the explosions are meant to be incredibly loud.  </p>
<p>Think about it -- if you're watching Independence Day, do you want every single line of dialogue to be just as loud as the alien ship blowing up the white house?  </p>
<p>It's mixed properly. It's just that, at home, we have neighbors and loved ones, so if we turned the volume up to the intended level, the loud parts are too loud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's usually the system that isn't setup properly. Film mixers mix to a certain standard / calibration. Most home theaters are setup improperly, not calibrated, have speakers distanced improperly, have weak center channels, etc.</p>
<p>Let's choose: the multi-million dollar mix facility did a poor job, or someone's crappy $200 surround system isn't setup properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to enlighten some friends about this the other day. We were watching Fantastic Beasts at their place and they couldn't figure out why the dialogue was so quiet. I asked them if they had a 5.1 system and they didn't even know what that meant. I told them to just change the audio track to stereo and be done with it. They were absolutely floored that having the latest/greatest version of the sound mix enabled did not, in fact, give the best experience if they didn't have the proper sound set up. That said, I think I convinced them that they need a 5.1 system so I'm going to enjoy movie night at their place much more in future. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was just a test. You won, and are correct! Seriously though I don't how I screwed that up. I just recently upgraded to 3.1 from 2.1 and should know better. </p></div>		</li>
