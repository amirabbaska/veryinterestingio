			<div class="markdown"><p>Along with the photos OP mentioned, another big reason could be that there are simply more painters as;</p>
<ul>
<li>The world population is ~20 times that of the 1400s</li>
<li>Greater proportion of the population are artists instead of farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply having a greater pool of talent means there are going to better artists</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I wouldn't want to take away from the greatness of the Masters, I certainly agree. The pool is larger. Also, it seems that there is a more robust foundation for today's artists to draw upon. </p>
<p>The sheer accessibility of information from formal institutions to YouTube tutorials combined with the greater flexibility many people have in their career choices seems to increase the odds of greater talent rising to the forefront. </p>
<p>Reminds me of that idea about how many potential Einsteins never made it out of their village's rice fields, or how many potential Da Vincis were pigeon-holed into carrying on their father's trade/serfdom? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pool of artists is larger. The volume and access to art knowledge is greater. Tools like paper, paint, pencils, etc are cheaper and more acessible. Tools like computers and Wacom tablets  let you practice over and over easily fixing mistakes or starting a new picture over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And we have muuuch better tools. Way easier to be perfect with undo, redo, history brushes, shape builders, perspective tools, blend modes, custom brushes, many artistic electronic peripherals like tablets... </p>
<p>The Masters like davinci would call us wizards</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha! Adding musculature is no joke. My favorite example of that is the wall in the Sistine chapel depicting the Judgement day. Those women in that mural are HUUUGE. At the same time, a lot of artists back in the day used camera obscura. Im not sure when it came into common use by artists but I'm sure they could use something along those lines. But I do feel like you hit the nail on the head with the Greek ideals. Also they were incorporating so many innovations all at the same time (perspective, body ratios, innovation of oil paint, chiaroscuro) that they might have had to pick their priorities.</p>
<p>Edit: Read further, camera obscura was used. Should of read a little further. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The technology of the medium mattered too. Artists today have pencils, charcoal, pastels, paints, brushes, and above all paper and canvases that are orders of magnitude better than what was available in the past. Those don't make painting or drawing easier, but they do eliminate a significant barrier to expression. A modern comparison might be the difference between creating a photoshopped image on an old Pentium 1 running Windows 95, and creating a photoshopped image today - in theory, the same knowledge on both could produce the same image, but one makes it much easier than the other.</p></div>		</li>
