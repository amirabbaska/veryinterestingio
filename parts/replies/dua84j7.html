			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not both? This is ELI5. 5 year olds aren't expected to know compressing something makes it hotter unless they happen to really like diesel engines.</p>
<p>However, most 5 year olds know if they stick their hand out of a window of a moving car, they will feel the wind push on their hand. It's not much of a stretch to say if they were going fast enough, that wind pushing on their hand would cause lots of excess heat.</p></div>		</li>
