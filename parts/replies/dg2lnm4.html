<p>I can't eat for at least an hour after I wake up, or I'll feel sick to my stomach. Always been like that. Is that in some way related?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We metabolize food slower later in the evening than earlier, so late dinners are in fact a great way to Bulk.
Also eating sugary foods causes one to be hungrier faster than eating low sugar level foods.
Problem is, sugar is shit for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard this kind of claim many times but it makes no sense to me, maybe you could eli5 this for me. Slower metabolic rate at night means eating at night causes you to gain more weight? Why would it matter when you eat? If for example I ate one 2000 calorie meal each night, my metabolic rate would be slower immediately after I ate it, but the next day it would speed back up and burn the calories. Or if I only ate one 2000 calorie meal in the morning my metabolic rate would presumably be faster immediately after eating, but it would slow down at night again.</p>
<p>Weight should be calories in, calories out. How does when I eat change this equation?</p></div>		</li>
