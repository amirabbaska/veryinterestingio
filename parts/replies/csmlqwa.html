			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting how very close the predicted temperature at the cosmic inflation would be to the Planck temperature. Could be a fluke, but could also be that before this epoch (expected to begin only 10^-37 seconds after the big bang itself!), temperature would actually meet the Planck temperature. Seems to me that this would in turn imply that the quantum world must be connected with the larger scales, something that seems to not always be assumed these days.</p></div>		</li>
