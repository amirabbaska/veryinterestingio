			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems way more work to design them that way than to just make a square. Was poverty and lack of resources THAT bad in the past that saving a bit of wood was considered better than having to do way more work on the coffins? </p></div>		</li>

<p>For a skilled woodworker, the tapering isn’t much additional work time. 2 more side boards to cut, 2 additional cuts of the shape on the top/bottom, and 2 additional joints to secure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that much work. You pretty much have to cut the two boards on the sides in two and make a joint for each one, consider that most specialied works were performed since you were a child and it's easy peasy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, making it rectangular would have required more wood, which is more work too. Also, i guess that getting longer boards can be an issue too, if you didn't two 1.80 meters boards, joints were necessary anyway.</p></div>		</li>
