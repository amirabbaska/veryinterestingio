			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic fields do not just pull towards to poles. That is only half of the story. They also repel. That is one of the key differences between gravity and electromagnetism. Electromagnetism attracts opposite charges and repels like charges, while gravity is <em>always</em> attractive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A different question, but something I've always been wondering about:</p>
<p>You know in documentaries they show that spacetime is a 2d fabric with 3d imprints caused by gravity? Does it mean that gravity warps our 3 dimensions through the 4th or is it just a bad demonstration and it just warps in in 3 dimension. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 2D sheet warped in 3D space is only an analogy. It's a way to demonstrate the phenomenon in as relatable of a way as possible. Every analogy is inaccurate in some way. The actual mathematics that underlie the stretching of a rubber sheet look nothing like the warping of spacetime in response to mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it is simply an analogy given so that it is more easily visualized. Gravity bends the fabric of spacetime. Spacetime in tandem are four dimension, but these are three spatial and one temporal dimension. We do not have a 4th spatial dimension we can interact with, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't guarantee it's validity but I've found <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ctISI9v.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> to be a good visualization for 3D warping.</p>
<p>Though as others have said, time is a 4th dimension, just not a spacial dimension.</p></div>		</li>
