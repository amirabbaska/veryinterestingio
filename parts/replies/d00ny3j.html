			<div class="markdown"><p>The <del><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TauTona_Mine" target="_blank">TauTona Mine</a></del>*  is the deepest point a human could climb to (almost 4 km), but it isn't a straight drop. The deepest open mine is probably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_Canyon_Mine" target="_blank">Bingham Canyon Mine</a>, which drops about 1.2 km from the local surface. </p>
<p>* <strong>edit:</strong> TauTona has been passed up by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mponeng_Gold_Mine" target="_blank">Mponeng Mine</a>, as pointed out by u/Marrrlllsss below. They also note that the longest shaft is likely in another mine, Moab Khotsong. That shaft drops <a href="http://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v106n01p011.pdf" target="_blank">3.1 km</a>, which might be the deepest hole that a person could fall down.</p>
<p><strong>edit2:</strong> Since it was part of the original question, with air resistance a typical person would take ~60 seconds to fall 3.1 km in free fall. That ignores the finite width of the shaft which would increase the air resistance and assumes you could avoid bouncing against the walls. <em>Note: the difference between my 60 second estimate for a 3.1 km fall and the 50 second estimate at the top for a 12 km fall is whether or not you consider air resistance. 3.1 km is far enough to reach terminal velocity, so if you removed the air from the hole/shaft you would fall much faster.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current limits are around the 3 km mark for mine shafts, but those are long-term large excavations. If your objective was to create a short-term excavation with the sole purpose of dropping people, you could shrink down the diameter some (to around 6 metres, as an effective minimum for blind sink equipment).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our knowledge of rockmasses at depths greater than 3.5 km is relatively poor and the deep mines with excavations at that depth have problems keeping those holes open due to the seismicity created by the rock stresses trying to close the hole. As an aside, rock on large scale tends to start to behave a bit like a fluid rather than a rigid solid. It moves to fill holes and generates seismic events as it does. On top of that effect, you have the problem of the hoist cable not being capable of withstanding its own weight plus the rock you want to pull out. It gets heavier as you make it thicker to make it stronger and it actually performs worse. For a single sink, there is probably a maximum of 3.5 km give or take and for sesmicity and stability, I expect no more than 5 km (if you sink two shafts or make a huge muck storage excavation so you can set up again at the bottom to extend your reach).</p>
<p>Now that we've spent the better part of $1,000,000,000 and got our 3.5 or 5 km hole, how long does it take to fall down? Because we have only up to 5 km of the 6400 km or so Earth radius, the gravitational acceleration won't change much. The air pressure will go up (by around 30-50% or so, I didn't bother to calculate) but we can assume that the free fall velocity won't change all that much. We will also ignore the acceleration time, because it is insignificant and the change in velocity and shape of a person bouncing off the shaft walls on the way down, because I don't know how to calculate that. From wikipedia, the terminal velocity of a falling person is around 56 m/s giving a total of about 90 seconds for the 5 km fall.</p>
<p>Note: I'm a mining engineer working for a research company that thinks about problems around ultra-deep mining scenarios. All jokes aside, that billion dollars for a little bit of ore (spent years in advance of production) is a real problem for the mining industry and it is getting way worse as we use up our near-surface deposits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the longest straight drop is at South Deep which is 2,993 meters (9,820 Ft.). Might be diifficukt to fall all the way with the steelwork currently installed in it. They accidentally dropped a skip (metal enclosed bucket used to lift ore out) down it during construction when it was about 1600 metres deep from memory.</p>
<p>There was a famous accident when a train went down a mine shaft killing  100 people in a horrible fashion. The majority fell about 1600 feet but were in a passenger compartment which basically got crushed to virtually flat not that falling in the open would have made things more survivable. The cleanup on that would have been horrible.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They pump hydraulic 'drilling' fluid through the drill pipe which goes to the bottom and rotates the drill bit. The drill bit is wider than the pipe, so it creates space on the outside of the pipe that allows the drilling fluid to recirculate back upwards, bringing up the broken up rock fragments (or 'cuttings') with it. <del>So the pipe is not actually rotating, only the drill bit.</del> The huge pressure that the drilling fluid is under also supports the sides of the hole keeping it from collapsing, and the fluid lubricates the pipe to help it move freely up and down.</p>
<p>That's how its done when drilling for oil anyway, which often goes several kms deep. </p>
<p>Source: Geologist, and used to work on a oil rig. (A drilling engineer would probably have some minor corrections for me, but that's the general idea).</p>
<p>Edit: The directional driller below stated, the pipes actually are constantly rotating for a variety of reasons, including drilling. The method I described is apparently primarily used for directional drilling (not straight down holes) and for increasing drilling speed. Since all my work was on directionally drilled holes, I mistakenly thought the mud motor I described was a standard operating procedure, not the exception.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While the temperature gradient conformed to predictions down to a depth of about 10,000 feet, temperatures after this point increased at a higher rate until they reached 180 °C (or 356 °F) at the bottom of the hole. This was a drastic difference from the expected 100 °C (212 °F). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but we don't do that at these depths. I'm wondering if it would even be efficient to pump water down, and would it stay hot enough to efficiently spin a turbine. I guess the answer comes down to how far we could hypothetically drill and how advanced our technology was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work offshore on oil platforms.  One of the first wells I was working on had about 160 ft of water depth off the coast of Louisiana.  It was a 28,000 ft well, and temperatures were around 450 deg-F.  When we cored the last 90 ft, it was incredibly compacted sands with quartz veins in it.  It was a miserable well to drill.  By the time the drilling fluid came to surface, it was still over 160 deg-F.  I had to use really thick gloves to work with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I calculate it at about 217 seconds, assuming google is right about 56 m/s being the terminal velocity of a human body.  </p>
<p>To reach 56 m/s takes about 5.71 seconds per  </p>
<p>v=v0 + at  </p>
<p>Where a = 9.8 m/s^2</p>
<p>And during that time, you'd fall 160 m per  </p>
<p>dx = v0t + 1/2 (a * t^2 )  </p>
<p>So, 5.71 seconds to get to 160 meters, then another ~211 seconds to fall at 56 m/s the remaining 11,840 meters.  </p>
<p>This all assuming terminal velocity and gravity remain constant throughout the fall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terminal velocity is proportional to the inverse of the square of air density. 12 km below sea level air is about four times denser, so terminal velocity would be halved. If you dug a hole 30 km deep, terminal velocity at the bottom would be about the same as falling from a 3rd floor balcony (5 meters). That's most likely survivable, although the 200+ Celsius heat and 40 atmosphere pressure would get you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This means air resistance not taken into account. ONLY gravity was used. His/her calculation is correct given those premises.</p>
<p>Your value is more realistic. but we could argue about the terminal velocity of  a human given the weird conditions in a narrow hole at those depths.</p></div>		</li>
