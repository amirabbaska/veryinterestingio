			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I never understand when I see people saying &quot;blah my English teacher just read in symbolism in everything and it was so strained&quot;.</p>
<p>Bitch, your English teacher purposefully chose literature which is easy to interpret and full of <em>explicit</em> symbolism so you could actually learn something and start making effective arguments when you got to literature where everything isn't so obvious. Your English teacher wasn't reading too into things, you were or are just an idiot who didn't know how to read. I include my past self in this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish teachers would explain this, though. I think if kids were told why they are taught a certain way, they'd at least feel a little more ownership of what they're learning. My mom was going back to school to be an English teacher when I was younger, so I got a rundown of how and why lesson plans are developed from her. I could see why somebody going into your average classroom might feel like things are pointless. </p>
<p>Simply say &quot;This is like practicing scales. I'm teaching you in this obvious/boring way so in the long run you can easily get enjoyment and information from reading.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High school English teacher here. I have found that being transparent with students about why they are doing something or why you are assigning something makes them much more willing to work with you. At the beginning of every year I promise students I will only ever assign them things that have a purpose (no &quot;busy work&quot;). My explanation is proof that I'm fulfilling that promise. And usually, even if they don't like the reason, I think on some level they appreciate that I gave them honesty and respect. This, in turn, makes my job infinitely easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High school ELA teacher here. Most of the time, we have to be pretty explicit in the reasons for our selections because a majority of the students need repeated practice and guidance before the light bulb turns on in their brain. If we aren't deliberate and repetitive, many students will not get the necessary exposure to the literary devices they need to master them. </p>
<p>I understand how the canon is useful, but I also see how it can be viewed as boring and outdated. It's all in how it's taught, however. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that by teaching the obvious boring way makes students associate reading with boredom and turns them off of reading for a lifetime.  It's the worst possible thing they can do. </p>
<p>It ruins reading for the students and makes the teacher's job a repetitive rote regurgitation hell.  </p>
<p>If you want to teach someone chess, you don't encourage them to play by letting them win.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experience it wasn't so much as to reading too into things. It was more so students feeling peeved that their interpretations were incorrect and the author had only one specific interpretation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's totally legitimate to have a different interpretation from the author, and many English teachers could do better at teaching this. That said, I'd say most high schoolers (hell, me today as an adult) don't necessarily come up with <em>well-supported</em> interpretations, and I'm guessing the easy route for some teachers is to point to the author interpretation. Even though the author isn't really authoritative, they usually have a decent understanding of their own work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. My past self was not the brightest bulb in the box. I didn't appreciate any kind of literature until after high school. </p>
<p>My final paper for senior year English read like a bad Reddit rant on why Shakespeare shouldn't be taught in school. It was so bad my teacher made me read it out loud in class. He then ripped every argument I made to shreds while I babbled nonsensical half baked rebuttals. Obviously got on F on that one.</p>
<p>I would have failed that class but the administration decided to fire that teacher for no reason other than to prevent him from obtaining tenure.</p>
<p>Both middle fingers raised, he went on his computer the day he found out and changed every grade of every one of his classes to an A.</p>
<p>Learned a lot from that man. Thanks, Mr. S.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is (was?) an English teacher at my highschool who taught a senior elective Joyce seminar. Pretty sure he had them read Ulysses.</p>
<p>Mr Alessandri also had his science fiction classes read Dune, so he certainly didn't shy away from having high schoolers reading long novels.</p></div>		</li>
