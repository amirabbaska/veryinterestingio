			<div class="markdown"><p>Ductile materials don't crush, though.  They have all sorts of yielding mechanisms and can even rupture but never crush.  If you compressed a penny with an absurdly large force, it would deform until its thickness is minuscule.</p>
<p>In reference to your stress concentration answer, any elevated surface (edges of the coin, images, etc.) will flatten to the same elevation as the rest of the coin.  You're right, there will be concentrated stresses in those areas but every part will soon become one smooth, flat surface (assuming a uniform load).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all metals are ductile and stretch before breaking. It depends on the primary material, the alloying materials, the heat treatments it undergoes during the manufacturing process, etc. Copper is one of the most ductile materials there is, but there are also hard coppers. Alloys that are stiffer and don't deform much before failure. Alloys of iron also fit the same bill. There are many that can deform greatly before failure and others, like tool steels, that will fail under far less strain. A metal like magnesium is considered a brittle material. Lead on the other hand is a ductile metal. </p></div>		</li>
