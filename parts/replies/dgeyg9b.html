			<div class="markdown"><p>Without government backing of proper research programs, what you are saying is pure speculative fiction. This kind of stuff is thought up by people who take hallucinogenics and then reach revelations founded outside of reality.</p>
<p>We <em>should</em> study these substances. We <em>should</em> find out how they affect us naturally. However, to assert that DMT has anything to do with our inner voice, our consciousness, dreams, or our self-awareness is downright outlandish without solid proof. Right now it's nothing more than a fantastical dream that has been born out of drug use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no that's not nearly true. you aren't informed enough of the research that exists.  try to find the book &quot;The Hallucinogens&quot; by Drs. Hoffer &amp; Osmond</p>
<p>and stop recklessly accusing rather informed, educated people of not having the information just because you haven't seen it</p>
<p>much like &quot;just because you have a snowball in your hand doesn't mean there isn't global warming&quot;</p>
<p>DMT is an endogenous compound involved with regulating the heart rate and contractions during childbirth</p>
<p>that's research that's been published by PhDs, people do know this, even if you don't</p>
<p>if someone says it's there it's your duty to find it before recklessly discounting it</p>
<p>calling something fictional with no basis.. makes one sound like a defensive, disturbed person</p>
<p>why choose to be that way?   the most ubiquitous and potent psychedelic compound known to humankind is produced endogenously,</p>
<p>you don't want to know the elephant in your room?</p>
