			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing he forget to mention is that the &quot;strength&quot; of a soap often has to do with the type of surfactant used, but also its concentration. Dish soap is much more concentrated than hand soap, which is why is such much better at doing what it does, and at lower volumes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally someone who can understand my delight and frustration.</p>
<p>Delight- I got this one bar of blue soap in France. It lasted <em>months</em>.</p>
<p>Frustration- after it was gone I went back to Ivory or whatever. Those bars last maybe 2 weeks. </p>
<p>I understand about sneaky thieving p&amp;g making soap with shitty lifetimes intentionally. But what <em>was</em> that amazing French soap, why did it last so long, is that The True Lifetime of soap, and where do I get it? I want one case. Boom. I'm soaprich for a decade. (Tell me where to click and please accept bitcoincash.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The French mastered a process called &quot;milling,&quot; which repeatedly cooks the soap, ultimately eliminating excess water, and further compressing the saponified oils. This makes a very dense bar, and prevents water from being absorbed. A dry bar is a long-lasting bar. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Let it stand, exposed to air, for a week or two. </p>
<p>Put it to use, alongside a 'normal' bar of the same soap.  </p>
<p>The 'dried out' bar will last far longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where were you when I was in high school? </p>
<p>There was this kid in one of my classes. One day during a class discussion, he proclaimed that &quot;ALL soap is exactly the same thing&quot;, and that people who bought different soaps and detergents for different purposes were &quot;suckers who fell for marketing campaigns&quot;. </p>
<p>He then proudly announced that he used the cheapest bars of hand soap he could find for <em>every</em> purpose, including <strong><em>washing his hair</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Everybody in the class was too nice to say anything, but suffice it to say that this kid had the <em>grossest, nastiest</em> hair you can possibly imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stripping your hair of all its oils all the time actually makes your scalp dry out and shed skin cells and produce more oils to compensate, which makes it a lot greasier and smellier and makes it attract a lot more grime, and hold all those dead skin cells. </p>
<p>If you use a shampoo or soap on your hair, you should always use a conditioner to help replace the oils the soap stripped. Strictly speaking, never using a harsh chemical on your hair is best, using only a mild abrasive like sea salt mixed in honey is the healthiest. But that's not really practical for everything people do with their hair now. </p>
<p>I did the whole no washing thing for a long time, just using really hot water and a good, stiff fine bristled brush and my hair never looked or felt better. Up until I cut it short for work and started growing it again. My hair grows straight out and unless I use a thick pomade, I look like a chia pet, so I had to start shampooing it again to wash the pomade out.</p></div>		</li>

Meanwhile, I buy specialized shampoo / conditioner / products and my hair breaks and doesn't shine and puffs up in weird places. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandma used to use soap for brushing her treeth! I was a child and I did ask her why once; she did give me an answer though I have forgotten what she said. Being curious I once tried to use it, like she would have. It was disgusting! Like you would expect eating soap to taste like. She did have nice teeth though, so maybe she was onto something lol</p></div>		</li>
