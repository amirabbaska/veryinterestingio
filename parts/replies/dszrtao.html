<p>accrues interest (though not much these days)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in the 80s, you actually saw rates of 8-10%.  These days, you're  seeing 1-2%.</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> Yes, 1-2% are the best rates you can possibly get.  I know that everyone is actually getting less than 0.5% on their own accounts.  You can stop telling me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: changed APR from 1.2% to 1.4%. Evidently, it’s gone up since the last time I checked. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I really enjoy Ally and would recommend them. Easy to use, secure, and many different account types/CDs available. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc it was Japanese banks that were recently charging negative interest. Like -.05%.</p>
<p>So if you had money in a savings account it would slowly decrease.</p>
<p>Because they were able to borrow from their central bank for free so they had no need for your money and were charging customers to hold it.</p>
