			<div class="markdown"><p>We have both squirrels (Eastern Fox) and rats (roof) living in our back yard and they seem to fill almost identical niches - one at night, the other during the day - and follow very similar reproductive strategies. But the squirrel can live for a decade if it survives that risky first year, while the rat dies in two years no matter what. Why such different life spans? Does anyone know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Predation pressure, maybe?</p>
<p>Would a rat have a much smaller chance of avoiding predation for a decade, compared to a squirrel? Or more generally, is a rat's expected lifespan significantly more limited by something other than senescence, compared to squirrels?</p></div>		</li>
