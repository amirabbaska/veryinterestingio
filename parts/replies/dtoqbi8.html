			<div class="markdown"><p>And <em>more</em> tires, so there is a greater force of friction that can add to the deceleration factors. I know with a large truck that the ratio of inertia to road friction isn't the same as a passenger vehicle, but the number tires is still a significant factor in friction.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems very counterintuitive; but Although a larger area of contact between two surfaces would create a larger source of frictional forces, it also reduces the pressure between the two surfaces for a given force holding them together. Since pressure equals force divided by the area of contact, it works out that the increase in friction generating area is exactly offset by the reduction in pressure; the resulting frictional forces, then, are dependent only on the frictional coefficient of the materials and the FORCE holding them together.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a driver being lightly loaded makes it much harder to stop quickly. Believe it or not having some weight helps tires get better traction. Any time I have to bobtail ie ( drive without a trailer)  my ability to stop is inhibited because my traction has been compromised due to less weight or downward pressure on my drive tires. Plus a trailer gives you up to 4 more brake chambers &amp; brake pads to slow truck.
Driving a truck bobtail in rain is almost like driving a rear wheel drive car on ice. It's very dangerous.
And for those car drivers who see a truck length gap between a truck and vehicle ahead of them should really think twice about jumping into that gap. It's there so driver can react to a quick stop in traffic and not crush the vehicle ahead of them. And trust me when I say a loaded truck rear ending a small to normal size car can and will end up on top it that car.
I drive tanker so for me, I have a surge of product if I brake quickly. So not only am I trying to stop truck. I have 52000 lbs hitting the front end of the barrel of the trailer. Thus shoving the truck forward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: air brakes overheat very easily, and once overheated basically do nothing. To get around this, truckers in steep terrain will use their engine to slow the truck instead. How that works is a separate question, but basically the wheels power the engine, and when fuel is cut off (they to their foot off the gas in gear over a certain rpm) the Pistons compress and vacuum air to create resistance. </p></div>		</li>
