<p>You didn't give any units so I looked it up. Google says the diameter of the observable universe is 8.8×10^26 m. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still not sure what you mean, though. Do you mean the diameter of the universe is 8x10^73 times the diameter of a hydrogen atom? That's still waaaaaaay bigger than 8.8x10^26 meters, isn't it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, ou of the 52! Total decks possible, there are 4!=24 which would satisfy the goal, therefore the total chance would be
(4!)/(52!)=3 × 10^(-67).
If i'm not mistaken, otherwise it's
1/(4!*13!)=6.7×10^(-12).</p></div>		</li>
