			<div class="markdown"><p>June 2006 and I'm winding down my stint as ER computer tech to join the hospital IT department.  0930 and one of the housekeepers comes up to me wide-eyed and says &quot;FIRE!!&quot; Due to my position I think she means there's a computer smoking or something.  I wander back to the resuscitation room with her.</p>
<p>Nope.  There are bona fide flames on the floor, about 1' x 1' x 2'.  And they don't look like they're winding down.  I ran back to the nursing station and tell the charge RN and a CNA.  While they run to investigate I call public safety, who calls 911, who taps a full first-alarm commercial fire.  I go back to the room where the CNA is using an extinguisher, when he yells, &quot;GET ME ANOTHER ONE OF THESE THINGS!!!&quot;  I don't recall if it was out before fire arrived on scene or not.</p>
<p>In the investigation, they discover a trauma patient came through in the early-morning hours (0130-ish).  They used a disposable cauterizer on him.  When you're done you're supposed to snap the tip off and throw it in the Sharps container.  Someone didn't do that and tossed the cauterizer straight into the container.  Something caused the cauterizer to turn on and melt its way through the plastic and ignite it eight hours later.</p>
<p>It's a day I'll never forget, mostly because I learned how ineffective I am during a fire.  But I can accept that.  (RACE and PASS completely vacated my mind.)  And although I was the department computer tech, I only came in when necessary.  So when I saw the fire my first thought was, &quot;I need to tell someone who works here.&quot;  But the fire was put out without extending.  The room was closed for about a week, but we had three others so it didn't have much of an impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A major cause is Electrosurgery (ESU units).  It’s a common surgical tool that passes radio frequency current through tissue, causing it to separate or coagulate as needed.  Not only is there an electrical arc (a spark that doesn’t stop) between the tip and the tissue it’s zapping, but that current has to leave the body.  It’s a lot of power and if something goes wrong with the return path it will jump from the patient’s skin to the next closest path. This can severely burn the patient, igniting hair, gowns or bedding as well.  The high O2 environment increases the risk by making ignition easier and the spread of fire faster.</p>
<p>ESU tech is beyond great, this is just a downside/risk of it.   This is a common occurrence like car crashes are common.  There’s so many in use in so many places that accidents will add up, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t safe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take 100% pure oxygen. Put oil in it. It might spontaniously combust.</p>
<p>And the scary part: Take an O2 bottle, regulator, and O2 safe hose. Open the valves, now O2 flow. Light the end of the hose on fire. It will catch fire, and the fire will burn quickly inside the hose, back to the regulator, which might actually catch fire, as in the metal may catch fire, then travel to the tank, which can now also catch fire. And BOOM.</p>
<p>Steel definitelly does burn at 100% oxygen... Many other metals also does. Thing that is supposed to be fireproof often burn at higher oxygen level...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that elevation doesn't change the <em>percent</em> of oxygen in the air - it decreases total oxygen by decreasing the total amount (density) of air.</p>
<p>The sensation of breathing at higher or lower altitude isn't a tactile &quot;this feels thicker/thinner&quot; sensation, it just feels much easier to get out of breath when you're at higher altitudes than you're used to.</p>
<p>Other factors (humidity, temperature) typically also change with altitude. These changes do a lot to contribute to the overall sensation of high vs low altitude air. Kind of like how we don't directly perceive &quot;wet&quot; on our skin - we combine a bunch of related cues that typically mean something is wet (change in temperature, texture, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lower pressure at higher altitudes decreases the exchange of oxygen through the alveoli.  Your resting heart rate increases as your brain says &quot;Hey, I need more oxygen&quot;, you can become dizzy if you stand up too suddenly, every exertion becomes a struggle,
your thinking becomes sloppy and you stop caring about things (I've climbed to high altitudes).  Your body can respond by increasing the permeability and capillary pressure in the lungs which can result in pulmonary edema (HAPE).</p>
<p>That drop in humidity is also a big problem, more than people mention.  The very dry air at high altitudes can create terrible coughs, make you vulnerable to infection and make the lining of your nose and throat raw.  It can really ruin your day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to hammer home the point. The composition of the air stays the same despite elevation, 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, 1% CO2 and trace elements. </p>
<p>When you change elevation the air pressure changes, which ultimately changes the partial pressure of each gas the air is made up of. </p>
<p>For example, &quot;Normal&quot; sea level pressure is 1atm, 760 mmHg, or 14.97 psi. Of the 760mmHg 78% is nitrogen, therefore, the partial pressure of nitrogen (PN2) is 592.8mmHg and the PO2= 159.6mmHg. </p>
<p>Now let's take at a higher elevation lets say 30,000 feet, about the height of Mount Everest and some jets. The Atmospheric pressure at this altitude drops from 760mmHg to about 226 mmHg. Lets now look at the partial pressures at this elevation. PN2=176mmHg, and PO2=47mmHg. </p>
<p>For comparison, the partial pressure of oxygen dissolved in arterial blood is about 80-100mmHg.</p>
<p>Jet plane cabins are pressurized to about 11psi or 569mmHg, the PN2=443 and the PO2=119. A safe level of oxygen. When a cabin depressurizes, the PO2 drops to an unsafe level like listed above, which is why the masks drop from above, these masks supply a higher oxygen%. </p>
<p>Assuming they act as a non-rebreather type of oxygen therapy mask and it's assumed to be delivering 100% oxygen, and the cabin pressure is still at that dangerous 226mmHg, the new PO2=226 (given now the composition of the &quot;air&quot; you are breathing is no longer 78% N2 and 21% O2 but rather 100% O2), Realistically I don't think those masks deliver a true 100% oxygen but perhaps something more like 50%</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former submariner here. Most boats I was on struggled to keep O2 levels above 12%. It is very noticeable on crew morale and cognitive ability when O2 levels get too low. There seems to be a general malaise or fog that hangs over everyone. Vice versa when O2 is high. (i.e. chipper, peppier attitudes, quicker cognitive processing)</p>
<p>Of note: CO2 concentrations played a significant portion as well. Again, we often struggled keeping CO2 levels below 2%. Higher concentrations above that has a similar effect as lower O2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>12%?</strong> Holy crap, you had some terrible CO's. Are you completely sure about that? Former bubblehead too; I've spent plenty of time at around 17%, when you feel a little slow and doofy, and the smokers have a hard time getting their cigs lit (especially on a Zippo). But 12% sounds both dangerous and pointless - it's not that hard to run the EOGs for a couple hours a day!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fires are actually easier to start up here because of persistent dryness making things easier to catch on fire and burn. For example lightning is a common cause of fires up here, where there isn't always enough accompanying rain to mitigate the strike (or it's dry lightning).</p>
<p>Also curious to find out if a 3% drop in oxygen translates to things somehow burning less than they would otherwise, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pressure changes minutely on subs. They try to maintain a similar pressure as sea level because it would wreak havoc in the crew to keep shifting pressures.  The hull supports the full weight of the water up to “crush depth”. You would notice your ears popping slightly when making rapid depth changes though. The hull compresses pretty significantly.</p></div>		</li>
