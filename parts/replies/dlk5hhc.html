			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the association with gout and wealth had to do with lead poisoning in Rome. Many rich foods were coated in sauces that were made with wine that had been boiled until it was syrupy. It tasted better if you boiled it in a lead pot, instead of a copper pot. The rich people who ate these foods were more likely to get lead poisoning, and saturnine gout, which is the form of gout associated with lead poisoning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of my family back in the early 1900s were very thin. Being thin, at least here in the Appalachia area, was referred to as &quot;being poor.&quot; My great-grandmother used to say &quot;you're looking poor. Come eat something&quot; when I came by to visit. Being skinny was the norm. Being fat meant you were rich.</p>
<p>I would imagine this was even more pronounced in earlier times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Homo sapiens have been around for the past 200,000 years. We transitioned from hunter gatherers to farmers ~12,000 years ago. Meaning as humans we've spent around 94% of existence as hunter gatherers. </p>
<p>When we lived as hunter gatherers we were not necessarily lean. Sometimes we were malnourished, but more often than not we had a healthy amount of body fat. This body fat was not always distributed in a way that's considered attractive. </p>
<p>Here are photos of existing hunter-gatherer groups who have maintained their hunter-gatherer diet (though some have access to pieces of modern clothing). </p>
