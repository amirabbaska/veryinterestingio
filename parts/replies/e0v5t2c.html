			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't a sharp difference between &quot;the sun orbit[s] in a subgalactic disk with other stars&quot; and &quot;the stellar neighborhood [is] amorphously dispersed&quot;.  The former describes a spiral (disc-shaped) galaxy and the latter an elliptical galaxy, but these are smoothly connected by a single parameter: the aspect ratio.  I am pointing out that the Milky Way is about as close to disc-shaped as the solar system is.</p>
<p>Are you still confused about how my reply answers the OP's question?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I am still confused. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you're keying on the prefix, which is &quot;sub&quot;. You are describing the galaxy as a whole. OP's question is whether the solar system orbits around a <em>sub</em>-galactic center somewhere. As an analogy, our moon orbits around the sun, but at the same time it orbits around the earth--a sub-solar system center of orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should we use the average or the maximum (7Â°)? We wouldn't use the <em>average</em> distance from the central plane to judge galactic width (especially since that would be zero by definition).</p></div>		</li>
