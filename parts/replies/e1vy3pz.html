			<div class="markdown"><p>The explanation I’ve been given is that the polarized plug was originally due to the design of the type-A lightbulb socket (the Edison Base). On these sockets, the large sleeve that’s easy to touch you want to be not electrified, so you always want it to be the neutral. The little dot on the bottom is the energized.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the polarized plug forces the neutral to be the sleeve, and thus makes for a safer lamp. Especially because there’s no way to deal with this using a ground conductor.</p></div>		</li>
