			<div class="markdown"><p>Seismometers can pick up waves (vibrations) from earthquakes. From the time it takes different kinds of waves to reach seismometers at a different distance from the source, it can be deduced how fast the waves travel at different depths. Generally the denser a solid is, the faster waves travel. </p>
<p>At 'state transitions', for example from solid to liquid, waves are broken, just like light waves are broken when they pass through a solid or liquid. Transverse waves (s-waves) don't propagate through a liquid at all. This is how we know the outer core is liquid. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add to your great answer for anyone interested.  S-waves are a type of seismic wave, a body wave, that travel through the body of the earth.  (S-waves - stretch out a slinky and shake it side to side and watch the wave propagate with vibrations perpendicular to the direction of travel.) There are also body waves called p-waves.  (P-waves - stretch out a slinky and slap it on the end and watch the wave propagate with vibrations in the same direction as the direction of travel.)  Because s-waves aren't conducted by liquids and P-waves are, and because waves refract (bend) when moving from one type of material to another (due to the difference in the speed of propagation possible by the wave through a particular material), all this together creates what are called &quot;Shadow Zones,&quot; that is, regions of the earth &quot;opposite&quot; the location of an earthquake (actually a region between about 103 degrees either side of the focus) where S-waves are absent.  That told us that there was a liquid core.  P-wave refraction is a little more complex, but the fact that there are also p-wave shadow zones, together with s-wave shadow zones, told us that inside the liquid outer core there was a solid inner core.  This was worked out by many people but directly we can probably thank Richard Oldham (who discovered p/s waves in seismic waves) and Inge Lehmann (who figured out the shadow zone bit). And all that happened before WW2! We've never been there, but we know what's down there.  Science!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The diagram got me thinking. If I understand all this... the energy radiating from the molten core should be high enough to throw off light. </p>
<p>Has anyone ever done the math to calculate how bright the core would be if exposed? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luminosity (or power, in watts) is what we use to quantify the brightness of objects in space. The luminosity of a perfect black body is proportional to the body's surface area multiplied by its temperature to the power of 4.</p>
<p>Google tells me the core is 6000 degrees C, so 6273K, and has a radius of about 1220km so 1,220,000m. Surface area is 4 x pi x r^2 = 1.87x10^13 m^2. The constant of proportionality is the Stefan Boltzmann constant; 5.67×10^(−8 )</p>
<p>Putting these numbers in gives luminosity = 4.17 x 10^13 Watts*. Sounds like a a lot, but this corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 37.2, which is over a million times dimmer than Mars which is around 30. Magnitude is a reverse logarithmic scale by the way. Source: Astrophysics student.</p>
<p>*Edit: Calculations were off, it's actually 1.64 x 10^21 watts, or an absolute magnitude of 18.3, which sounds more reasonable for a  huge 6000 C lump of molten iron, but still nothing compared to a star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that the relevant quantity? </p>
<p>I (maybe mistakenly?) assumed that the question was &quot;If you drilled a big hole down to the center of the earth and looked inside it (probably assuming nothing came up the hole, and that the stuff at the bottom stayed the temperature it still is), how bright would it be to the observer 6400km away? Would it be visible? Would it be like a light bulb? Would it melt your face off?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, you start hitting mantle when the rocks become dominated by olivine minerals as opposed to granitic rocks.</p>
<p>This definition is a bit misleading though, because the lower crust and upper mantle behave similarly with a few important distinctions, such as density. The generally more useful distinction is between the (rigid) lithosphere and the (malleable) aesthenosphere, which is defined by temperature. The lithosphere includes the crust, and can thicken in areas of older crusts as mantle rocks adjacent to the base of the crust cool, become rigid and stick to the bottom.</p></div>		</li>
