			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why its seldom said is because there is a stigma about it. This used to be a somewhat popular pop-theory, called the aquatic ape hypothesis. </p>
<p>However, there has never been any evidence outside of cherry picked human traits that support the theory. And, virtually all the traits that were used to support the theory (big nose, propensity for obesity, ability to swim, etc.) have been explained better by other theories.</p>
<p>Our great ability to swim, and many traits that help us in the water seems really persuasive if you dont think about it much farther. However, we are even better at complex tasks like riding motorcycles and flying airplanes, but we clearly didnt evolve for those actions. The reason why it isnt talked about much is because support for the aquatic ape theory is largely based in fringe science/conspiracy groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You didn't mention the strongest &quot;aquatic ape&quot; argument -- the possible link between bipedalism and wading. It's a decent argument. Gathering food in marshlands and coastal or riverine areas would have required standing upright, which would have encouraged bipedalism. Even present-day chimps/gorillas stand upright when they wade. In fact, water is really the only environment that forces primates to stand upright.</p>
<p>However, the aquatic ape stigma extends to a stigma on considering wading as a cause of bipedalism. Which seems unfortunate, because none of the other explanations for bipedalism are particularly compelling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However it doesn't negate the effect it can have on the side.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but is there not at least something to the fact that we can go underwater while other primates can't?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But other primates can swim and dive. There are videos. Apparently chimpanzees just have to learn it. Just like humans. </p>
