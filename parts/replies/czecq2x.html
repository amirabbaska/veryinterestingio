			<p>I will never understand that. My German Shepherd can chose whether to stay inside or outside and he prefers outside even when the temperature is 10-20F. And often he chooses to lay down in the snow, for hours.<br><br>Yet some people reason that &quot;if it is too cold for you it is too cold for your dog&quot;. The fact is that dogs (and cats) are not people.<br>Now, a chihuahua is a different thing (and indeed it doesn't exist in the wild), but leave my German Shepherd outside when he feels like.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;When he feels like&quot; is the key here. When your dog is chained to a tree and can't get anywhere to warm up, ever, then you have a problem.</p>		</li>

			<p>absolutely.<br>for normal city dogs.<br><br>Some dogs actually have to stay outside (sled dogs in the artic). They can sleep just fine outside at -30F..-50F covered in snow and it is dangerous to have them in and out from heated homes. They just need to stay outside.</p>		</li>
