However, if there's something really distressing that's happened then the first thing that's affected is my appetite. That 'fight or flight' response kicks in and it feels like I physically can't eat and I know I was hungry af before the distressing event happened but eating is the last thing on my mind all of a sudden.</p></div>		</li>
