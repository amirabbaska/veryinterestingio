			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends, I prefer the Talisker 57N to the normal Talisker 10. It's also more expensive though, so I'm assuming they mixed in some Talisker that older than 10 with the stuff that's younger (or I'm just giving them pure profit, who knows).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. All the NAS expressions are very different, but they're unique. I am enjoying the extra choices but I don't like the inflating prices of the standard age statement expressions</p></div>		</li>
