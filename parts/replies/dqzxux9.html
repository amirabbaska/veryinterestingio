<p>The flu is one of the worst feelings I’ve ever felt when I got it without being immunized. It is absolutely horrible to get if you catch it full swing and will make you sure to mark your calendar for the next five years for getting your shot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, people often think they have had the flu. Really having the flu is hard to understand until it suddenly hits you like a truck. When I actually got the flu I really thought I was dying. To some extent, I’m not sure if I ever fully recovered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No... those who are overall healthy should also be getting a flu shot to help protect those who cannot get one. It also may help protect those healthy, young individuals from getting the flu. Bonus.</p></div>		</li>
