			<div class="markdown"><p>Crying also stimulates the milk &quot;let down&quot; reflex in a nursing mother. When my baby cries, my breasts tingle (the milk letting down) and then usually start to drip. I also know she is crying even if I can't hear her because my breasts begin to leak so I know something's up. For example, if I'm outside and my husband is caring for her inside the house, if my breasts start leaking I can walk into the house and sure enough she is or had been crying.
On a similar note, other peoples' babies crying will stimulate milk let down. My friend, who still breastfeeds her son, was in the room for my daughters birth and as soon as my daughter let out her first cry, my friends milk began to let down and within minutes her breasts were full. </p></div>		</li>
