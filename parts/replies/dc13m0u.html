			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, this may sound too easy, but the biggest challenge is finding the money to do the experiment.  The SETI Institute receives NO government money for its searches.  By the way, my family gives me the occasional hard time, but not about my job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the app broke one day and they never fixed it afaik     I had one of the largest compute clusters in the world (top 10 iirc) so I ended up moving to the Prime program and considered but never did folding@home.</p>
<p>Now, if SETI or another organization released a distributed imaging application that took coordinates and pictures from tellys at home I would plug that into my 10&quot; dobby goto in a second.   Imagine 10,000 goto 10&quot; dobbies all targetted to a single spot and getting a combined view of a target. </p></div>		</li>
