			<div class="markdown"><p>Well put. I'd like to share my own pet hypothesis, that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA" target="_blank">microRNA</a> (miRNA) sequences, which are modifiers of gene expression, can act as an added dimension to let an organism get more complexity out of a fixed set of genes. These sequences don't count as genes and were formerly assigned to the bin of &quot;junk DNA&quot;. I'll have to summarize this to an unfair extent, but humans and mice have a similar number of genes, and humans have 2,000 miRNAs, yet mice have only 1,000 miRNAs. So I suspect a lot of our extra complexity is derived from our doubled capacity to modify how our genes are used. If you try and correlate the gene count with &quot;apparent&quot; complexity, it often seems to be uncorrelated or anti-correlated. But the miRNA count tends to track with what we'd expect. And because of the question at hand, I looked up how many miRNAs are in corn: just 200, totally in keeping with this idea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having twice as much miRNA doesn't mean you have a doubled capacity to modify how genes are used. miRNAs are used for regulation of existing mRNA transcripts, but not in a way that's conferring any completely new functions. In general it's actually involved in destruction of mRNA. It definitely adds a level of finer control to the process but isn't greatly increasing complexity in the way I think OP is looking for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The power of selectively controlled expression of various combinations of genes <em>is</em> the power to confer new functions. Perhaps not at the intracellular level, but certainly at the multicellular level. A carefully controlled series of expression regulation events is foundational for development of organs, especially complex ones like the brain. Process control is nothing to write off; it can make all the difference.  </p>
<p>Your presumption is misguided: that greater complexity or more advanced function is brought about by more/better individual genes. The cellular/enzymatic function of many animals is comparable; the thing that sets them apart is how those cells work together. Humans aren't great at using tools because they have a more advanced tool-building gene; no such gene exists. Same goes for language. Developmental control via gene regulation is much more likely to explain our &quot;advanced&quot; function; not the improvement of some individual enzyme.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Epigenetics sort of falls into the same category, but via a different mechanism. MicroRNA evolution is not particularly responsive in an evolutionary sense, while epigenetic change can have generation-to-generation impact on phenotype. I'm not sure if an organism could survive if epigenetic regulation were wiped out, but I'm <em>positive</em> that a human could not exist without miRNAs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, my followup questions would be, what is the advantage of having more or less genes. You would think that having less genes would be advantageous because it would be more energy efficient, and having more genes would allow for a wider range of evolution, increasing the capacity for a successful organism (defined by the ability to reproduce), at the cost of a few outliers dying off because of increased rates of cancer (which weren't really a factor until we started living past 40 en-masse).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The number of genes isn't what determines complexity, it's how those genes are used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Functional gene&quot; isn't a protected term with a specific, defined meaning as far as I know.  In your analogy, the &quot;10 genes&quot; would be structural genes.  The &quot;10 different things&quot; is what I think OP means by &quot;functional genes&quot;.  I think the word <em>functional</em> is being used to contrast to the word <em>structural</em> to imply how many things are being done rather than a direct count of actual genes.</p></div>		</li>
