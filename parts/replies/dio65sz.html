			<div class="markdown"><p>With SSDs, painted over squares speed up the drive and make it last longer. When you buy a &quot;120GB&quot; SSD, it actually contains 128GB of space. But, if it shared with you all of its space it would die very quickly and get slow, assuming you actually kept it full.</p>
<p>In keeping with the analogy, imagine you fill up all of the boxes except one. Then you constantly erase and refill the only remaining box. Soon you will have a hole in the paper. :( Imagine if instead you vowed to only fill up 90% of the boxes. Every time you needed to write/erase one box you chose from the remaining 10%. Now your paper will last much longer before getting a hole. This is similar to &quot;write leveling&quot;. </p>
<p>To dive in a little deeper, imagine you only have a giant eraser. When you want to erase just one box, you will actually end up erasing some of the neighboring boxes as well. So when you are told to erase just one box you don't do it, because erasing all those boxes wears out the paper. Instead you fill in one of the empty 10% of boxes that you reserved for your special use. You also make a mental note that the one box you were told to erase, but didn't, is no longer needed. Over time you are told to erase more boxes. Eventually many neighboring boxes all need to be erased, and so at that point you go ahead and do it. This is quite similar to a how SSDs handle erasures. They have to dump a lot of electricity into a NAND cell to reset it, so much that it erases neighboring cells as well.</p>
<p>All of these things requires a little bit of extra space. If you told people you had 128 available boxes, you wouldn't be very efficient when people filled in all 128. But, if you said you only have 120 boxes, you can use the extra 8 for the techniques above. Plus, if you do end up wearing out one little box and put a hole in the paper there, you can just stop using that one. Instead of now having to tell people you now only have 127 boxes open, you can go on pretending you have 120.</p>
<p>Can you unlock the extra gigabytes? Yes, with custom firmware. But, it's counter productive. It kills your drive faster and slows it down quite a lot. It's worth noting no SSD has 50% of its space hidden. It's more like 6% of the space. I have never heard of the traditional platter drives painting over squares. They do however remove sheets (platters). So you can't unlock those because they are physically absent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they were asking more along the lines of if they artificially make the drive smaller, like a 500GB into a 320GB to save money by producing only one type of physical drive, not just having normal reserve space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another use of thoes hidden boxes is so when you do create a hole you pull up a fresh box to use and don't lose the space you can write on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that sometimes the painted squares are an artificial limitation, and that sometimes it's painted over because the painted squares were [analogy falling apart here] the wrong color in the first place? Like, overclocking sometimes works because your i5 might be an i6 with one of the drives disabled. Or your i5 might be an i5 because it was originally made to be an i6 and one of the cores didn't come out right. These components are so impossibly tiny and fragile, one little production flaw can make the whole thing unusable. But rather than waste the time and money it took to make the whole thing by throwing it away, or waste more time/money recycling it, they just sell it as a slightly crappier drive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how a lot of electronics are done. Even down to resistors. Resistors are made the same. Upon testing, you may find that a bunch of them perform at spec (+-5%). Some might be a little worse (+-10%). But some turned out better than expected (+-1%). You label and price them differently based on their tested performance. The same applies to larger electronic components, as in the example. It only makes sense that this can be applied to most electrical components small and large.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your understanding is not quite right. What you have said is of course true for CPUs, GPUs, and the like. But, it does not really apply to SSDs nor traditional HDDs. </p>
<p>SSDs are highly modular. SSDs are comprised of numerous banks of NAND flash that are soldered on to the board. Prior to being attached these cheap individual components are tested, if one doesn't pass it is not attached. This is different than a CPU, which is just one very expensive component. </p>
<p>As I understand it, due to legacy compatibility/performance HDD controllers are hands off when it comes to where on a drive data is stored. Thus the operating system has to handle corrupted sectors. If you ship a drive with a scratch on the platter, the first thing the OS will do is complain about all of the bad sectors. The drive will get returned. Thus, platter drives are checked for impurities with special lasers before being shipped off. Ones that don't pass aren't sold. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I am fairly certain this is the way of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can actually answer this. </p>
<p>Typically you'll find these 'Red painted squares' on every drive. When creating a HDD you'll always have some imperfections leading to slightly different storage sizes. What can happen over time with re-writing on these drives is these sectors 'squares' can fail whereby what was stored in that bad sector will be replicated into the unused 'red painted square area' slowly decreasing the size of the spare sectors on the HDD. </p>
<p>This is why HDDs have a life expectancy and some can achieve longer life than others.</p>
<p>Hopefully that made sense, I tried to stick to the analogy used as much as possible because it was a really good analogy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you won't find a 500GB HDD that is actually 1TB, it's usually more like 759GB or a weird number like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would need to use illegal software to re-enable a disabled disk. But a disk is usually discarded because of defects during process or because the data saved on it is deemed unstable. The company makes more money by selling more storage so there isn't too much reason to disable a perfectly fine disk.    </p></div>		</li>
