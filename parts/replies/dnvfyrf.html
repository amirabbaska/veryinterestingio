			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually, yes. It can get complicated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species" target="_blank">when two species can't interbreed directly</a>, but <em>can</em> both interbreed with the same related species:</p>
<ul>
<li>A can interbreed with B</li>
<li>B can interbreed with C</li>
<li>A and C can't interbreed</li>
</ul>
<p>Should A and C be considered separate species?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No because the genetic pools of both populations are still connected. But if B goes extinct, then A and C become separate species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's interesting. Also, you wouldn't call horses and donkeys the same species, but they can kind-of interbreed, creating mules...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, &quot;species&quot; is more of a comparative term. You say something is the same species if it's close enough to one thing, but if it's not close enough you say it's not the same species. Keep doing this and eventually you start getting some classification of species, but it's not perfect as there can still be the blending between. Usually over time the in-between things die out so it's less of an issue, but occasionally you still have stuff like ring species that make the idea of species less about an objective specific definition of one thing, and more about the comparisons between two things. </p></div>		</li>
