			<div class="markdown"><p>That organism would be one which uses a novel energy transport method, novel cell structure, novel membranes, novel everything <strong>except</strong> the genetic material is readable using the same methods as ours. Kinda unlikely.</p>
<p>Every living thing on this planet relies on the same list of available minerals and molecules we do and we all share basic solutions to get those building blocks into us. Look up 'ABC transporters'. Everything from plants to thermophillic bacteria use em as well as us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't a virus or a plasmid be so far removed from any eukaryotic DNA to be plausible to not share any similarity? Viruses have completely unique life cycles from anything alive with DNA that will code for those completely unique actions, and some plasmids just code for a single protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So far, everything we've found points to a single ancestor from which every living thing on Earth is descended.  But it's entirely possible that a planet could develop 2 or more entirely separate trees of life.</p>
<p>For instance, Earth life uses &quot;left-handed&quot; amino acids.  The amino acids that comprise all the proteins in our bodies could all be made the same way, just a mirror image.  I.e., &quot;right-handed&quot;.  For the most part, aminos with differing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_\(chemistry\)" target="_blank">chirality</a> would not 'fit together' right.  So left-handed organisms can't usefully consume right-handed ones, nor vice versa.  The amino acids are otherwise utterly identical, and there was no particular reason why Earth life should be left-handed except &quot;it just happened that way&quot;.  So now imagine that the primordial ooze spawned not one, but two self-replicators, only one was right-handed and the other left, and by luck neither was rendered entirely extinct (it could be this actually did happen on Earth, but only our ancestor survived).  Give it a few billion years, and we have two types of organisms that can compete for certain types of resources (water, air, sunlight, fixated nitrogen, soil, etc), or even cooperate for those or form symbiotic (or parasitic) relationships.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even better. You can order 'custom' genes from companies nowadays. They will build these genes according to your requests and they will even take genes that exist in the wild and 'optimise'* these for a host that was never intended by nature to have it, so the precise combination of A T G C will have never appeared before in history. When you search a database for that combination, nothing else even remotely similar will appear. </p>
<p>To find something naturally that has no similarity to humans, one only has to look for a structure in another cell which has no known human counterpart. For example, any gene which encodes a protein that builds the cell wall in bacteria is a sure bet to be millions of miles away, genetically, from anything that exists in humans seeing as our cells don't have cell walls. There are tonnes of other examples. Bacteria and human cells are quite a long way away from each other, genetically speaking. </p>
<p>As a side note (and only tangentially related to your question), researchers have recently created two new base pairs. Given the rather imaginative names d5SICS and dNAM. So whereas before, each codon (a functional unit of three nucleotides which encode for an amino acid) was limited to 64 possible combinations (4^3, four possible nucleotides in arrangements of three) the number of possible codons now shoots up to 216. Now of course, these two synthetic bases are technically useless seeing as naturally, cells can't do anything with them but the hope is that one day we can hugely expand the genetic library with them. </p>
<p>*If you want to know more about why they optimise things in this way, when researchers introduce DNA segments into an unnatural host, often the host will have a hard time actually dealing with that DNA. When it tries to create protein out of it, the new host can't organise it's tRNA (single amino acids that correspond to codons) correctly as they often lack the ability to do so. Frequently, more than one codon (clusters of three nucleotides) will encode for the same amino acid and different organisms have a different preference for the codons they use. So when introducing DNA into a foreign host, an optimised sequence helps researchers an awful lot but this has the side effect of creating frankenstein DNA that has no resemblance to anything found in nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reply while not directly answering the question outlines an issue in the initial conception of the question (or rather a perceptional bias within the question). This is super important and honestly what ask science should be about. </p>
<p>To continue from your point that the genome is the most-removed level of information, I think we have to understand and respect the changes that occurred in biology when rapid technological development was made in sequencing of organisms. This is true in all transomics but as you pointed, the level which DNA is removed is a level of sophistication that points to things like regulation of expression -- and in this way highlight a kind of logical code. This isn't emphasized enough in my mind that DNA is software, it has data structures, if we read papers on multi-fractal analysis of DNA and related patterns in expression -- we see the evolution of mechanisms that are stupendously complex and still a more complete understanding of their interdependence, their immergent relationship, still lays very much out of grasp (which is why I mention the great work going on with multi-fractal analysis)?</p></div>		</li>
