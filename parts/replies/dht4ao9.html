Saw Ben Klock &amp; Marcel Dettmann a few weeks ago in London &amp; they were superb. Techno's in the midst of a fantastic period right now &amp; it's a joy to be able to regularly see some of the very best DJs around. Great choices, man. :)</p></div>		</li>

In my view, they would go at the top of the technical list, even if the music is a bit out of date these days..

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, when you see an electronic musician billed as a &quot;live set&quot; on a lineup, this is what they will be doing. It's &quot;live&quot; in that they control individual elements of songs, perhaps playing keys or drum pads along with it. When they're billed as a &quot;DJ set&quot; they will have 2+ turntables that each control a complete song. Yes they are pressing play on pre-recorded songs, but they first have to choose a song with the right key and energy level, adjust the tempo to match, and start switching between songs at an appropriate time. </p>
<p>Live sets like described above require a lot of planning and setup, choosing which song elements will be used well in advance. Also ableton snaps these clips to the beat so the timing is never even slightly off. For this reason I personally feel like live sets are often a bit too rigid, whereas a dj can grab a new song and mix it in in the spur of the moment, and the occasional slip-up in timing makes it feel human.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, in order to actually &quot;perform&quot; a song, the artist has to deconstruct it, as much or as little as they choose, then reconstruct it live using controllers. I find that the more interesting artists have their music super stripped down, and they play almost the whole thing.</p>
<p>I love electronic music. I really do. But tbh  most artists' live sets are not very interesting to watch. When I'm at a set I don't even really pay attention to what they are doing anymore, I just dance and goof off with my friends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rules of DJing: Never lose the crowd.  Never let the music die.  Never be the reason someone stops dancing or bobbing their head.</p>
<p>Everything else is fair game.  Get as wild and crazy and unique as you want with it.  Grab some music you have a particular flair or affinity for and make the journey you take your audience on your very own.</p>
<p>DJ is an acronym for disc jockey.  Much like a traditional jockey, who rides or directs a horse versus doing the actual running, a DJ rides other music.  But think of a DJ as a jockey that is jumping from one horse to the next in a relay race.  Sure, the horse is doing the running, but it's the DJ that needs to be skillful in jumping horses.  You need the right pace, the right timing, the right angle, the right landing.</p>
<p>Beat matching!  DNB is around 170 bpm.  Hip hop tends to be around 85 bpm.  That's exactly a 2:1 ratio -- so they work well together.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gjQUkeNvJQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gjQUkeNvJQ</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZuYaJRcRBk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZuYaJRcRBk</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There exists similar such tempo compatibility between other genres.</p>
<p>I've seen DJ's switch back and forth between the same record at specific parts.  Cutting, rewinding, mixing, adjusting.  It's all about knowing the music -- every break, every frequency, every progression -- and then weaving your own rendition of it.</p>
<p>You can throw all sorts of frequency modifications and modulations into it.  Whether it's just selective attenuation via an equalizer, external audio filters making use of send/return jacks on mixers, isolating a sick baseline on one track that sounds great with another, having an emcee spit some amazing lyrics on a great beat, scratching, whatever.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter what the music is.  Technique can be anything at all as long as it's a unique and compelling musical progression from beginning to end.  Just don't let it end until your set time is over.  You don't want to lose the crowd!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is the actual answer to OP's question. There's little point in recording all at home and then just pressing a button. Even though it can work for easy crowds when you just play variations of the most popular stuff. You want to control the crowd. Make the attractive people happy and the weirdos go to some other place. Get the mood slowly going when people are still chatting, without disturbing them. Make them really happy when it's party time. And wind things down in a way that they stay happy but still know it's time to go (depending on venue - some would just switch from party music to night music and let people continue as long as there's enough left to support the bills).</p></div>		</li>

Apparently music at 100 bpm can sometimes be used to time CPR - E.g. &quot;Staying Alive&quot; or less appropriately, &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot; ?</p>
<p>I'd have to check though, it is only one article, so there is somebody more qualified who can check</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I've seen a ton of DJs in my time and way more do live mixing than hitting play. It's the same as Pop music for the super popular DJs though. They play premixed sets just like Pop artists play pre recorded music, because that's what those fans want. They want what they hear on an album or radio, so they cater to that. It really isn't the norm for DJs to hit play, just many of the really popular ones do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most DJs do just hit play and perform slight variations. Any DJ with a pre mapped light/projection show can't change anything.significant live because the music is mapped with the light show. You would be incredibly surprised how much of the knob turning and button pressing is totally fake and meant to get the crowd hyped up. SOURCE: I've worked too many of these gigs to count and the lighting designers have told me countless times how fake most DJ acts are.
TLDR: they do just hit play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not bad, I used to go to lots of EDM shows and it's really not about going to watch someone show off their live performance skills.</p>
<p>Mostly it's to have an amazing time with friends, possibly on drugs, while listening to music you all enjoy and hearing DJs debut new songs in the genre, both their own and others'.</p>
<p>There's a lot of skill and art in creating a mix, even if the vast majority of that skill happens in the studio and not on stage. For all I know, my favorite artists might have made the mix at home and just hit play while jumping around and shouting ad libs into the mic. But I'm okay with that, and it's not boring at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think calling the former artist (using Ableton or mixing in live synths/samplers) a DJ is misleading.  Those are producers. Producers who play live. Alternatively &quot;electronic musician&quot;. They aren't DJs though.</p>
<p>DJs mix tracks. The art of &quot;real&quot; DJs who mix in key, mix without automated beat matching, etc, without just hitting play, is a different discussion than producers who manipulate real or virtual instruments in real time.</p>
<p>It may seem a minor distinction, but between DJs and electronic musicians there's a clear distinction. Promoters and show production managers would need/want to know the difference too (makes planning an event different if you have all of one or the other or a mix of the two types of artists).</p></div>		</li>
