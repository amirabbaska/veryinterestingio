Well at least thats the case if you're living in the US.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with you. I have some kind of unfortunate intolerance to kimchi. I can eat a meal that includes it, drive home from the restaurant, and shit out essentially unchanged kimchi anywhere from one to two hours later. I respect that it takes time to form healthy stool, but there are definitely exceptions to that process as many people in this thread have said, and I'm still preeeetty confused on how those exceptions are possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup!  Went to a fish place. I <em>knew</em> the fish smelled/tasted, well, “fishy.”  And not in a good way.</p>
<p>We were on our way home and I told husband to stop.  TGI-JackintheBox!  So that was 20 minutes after finishing dinner.  Then again when we got home.</p>
<p>I normally go ever day, or twice a day.  I didn’t go for 2 days after that.  I guess “the tracks were empty and slowly being reloaded.”</p></div>		</li>

I suppose if you sit down and eat an entire jar, your system is going to join &quot;team fuck it&quot; and flush it out. Too much of a good thing... not so good for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe your body prioritizes what it wants to get out so crams the kimchi in the box cars that are already formed since that would be most expedient. Perhaps Kimchi doesn't require as much digesting. ??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As with the others I call bull on /u/huphelmeyer 's statement that it takes hours to make stool. </p>
<p>I have IBS and have literally had cases where I needed to shit before I was even done eating my meal, and I know for a fact that what I shat out was what I had not even finished eating. Corn is the easiest one to identify, but salad is another. Anything with alfredo has a 50/50 chance of doing this to me (which sucks, cuz I love alfredo). </p>
<p>In any case, the above statement is dead wrong! It can happen!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but you have ibs as you said, which is an exception. My girlfriend has ibs and no gall bladder, so I understand that food goes right through you sometimes. That isn't 'making a stool' though. It's not even close. It takes a while to assemble a healthy brown beauty, if you don't have some affliction of the bowel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to see a study in this because I'm finding it hard to believe the body manage to make chyme, absorb the nutrients and  remove all the excess water, with the body releasing enzymes to change to ph, moving it all the way through your colon to the rectum as faeces - in a matter of minutes. It takes  at least 40 minutes to digest food into chyme alone never mind anything else. You might shit but I'm pretty sure it's not the food you ate minutes ago.  </p>
<p>Anyone got any links to prove me wrong? </p></div>		</li>
