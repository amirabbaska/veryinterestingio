			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the question should rather be vise versa - the substance itself is flammable, but why doesn't it burn if in a compact mass.</p>
<p>-Because it can't get enough oxygen in air, and because it's effectively distributing the heat so no point becomes hot enough to start the chain reaction (anything burning is a chain reaction)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why metal powder (usually aluminum IIRC) is added to explosives to a cheap and easy way of boosting them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, especially because metal conducts heats very well. A plate of iron is almost impossible to heat to burning temperature, but iron powder makes for lovely sparkles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My acetylene torch begs to differ.  </p>
<p>Fun fact, once the plate starts burning where you want to cut, you can turn off the acetylene, and the cut can be finished with just pure oxygen...</p>
<p>Although, if you're talking about setting the whole plate ablaze ... Yeah totally agree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, even substances like gasoline combust more readily when aerosolized (the fuel that's introduced into the combustion chamber in an engine only produces the level of power it does because it's sprayed in as a fuel/air mixture).  </p></div>		</li>
