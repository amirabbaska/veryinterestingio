			<div class="markdown"><p>Important too:</p>
<p>Hawaii has iron-rich rocks that are bad at forming plugs. Magma boils up, retreats, and the next time the magma boils up it can melt the old magma too. Any plugs that form are weak, and tend not to let too much pressure build up. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%ABlauea_Iki#/media/File:Kilaueaikimagmabudget.gif" target="_blank">It can be dangerous and cool when pressure is relieved</a>. </p>
<p>Yellowstone, like Mt. St. Helens, has silica-rich magma. It boils up and retreats, the remaining magma solidifies into strong rock that won't remelt with the next boil up. These can form strong plugs, allowing pressure to build behind them. When they fail, the fail catastrophically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This my concern... I live on BigIsland.  If the crater falls in it may not plug, but the ash and burping affective is my concern.  </p>
<p>The new reported concern is also about the water table surrounding the crater.</p>
<p>My simple math looking at nearby well depths and water table elevation.  Shows the drop in the lava lake .... Is now around 3100 ft. Elevation.  This is approx 1500 ft above a nearby water table well elevation.  FYI well data is on GIS sites.</p>
<p>The lava lake has dropped over 900 ft in last week...</p>
<p>It was reported he lava lake was dropping 2meter per hour a few days ago...when it get closer to the water table the surround layers of rock and condition can change and who knows what can happen.</p>
<p>If the ground is hard and dry it will stick together but if water starts to loosen it up????</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it reaches the water table or around that time what can happen is that the water in the surrounding rock will vaporize and cause a large steam explosion. Which will likely cause a larger crater to form and might cause changes in the plumbing around the volcano that are impossible to predict. </p>
<p>It is difficult to say if it will reach the water table or not because we don’t know much about the source of lava at Halema’uma’u. </p></div>		</li>

<p>. [Nasa]They believe the most viable solution could be to drill up to 10km down into the supervolcano, and pump down water at high pressure. The circulating water would return at a temperature of around 350C (662F), thus slowly day by day extracting heat from the volcano. And while such a project would come at an estimated cost of around $3.46bn (£2.69bn), it comes with an enticing catch which could convince politicians to make the investment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170817-nasas-ambitious-plan-to-save-earth-from-a-supervolcano" target="_blank">“Yellowstone currently leaks around 6GW in heat,” Wilcox says. “Through drilling in this way, it could be used to create a geothermal plant, which generates electric power at extremely competitive prices of around $0.10/kWh. </a></p>

<p>This is the part to really emphasize. You've basically got one water balloon the size of an apple, and another one the size of a house. </p>
<p>The volcano under Yellowstone is fucking MASSIVE. If it blows, the eruption will be so large it'll drastically affect the entire planet. </p>
<p>With other volcanoes like in Hawaii, it's just not nearly as big, so even if it did 'pop' all at once like a water balloon, the eruption wouldn't be nearly as destructive. You'd get a little splash of water as opposed to an an entire swimming pool's worth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! The four states that are above it will pretty much be a completely changed landscape, everyone in it probably getting obliterated. The states surrounding those might get hit by a pyroclastic flow (what happened in Pompeii) or will probably get caked with several meters of ash. There would be a hefty layering of ash for a greater part of the mainland USA, I think the only ones that could avoid it being states like Maine, Florida, and Washington. This event would cause the greatest evacuation/mass migration known to man kind as the entire western half of the US would probably have to evacuate, along with a bit of the Midwest. </p>
<p>Several species local to just the states surrounding Yellowstone would likely go extinct, with other animals probably going extinct too due to the impact of the eruption on earth’s climate and air composition. Humanity would most likely survive unless it ends up being way more insane than its thought it will be, but it would take a bad hit as temperatures worldwide would drop a few degrees. </p>
<p>Also lemme just say I’m just a geology nerd, not a geologist. I’m just repeating what I heard in one of my two HS geology classes when we had a discussion about super volcanoes one day and looked up information about it. Plus info from YouTube videos I watched more recently. So I might have gotten some information wrong, but this is what i remember.</p></div>		</li>

Not sure how accurate this is, just saw it on Youtube the other day, but the TSAR Bomb (fuck off big nuke) is estimated 50MT yield and the entire worlds nuclear stokepile detonated at once is supposed to be about 7,000 MT as a comparison. Well Yellowstone eruption is supposed to be something to the order of 875,000 MT. </p></div>		</li>
