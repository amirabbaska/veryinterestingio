			<div class="markdown"><p>How appropriate would it be to say that Satan in his earlier representations is more of a &quot;challenger&quot; that acts under God (not resists him in the miltonian tradition) to test people with hardships. </p>
<p>As in Job. In Christian re-enactments the exchange with yahweh and Satan in the beginning is interpreted as challenging and adverserial but that might not necessarily be the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Job always made me laugh. God sees a good man, and punishes him to win a bet. The devil tries to help him because the bet is unjust but God just ups the ante and punishes Job more. Kills his family, burns all his stuff, covers him with boils etc. Man doesn't take the devil's help  and God turns round and says 'See, I told you I was the good guy, this guy still loves me and I just ruined his life for lols'.  </p>
<p>And somehow. Somehow. Billions of people see the devil as the bad guy in this story.  </p>
<p>But to answer your question, pretty appropriate when translated to english and Latin, however in the original language the title is used as more of a denigrating insult. Almost sarcastically from what I was told (hence the confusion as to whether or not it was a proper name). I wouldn't know for sure, translating 3000 year old dead languages isn't particularly easy and there's only a handful of people in the world that would understand the intended tone/context of what was actually written. I am certainly not one of them. I struggle with English and I'm a native speaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the language, it's the culture.  Understanding Judaism helps to understand the cultural context of the Old Testament, understanding the culture and history of the time also helps, as does understanding the Tanakh as it sits today since it has so much historical commentary that can add context from historical time periods as to why different revisions occurred and how people have seen the verses across time.</p>
<p>The long and the short in this example is that Job is a Judaic text; there isn't a devil in Judaism in the way Christians see it, just one or more angels tasked by God to test man.  So the being in Job is an angel commanded to test Job.  Here's one source just to get a feel for the Jewish perspective. <a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/satan-the-adversary/" target="_blank">http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/satan-the-adversary/</a>.</p>
<p>And another just talking about &quot;Satan&quot;.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends if you mind looking at primary sources or not and if you want to look at multiple religions (he's in pretty much all of them in a manner of speaking). A good jumping off point would be:  </p>
<p>The Bible (New Revised Standard Version)<br />
Dante's Divine Comedy.<br />
The Complete Works of William Blake.<br />
Paradise Lost by Milton.<br />
Faust by Goethe.<br />
Faustus by The other guy who wasn't Goethe.<br />
The Qur'ran.<br />
The Torah.<br />
The Talmud.<br />
The Haddith.  </p>
<p>Scholars who wrote extensively about evil/satan:<br />
Enoch.<br />
St Augustine of Hippo.<br />
Origen.<br />
Leibniz.<br />
Epicurus.<br />
Irenaeus.<br />
John Hick.<br />
St. Thomas Aquinas.<br />
Martin Luther.<br />
John Calvin.<br />
St. Justin the Martyr.  </p>
<p>I'm sure there's plenty of modern scholars that summarise all the above perfectly well but I couldn't name any off the top of my head. It's a whole thing. The focus in primary texts isn't on the devil specifically, it's about evil on general. Satan is just kind of used as an example of shit God shouldn't be able to do in Theodic arguments. It's a huge rabbit hole that ties in to church politics, language problems (both logic problems and translation problems), Church history, political history.  </p>
<p>Basically all religion is utter nonsense, God isn't real. All Abrahamic religions are glorified sun worshipers and morality is moot. That's what I took away from 4-5 years of study and my £40k. My advice, don't even bother. It's morbid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think I could dedicate that much of my time in to learning about religion. But I do find it quite interesting to learn of how it developed. I came across the Latin definition for &quot;lucifer&quot; in a biochemistry book that was talking about an enzyme called <em>luciferase</em> (it makes bacteria luminescent). And, that's kinda what got me wondering about the word's history.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bart Ehrmann, Richard E. Friedman, Geza Vermes are some of t he more accessible (both in libraries and in readability!) authors in Biblical scholarship. NT Wright and John Dominic Crossan are also good and use solid info, but they are theologians by profession, not textual critics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun fact: Of all the characters associated with Satan in the NRSV edition of the Bible, not one of them ever tells a lie. The devil always tells the truth (which probably had a significant impact in tying him to the Lucifer story from Enoch).</p>

<p>NRSV Gen 3:</p>

<p>Spoiler: they died, and the snake is associated with Satan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to that origin story,  didn't death actually not exist at all before eating the fruit (which of course doesn't make any sense, why would he reference death if it didn't exist)? Do you think he was promising she would literally never die of she ate it? It seems fairly obvious that &quot;you will not die&quot; was meant as &quot;you will not die immediately as a direct consequence of eating the fruit&quot; rather than &quot;the fruit will grant you eternal life. &quot;</p></div>		</li>
