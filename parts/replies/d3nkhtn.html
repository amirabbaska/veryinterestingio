<p>Safety and OSHA and more complicated buildings (cable/internet) are a big factor, but just imagine driving in New York City with a Prius. Now imagine driving in with dump trucks and semi trucks and giant cranes. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Cable and internet would be a minimal factor if at all. That's all interior finish work and can be done at the same time as all the other interior finish work is being done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, I'm doing this currently as an electrician apprentice, but I think what he means is there's just more being put into buildings now then there ever was. Cable/internet was a poor example, but think of all the new modern amenities that almost all newer buildings are featuring. From cable/internet to more outlet receptacles in almost every room, more complicated elevators, automated lighting and doors, the list goes on and that's just the electrical aspect. Each trade now also needs more specialized workers to complete these specific tasks too which slows the process as sometimes there aren't many.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, probably for good reason. They have people die every year from crane accidents.</p>
<p>Though I'm not sure if permitting is really the problem there . . . </p>
<p>From what I've heard the regulations are crazy. Then again, deaths and injuries are down this millennia so . . .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not just that.... TRAFFIC and even MANEUVERING the damn things.  Especially in the Financial district, where some of the streets are over 300 years old and narrow as fuck.</p>
<p>a lot of times they need to shut down several whole streets to get the equipment in, and even THEN it's a major test of the driver's spatial coordination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I'm qualified to say <em>why</em>, but apparently the original WTC had significantly more deaths in construction than the ESB.  <a href="http://www.forconstructionpros.com/blog/12096401/looking-back-on-the-worlds-deadliest-construction-projects" target="_blank">5 vs 60</a></p>
<p>Granted, that could be due to many factors.  But it doesn't appear that construction today is any safer, despite OSHA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was also a lot of plans regarding the 9/11 museums, new path, and other WTC complexes.  It wasn't really just one building.  Keep in mind there was a national tragedy, clean up, and they didn't want to slap a new building on top of it right away</p></div>		</li>
