			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too. Sadly as i've gotten older, that feeling has given way to despair when I know I should be in bed by midnight but it's 2 or 3 oclock in the morning like I can't believe how late it is and now it just makes me stress :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, you took the words right out of my mouth. I feel like I'll miss something. I hate going to sleep when it's dark out. I would rather go on a bike ride, or a walk, or just sit outside and smoke a cigar. I prefer the darkness. I feel comfortable, less anxious, like I belong when it's dark and uninhabited outside. I, too, can sleep half the day away and not fret it. Sucks that I now work days. I prefer night shift but my wife wants me home at night now that our only son has moved out. <em>sigh</em> </p></div>		</li>
