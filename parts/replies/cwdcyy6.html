			<div class="markdown"><p>They making very small adjustments right now but have said they have no intention of reducing the quality of life for Saudis and any reduction they make will translated to basically a drop in the bucket. </p>
<p>I believe the article I read stated their budget is manageable if they are selling oil at $104/barrel. Right now its sitting around $47 and its still sinking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can produce profitably around $17USD/bbl. They just can't produce <em>as</em> profitably.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn't mean they are balancing a budget at that point but that's because they spend profligately. If oil doesn't recover they'll just need to rein in spending some and honestly, if there is one country on Earth that <strong>can</strong> do so, it's them. Not to say they will but they certainly have the tools to do it.</p>
<p>The hype that the house of Saud is in danger of bankruptcy is just pipe dreams at this point.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's also worth noting that SA has actively chosen to keep oil prices low, and US oil producers have been giving up on operations as unprofitable.  They are pulling a macro-scale &quot;Wal Mart&quot; strategy.  Sell low, drive the mom and pop shops out of business, and own the market down the road, rather than focus on profit this quarter.  When oil prices rise in a few years, there will be fewer players in the game so the Saudi's will have more control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that their domestic stability is dependent on huge transfer payments from the government.   </p>
<p>If they cut payments, they risk civil war not unlike what's happening in Yemen.  If they cut military budget, then Yemen falls to the Iran-supported Houthis, and ISIS probably starts to think that they'd do a better job of running the region than the Sauds.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is how much they can lower the budget but still keep the crazy contained. When the Arab Spring happened, they dealt with it by throwing money, lots of money, at the problem. It remains to be seen if they can maintain social control for half the price.   </p>
<p>At present, it looks like they are trying violence and intimidation. The big jump in beheadings this year could just be coincidence, but I doubt that. </p></div>		</li>
