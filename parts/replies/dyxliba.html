			<div class="markdown"><p>True. I posted this some where else, but I'd like to add that foods with high water content can satisfy or prevent mild thirst as long as it is truly a minor need for water. High water foods includes, fruits and vegetables, generally (Bananas and potatoes are high starch, low water so there are exceptions). </p>
<p>Many foods consumed outside of fruits and veggies require more water to digest than they provide, often aiding in dehydration. </p>
<p>Oh and sugar dehydrates as well. So soda/juice is a temporary feeling of hydration.</p></div>		</li>
