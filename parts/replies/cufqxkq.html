			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh... Wasn't this Susskind's idea?  When Susskind heard Hawking's original idea about blackholes eating information he wasn't happy with it, so he did a lot of research and proposed that everything that enters the blackhole leaves it's information in 2-dimensional form on the event horizon.  Something about outside observations seeing time stop at the event horizon forces this to occur.</p>
<p>I won't pretend to understand it, but there was a documentary about Susskind's disagreement with Hawking over information-loss at the black hole and what you just described as &quot;Hawking's idea&quot; sounds like Susskind's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, Susskind convinced Hawking that information is not lost and that is when Hawking conceded his famous bet. But the details of how this occurs lie in the theory, the exact mechanism is not known. It's not fully clear yet, but as far as I can see Hawking is proposing that he can now calculate how the information is imprinted on the horizon in the form of super translations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. </p>
<p>I think a decent analogy would be if you are trying to swim up a river whose current gets faster and faster the further downriver you swim. Your swimming speed is consistent and nothing can swim faster than you. Let's call your swimming speed &quot;c.&quot; </p>
<p>There is a certain point on this river where the current is exactly &quot;c,&quot; your swimming speed. Anywhere upriver from there and you will be able to swim upriver against the current, but anywhere downriver from there you will lose to the current. Let's call that point the &quot;event horizon.&quot; </p>
<p>Now you float down the river with a thousand of your clones with one clone starting to swim every second. Those clones who start to swim before reaching the event horizon make it upriver and those clones who start to swim after the event horizon get sucked downriver. The clone who starts to swim exactly on the event horizon will stay there forever.</p>
<p>Since &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light and it is a constant, anything that crosses that event horizon whilst emitting light, radiation, or any other form of information that travels at &quot;c&quot; would leave an shadow stuck on the event horizon. </p>
<p>At least that's my best understanding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually really helped me, thank you.  Perhaps my next question is a failure in the analogy and perhaps not i genuinely want to know.   I realize in the analogy the swimmer would stay in place forever assuming infinite energy, but obviously light and matter do not have infinite energy so how or why would they not travel further into the black whole once the gravity overcame the energy of the thing it's pulling in? Why would it get stuck?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question, but this is where they analogy breaks down. The swimmer does need energy to swim, but light isn't consuming energy as it travels through space. My understanding, which is limited, is that light is how you transfer energy through space. It isn't consuming energy as it goes. It doesn't sort of give up or slow down somewhere between point A and point B if those points are too far apart. It just keeps going until it hits something that it can give its energy to. </p>
<p>On the event horizon, however, it would basically be static. It would never reach anything to which it could transfer its energy. </p>
<p>Unfortunately here my understanding of this topic is reaching its limit. I'm happy to clarify anything that I've said and answer any other questions that you have, but this topic is really one that is suited to /r/askscience. Those guys know their stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the matter per se in this case, but rather the information contained in the light/radiation emitted by the matter that is getting sucked across the event horizon. Of course, if we were talking about a spacecraft with a finite supply of energy, it would eventually lose to the current. However, what would never lose to the current would be the light/radiation that was being emitted from the spacecraft at the exact moment it crossed the event horizon. And the reason for that is that radiation/light is traveling at <em>c</em> (the speed of light) and the event horizon is defined precisely by the point at which things traveling at <em>c</em> get stuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that really the same amount of information, though? If a single atom contains information i.e. on the position of the electron, this information would not be projected onto the surface.</p>
<p>So, don't we still lose a large amount of information in converting from 3D (+ time!) to 2D?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd have to take this up with Hawking. According to Hawking, the information is there, just jumbled and unrecoverable. To me, it makes more sense to say it isn't there anymore, but quantum mechanics has its own peculiar definition of &quot;information.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good analogy (IMO) that I read earlier was originally it was thought that information is destroyed when it enters a black hole, which of course violates the laws of physics. Think a dictionary being thrown into a fire, the book is burned and the information is lost (except black holes don't burn things, they just disappear.) Now the theory is saying that it's more like throwing a dictionary into a wood chipper...it is no longer a book so technically it is gone, but the information is still there scattered among the tiny pieces of paper, making it incredibly unlikely to obtain any information from it. </p>
<p>I hope I explained that accurately to how I read it. I do not for the life of me remember where I saw it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok why can't you destroy information? How does destroying information violate the first or second laws of thermodynamics? If anything I would think it supports the second law of thermodynamics, that entropy increases. Being smushed into a black hole doesn't eliminate the matter, or the energy of the original substance. Unless I understand black holes incorrectly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, technically, there's no reason you can't destroy information, except that you can't.  If you could, cause and effect would cease to have logical certitude.  Quantum determinism holds that given any initial state in which you have perfect information, you can determine any other state-- past, present or future.  This is because the backbone of physics is cause and effect.  If information is lost in black holes, you can never have perfect information in any universe that contains them, and therefore quantum determinism is false... which means the study of physics is deeply flawed at a fundamental level that cannot be fixed or worked around.  And that kinda destroys our understanding of reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't destroy the information. You separate it into smaller pieces.    Theoretically if you burned a book, there would exist the possibility to take every piece of smoke from that book and piece it back together to create that same book. Or somewhere somehow, all of that same matter could form back into a book, if it wanted to. </p>
<p>The information will never be nothing. It will always be something. And all those somethings made the book in the first place. So they could turn back into a book if the conditions were right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can destroy information in that if you burn a dictionary you can no longer read the words printed on it. But you can still determine from the ash/smoke/remains what the book was original made from. That's the kind of &quot;information&quot; you can't destroy. Even though it's changed from a tree to a book to ash you can still tell that it was originally paper/tree from the ash remains.</p></div>		</li>
