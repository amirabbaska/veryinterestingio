<p>might actually be easier to build it in space where everything will get sterilized as you go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's a bit intrinsic by our nature. We can't live without being a macro-organism, as bacteria are responsible for protecting our skin and intestines from <em>worse</em> bacteria and aid in our breaking down of food.</p>
<p>Without them, we would have been eaten alive ages ago..</p>
<p>So how does one produce anything without humans?</p>
<p>The technology isn't there yet, but I propose tele-present frames and self-assembling metamaterials. </p></div>		</li>
