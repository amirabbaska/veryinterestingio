			<div class="markdown"><p>Other answer is wrong.</p>
<p>A significant number of people have a mutation that causes their taste buds to perceive cilantro as 'soap'. People without that mutation perceive the taste as slightly tangy and leaf-y and citrus-y.</p>
<p>It's only a small part of the population that tastes cilantro as soap, but it's a really loud one because soap tastes <em>really</em> nasty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of what you &quot;taste&quot; is actually perceived by your olfactory system. Anything that is a volatile compound gets pushed to the back of your throat into your sinuses and is perceived as taste. Your brain interprets these differently than chemicals that enter through the nose which are interpreted as smells. It's why lemons and limes taste different even though the majority of the flavor your tongue can sense is sour. The volatiles are different. It's why flavors can be far more complex than a combination of 5 flavors.</p>
<p>I originally deleted this because it got downvoted, but fuck it. The other posters, though they say others are wrong, are not giving you the full truth. Super tasters are a thing. But research indicates cilantro is mostly an olfactory response situation.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriander#Taste_and_smell" target="_blank">From wikipedia</a>:
Twin studies have shown that 80% of identical twins shared the same preference for the herb, but fraternal twins agreed only about half the time, strongly suggesting a genetic component to the preference. In a genetic survey of nearly 30,000 people, two genetic variants linked to perception of coriander have been found, the most common of which is a gene involved in sensing smells. The gene, OR6A2, lies within a cluster of olfactory-receptor genes, and encodes a receptor that is highly sensitive to aldehyde chemicals. Flavor chemists have found that the coriander aroma is created by a half-dozen or so substances, and most of these are aldehydes. Those who dislike the taste are sensitive to the offending unsaturated aldehydes, while simultaneously may also be unable to detect the aromatic chemicals that others find pleasant. Association between its taste and several other genes, including a bitter-taste receptor, have also been found.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ah, so MSG is the right shape for umami, and the sodium ions trigger the salty ion channel just a bit.</p>
<p>Do you know if there is anything that gives a pure umami taste? (Hopefully something nontoxic and easy to obtain.)</p>
<p>EDIT. Plenty of misunderstandings here. The taste of MSG is umami + a little bit of salty. I'm asking if there is anything with a <em>pure</em> umami taste. That would not be MSG, as it is a little salty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. It's called MSG.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trigger isn't really the best word, it's more correct to say that sodium passes through the channel because it has the right shape and charge</p>
<p>And as for umami, the current thought is that what we detect is glutamate, which is found in high concentrations in cheese, meat, mushrooms, soy products, etc. But really, the most direct source is MSG, which is monosodium glutamate</p></div>		</li>
