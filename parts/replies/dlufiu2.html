			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a room where I worked years ago like this. It was essentially a grounded metal bunker. The company developed and built pulsed-power systems that generated short but massive spikes of EMP and/or radiation (depending on the device). </p>
<p>That said, it is possible to design a cage that is more selective in the frequency range it blocks, but still limited to being a cutoff (stop frequencies below a given frequency), since higher frequencies have a shorter wavelength and could be allowed through (small enough to make it through a given mesh) but not the reverse without possibly using a waveguide of some form.</p>
<p>I should note that grounding is critical for a faraday cage to work. I don't think a signal could pass through a 'floating' cage, but the energy absorbed would be released back out as radio noise unless a damper/choke of some sort was configured to drain the energy off (someone with a background in electronics could probably clarify/correct those details).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would take a lot of resistors.  Or, you can ground it to a copper rod driven 3 feet into the ground.  A pulse will make the cage oscillate until resistors have damped out the signal for your example.  For a grounded cage, every point is an equipotential, so the shell of the cage itself isn't resonating.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as my electrodynamics courses went, an ungrounded fraday cage works like an invisibility cloak for radio waves. Nothing gets in, but the waves propagate along the outside of the cage and leave on the other side like it never been there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is essentially my understanding except that the energy the cage absorbs (it <em>does</em> absorb it) must go somewhere and will be radiated back out in all directions but not in the same form (maybe as a form of low-frequency black body radiation?). The energy has to go <em>somewhere</em>.
Now, with meta-materials it's possible to redirect/bend the energy around the object. They have demonstrated this with water, light, and radio waves (and probably other wavelengths as well)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the floor, walls, and ceiling need to be conductive. Gaps in conductive materials need to be very small, and all the pieces need to be electrically connected. So things like anywhere two pieces of sheet metal meet, they need some sort of connection, and not just at one point, but at many points along the joint. (The ground itself may be adequately conductive that you don't need anything special for this use case.)</p>
<p>A metal mesh screen is plenty, as long as you're careful about how you connect the pieces to each other. It could be behind the walls, even.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be unlawful due to the need to respond to emergencies, you cannot jam phone signals for any reason public or private in the United States.    </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't <em>jam</em> signals. Jamming implies a radio transmitter. You can absolutely <em>block</em> them under normal FCC radio regulations, by using conductive building materials or whatever. It's possible there are other laws that prevent it, but it's a totally different thing than jamming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jamming is illegal, intentionally wrapping your building in signal killing materials is not.</p>
<p>The reason jamming is illegal is because it works by flooding the signal with garbage.  You are broadcasting large amounts of garbage and interfering with other people stuff.  You jamming signal can easily extend beyond your building.</p>
<p>Passively blocking a signal is legal.  We already build chambers that block signal for testing devices.</p>
<p>So yes, it would be completely legal to build a movie theater that is a giant Faraday cage.  You could even build it so only the actual theater rooms kill the signal and that the lobby and halls are fine.  It is just expensive to do so and as a result people don't do it.  Theater owners looked into it before, Faraday cages were too expensive and jammers were illegal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cell phones increase their RF power when reception is bad. They always try to keep a connection to the nearest cell tower. If you have bad reception it's also more likely that a transmission gets lost and you have to repeat it.</p>
<p>This all contributes to more battery drain in areas with bad reception.</p>
<p>At least that's how it was with GSM (2G technology). Though I'm sure similar principles apply with 4G.</p></div>		</li>
