			<div class="markdown"><p>So how much food waste would we have to pyrolize to run the US's cars?</p>
<hr />
<p>Wood vinegar is neat:</p>
<p>quote:</p>
<p>Pyroligneous acid, also called wood vinegar or wood acid,[3] is a dark liquid produced by the destructive distillation of wood and other plant materials.
...
Composition
The principal components of pyroligneous acid are acetic acid, acetone and methanol. It was once used as a commercial source for acetic acid. In addition, the vinegar often contains 80-90% water along with some 200 organic compounds.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Food waste really isn't a viable feedstock for pyrolysis processes. A more likely scenario is a dedicated energy crop, preferably one that grows somewhere it won't compete with food crops. My favorite example is a poplar species called <em>Populus tremuloides</em>, which can grow further north than corn and even wheat.</p>
<p>My favorite proof-of-concept paper is this one from <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/47594.pdf" target="_blank">NREL</a> (the National Renewable Energy Laboratory), which built and analyzed a pilot-scale plant to convert poplar to syngas to methanol to gasoline. At a gasoline price of $1.95/gallon. But you asked how much to run every car in the US. From their abstract:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>55.1 gallons of gasoline per tonne of poplar fed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>~5 tonnes of poplar per acre per year</p>
</li>
<li>143.37 billion gallons of gasoline consumed in the US in 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>And that comes out to 520.4 million acres dedicated to energy crops. For scale, that's about 813000 square miles, or 2.11 million square kilometers. It's slightly smaller than Alaska plus Texas combined. It would require converting quite a bit of Canada's undeveloped land to industrial forestry.</p>
<p>This is why biofuels should be a transition. Although it's technically sustainable indefinitely, it would require destroying or at least damaging vast swaths of tundra and taiga ecosystems. However, it's simple enough to set up that it could start replacing oil almost immediately on a small scale, and it's compatible with almost all the transportation infrastructure that's already in place - from the gasoline pump all the way back through most of the refinery. At worst it's carbon-neutral, because to turn trees into gasoline they have to have as much carbon in them as the gasoline will burn, and trees get their carbon as CO2 from the atmosphere. </p>
<p>And finally, biofuels will give the holdouts on truly renewable transportation a little more time to move on (or shuffle off while their children make smarter decisions).</p></div>		</li>
