<p>Similarly I think you can talk about the PEP as a force, it just happens to be a force with really weird properties. It also doesn't have an obvious classical analogue, but in my opinion that is just fine. Nothing wrong with calling it a force.</p>

<p>It's not just that there is no gauge boson for the Pauli exclusion principle, it's that it exists even when the particles do not interact.  Even free fermions are quite complicated.</p>
<p>Another way to see that Pauli exclusion is different is to look at the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation for a helium atom.  The only interactions are Coloumb interactions, but the PEP still must be satisfied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PEP sounds like an interaction. It causes two particles to behave differently than if the other one of them wasn't there. It's difficult to see a way to avoid calling that an interaction. I think that's part of why some people here feel it needs an explanation as to why it's not a force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See but then what constitutes ``interactions&quot; in a sense Fermions without any potential term do interact with one another in that the behaviour of one is determined by the presence of the others. </p>
<p>I just think it is a matter of semantics, and people are oddly desperate to define forces as being mediated by gauge bosons, or in a non-relativistic setting as the result of quantized potential. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much a desperation, but rather an admission that in the standard model the anti-symmetry of fermion wave functions is imposed by hand, so it remains one of the great mysteries where it comes from!</p></div>		</li>

<p>But we haven't even found a boson for gravity. Or even hints of one, as far as I know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue its almost universally accepted that gravity is mediated by a spin-2 boson, (i.e. the graviton) and while the ultimate UV theory is not decided no-one disputes some of its basic properties. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's ok if you're speaking to a lay audience or just working on your intuition, but physics at the level where these things become important is all about mathematical formalism. At that level these vague definitions will hurt you if you're not extremely careful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's totally arbitrary to say that some ways of transferring momentum aren't forces. There certainly isn't a mathematical justification for it. Just because some forces are gauge mediated doesn't mean that you have to use the word force to only mean that, especially since that's not the concept that Newton introduced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is very easy to formulate this though. You take the many-body energy functional and define forces to be negative the rate of change as you vary the position of a given particle keeping other particles fixed. </p>
<p>There is clearly no computational advantage to this kind of procedure, however I see no reason why one cannot define an exclusion force rigorously,  in precisely the same way one can describe a pressure. </p></div>		</li>
