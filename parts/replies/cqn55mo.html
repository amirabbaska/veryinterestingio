			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually Spanish stayed in the curriculum until the early to mid eighties. At least for most Catholic and private schools. Then it became optional, and eventually removed. </p>
<p>Nationalism was high shortly after Cory Aquino took over, misguided or not, the removal of Spanish from universities was one of the side-effects, along with pushing the U.S. bases out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true. 300 years is a very long time so it's inevitable that there will be borrowed words. The only difference is the spelling: e.g. coche (car) is kotse in Tagalog. Therefore, modern Filipino language is a combination of Malay, Tagalog, Spanish, English, and whatever country influenced our culture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How heavy is the Chinese influence? I know there is a huge population of Chinese in the country and a lot of people have Chinese descent too. This seems to be case for the entire Southeast Asian region. I know in Malaysia and Indonesia there are a huge population of people that speak Chinese (either ethnically Chinese, of Chinese descent, or just know Chinese because of business reasons).</p></div>		</li>
