<p>This is applicable to only sharp fleeting chest pains and it is called Precordial Catch. It is a non-serious condition affecting the left side of the anterior wall of the chest. It is characterized by sharp chest pains, and usually affects children and adolescents, although it can occur, though less frequently, in adults. PCS manifests as a very intense, sharp pain, typically at the left side of the chest, generally in the cartilage between the bones of the sternum and rib cage, which is worse when taking breaths, or doing physical activity.</p>

<p>This, or something very similar to it, can also be triggered by anxiety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good point!</p>
<p>Along with being an anxiety sufferer, I have a diagnosis of costochondritis (inflammation of the chest wall).  I have randomly occurring pains that are  much like Precordial Catch; some are dull/blunt/achy, but some are like lightning bolts to the chest.  The only treatment I am encouraged to pursue right now is a course of NSAIDs, but finally there's one that helps a little.</p>
<p>So this was discovered after lots of investigation in the Cardiology department, all in all it took about a year from first symptoms to properly identifying it.</p>
<p>Friends - don't ignore chest pains.  It could be nothing, but when it gets worse, it could be frightening if not downright life-threatening.  Maybe even a fairly unusual condition like mine!</p></div>		</li>

<p>After watching &quot;Avatar&quot; as a kid, I suddenly had overwhelming heart bpm, couldnt breathe, was terrifying. Afterwards, would have occasional sharp knives/lightning bolts up the side of my chest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You had costochondritis/tietze syndrome for a year? Or several &quot;flairups&quot; that triggered localized pain in this area over a years time? Reason I'm asking is because costochondritis/tietze syndrome usually resolves without any treatment within two to three weeks. Your DX might have just been a grab at what issue fit the symptoms best versus the correct DX. Depending upon your sex (yes sex can play an issue here because females can sometimes display non-characteristic symptoms of serious issues) it could be many other things. </p>
<p>Usually if someone displays symptoms of costochondritis/tietze syndrome more than two times in the same year the odds of there being another underlying cause is pretty high. Sometimes the  xiphoid process (the little lump at the end of your sternum) can become inflamed (xiphoidalgia/xiphoid syndrome) and referred pain can be felt throughout the chest. GERD or even arterial blockage can also cause very similar pain. costochondritis/tietze syndrome is many times related to a rheumatoid flair up when it happens more than once a year. </p>
<p>The point I'm trying to make here is that it shouldn't have taken more than twenty four hours to give you that diagnosis. </p></div>		</li>

Strangely, all the symptoms just disappeared the day after my doctor visit. It seems my mind was playing a very not funny prank on me! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had exactly this type of random pains in my chest ever since I can remember! I had no idea that there was a name for them, and you would think my dad (a doctor) would've known. This makes me feel a lot better actually! I thought I was the only one that had weird, sudden, short, debilitating chest pains. Glad to know that it's just my body twitching, not the impending chest cancer I was assuming it was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the reason for this is because the cause isn't really known... I talked to a doctor I was shadowing and they had never heard of it, but it sounded like they found sharp &quot;catching&quot;/&quot;popping&quot; chest pains very common, especially in females (with a description fairly similar to PCS), but attributed it to cartilage rubbing or catching, which is supposedly fairly benign.</p>
<p>I also believe I have this... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up with nurses &amp; doctors so I've always known it as &quot;getting a catch in my ribs&quot; where it's a pinpoint pain especially when taking a deep breath. Think of it as a short-lived muscle knot.. </p>
<p>If the pain is persistent and where you think you need t visit your doctor... it is definitely not a catch !</p></div>		</li>
