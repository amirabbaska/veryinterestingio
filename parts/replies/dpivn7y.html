			<div class="markdown"><p>If the magnetic field is static, it will not particularly emit energy except to replace resistive losses or losses while cooling the superconductors.</p>
<p>Being in a magnetic field does change some elements of circuit design, but not in a way you can't work around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are high but reasonable numbers. 500W-1kW is about what a high-power gaming computer consumes at full tilt. This is too much for a modern space probe power supply which uses a typical radioactive RTG, but is reasonable for a large solar-cell array.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. 5kW of energy isn't much. If that patent is correct and 5kW is necessary to protect a desk-sized spacecraft then it's possible with current power technology. </p>
<p>For example, the photovoltaic arrays on the ISS each produce about 33kW of power. </p>
<p>The most powerful RTG ever flown had a power output of 3kW. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>So that’s the entire spacecraft. JUST this shielding requires almost 2x the entire power budget of the most powerful RTG ever, not including the mass of the hardware needed to produce such a magnetic shield. </p>
<p>Is it really worth the effort? Depends on the mission but 5kW is a LOT to ask of a spacecraft power supply </p></div>		</li>

<p>Even scaled down by a factor 2 or so (also taking into account that at the distance of Mars there is a lot less sunlight), the spacecraft would be significantly larger than a desk. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not to mention that generators are usually very... heavy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like a solar panel array roughly the size that the ISS  currently uses would be required to protect the pressurized compartments given that the ISS uses &quot;the 75 to 90 kilowatts of power for the ISS...from...its...acre of solar panels&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/facts-and-figures" target="_blank">https://www.nasa.gov/feature/facts-and-figures</a></p>
<p>However, I figure that for an average of 1kW and that 5kW would be required for rare solar events.  </p></div>		</li>
