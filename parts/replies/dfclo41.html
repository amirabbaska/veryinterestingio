			<div class="markdown"><p>That is wrong.  I'm very disappointed that Reddit upvoted this misinformation. Objects in galaxies are not rotating anywhere near fast enough for this to be true. <a href="https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question18.html" target="_blank">Our sun takes 230 million years to orbit around the Milky Way.</a> The galaxy would have to be rotating millions of times faster for that explanation to be true.</p>
<p>Any blob of matter is rotating in some random direction. As it collapses, due to gravity, the rate of rotation increases. Clouds of gas and dust orbiting around an axis different from the galaxy as a whole have more collisions. It will then lose velocity from the collisions. Gas and dust rotating with the rate of rotation have almost no collisions, so they don't collapse at anywhere near the same rate. So any blob of dust and gas will collapse into a disk. There tend to be waves in large amount of gas and dust. These waves often form spirals. That's why flat, gas rich galaxies are called spiral galaxies. Stars like our sun then form in the disk of gas and dust.</p>
<p>Stars are very dense, so they don't collide as much with other matter. So blobs of stars remain in a globular blob as they collapse. Gas poor star clusters are called <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-sees-an-ancient-globular-cluster" target="_blank">globular clusters.</a> There are globular clusters in <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/ESSAYS/Cudworth/cudworth.html" target="_blank">a halo around the Milky Way.</a> The orbit of the globular clusters don't flatten into a disk as they rotate around the Milky Way, since they aren't colliding much with matter. But since most of the matter in the Milky Way is gas and dust, the disk is far more massive. Gas and dust poor galaxies are call elliptical galaxies. Galaxies with a small, but visible disk, are called lenticular galaxies.</p>
<p>We know dark matter doesn't easily interact with other matter, since it doesn't flatten out as it collapses. Dark matter forms a halo around galaxies, just like globular clusters. It's the collisions and rotation that cause matter to lose velocity, and collapse into a disk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get everything else your saying, but think that your explanation for why rotation isn't a cause is lacking. While it may very well be true that a 230 million year period is too long, it's not evident without a little context. 230 million years over what distance? That number could be lightning fast or a snails crawl. What about inertia, momentum, and the mass of the sun? 230 million year period with something relatively small/not very dense is a totally different story than the opposite case.</p>
<p>And what about that 230 million years? Is the Galaxy large enough that what appears slow on a galactic scale is turbo mode at small star level?</p>
<p>Lots of info needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying that rotation and conservation of angular momentum don't matter. I'm saying that conservation of angular momentum and rotation don't explain everything. There needs to be both rotation and matter colliding to form a disk. In <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster" target="_blank">globular clusters,</a> the stars collapse into a dense blob only a couple of light years across. The globular cluster is rotating just like a cloud of gas rotates. Angular momentum is also conserved, as it collapses. Yet the stars don't collapse into a thin disk of stars. Instead they orbit every which way. It takes collisions to knock the matter into a thin disk. It takes collisions to force everything to orbit one way. Stars almost never collide, so star don't collapse into disks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who studies the formation of galaxies for a living: I don't think this analogy is completely right.</p>
<p>Galaxies don't become more disk-like because they're pulled away (pizza dough analogy), but rather because the total amount of spin is hard to get rid of. The average random motion, however, is easier to get rid of (combined with gravity), and so it pulls things together into a flat disk.</p>
<p>As some below me have commented, <a href="https://youtu.be/tmNXKqeUtJM" target="_blank">minute physics has a nice video on this</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote most of the original post a couple years ago (though this quote added in more pizza). Though it was meant to be a simple explanation (it is, after all, ELI5), I can see from this thread I was off the mark. </p>
<p>I've edited my original post to reflect this, so hopefully it doesn't come up again in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great, that's really good of you to do that. I also appreciate your earlier attempt at simplifying, even if it wasn't quite correct.</p>
<p>As far as simple explanations, the same phenomena that makes water in a drain swirl (net angular momentum) is the phenomena that causes galaxies to spin. So maybe we could use that more terrestrial example to help explain why galaxies spin. However, since it's not intuitive why water in a drain spins (a lot of people think the Coriolis effect is significant, when it actually plays a very small part), this analogy isn't perfect.</p>
<p>And once we explain why galaxies spin, we need to explain why that prevents them from collapsing in. For that analogy, it's simple enough to just use the Earth orbiting the Sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not quite right. A solar system starts off as a cloud of particles orbiting a star. Shit bangs into each other until everything generally rotates in the same direction and in the same plane. Neglecting dark matter, the same thing applies to galaxies</p>
<p>Your pizza dough analogy is fair, but it doesn't explain why everything is spinning in the same direction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you summed every vector that describes the motion of each particle in that universe you'd end up with a net rotation. That cloud of mess has some net rotation that will largely determine how it will form.</p>
<p>All that really matters is time. How much do you have? A cloud of gasses and particles is only the start of a galaxy that ends up as a disc. There are various stages in between. Universe-time is slow. Things look pretty constant even for hundreds of generations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct, but how does that cloud turn into a plane? Answer:  collisions </p></div>		</li>
