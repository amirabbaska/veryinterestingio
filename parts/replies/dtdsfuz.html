			<div class="markdown"><p>The shape of the current is more important than the speed and direction. A perfectly linear wave will propagate the sound as a package inside the greater compression wave. This is essentially what happens in a full frequency speaker like a headphone speaker, where the entire spectrum is created by a unidirectional driver.</p>
<p>When the current in the wind is chaotic, it causes those compression waves to lose cohesion and phase cancel. The more chaotic, the more damping occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree, the significance of the wind speed in terms of effective distance it will have to travel will be proportional to fraction of windspeed /speed of sound which should bring pretty much negligible
These effects would have a mech larger impact on sound</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why more against the wind than with it? Wind is only about 1/30th the speed of sound, so the sound waves cross about the same amount of 'chop' in either direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was sticking to the wind is at the speed of sound supposition. I should've specified. But yes, it'd just pass through for the most part if it's orderly but would cancel if it's not.</p></div>		</li>
