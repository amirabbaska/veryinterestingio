			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, how is that possible? There have to be people in the Americas who have no ancestors from Europe/Asia/Africa, like those untouched Amazon tribes. I have a hard time believing any Vikings' ancestors made it down there, so shouldn't you have to go back like 10,000 years prior to crossing the land bridge to find their common ancestor with someone of Asian/African/European descent?</p>
<p>I'm trying to read the PDF and... I don't think I know enough about the subject to really understand this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They adress this in the discussion part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, some readers may be concerned with the possibility that the existence of small, extremely isolated island communities, either true island dwellers or cultural isolates, could mean that the MRCA is far less recent than proposed here. Easter Island, Hawaii, and the Chatham Islands were included in Model C to investigate just this possibility, but many other islands were left out. However, in order for a remote island to affect the MRCA date, it must have been colonized prior to the lineage of the mainland MRCA reaching the source population and it must have remained genetically isolated until very recently in order for there to be surviving people with no modern mainland ancestry. This is an unlikely combination because any island that could have been discovered using the seafaring technology available several thousand years ago and large enough to be capable of sustaining a human population would probably have been rediscovered many times since then, if not participating in continuous trade and exchange of people.   </p>
<p>Many of the smaller islands, if they had been effectively isolated, were probably colonized by Europeans early enough, and their native populations at the time of discovery so reduced by disease or enslavement, that no purely native descendants remain. Although the Andaman islands are renown for their isolated tribes, the Sentinelese in particular, who may have no recent European ancestry, these islands probably do not present a problem for the model's predictions. They are close enough to Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, and India to have maintained fairly steady contact over the past two thousand years. Furthermore, the Andamans happen to be located very close to the probable home of the MRCA, and therefore may have actually been one of the first places reached by his or her lineage. Finally, even religious isolates such as the Samaritans are known to have accepted occasional outsiders (BonnÂ´e-Tamir et al., 2003) and were, in any case, probably already descendants of the MRCA at the time of their formation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I'm reading that right, the 5000 year old common ancestor's genetics was introduced to these remote people relatively recently.  That's why you don't have to go farther back.  You aren't getting a common ancestor between the Vikings and the Amazonian tribes person, you are getting a common ancestor between their respective descendants today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This example &quot;most recent common ancestor&quot; diagram from Wikipedia, sheds a little a light on how this might happen, if you want to think about it visually. Here are five generations:</p>

<p>&quot;Through random drift or selection lineage will trace back to a single person. In this example over 5 generations, the colors represent extinct matrilineal lines and black the matrilineal line descended from the MRCA.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's certainly possible that isolated peoples make the claim not <em>literally</em> true, it's true to a very large degree at the least, and it's not unreasonable to think that it may be literally true.  You doubt that a Viking's descendant made it down there, but it only takes one Viking who took up with (or even just had sex with) a Skraeling; if a child came about, and that child had children, and so on, then Viking ancestry almost certainly spread far and wide.  Or one Siberian Aleut who got shipwrecked in Alaska.  Or one Easter Islander who decided to go as far east from there as his ancestors did in order to get there in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I came to say. This idea of common ancestors and traceability is interesting, but it does not speak to the question about the probability of genetic variability between individuals within (and without) populations.</p>
<p>While an intriguing prospect, this answer does not answer the question in any respect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd go even further: I'm pretty sure the op is aware of the common ancestor theory and it might even have inspired him to post the question in the first place, looking for further explanation of what that means, genetically.</p>
<p>This is easily one of the best subreddits, but it's a bit disappointing, sometimes, when the top reply is just dumping a relevant abstract. It's hard to read scientific papers, especially from a field of research you are not familiar with. What I come here for are basically ELI18 expanations of more complex scientific concepts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we share a common ancestor who is at most 5,000 years old, then we're probably more related to people today than an ancestor from twice as long ago. Someone a little more familiar with genetics and pedigree may want to chine in though in case I missed something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having &quot;common ancestry&quot; does not help at all in quantifying the amount of genetic variation between individuals withing and without populations. We share common ancestry with every living thing on earth, as far as we can tell; that, however, does not give us any useful information on similar or different we are, genetically, from lemurs, for example.</p>
<p>While an interesting consideration, this is not a useful tool for assessing the probability of genetic diversity or variation between individuals from the population of humans today or in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're not &quot;genetically linked back to <em>one</em>&quot; in the sense of one and only one; we're genetically linked back to a huge number.

<p>The &quot;one&quot; is just one specific person that we're all genetically linked to, out of the immense number of people that we're all genetically related to: He (Y Adam) or she (Mitochondrial Eve) is the one who is the most recent &quot;father's father's father's... father&quot; or &quot;mother's mother's mother's... mother&quot; of us all.  We're related to so many of his and her contemporaries too, but they're all &quot;Father's Father's... Mother's Father's...&quot; or &quot;Mother's Father's...

<p>I still don't understand. What does it mean for everyone to be genetically linked to one specific person, while not all being genetically linked to the other people living around that one person? What causes that one person to be special?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is very easy to forget that up until very recently, the mortality rates among humans were very high and life expectancies much shorter. It was also quite a common occurrence for entire families, or even entire regions, to be wiped off the map, ending the line for that branch of their family tree. Do that enough times and, over the course of a couple thousand years, it means that (nearly) everyone alive can be linked to one common ancestor. This is not to say that they were the only person alive at the time. There were hundreds of thousands thousands of others alive. It also doesn't mean they are the ONLY person alive from that time that some of current humanity shares links to. It only means that they are the &quot;trunk&quot; of humanities current family tree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the other reply, you also have to account for the fact that many of the descendants of the other &quot;hundreds of thousands of people&quot; alive at the time likely intertwined with a descendant of our &quot;one common ancestor&quot; at some point along the way</p></div>		</li>
