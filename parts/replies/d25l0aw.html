			<div class="markdown"><p>With C4 specifically, the plasticizer(plastic part of plastic explosives) binds with the more unstable explosive and gives it this immense ability to resist unwanted detonation. Dynamite did effectively the same thing by keeping Nitroglycerin more stable with silicates and other things, making it a heck of a lot safer</p>
<p>Edit: wrong explosive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>QUESTION: hypothetically, were I to hypothetically store some C4 for 100 years, would it 'sweat' and become Unstable in the same way that nitro does from the clay base? </p>
<h1>tldr</h1>
<p>Under any circumstances does C4 become unstable during storage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the binder ages the block hardens.  This can cause the detonating cap or detonating cord to shatter the block without transferring the energy needed to initiate the compound.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea what I'm talking about but I'm going to say probably not. If the binder contains pieces of explosive and the densities are different and the melting points are low one might expect that kind of thing. If the explosive is soluble in the plasticizer and the melting point of the mixture is suitably high then they shouldn't separate under normal storage conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the plasticizer tend to separate out over time as they do with many other plastics, leaving the combination less and less stable as it ages? That would be kinda scary.  I mean it's bad enough when your laptop case gets all gummy and sticky, but at least it doesn't explode. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i said this in another response but like u/robot_pictures said, the explosive in C-4 is RDX, which on its own is relatively stable, the Plastic is for added stability and for malliability, so it can be formed to whatever shape necessary</p></div>		</li>

I doubt any EOD guy would give you a direct answer, it may not be classified but we don't usually like to talk about our specific capabilities unless it's to someone with need to know. </p>
