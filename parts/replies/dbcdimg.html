			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't happen. In aggregate people, in this case customers shipping packages, are extremely predictable. Say in this example only 10% of people choose the guarantee most of the time, for 50% or 100% to choose the guarantee would be such a deviation that it's statically impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He isn't saying that half paid for guaranteed delivery. Say 10% of those two planes worth of packages were guaranteed. Plane one would have 20% guaranteed packages and 80% lucky people, and the second plane would have 0% guaranteed and 100% unlucky people. </p>
<p>Edit: I was gonna say who downvotes this comment, but then realized I'd skipped a parent comment that made mine irrelevant to the proposed scenario. My mistake. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For plains region FedEx Ground:
-Package is marked as guaranteed in computer
-Handlers scans pkg off truck at each station, and it tells them that. This forces them to move the package, when they might not have before. This could have been because of high volume or other outside factors.
-Driver (or subcontractors they work for) are penalized if pkg is not delivered</p>
<p>80% of the time, nothing would happen if <em>everyone</em> paid extra for guaranteed dates. In the provided system, the pkg was going to get there anyway barring an unusual hiccup, but the extra pay forces them to take special interest in that pkg.</p></div>		</li>
