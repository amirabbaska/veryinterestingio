<p>It's always amazed me that more people don't apply for it.</p>

<p>That program sounds really cool and everything, if you're really into Japanese culture and want to learn Japanese. But otherwise, it just sounds like a huge pain. For me, I see it this way: most of the best universities in the world are in the US and UK, where they speak English and everything is done in my native language and my native writing system. I can go to school in my home country or a country with a very similar culture, and be at one of the best universities in the world. I can focus my energy and attention on learning difficult material in engineering classes (for example) without having to struggle with the language it's being taught in. Engineering classes are hard enough as it is in my native language.</p>
<p>If I did the Japanese program, I would have to learn a strange writing system that I don't understand and completely relearn everything I learned in kindergarten (letters, numbers, math symbols, etc.) and learn a new language that has exactly nothing in common with my native tongue. Plus, it's not just learning a new, difficult language for fun: you <em>have</em> to learn it. What happens if it turns out that I suck at Japanese and I don't learn it well enough to take classes? Did I waste a year of my life? A year of intensive study might teach me a lot, but I'm not going to be anywhere near the level of a native speaker, so I will have a huge disadvantage compared to all the other students. That's a lot of pressure - and all this just to go to a university that doesn't have anything that I couldn't have gotten at home. </p>
<p>So, I'm sure most people just don't see any reward for the immense amount of work, stress, and pressure that would be required for an English speaker (or any Latin-based language speaker) to attend college in Japan. It's not like Japanese universities are anything special compared to US/UK universities, and considering all the disadvantages of having to learn such a difficult language and be competing with native speakers who grew up in that culture, it just doesn't seem worth it to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that it takes an extra year to graduate, it's that it would be extraordinarily difficult and stressful, for basically no reward. Japanese is possibly the hardest language in the entire world for a native Latin-based language speaker to learn. One year of study, while great, would still leave you substantially lacking behind compared to Japanese people, and then you jump right into a university curriculum and take a bunch of really intensive, high level classes in Japanese. </p>
<p>They might pay for your tuition, but you still have to do well and pass your classes with high marks. Imagine how hard it would be to compete with people who speak the language you're being taught in significantly better than you do. And if you manage to get through all that, all you end up with is a degree from a Japanese university that is not special in any way compared to US/UK universities. Unless you plan on living and working in Japan, it's not worth all the hard work and stress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, unless you are planning to work there after graduation, you're getting a degree from a school no one has ever heard of.  That makes getting a job back home significantly harder.  In the US, having a degree from a school in Europe, let alone Japan, makes getting a job more difficult unless it is from one of the very best schools that does have name recognition and alumni over here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah definitely. Like I said, if you love Japanese culture and you want to live there after school, then the program sounds amazing. Free schooling from a Japanese university and intensive study in the language is a great deal, but only if you stay there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Monbukagakusho program also applies to graduate studies.  I believe you can apply any time up to 35 unless they changed the rules.</p></div>		</li>
