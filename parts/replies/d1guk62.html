			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah armies for the most part travel together in one big group. </p>
<p>With a ladder, constructing a ramp/stairs or destroying part of it(idk if invaders ever did that) it shouldn't <em>stop</em> people for too long, especially if it was an undefended section.</p>
<p>BUT, individual members of an army couldn't just get around it however they could and keep on marching along. They would have had to wait for everyone else to catch up. And with tens of thousands of soldiers, horses, and supplies it'd take some time to get everyone through and back moving. By the time a large portion got through, Chinese soldiers would surely have time to respond. And unless they were <em>really</em> off the ball, they'd encounter the enemy half way on one side and half way on the other, making things easier for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like any good passive defensive system -- safes, for example -- you would rate it in terms of time.</p>
<p>In the case of the wall, I'd probably say it'd hold up an army for a couple days, maybe a week.</p>
<p>In strategic terms though, that's quite valuable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember that your horse and seige weaponry couldn't climb a ladder or a rope, so some larger items that you brought with you had to leave behind. Mongolians relied heavily on mounted soldiers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary purpose was to remove incentive to raid in a large organized way. Lugging the loot back would be difficuly if not impossible, and the wall was two things: A signalling device and a raised roadbed for marching a defensive or counter force to the point of incursion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People also forgot it was hard to get back. If 20 mongolians are raiding a village in northern China the defenders of the Wall can have more soldiers ready for where they think they might try and climb back over it. In reality they didn't really think they could stop everyone, as you said. Also important is that the wall was made AFTER the mongolians came through and destroyed their country. There was no major attempt to re-take china and by the time the final wall was made in the Ming Dynasty the mongolian threat was greatly reduced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once saw a documentary wherein they pitted the fire/smoke signal atop guard towers on the great wall against horse messengers and a small off road vehicle (wrangler maybe).  I can't find the video, I can't even remember what language it was in.  Obviously the signals won.  Neither horse nor off road vehicles can keep up the pace with the signals.  I vaguely remember they even spaced towers with weather, such as fog, in mind, and/or adjusted the size of the signal flames to penetrate through the fog. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Napoleonic wars, signal towers used semaphore to carry messages great distances in a few hours that would take horses days to travel. Also a maritime force cruising along the coast at three or four knots, was easily faster than a land force trying to keep up with them along a coast road. The wind does not stop for lunch or to feed and water the horses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Countless people. He's not really the type to listen to what anyone has to say. The wall is just a big-dicked sensational appeal to the people who follow the narrative that there are these parasitic life forms riding their donkeys up north by the millions to steal our jobs and rape our white women.</p>
<p>The truth is that first of all, net immigration from Mexico is approximately zero. And second, more illegal immigrants are coming in through legal passageways, so a wall will not fix that. And finally, a wall just won't work even for the cases it's intended for. The The Donald even realized this at one of his own rallies...</p>
<p>Donaldo: &quot;So the wall will keep them all out. You get a ladder, once you're up there, 30 feet high, how do you get down?&quot;</p>
<p>Then in the voice of a child making an unfortunate but large revelation, &quot;Maybe a rope....&quot;</p>
