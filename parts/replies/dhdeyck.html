			<div class="markdown"><p>While this answer does a fine job of literally explaining why seat belts aren't enforced on motorcycles, it doesn't really answer the root of the question. </p>
<p>At the root, the question is why for car operators/passengers it is fineable to not wear a seatbelt, which is for added safety in an already safer environment than a motorcycle, when motorcycle safety is, for all intents and purposes, as minor protection as possible. Even &quot;safe&quot; take downs on bikes can lead to serious injury and a helmet won't stop a concussion for the speeds at which your traveling on anything except a community street.</p>
<p>This answer only helps me think motorcycles should be ticketed for not also wearing a leather jumpsuit every time they ride, since these leather suits are for added safety. As well as wonder why &quot;safe takedown&quot; isn't part of all motorcycle tests so they are able to be as safe as possible.</p>
<p>If you're going to ticket car operators for essentially not being as safe as possible, then why aren't bikes also ticketed for not being as safe as possible? That's the real question and there isn't a fair answer except that motorcyclists have done a good job of keeping the regulations from happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So let's put the other foot/shoe into the discussion... </p>
<p>Why, in States that require a helmet be worn on a motorcycle, where it's a fineable offense not to, are helmets not similarly required for driver's and passengers in cars?  </p>
<p>A helmet would increase safety in a car, so why is it not a requirement?  </p>
<p>Same answer for both.  Laws aren't written to ensure &quot;maximum safety&quot;.  If they were, we'd all be driving around at 15mph wearing Nerf suits.  Laws are written to mitigate risk to an acceptable level.  &quot;Acceptable&quot; risk for a motorcycle is clearly higher than for cars, and riders knowingly accept that risk when they opt for half the wheels :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Also, the safety features that are in cars (specifically air bags) rely on the fact that a seatbelt is being worn. Laws often come about because enough people with money lobbied to have certain laws be made/passed. Car companies do not want to be sued for air bags killing consumers in accidents. If wearing your seatbelt is a legal requirement, but you don't wear one and get into an accident where the air bag decapitates you, the car company/airbag manufacturer is much less likely to be sued.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The acceptable level of risk is different for everyone. If we allow motorcyclists to have a different acceptable level of risk than why not everyone? You shouldn't have to ride a motorcycle in order to just avoid wearing a seatbelt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really not motorcyclists.  It's just hard to regulate anything other than the helmet.  What brand of outerwear is appropriate or can you just buy something cheap from goodwill to get away with it?  How would a cop be able to tell from a distance?  And for those just cruising around town real biking gear is expensive.  Upwards of 2k expensive.  Usually people buy it for cross country trips and that's about the only time they wear them.  So the ticket every once in a while would be a lot cheaper than the protection.  It's like ticketing someone for not having a roll cage on their 97 dodge neon that never goes above 35 mph.  It's basically unenforceable.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not 100% fool proof but is an easy way to enforce 99.9% of traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may have something to do with the fact that one un belted passenger in a car can kill or maim the belted occupants in the event of a crash. (This doesn't explain why a lone driver still gets ticketed for it though) or it may be that all of the safety measures taken by car manufacturers are rendered essentially useless if you don't buckle in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally, once you go down you have one leg tucked up from getting it out from underneath the bike. You just put that foot on the bike and kick the leg back out. Based on the couple of times I've done it, it wasn't really a conscious decision, it just happened that way.</p>
<p>I am certainly no expert on this, that just always seemed to make sense to me. I just questioned a buddy who actually races them about this and while he obviously agreed about getting out from underneath, he never really thought about kicking it away. He actually says he sometimes tries to get on the bike, using it basically as a sled so he isn't directly sliding on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disregard reflexes, street bikes weigh like 300-400 lbs at the low end. You're not &quot;kicking&quot; that away lol. Also having dumped a few bikes, several times (racing), I've like stayed on my feet twice, &quot;surfed&quot; once, and most of the time just let go and been like &quot;well here we go&quot; the rest </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will testify to this as a cyclist: I almost got creamed by a car who took a left turn when I had right of way, saw the car coming toward me and more or less flung myself away from the bike and car to avoid actually being squished. Yeah I fucked up my arms and knees a bit, but the car didn't even touch me. Can't imagine trying to do that on an even faster, heavier vehicle. </p></div>		</li>
