			<div class="markdown"><p>What lack of chemicals in the brain of someone with ADHD causes that lack of focus? Anecdotally speaking I've found that I have a sense of achievement upon the completion of a task, as well as a greater urgency to complete it when on the meds, versus being off of the meds and viewing a task as something to be completely avoided if possible, and applying minimal effort in things that I have to do, due to the lack of any self-satisfaction on top of being perpetually sidetracked from any lack of urgency. Is that phenomenon all explained by the medication causing a release of dopamine, or perhaps counteracting something that may be inhibiting the release of dopamine?

Benefits also including the ability to process and organise thoughts one by one as opposed to jumping from thought to thought without properly processing </p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a hard time completing any tasks, and I Get depressed When I Complete A task. The task was the thing that I was interested enough in to actually engage in, leading to PFC stimulation without drugs.</p>
<p>When I care about something, I can work for hours without eating it sleeping unmedicated. (Hyperfocus) like I might spend too much time replying to this port when I should be getting ready for work, but work is boring and talking about ADHD is interesting.</p>
<p>I try to do stuff all the time, I get excited about starting projects, but unmedicarwd, have terrible follow through. You should like all of the musical instruments I played for a week or art supplies... posting on reddit increases dopamine, hence it is attractive until my med kick in.</p>
<p>Honestly it does not sound like you have ADHD, you are responding how my depressed ex did when she took stimulants. She responded much better to antidepressants.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed as a kid, and reconfirmed as an adult. I take 5MG adderall XR a day. A correct ADHD dose should avoid a high and simply help your brain work a little more normal.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i am also adhd, i get hyperfocus when riding motorcycles. if i am going to race i don't take any adhd meds because i lose my hyperfocus abilities (in my opinion) for a more generalised attention, which is not what i want when i cannot make a mistake. why it happens when riding is something to do with all of my senses being 100% engaged or something. i get mega depressed if i can't ride.</p>
<p>i gave up bikes for a few years and i became someone i don't even recognise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really responsible to say it sounds like someone doesn't have ADHD based on a single paragraph Reddit post?  ADHD is a chameleon.  ADHD specialists have problems identifying ADHD.  A misdiagnosis of someone who really has ADHD can be devastating.  People lose decades of their lives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There actually isn't a lack of a chemical, there is, hypothetically, an over production of dopamine reuptake pumps. Those pumps actively remove dopamine from the synaptic cleft and leave the signal transduction &quot;weaker&quot; or shorter in certain neurons.</p>
<p>The thing is, ADHD is a spectrum. The medicine will help  anyone concentrate on certain tasks, but you need to  I find the right medication and dosage. I want to caution people, the  a side effects of ADHD medication are pretty severe, at least for me. Insomnia, or lack of deep sleep, dehydration, increased heart rate, and worst of all, dose-dependent social anxiety. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stick to one for more time and you'll gain tolerance and sleep will be more possible. Take it early right after breakfast.  Don't use XR. Exercise vigorously late afternoon at the latest. Your mind and body need to be tired. Work on sleep hygiene. Drink acidic things later in the day. I think that works but maybe only works when taking the drug. </p>
<p>Dehydration is common because of appetite suppression so you need to use one of those water bottles with markings or schedule your food or water in advance because of the removal of appetite. That will resolve things nicely. It will just become another task to eat and drink. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, Adderall makes sleeping 100x easier. The reason being is that there are no longer billions of thoughts flowing through my head. Without some sort of medication, I can lay wide awake in my bed from 8 pm to 6 am just thinking about anything and everything, and never falling asleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not exactly a lack of focus, but a problem in deciding.</p>
<p>The &quot;focus&quot; is there, but the brain can't really decide which interruptions to ignore and which to listen to. It can decide to ignore them all hard, which is hyperfocus, or be distracted by every little thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an annecdote, when I was a child and engrossed in a book or other form of entertainment my mother would end up yelling my name only feet away. I legitimately would be completely unaware of it. Common occurrence.</p>
<p>I could hear her only in a the sense that, once my attention was broken away from the book, I could recognize <em>after the fact</em> that she was yelling my name in the past. I always found that interesting, especially the retroactivity of that awareness. Says a lot about how non-fixed, flexible, and complex our conscious awareness is.</p>
<p>Anyway, i believe the hyperfocusing phenomenon really goes to show that in many cases, ADHD, at least the predominantly inattentive type, is a dopamine and norepinephrine disorder of frontal cortex <em>control of and processing</em> of attention, rather than just a deficit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thus. ADHD does have aspects of hyperfocus in certain people. But only if what they are focusing on was able to fully capture their attention. If it does, it's almost impossible to pull them away. I have ADHD and I do this with a good book. It takes me roughly 3-4 hours to read 500 page novels because I can't put the book down. I'm in that world while reading, and I don't want to go back to the real one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can learn to control it, it almost ends up being a superpower.  When I manage to target that &quot;block everything else out&quot; hyper-focus on the correct thing, I can absorb and retain enormous amounts of information very rapidly.  The issue is making it work on things that aren't naturally of interest to you.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'd say that on the whole, it's been an overall net benefit in my life, despite being a bit of a double-edged sword.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to clarify one point: inattention as a symptom of ADHD is better described as a stamina deficit - not a focusing deficit. A person with ADHD <em>can</em> focus; the difficulty arrises in focusing on one thing for an extended period of time without shifting focus to any number of other things that might be within that person's immediate awareness. </p>
<p>This might seem pedantic but it paints a better picture of what the person with ADHD is experiencing and is a more accurate description of the behavior as a manifestation of cognitive, or more accurately, executive functioning fatigue.</p>

<p>For extra reading, I'd suggest anything written by Russel Barkley. Check out his website: <a href="http://www.russellbarkley.org/" target="_blank">http://www.russellbarkley.org/</a> for summative fact sheets and easily understood descriptions of facets of ADHD.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not entirely true. It's not like normal people are at 0, ADHDers are at -5 and all ADHD medication is a +5, bringing ADHDers up to 0 and baseliners to +5. There are different types of medications for ADHD and the underlying cause of ADHD is very complex and I get that you're trying to ELI5 but it's not quite accurate. For instance, if a person with ADHD takes a 'stimulant' medication (again, there are other forms of ADHD medication) it could actually have the opposite effect and calm them down whereas that would not happen to a baseline 'normal' person. So it would be more like ADHD people are +5 on the hyperactivity, normal people are 0 and the medication somehow works as a -5 for those with ADHD but a +5 for those without, hence OP's doctor's comments about 'that's one way specialists are able to tell'. </p>
