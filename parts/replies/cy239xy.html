			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably, it's over 2,000 pages long. It's doubtful there's anyone that's even read the whole thing from beginning to end. I only know of the section on tobacco because a few people within the niche communities it would effect keep track of any new legislation on the subject. There are probably other communities I'm unfamiliar with that have their own unique problems with this bill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the $10+ exemption is only for what they are calling premium cigars. E-cig's and liquids will not be exempt at any price bracket. I have an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that the only reason there's an exemption at all is that a $10 cigar is still affordable on a congressman's salary. It's fine if they're out of reach to the lower classes.</p></div>		</li>
