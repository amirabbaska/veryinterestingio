			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is that large variations in 'snap' can be visible as &quot;unnatural&quot; or &quot;uncanny&quot; when watching artificial motion (such as robotic arm movements).  A very consistent 'snap', even when &quot;jerk&quot; is strongly controlled, can make things feel overly precise or planned.  Imagine someone &quot;doing the robot dance&quot; when they take advantage of this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always think of brakes as a good example of jerk.
If you're driving and push the breaks firmly, but consistently, you are decelerating fairly evenly. So, chart of acceleration would like like a relatively flat line in the negative.</p>
<p>Once the vehicle comes to a stop, it can't continue to decelerate, otherwise it would start moving backwards. So, in the acceleration chart you would have a sudden step to zero.</p>
<p>If you took the derivative of this, it would look like a big spike right  at the step.</p>
<p>So while you're driving and coming to a stop, you can feel that force pushing you forward. That is the force from deceleration. Then, that whip feeling as the car stops is the result of Jerk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it much easier to conceptualise with driving a car.</p>
<p>Standing still = Position</p>
<p>Constant speed = Velocity (Changes in position)</p>
<p>Accelerate = Acceleration (Changes in Velocity)</p>
<p>Gear ratio changes while accelerating/decelerating = Jerk (Changes in Acceleration)</p>
<p>How smooth the gear change is = Snap (Changes in Jerk)</p>
<p>How the car vibrates in relation to Snap = Crackle (Changes in Snap)</p>
<p>Not sure how correct that is, but I always thought that human sensation while driving gives us so much feedback because all of these are working at once and being processed by our brain fairly naturally). I like to think that when a human feels 'something is off' about something, it is because they cannot successfully step backwards through the unwinding of these massively multiple variable functions that determine normality. Like the 'engine is wobbling, feels off' could actually be the combination of higher order derivatives than crackle, but while we might need a highly specific conceptualisation to reference it, we automatically calculate it with our physiology first. We could even potentially recognise this exponentiation of multiples applying on some fundamental level, and learn to associate it with an increasing bad sensation. So we essentially develop a natural sensation of higher order derivatives of movement as a means to detect danger.</p>
<p>I suppose astronomical movements are probably very useful in conceptualising these also.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I imagine this is a consequence of the higher derivatives basically never being used, so those few engineers that do have to use them can get away with more cheeky names.</p></div>		</li>
