			<div class="markdown"><p>I have always liked Spath's to have larger than normal growing containers for that very reason.  However over watering will promote yellow leaves.  When they get dry (as you may have seen) will crash as I call it.  The plant leaves and flowers all lay flat across the edge of the pot like someone stepped on it.  But within an hour after watering the plant will come right back and the leaves and flowers will appear as if nothing ever happened.  These plants can take crashing only a few time and then the crown of the plant dries so much that permanent damage is done.  Usually when this happens smaller plants (pups) are formed along the edges of the main (Mother) plant stem.  These pups rarely form into anything that has any vigor or growth potential unless separated from the Mother plant.   However to propagate correctly, you would need to have an area that has about 80% relative humidity to help keep moisture in the pup plants till a sufficient root system is formed.  We have a very special spathiphyllum here at our house.  We received it for my son's funeral back in 2005, when he passed away, at the age of 13.  The plant gets special care and it looks like it does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you mind explain in bottom watering a bit more? I feel like getting a pot with a plate and just putting water in the plate isn't what you mean. I recently murdered a mint plant (rest in peace little dude) that I bought from a grocery store and I couldn't keep that thing alive for the life of me. And it's the same thing with the basil I bought from the store. Maybe I need to stop buying plants from the grocery store. Because every other plant I own is alive. Opinion s?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To explain a bottom watering set-up for commercial practice would take many visual descriptions and a lecture that could take two days.  However, the herbs you are suggesting usually do pretty well with a rudimentary scenario.  Typically a mat, in commercial it is called a capillary mat and very much looks like felt or fiber carpet padding.  The mat is placed in a tray and typically enough water to saturate the mat by half its thickness.  This would mean, if your mat is one inch thick.  The depth of the standing water would be 1/2 inch deep.  This also helps keep humidity around the plant but you need to be sure that the plant is not on a cold windowsill.  Plants generally like cool ears and warm feet.  In the commercial setting, the grower will use a system called Bio-them.  These are rubber tubes which are laid on the benches or the ground (under the pots) to warm the feet of the plants by circulating warm water through the tubing.<br />
Many people who maintain window gardens will use Paper towels (like Bounty) and place them under the pot.  The paper towels are fairly sterile and can be discarded and replaced easily.  When bottom watering plants, you should try not to disturb the surface of the medium, as you are setting up a scenario for a micro climate.  What is important is that you will need to remove the top layer of the soil when it appears to start turning white and crusty looking.  It looks like salt and that is because it is salt that leaches to the top of medium.  This comes from the nutrients that you would be fertilizing your plant with.  If the crusty surface starts to go from white to brownish color... you would be late removing the surface layer and replacing it with new medium.  Plants do not like salt and that is why you should never water the plant from the top when you are using a bottom watering technique.  You will burn the roots of the plant, just as if you over fertilized it.  One word of warning, if you bottom water, you will increase the chances of getting fungus gnats.  These insects are just pesky and generally feed on the decaying moist peat moss that most soiless mixes are made from.  If you see them, most people will believe that they have fruit flies in their house.  But they generally stay by the plants and can also be seen running around on the surface of the medium until they can fly.  </p>
