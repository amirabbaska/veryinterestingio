In addition, the B17 and other large multi-gun bombers had side gunners who could get hit with shrapnel.  Belly, tail, nose and back gunners could also be disarmed with the right hit.  Deploying lots of flak into a large formation of bombers would create a  sea of small fragments for planes to fly through.  Small damage to the planes adds up, and taking out a few gunners, or obstructing a pilot or  gunner's view still decreases your enemy's strength.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point about the windows. I haven’t heard much about the damage to engines that shrapnel caused, but I guess it’s enough to say that the right size of metal flying into an engines intake wouldn’t be a good result. I think the </p>

<p>Statement Is a good summary for flak. Whether it’s breaking up formations, causing stress to the crew, or taking out modules, flak adds chaos and makes it difficult for the bombardiers to keep calm and do their job. IIRC there are some reports of bombardiers dropping early due to misinformation (possibly caused from the chaos) or simply dropping early in order to escape the flak sooner. The thought of trying to fly on course and get eyes on a factory or other target location while being bombarded with flak is a daunting image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. Losing crew could also bring the plane down or at least make it harder to continue on with the raid... I wonder if the entire crew of a bomber were proficient at flying, or more likely was it just the pilots themselves? I honestly never thought what would happen if both pilots became incapacitated... </p></div>		</li>
