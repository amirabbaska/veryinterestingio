			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We've sent multiple spacecraft past Jupiter (Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo, Ulysses, Cassini, New Horizons). If you just extend a wire loop from the spacecraft and measure how much current is generated by the craft cruising through the magnetosphere, you have a very good estimate of how strong the magnetic field is.</p>
</li>
<li>Jupiter produces <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yGikf.gif" target="_blank">some pretty crazy looking radio emissions</a>. The sphere there is Jupiter itself, and the lobes extending off the sides are the equivalent of Earth's Van Allen Belts - charged particles trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field. By measuring the extent of the lobes and also the exact frequency of radio they emit (technically a kind of synchrotron radiation), you can again get a very good estimate of the strength of the magnetic field.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Realistically, that's not going to happen.</p>
<p>Metallic hydrogen only forms under about 2 million atm of pressure (where 1 atm = the pressure at Earth sea level), so first  you need to design a &quot;spoon&quot; that can descend 30% of the way to Jupiter's center and withstand crushing pressures, not to mention temperatures in the 10,000 C range.</p>
<p>Second, we believe that metallic hydrogen is an exceptionally good solvent, dissolving just about everything it comes in contact with, so you'll need a spoon that somehow defies that.</p>
<p>Finally, you'll need to fight against Jupiter's intense gravity to get your spoon out of the planet's depths and ultimately out of its gravitational sphere of influence, all while keeping the contents of the spoon under millions of atm of pressure (or else it would just revert to plain old hydrogen).</p>
<p>We're much better off just trying to continue experiments to make it in the lab, as the amount of technological investment is considerably less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The extreme pressure in Jupiter's interior making hydrogen liquid would also crush your giant spoon device. And once you somehow scooped up the liquid hydrogen, it would just evaporate in the lower pressure anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, but it wouldn't be metallic hydrogen by the time it reached the surface, it'd just be normal hydrogen: you need enormous pressure for hydrogen to become metallic. And there are much, much easier places to find hydrogen than Jupiter's core (like Jupiter's atmosphere, for example).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or basically anywhere in the universe for that matter!</p>
<p>I guess the thing with spooning out some of Jupiter's stock of metallic hydrogen is that there's no possible methodology that wouldn't be just moot based on having the tech to maintain the pressure once it didn't have all of Jupiter's atmosphere on it. It would be like scooping out some of the Sun to kickstart a fusion reaction. If you can get it, you can make your own.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>The key to keeping high-pressure phases stable at low pressure lies in the internal energy between atoms. For example, apply lots of pressure to graphite and you get diamond, but if you then lower the pressure, it stays diamond. This is because the difference in internal energy between graphite and diamond is very small, so it's not all that energetically favorable for the diamond to convert back to graphite (though it does eventually happen after many billions of years).</p>
<p>It depends on which high-pressure equation of state you use, but the general consensus is that solid metallic hydrogen has a <em>lot</em> more internal energy than plain old hydrogen, suggesting it will likely revert back after you remove the pressure.</p></div>		</li>
