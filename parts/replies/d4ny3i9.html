<p>Batman's cape when he punches using Punch1, then Punch variation 2, then Punch variation 3, etc...</p>

<p>Batman's cape was manually animated, not cloth physics. They actually had to match the cape to every single motion Batman can make, which is <em>a lot</em> of animations. And it looks <em>so good.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol... yeah that's why I brought up Batman's cape in those Arkham games.  When I saw that game for the first time I was like... &quot;how exactly are they doing this cape?&quot;  I assumed it was just baked in from a physics simulator, but then someone at work forwarded an article about how they had animators literally hand-animate that cape for each possible thing Batman could do in the game.  It was staggering to think that was someone's job.  There's not much positions available for &quot;Batman Cape Animator&quot;. XD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Programmer here (not video games) but this is the right answer. </p>
<p>Physics simulations have gotten pretty good looking (ie: ragdoll physics on death) but walking is almost 100% animated, not actually physically simulated.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following physics simulation:</p>
<p><a href="http://m.imgur.com/k6IPbOu?r" target="_blank">http://m.imgur.com/k6IPbOu?r</a></p>
<p>While physically accurate (mostly), it looks unnatural for a different reason- it's like a baby not 100% in control of its limbs, not a swift, sure, fast-moving, deadly martial artist. </p>
<p>Either your character is an avatar (representation) of what you want to do or a physically accurate simulation that you control, and it's tough to blend the two. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in Toribash (the simulation), every joint has to be extended, contracted, held in place, or relaxed. There's no in between these. Each &quot;move&quot;, or combination of joints doing one of the four operations, takes a turn to complete, so the result looks very robotic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And coming from a year's worth of experience playing the game, the player doesnt have the ability to move realistically because you can rotate limbs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't such animations be calculated and baked into the game? The example of batman's cape flapping is a good illustration: a physics engine could simulate the cloth very realistically. Then, for each punch animation, you can generate all the corresponding cape animations and put them in the final game.</p>
<p>Similarly, the step animations could be made for each type of stair and for a number of gaits.</p>
<p>(also, if you make all the stairs multiples of N steps, the animation looping wouldn't be a problem).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's pretty common too now.  Generating animations based on a physics simulator then simply baking the animations into the source file then exporting it out as if it was hand-animated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another big problem with stairs is that you can go up them at an angle, making the required stride/step length longer. It would be really hard to make animations for a range of stride lengths.</p>
<p>There is a solution though: procedural animations. There are some games using them (Grow Home) but they can be expensive and unpredictable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what someone else brought up earlier too.  Using points on the stairs to tell the character where to place their foot.  Sounds good in theory but it's a terrible idea in practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue here (I think) would be that every instruction used to calculate the correct position of the cape takes away from an instruction used to do something else worthwhile. Here's a super simplified example that ignores tons of technological advances we have in place today:</p>
<p>Imagine that a CPU can only do one instruction per second. To make the cape billow after a punch, it takes 3 instructions with Engine X with assistance from animation.  Engine Y is much more particular, and it doesn't need your fancy animation assistance. However, it takes 5 instructions. Each time you punch, the game will stutter for an additional 2 seconds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are probably right that physically simulating will take more computer power. That is why /u/link0007 was wondering if it wouldn't be possible to have the animator simulate the cape with Engine Y and then record that and put it into a format usable by Engine X. So now you have a hybrid that has the quality of Y and the computing speed of X.</p>
<p>The XY hybrid method would make it easier for animators to generate accurate animations since it is not done by hand but most of the work is done by the computer. That way you can create lots of animations for a lot of moves and situations and then store them all separately to be used by engine X while spending only a fraction of the time that manually animating them would take. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern CPUs have power to spare running even the most demanding games. And they run at ~200 billion instructions per second (also not a very good measure of power/speed).</p>
<p>In this case it's mostly that game developers don't have the time or resources to work on things like this.</p></div>		</li>
