			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll have to dig up a study, but IIRC not significantly more so than other public surfaces. Caveat being that they're all teeming. </p>
<p>Way too many people don't wash their hands in the bathroom, though. Too many. Men (and honestly women, too, but I mostly hear this from dudes) like to give the excuse that &quot;i don't have to touch my junk, so my hands are clean.&quot;</p>
<p>1) shaking isn't good enough, dab, and</p>
<p>2) you've touched all of the aforementioned teeming public surfaces on your way in, you shitbird. Don't run away from one of your day's built-in opportunities to wash your damn hands, even if you do think your junk is Teflon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While most of your body's microflora DO genetically adapt to their environment (your body, thus making them &quot;your germs&quot;) most of the microbes (that would be a concern) you'd find on your phones/keyboard would NOT belong to that group. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously, go find a picture of a door with a foot pedal and post it to /r/pics with a title like &quot;Every bathroom should have this&quot;  and you'll get 1000 upvotes with in the day. </p></div>		</li>
