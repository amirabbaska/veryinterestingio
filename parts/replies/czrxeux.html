			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they white or are they clear? Most likely it is just some dermal cells that are attached to the hair. Perfectly normal.
Hair will vary in thickness all over the body and even in the same spots Ex. Someone can have thick and thin hairs on their chest at the same time.
Humans have terminal hair (hair on head, pubic hair etc.) and vellus hair (peach fuzz) so you may find some vellus hair mixed in where your terminal hair. </p></div>		</li>
