			<div class="markdown"><p>It only lasts a few months because that is the life span of the antibodies themselves. When you are exposed to a pathogen like a bacterium, cells in your immune system called B cells start making antibodies to it. Some of them morph into “memory B cells” which will remember the offending agent, giving you long lived immunity. If you see the same bacterium again, they will start producing antibodies to it. </p>
<p>When you get the antibodies transferred in passive immunity, you only get the antibodies, not the cells that produce new antibodies. Once the antibodies (immunoglobulins) break down in the blood stream, you lose the immunity.</p>
<p>This is vastly oversimplified with regards to how immunological memory develops but that’s the main gist of it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The antibodies are just proteins, they will denature or be broken down eventually. Since you are transfusing the antibodies but the recipient does not have memory B cells that can produce new antibodies for that disease, the recipient can't replace the transfused antibodies once they are gone. </p></div>		</li>
