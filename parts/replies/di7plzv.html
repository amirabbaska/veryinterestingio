			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure thats a basic emotion. Much like feeling hungry is not an emotion and craving a cigarette is not an emotion. </p>
<p>Sexual arousal is also a fairly popular field of study and it does utilize fMRI brain scans rigolously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In principle, we could study emotions in animals along a spectrum of neural complexity.  Because humans experience fear (exhibit fear behaviors) when we see a snake, and bonobos also experience fear (exhibit fear behaviors) when they see a snake, and because huamsn and bonobos have similar brains, we can reach some not-entirely-uncomfortable conclusions about bonobos experiencing fear.</p>
<p>Once we have a neural model of fear that humans and bonobos express, we can move to chimps, then gorillas.  So long as the model continues to predict successfully, we can move to further mammals (dogs, mice, etc.).</p>
<p>In principle, so long as the neural behavior explains fear in humans, AND it explains the appearance of fear in animals, AND it relies upon similar neural mechanisms, then we can reasonably conclude that bonobos experience fear like we do. </p>
<p>There are some limitations to this, but they are not that damning.  This line of study does not show that other animals have a similar EXPERIENCE as we do.  We can't know that they have the 'what it's like', that we have.  This means that, in the end, a neural model of fear is only incrementally better than a cardiovascular model of fear (which we already have, when animals get a fright their heart beats quickly.)  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given how small their dataset is the leave-one-out cross validation undoubtedly over estimates the performance of their classification. In my brief scan of the paper I also didn't see any mention of an independent validation set either (might have missed that). It seems like there are substantial issues in their benchmarking/modelling. Some discussion here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.russpoldrack.org/2012/12/the-perils-of-leave-one-out.html" target="_blank">http://www.russpoldrack.org/2012/12/the-perils-of-leave-one-out.html</a></p>
<p>In short, I'd be amazed if their classifier has any meaningful performance on MRI scans they didn't collect.</p>
<p>So I would say that paper doesn't meaningfully answer the question on whether brain scans can be used to assess what emotion someone is feeling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overfitting is definitely a major problem when it comes to applying machine learning on fMRI data, where there are typically more features than data points. The authors did not mention if any regularization was used, but they did mention that there were no hidden layers (which does add some confidence).
Also, if we look at the within-subject classification accuracy, it is actually way above chance. While LOOCV has its weakness, it is unlikely to have led to such huge inflation.
Given that the point of the paper was to examine if there is sufficient information for the discrimination of different emotions (and not to generate a model for classifying emotions based on fMRI data), I think that was a pretty good proof-of-concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who knows if regularization would help in this instance, that is not my point.</p>
<p>They don't describe how they characterise or control for their generalisation error. By extension it is not possible to tell if their model has just learnt their data (i.e. overfitted) or produced a predictive model. Which of those outcomes occurred is undecideable given the material presented in the paper. So we, and the authors, are not in a position to say if there is sufficient information in their data to discriminate different emotions (in the general case). As long as this core issue is undecidable I can not tell if this is a pretty good proof-of-concept or not.</p></div>		</li>
