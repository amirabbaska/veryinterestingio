			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really cool thanks. One more question; when this happens while conscious we notice the reflex, therefore some signal is sent to our brain correct? Is this signal still sent while unconscious?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The signal sent to your brain is actually not integral to the reflex. As explained above, reflexes are enacted by arcs that actually bypass the brain, allowing your body to act without the need for processing.</p>
<p>As to whether or not sensory signals are sent to the brain at all: it would depend on the anesthetic used in terms of type and technique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bypass is not the perfect word to explain this.  I'm not sure what is.  But it's like you are heading up the street to the roundabout (brain) but find you can do a quick U-turn half way up the block and head back to the quadriceps.  This short turn is much faster because it doesn't need to go all the way up and back. </p>
<p>To restate this: the signal doesn't bypass the brain. It doesn't go near or past it. It goes to the spinal cord and back again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to consider is that neuromuscular blockade is often used during general anesthesia. So even if the reflex is intact the muscle often wouldnt respond to the nerve signal </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct - drugs like succinylcholine and rocuronium (known as paralytic agents) prevent the body’s muscles from moving while under anesthetic. </p>
<p>In the case of other procedures where patients are awake but sedated, often they’ll be given a spinal anesthetic in addition to sedation. The spinal blocks all signals below the level of the spinal cord where it takes place (usually ~L4/5) - most importantly sensation but also motor activity, preventing any reflex. </p>
<p>As an aside, before starting surgery, anesthetists will often brush a patients eyelashes (or something similar) in order to try and elicit a motor reflex. If the reflex is present, surgery won’t start until it is no longer there. I imagine the same thing would be true of the knee jerk reflex (just harder to test in an OR once the sterile field is set up etc)</p></div>		</li>
