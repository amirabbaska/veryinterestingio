			<div class="markdown"><p>You won't notice it, unless you've absolutely filled your stomach. I've never seen or heard about this fact having any clinical significance. Normally, people don't eat enough small pieces of plastic for it to matter. There are some very interesting animal studies about this, though. It's also a convincing argument that humans aren't meant to eat extremely frequently (never having a period of 8 hours fasting). </p></div>		</li>
