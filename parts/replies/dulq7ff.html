			<div class="markdown"><p>A) Yes, but there's no such thing as a &quot;complete&quot; vacuum. B) Yes, that's how a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube" target="_blank">CRT</a> works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but paper, oil and plastics can have dielectric strengths (relative permittivity) 1000s of times greater than vacuum permittivity, making the required separation for a fixed C to decrease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to wikipedia, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_strength" target="_blank">dielectric strength</a> of vacuum is 10^18 V/m. I'm not even sure what that means, anyone want to explain it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some plastics reach relative permittivities in the 1000s. Most materials, including most oils and papers, have rps in the range <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_permittivity" target="_blank">3-10</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the plates are <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> close and the electric field huge (i.e. lots of energy being stored in the tiny capacitor) the electrons can actually tunnel across perfect vacuum.  In reality though there is no perfect vacuum so the electrons will start crossing even earlier then this theoretical break point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, you need more surface area to hold electrons or a better plate material, so you can’t just pack more on. (Is that right?). That’s why 1F can’t be microscopic.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dielectrics have essentially infinite resistance until they reach breakdown voltage. Capacitance is increased by the dielectric because the voltage applied to the capacitor deforms the electron cloud of the dielectric, which creates a counter voltage (reducing net voltage), altering:</p>
<p>Capacitance = Charge/Voltage</p></div>		</li>
