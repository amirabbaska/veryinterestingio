			<div class="markdown"><p>If I could expand on what you've already written: Kenneth Burke says that all of our identity-giving memberships (I am a college student, I am a conservative, etc.) come with a set of vocabulary words, or terms, that we recognize and use in a certain way. Our &quot;self&quot; is made of those memberships, and the terms form &quot;terministic screens&quot; that allow us to filter out information that goes against our terms (that are supplied by our identity) or receive information that doesn't. That's why Republicans use and respond to &quot;illegal alien&quot; where Democrats prefer &quot;undocumented immigrant,&quot; etc. I'm not sure if I explained that well, but you're absolutely right, we like information that (at least) sounds like what we already believe.</p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance occurs when reality or what we perceive as real conflicts with our self-construal (who we think we are, and who we think others think we are). One way to fix it is to change our beliefs, but it's easier to reassure ourselves or seek out information that assures us that our self-construal was in fact right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with you on pretty much everything except a college degree being any kind of proof that the person holding it can think. I went to three different US colleges and sat in several classes at Berkeley... its pretty much just the same &quot;memorize, regurgitate, repeat&quot; format of lower education. And I met plenty of idiots on all four campuses. As you said, educated doesnt necessarily mean intelligent. </p>
<p>Also, people who have studied a subject in college, even as little as a class or two on it, sometimes consider themselves experts on the subject, and are thus less likely to accept views contrary to whatever the class/curriculum/professor taught them. </p>
<p>If you think about it, college is really more a place where youre told what to think (and tested on how well youve memorized what youve been told) where in the real world you have to figure stuff out for yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, I'm with you on that.  I should have rephrased my statement to say that the college experience <em>should</em> confer upon graduates the ability to think and reason.  Not because these people are born smarter, but because college is supposed to give you four years of practice. Hence my expectations of college grads, and my greater disappointment when they can't employ the skills they should have learned.  It's like being a metal fabricator for four years, and then not knowing how to fabricate metal.  I didn't mean that in an elistist way at all.</p>
<p>Instead, the college experience boosts alcohol industry and flash card sales <strong>^guilty</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your renewed emphasis on &quot;should&quot; and &quot;supposed to&quot; pretty much have us on the same page. You didnt come off as elitist, and I hope I didnt come off as nitpicky... I just have some very strong opinions on US education. </p></div>		</li>
