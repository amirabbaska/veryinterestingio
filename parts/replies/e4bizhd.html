			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife's grandmother (86 years old) was in the hospital saying &quot;this is the end, I can see the pearly gates!&quot; (and she was very serious, and maybe a bit dramatic.  Two days later the doctors took her off the only medication she was on because she didn't need it anymore and discharged her.  When she came to our house after she was discharged, she came bursting through the door shouting &quot;Death couldn't hold me!&quot; and a bunch of other phrases in Spanish that I couldn't understand.  She's super active (and a bit insane) and it's been six years since then and we are starting to think we might die before her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother told me since I was a kid that her father once called her to the hospital (he was sick) and said “this is it, I’m going to die. Take care of this and that”. A few days later he died. She said he knew, but I never took her seriously.</p>
<p>One day my mother got sick, one day she called me to the hospital and said “this is it, I’m going to die. Please do this and that.” That was on a Sunday, on Tuesday morning she died.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My great-grandmother told her caretaker not to bother coming in the next day because she wouldn't be needed, and she died that night (age 83).  She'd been in pain for years so it's amazing how she could still distinguish when she was that close to the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My aunt was in a coma; woke up and joked and laughed like she always does; and then died the next day. Death is so weird. Like people suddenly feel fine and then they die soon after. Maybe it sounds silly but I guess that’s kind of meant to be? You get to remember them how they were. You enjoy them one last time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father in law hard liver disease from drinking, hepatitis C from a bad blood infusion and was obese when. I first met him.
He started working out, walking everywhere. He was eating healthier and taking better care of himself. One day he called us and said I'm going to visit grandpa and grandma my harley's at So and so's, he was a biker. Two days later we got a call he had a massive stroke at his dad's house.
We rushed down to be with him and my husband had to be the one to decide on his end game. We already knew because he was adamant throughout his life that he would never live as a &quot;vegetable&quot; on a respirator.
But in all that, it's almost like he knew too. But we were expecting one of the other things to take him first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I had a family member dying of cancer on hospice. We spent days and nights with her. The hospice nurse informed us we would experience different smells coming off of her. I’ll never forget that. As we huddled around her and held her hands I’ll never forget the smells. The smell of something like chlorine particularly stuck with me. </p>
<p>On a side note....the hospice cleaned each room after someone passed. And they placed a single rose across the bed. Walking down the hallway it was sad to see those rooms but I loved how they paid small tribute to each person. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hospice is such an incredible organization. When my grandma was reaching her final days the nurses were providing around the clock in-home care. The day before she passed the nurse told us that she had about 24 hours left. As the time got closer the nurses were able to give me and my family an exact breakdown of what was happening in her body and how much time she had left, saying things like “...her blood pressure has decreased to <strong>/</strong>. Now her kidney function is beginning to decline. Now the blood supply to the brain...etc,” </p>
<p>I cant remember the exact stuff she was telling us but as morbid as it sounds, it was extremely comforting having someone there who had so much experience with death. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandad died a couple of years ago of stage four cancer in his lungs that spread to his bones and further.</p>
<p>He was in the hospice for a few weeks and then they kicked him out to a hospital in leven because the hospice isn’t intended for “long term care” he died a few days later.</p>
<p>He went from a lovely environment with a view of a nice garden to a dim, empty hospital room. I think that was what pushed him over the edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My childhood dog lived to be 17. She had that smell for probably, about the last year, or so. She didn't seem to be suffering. Her eyesight worsened and her coat got wiry and thin and she had fatty lipomas everywhere but she continued to eat and drink, use the bathroom outside, and go up and down the stairs with relative ease. She got so gross that company didn't greet her with pats anymore. The family stopped letting her lick them because she smelled like her insides were rotting. I intentionally sat on the floor anytime I saw her that last year and petted her to her hearts content. I let her lick my feet, which, while disgusting to some, was her favorite thing to do. She would do &quot;drive-by&quot; licks of feet hanging off of the end of recliners her entire life, lol! I said my final goodbye to her many times that year. I never expected sweet Milo to live so long! I am glad I was intentional in loving her in her gross, old age. When the time came to help her die, it was quick and neither my sister or I had time to see her before my parents arrived at the vet's office with her. They paid before having her euthanized, went back with her, and held her for the rest of her living moments on Earth. She licked my dad's hand after the first, sedating shot but before the second heart-stopping one. She was a good, good girl. I very much hope to see her in the afterlife.</p></div>		</li>
