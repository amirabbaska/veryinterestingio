			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if the Cl- ions want to form neutral Cl atoms (or essentially Cl2) then they need to find a species that would happily take their electrons away. As it turns out, in water alone there aren't any species that would rather the electrons than chlorine.</p>
<p>Electrolysis is one way to remove the electrons in a controlled manner to produce Cl2. This requires energy input as we are trying to escape an energy well - pulling electrons away from their desired locations on an electronegative species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the solution needs to be charge balanced. That is, there can’t be excess positive or negative charge. In the case of NaCl, you’ll find Na+, Cl-, and ridiculously small amounts of NaCl that hasn’t dissolved. </p>
<p>For every 2 atoms of Cl- that come together, you would need 2 atoms of Na+ to accept the electrons the formation of Cl2 would release. This would balance the charge. The problem is, Na+ has an empty, high energy s orbital and Cl- has a full p orbital that is lower in energy with respect to Na+. The energy penalty for moving an electron from a filled low energy orbital to an empty higher energy s orbital is huge and prevents this reaction from taking place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. You can also frame it in terms of electronegativity, where sodium is very electropositive and chlorine is very electronegative. So taking an electron from a chloride ion and giving it to a sodium ion is definitely not happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At a macroscopic level the solution needs to be balanced.  At the atomic level the Cl- doesn't stay bound to Na+.  At what scale do the Cl- and Na+ ions need to &quot;stay close to each other&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with energy levels. Water is a polarized molecule, so ions form easily around it. You can create chlorine gas by adding energy to it, but water provides a large barrier to activation energy which is why it's such a good solvent. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you're thinking about studying Chemistry I couldnt recommend it enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd say go for environmental or chemical engineering.  A degree in chemistry, for whatever reason, doesn't pay nearly as well as those.  Yet you get to learn much of the same stuff.  In OPs case the environmental path seems ideal - if you like the work.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Advance Material (Nanomaterials/polymers, Energy, Biomedical, applied electronics/organic electronics, batteries and probably soon graphene) chemistry is getting bigger and bigger and the high end (PhD) jobs are very well paid.  Theres a lot of jobs in analytical chemistry, but it is hard for many people to pursue their passions in analytics.</p>
<p>But if you don’t want to pursue more than a first degree, a clever way to do it is get a  professional college level technical formation first. Then get a part-time technician job and then pursue University degree(s).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nanomaterials, organic electronics, and graphene are mostly just research phase atm. I also wouldnt recommend biomedical materials with just a bs, usually a PhD kinda deal. Applied electronics, batteries, and polymers are huge tho. Especially polymers. I would also recommend a degree in material science for any of those rather than a chem degree :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with degrees in chemistry I can't disagree with the idea of getting a degree in chemistry more. If you get a PhD then you are potentially employable, otherwise you will never make any real money or even have a job that isn't mind-numbingly awful (or close to it) and the PhD doesn't guarantee an interesting job or money either, it just makes it base-line possible. I would do as suggested here and definitely go for an adjacent degree, but definitely NOT just a degree in chemistry.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So if two chloride ions approached they would repel each other because they are both negatively charged. In the exact same way that the negative ends of two magnets would repel each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little nit-picky, but it's not like how magnets repel each other. That's a magnetic force, while the chlorine ions repel by the electric force. Magnets would rotate in order to align their fields. This would never happen in a chlorine ion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand, difference there isn't electric vs magnetic force, it's monopole vs dipole. A chloride ion cannot rotate to align it's field but a water molecule or any other dipole could and would rotate just like a magnet in magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>
