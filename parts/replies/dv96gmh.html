			<div class="markdown"><p>so what about the amount that's released? </p>
<p>I'm wondering since I mostly drink water, and always drink from a re-used plastic(PET) bottle(since I can knock it over without spilling, and I drink sips of water troughout the day instead of a whole glass at a time).</p>
<p>so, would it be better to take a glass, or is the amount released into the water in a plastic bottle so small it's no concern, even if drinking from it all day?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is not something you need to worry about at all.  The leaching rate is also proportional to temperature, so cold or room temperature water will absorb a nearly indetectible amount.  The issue with baby bottles is that they are regularly heated which increases the mass transfer rate.</p>
<p>So, I maybe wouldn't use a PET coffee mug, but water bottles are totally safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems that there is strong consensus that some leaching occurs in most plastics, but that this is typically associated with heating (or UV exposure).  Does the rate of leaching increase after heat exposure through degradation or just during exposure to high heat?  For example, I wash my plastics in the dishwasher but rarely heat food or put hot liquids in them.  By exposing them to 120-150F water in the dishwasher, am i breaking down the plastic and still increasing my exposure even though I only add foods/water once cool and then store cold?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, ambient conditions affect the rate of degradation.  As a general rule, heat, sunlight/UV, and time will all increase how quickly/how much will leach out of a plastic.  So, for instance, a bottle holding water outside on a hot day will likely contain more degradation products than a similar bottle kept in the dark in a refrigerator.  As far as washing plastic in the dishwasher, I’d imagine that’s fine since the bottle is rinsed as part of the process. In fact that’s usually my strategy for reusing plastic bottles: a quick rinse before use and try to avoid prolonged storage (like, days. Bringing a bottle to work with you is fine) of liquids. Sidenote: definitely never microwave disposable plastics, microwaves can ramp up degradation extremely quickly.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you use some discretion in how you treat your plastic containers I’d imagine most of the risk is mitigated.  I usually tell people that, statistically, time spent worrying about trace contaminants in food/drinks is probably better spent making sure your car’s brakes are in good working order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The disappointing answer is, we're not sure.</p>
<p>You are definitely washing away BPA as the plastic goes through the dishwasher, yes. So overall the washed surfaces will have a lower BPA concentration to offer the water you pour into it.</p>
<p>However, BPA is an additive in plastic because it improves the hardness. As plastic breaks down, it may be presenting tiny cracks and more surface area to the water, allowing fresh surfaces with more BPA to offer.</p>
<p>It's hard to say.</p></div>		</li>
