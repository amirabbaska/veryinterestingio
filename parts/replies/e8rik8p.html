			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have migraines but do grind my teeth at night as a drug side effect. I hadn't even considered a night guard, so thanks, I will bring this up with my dentist next visit and go from there.</p>
<p>I did experience two aura in the past, I think. Very mild compared to what you discribe. The partial blindness lasted about an hour-ish but the headaches and nausea subsided after a few hours. Very freaky the first time and not cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you may have solved the question I've had for years. I used to have migraines multiple times a week growing up but they stopped around the age of 15. Coincidentally I stopped grinding my teeth around that time as well. Don't know if that's exactly it but it's an idea.</p></div>		</li>
