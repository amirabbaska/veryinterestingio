			<div class="markdown"><p>I also had that part about defending the Constitution from enemies, foreign and domestic in the oath I took at my enlistment. It's something some enlisted guys take seriously since we swear to the Constitution before agreeing to obey orders. So it's not that different of an oath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was going to say, I recall reciting the foreign and domestic line as well (Army enlisted).  Google suggests the entire swear in was as follows (I certainly don't recall it from memory):</p>
<p>&quot;I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the oath is to, &quot;...obey the orders of the President of the United Stated <em>and</em> the orders of the officers appointed over me...&quot;, what happens in the hypothetical event that the orders of POTUS and the orders of commanding officers contradict? Does one always supersede the other, or is it based on the legality/ethics/constitutionally of the orders themselves?</p></div>		</li>

Theoretically, as a citizen you are at the top of the president's chain of command, as the president serves the citizens. Swearing to obey your employee would be antithetical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me if this question is out of your wheelhouse, but it's been a debate among friends (even before Trump took office).</p>
<p>Every bit of media I've read says if the President says launch the Nukes, they have to fly, because nobody in the chain of command can tell him no, even though VP and Sec. Of Defense have to confirm the order. Is this true, or can someone simply stand down and refuse and not break their oath? I'm of the mindset that there's someone that could stop it, and some friends agree and some disagree .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure they could stand down. Pilots could decide not to fly their alert aircraft, silos could decide to abort the launch and so-on. There are consequences and people could go to prison for violating a lawful order.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why there's disagreement. People, even in the military, have free will. Whether they are likely or unlikely to execute a specific order is a different question.</p>
<p>A similar scenario came in June of 1980 - twice. Pilots of alert B52's all over the US received real and lawful orders to launch and nuke their targets from a faulty computer. Interestingly, there were no orders in the process to stand-down. The account I know of is straight from one of the co-pilots and is very interesting but unfortunately there <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/25685/7-close-calls-nuclear-age" target="_blank">aren't</a> a <a href="https://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/Breakthrough/book/chapters/borning.html" target="_blank">lot </a> of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-were-close-calls-for-a-nuclear-attack-to-the-USA" target="_blank">sources online</a> that go into much detail about the first weeks of June, 1980.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the end, cooler heads prevailed, and the crews, after some hours, followed an illegal order to park their bombers and thusly, stopped a nuclear war. Interestingly, War Games was released just a few short years later...hmmm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's my concern though: Yes, those that would be ordered to operationally launch the missile can stand down - but all you need is one person to go along with the order. And if the president is insistent and relieves from duty those that are disobeying the order, at some point he will find someone who will carry the order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends, basically if an order is consider immoral or illegal you can refuse to follow it, but you better be sure it is or can face a court martial or some other disciplinary measure. </p>
<p>Ultimately the federal government and military is made up of people, and starting at the top with Mattis I believe they fully understand the implications of nuclear war and wouldn't follow that order unless they agreed it was the final and only option. With a weaker secdef it's hard to tell what would happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To attempt to answer simply:</p>
<p>A lot of people look at it from the wrong perspective.  The law is not a physical boundary, but a philosophical one, so there is always some wiggle room because there is always some exception, some matters or circumstances around an event that may give it semi-unique meaning.  It all goes on a case by case basis because of this.</p>
<p>Not only in the military, but in civilian life, anyone <em>can</em> do anything.</p>
<p>What a court or other officially judging party may or may not convict for is another matter.</p>
<p>It all hinges on what you/they can prove and what rationale you can demonstrate within the established order of law.</p>
<p>There are means for justifying denying to follow an order, that's where the second half of that sentence applies.</p>
<p>But it has to be justified, one can't just arbitrarily deny an order without the chance of facing punishment.</p>
<p>An example in civilian life, a plea of &quot;self defense&quot;.  If you can demonstrate that, you <em>can</em> kill people without much consequence.  You <em>can</em> use that plea for out and out murder, and you might get away with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also something ingrained in a lot of Soldiers, Marines, etc. While we know that we must obey orders from superior officers, we acknowledge that orders that are illegal/immoral/unethical aren't ones we have to obey. That doesn't mean it won't come without consequences if not done in the proper manner, though, and there is obviously a lot of ways to interpret morals and ethics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the severity of how immoral it is, too. It's not always an all or nothing situation. An example I have is following an order under protest, to spend all of our budget on crap we didn't need a week before we lost the budget balance for the year.  I felt it was immoral to waste half my annual salary just to say we used it, but in the end I did it because it wasn't an illegal order. But my branch head and divo who had desks two cubicles over heard it and knew I felt it was wrong. </p>
<p>That was about as far as I could take it without sacrificing myself to make a point, and saving my $20k budget didn't seem worth that in the big picture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, that spending situation is common to any organization that sets fixed budgets. The only way to ensure you have discretionary funding when you need it is to always 'need' that much. </p>
<p>When the cuts do come, the people who only spent for what they needed, staying under budget, will suffer. Over spenders get rewarded for being wasteful.</p></div>		</li>
