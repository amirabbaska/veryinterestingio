			<div class="markdown"><p>There has been communication as recently as Feb 18th! Dr. Park, the lead scientist, <a href="http://www.talk-polywell.org/bb/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=6139&amp;start=45#p124371" target="_blank">responded to a list of questions put together by folks on talk-polywell.org</a>.</p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During our WB-8 campaign, we found out that the magnetically insulated grid does not work due to Debye shielding . . . Instead, we now think it is in principle possible to form a deep electrostatic potential well using electron beam injection when there is sufficiently good electron beam confinement. This is because of the enhanced electron beam confinement in a high beta cusp, which greatly lowers the required beam input power . . . However, we are not aware of any previous work on this (both theory and experiment)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the original design features of the Polywell was using a magnetically insulated &quot;grid&quot; to keep electrons confined to the center of the device. The electrons make a negatively charged potential well, helping to attract the positively charged ions in the plasma that you want to fuse. Because this didn't work out, you'd think that the Polywell concept was finished, and they would be completely demoralized. Not so! Instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now we know that a high beta cusp can provide a means for electron confinement good enough for a fusion reactor, which in turn can make the electrostatic ion acceleration and confinement a reality. Throw in the inherent plasma stability of cusp, we may have one of the most attractive fusion concepts . . .  We absolutely plan to focus on the formation of a potential well with sufficient electron beam power and sufficiently good electron beam confinement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One other really interesting detail - having magnetically insulated coils puts enormous physical strain on the device. The WB-8 prototype had</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mechanical strength to handle over 30 metric tons of compressional and substantial shear stresses for each coil support at the same time in one package. What we did not discuss much is how [much] simpler it is to design a Polywell device not utilizing magnetically insulated grid approach.</p>

<p>Even though the US navy is no longer funding this research the Navy tried to put ITAR restrictions on the project. Very recently a judge has lifted these restrictions, and no the EMC2 company is once again <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polywell#Going_public" target="_blank">going public</a> with its results and presenting its plans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well good. Any idea why the restrictions in the first place? Was it an automatic thing, or did the Navy see something with promise there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there's actual merit behind this, why not present it to one of the forward thinking young tech entrepreneurs, like larry page or Elon Musk. It's pennies to them, but if it works, it would be their greatest legacy, and they'd become the first trillionaire.</p></div>		</li>
