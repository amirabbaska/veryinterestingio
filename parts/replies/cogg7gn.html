			<div class="markdown"><p>I certainly think that &quot;So they faked the moon landings, but the Russians never noticed or pointed it out to the rest of the world?&quot; should be a compelling &quot;argument&quot;</p>
<p>There's also a video on youtube somewhere where a bloke explains that they didn't actually have the film technology to fake the moon footage, given the framerates of the footage and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that the Russians accepted the landing as fact is the most compelling argument. They had the biggest motive and the greatest means to disprove a landing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really - conspiracy theorists will have you believe that the russians wanted the race to end as well, and was in on it. Most conspiracy theorists claim only the first landing to be fake, and probably not the rest. Thus side-stepping a lot of counter arguments. Clinging to the idea that they could reach the moon, just not in time, and that the russians accepted this and wanted an end to the very expensive space race. From a psychological stand-point, it's a rather compelling argument, all facts being thrown out the window first, of course. I can see why some people find it to be a comfortable middle-ground to stand on.</p>
<p>Why Putin, however, wouldn't have shamed the U.S. by revealing all this, that's kind of hard to tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i agree, yet i also feel an equally compelling argument is the fact that, given scheduling and travel cash, one could take the skeptic to see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment" target="_blank">Lunar Ranging Experiment</a>, (assuming it is still in operation by the time they make it there). </p>
<p>Or maybe just show them the website.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used that argument on an associate. They responded with something along the lines of, &quot;It would have been beneficial to the Russians to let the US fake a moon landing, as neither country was anywhere near accomplishing it. The Russians were just wasting their money. If the US 'landed on the moon' first, they could stop spending their money.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Problem with that is that the Soviets continued to spend money on their own moon-landing program until 1974, and that same program's existence was classified by the Soviets until 1990. It wouldn't serve as a face-saving propaganda measure to publicly corroborate a &quot;faked&quot; American moon-landing  in order to justify canceling of one's own classified program 5 years later, and only declassify that program during the dismantling of  Soviet state 16 years after that.
Funfact: the Soviet program produced the Proton rocket that Russia still uses to this day, and the Soviet equivalent to the Saturn V was called the N1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the Russians wanted to win just as much as the US did. This was a battle to determine the number 1 superpower in the world. You can bet anything that the Russians would want that title. Their claim makes no sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is that even an argument? The US were the ones in the position to dump truckloads of cash onto NASA until they reached the moon while the Soviets had financial problems.</p>

<p>That sentence doesn't really make sense to me. Am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't matter what the computational power was.  The fact is that we did it, and that's provable by the presence of the mirror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I'm 100% confident in the moon landing.  We recently landed a robot on Mars.  That flight was unmanned.  It wouldn't be farfetched to say that the mirror was placed on the moon in a similar fashion.  I'm not saying that happened but I wouldn't use the &quot;there is a mirror on the Moon&quot; argument to say we were there.</p>
<p>Edit:I blame my lack of sleep for saying Jupiter instead of Mars.  I'm so sorry Curiosity.  Please forgive me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's not. We have rovers on Mars and Venus. We did goto the moon but suggesting that only a human could place a mirror on the moon is absurd. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I doubt the moon landings but this is a weak argument to make.  All it proves is that we landed something on the moon, an almost trivial task compared to landing and bringing home a manned capsule.  If NASA wanted, they could put a similar retro reflector on Mar's moon without too much trouble, compare that with the cost and complexity if landing living humans there and bringing them home again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much more complex would it really be? You still have to actually put something in a lunar orbit, and land it in the right place. At least you'd have an intelligent being on board who could make adjustments to orbits, etc, and fix things. If you could do that, it's not that much more effort to enlarge the ship and put oxygen and three seats in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's not the best of arguments because you could always have a robotic lander place the mirror (or even be the mirror, for that matter). There's much better proof.</p></div>		</li>
