			<div class="markdown"><p>There were two islands that showed up on early maps of Lake Superior, and were later were used to define the US-Canada border. Upon further exploration of the new border is was determined that those islands didn't exist. Sometimes people just lied about islands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>..... Do you understand what my question was asking? There used to be a practice of map-makers placing false information on their maps to detect when someone else publishes a similar map by simply copying their work.</p>
<p>So what I was asking specifically if <em>mistakes</em> were made in a given case or intentional deception.</p>
<p>What are you basing your conclusion on that the maps were lieing rather than mistaken? Because certainly, both are possible but it would be interesting to know which is the case from example to example if we can. A real island that is a bit off its correct location is most likely a mistake while an island that simply doesn't exist at all is likely the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it would apply in this context but “Paper Town” is the word for a town map makers put on their maps as copyright traps. For example; Algoe, New York is probably the most famous paper town. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Barrier islands off the coast of Florida completely disappear after hurricanes sometimes. They are usually uninhabited since nobody's willing to build anything on something that might disappear.  When somebody commits to building something though usually defend it during storms and prevent it from disappearing.  Until someone lays down the foundation it's just a sandbar with trees growing on it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some ancient maps show areas when sea levels were lower when those islands reached above the surface of the ocean and were able to be mapped.  Ancient maps that were barely legible 500 years ago that have been recreated and the originals since destroyed depicting many interesting finds.  It is one of the arguments for an ancient advanced civilization we have yet to discover. </p></div>		</li>
