			<div class="markdown"><p>OPs question: Why rich countries have a higher cancer rater than poor ones ?</p>
<p>Your intro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't know this for sure, but I would guess <strong>access to diagnosis.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your final paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In richer countries (like the US), cancer rates are higher among those who are poor, because of <strong>decreased access to health care.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm pretty sure these are contradictory statements. If access to diagnosis is the reason rich countries have higher cancer rates, but cancer rates in richer countries are higher among the poor, that means the poor must have access to diagnosis. But you said a reason that their cancer rates are higher is because of their decreased access to care. Perhaps you meant decreased access to preventative care?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Folks who are lower income have decreased (financial) access to both preventative care, which increases the risk of developing things like cancer, while also having decreased access to treatment. Being poor in the US is different from living in a poor country, though. Poor country-&gt;less infrastructure-&gt;decreased physical AND financial access to both preventative care and treatment. I can see how my original wording was super contradictory. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem. I thought you meant that their rates are higher because of decreased access to preventative care, but you hadn't articulated it that way. Also, it doesn't end there. Diet tends to be poorer, they are more likely to smoke, more likely to have a higher BMI, and you already mentioned environmental factors which play a part as well. It's not just decreased access to primary care, I actually think the things I listed are more likely to lead to cancer than primary care access. Just being in a lower socio-economic status inherently comes with all of those things that increase their risk for cancer (among MANY other diseases and ailments).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A PET scan can cost $6-7000.  I've had to get PET scans every 4 months for the last 2 years.  I'm fortunate that I have a max yearly out of pocket of &quot;only&quot; $4000, but it's still eating me alive over time and I'll likely never be able to stop because of the type of cancer I had.</p>
<p>I'm guessing poor folk don't have access to the kind of insurance I do, which makes it barely affordable to me.</p>
<p>In other words, even if a GP or an ER doc thinks you might have cancer, what do you do from there?  You can't diagnose it without biopsies, expensive scans, etc.  I think my initial diagnosis cost my insurance 15 days in the hospital and probably close to 50,000 worth of scans and biopsy surgeries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, I work with oncology providers during some of the hospital work I do. The really poor are better off that the working  poor in many insurance situations, as they have more benefits afforded by the state. You'd have to have a good grasp of insurance providers and contractual rates and network provider-ship to be able to speak to that. If a physician at a hospital we work at suspects cancer, they won't refer for scanning but verify ability to pay. The patient will get their diagnosis one way or another. They just may not be able to pay the bill for their diagnostics in many cases. And their treatment options may be very different, but that you think they just won't get diagnosed is a bit surprising, because in practice that just isn't how it works in the U.S. for the most part.</p>
<p>FYI I hope your cancer stays in remission. Or if the goal was curative I hope there is no recurrence!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s what I was thinking. I’m no expert or anything but I would assume that it’s equal everywhere, it’s just with poorer countries, not everyone can get diagnosed therefore it goes unknown/untreated. </p></div>		</li>
