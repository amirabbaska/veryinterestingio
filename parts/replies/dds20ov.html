			<div class="markdown"><p>Call it collapse, call it &quot;the moment different branches stop interfereing&quot;, doesn't make it clearer either way. You are left with all the same questions you have in Copenhagen interpretation, but now on top of them you are also having uncountably infinite set of noninteracting universes. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You no longer have issues about what an observer is or what measurement means, those are explained. The number of universes isn't actually infinite because the hilbert space isn't that big. It's bounded by something like 2^(surface area of the universe). And the fact that they don't interact explains why they aren't observed, which was a long standing problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Decoherence allows you to describe situations in which the collapse is not complete. In other interpretations, like the Copenhagen interpretation or the Many-Worlds interpretation, a wave function either collapses or it doesn't, but that's not what we observe. They get around this problem by making 'complete' collapse a separate catagory from 'partial' collapse and treating the later in an entanglement framework, but it's not clear to me why 'complete' collapse shouldn't just be the most extreme version of entanglement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The thought experiment works just as well if the cat is a single electron. Decoherence of macroscopic systems is irrelevant in such a case.</p></div>		</li>
