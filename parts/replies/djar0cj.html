			<div class="markdown"><p>An indoor firefighter is required to take more classes AND participate in a live burn.  Exterior firefighters are people that want to help out, but not be full-blown crazy like the rest of us that run into burning structures while others are running out.  </p>
<p>P.S.  I'm at the top of the heap, I'm a volunteer, and do it for free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, it got away from me.  :p  The first answer was pretty accurate, about the hottest burn due to the availability of oxygen.  I can't comment much on it, because I'm not a fire investigator, sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, that should have been &quot;interior&quot;.  However, if you've never heard of that term either, I'm in PA.  I've never heard of a structural firefighter, so maybe it's a coastal thing?</p></div>		</li>
