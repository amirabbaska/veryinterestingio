			<div class="markdown"><p>wait. i thought wounds healed best in dry environments because bacteria grows in moist environments. by keeping a wound moist, don't you allow for more bacteria to breed? i suppose it is a mixture of good and bad bacteria.. but still.. i've always heard to keep wounds dry. hence why you let your wound 'breathe' instead of continuously bandaging it and smothering it with neosporin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of wounds, and they have different environments they heal best in. A superficial cut that doesn't penetrate deeper than the skin you can keep dry, because all you need is the scab to stay in place and it'll heal fine, usually. But for more serious wounds, moisture is fine in the context of professional wound care where you're having daily, sterile dressing changes (e.g. in a hospital). Your average wound bed which is healing well should have pink granulation tissue, and be moist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the wound. Some larger wounds are left to heal by what's called secondary intention. Basically letting the wound heal open without closing it with sutures first. They'll wet a dressing and put it on the wound and then let it dry. What it does is creates a surface for granulation tissue to form, which is one of the first stages of wound healing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up Dr. George Winter. His research has created a whole market of moist wound care dressings. Of which I do product development for. It's mostly aimed at hard to heal chronic wounds like diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, wounds on older/ less healthy individuals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically an abscess is what forms when the body tries to wall off the infection. A cyst is different from an abscess as it has a true epithelial lining and does not necessarily indicate an infection. It can become inflamed and infected but it would just be an inflamed or infected cyst, not an abscess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both gram negative and gram positive bacteria can kill you. Typically the anaerobic bacteria create the worst and nasty infections. An example of a gram positive infection would be a staph infection of the skin. A gram negative infection could be a urinary tract infection caused by E. Coli. Both infections have the potential to kill you if neglected. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gram - has lipid a (endotoxin) in their outer membrane though so they're toxic just from that even if they don't secrete any other toxins. Maybe that's what OP couldn't remember?</p></div>		</li>
