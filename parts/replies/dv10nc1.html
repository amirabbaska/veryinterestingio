This has been nicely illustrated in the following study:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.  I can have windows open year round with lights on indoors, and hardly a bug flies in.
Noticed the difference just in the last 5 years, because that's when I moved house, and had to have housemates catch bugs for me.<br />
The decimation of insect life is terrifying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can have some of our bugs. In Massachusetts we've had some brutal years in terms of bugs. Ticks, stink bugs, caterpillars, butterflies, moths, all have been huge the last couple years. Probably more, I'm just listing out the pests that I deal with on a regular basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My SO asked me last year if I noticed that there are no flies around lamps anymore at night. If this is proportional to the overall population it's frightening. And the cited study seems to confirm this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Come to Florida dear sir or mam and leave your window open at night. Let me know the results. If i turn a porch light on in the summer I'm assaulted by at least 30 species of bugs and 200 moths, spiders, roaches and palmeto bugs. Its great. Especially with a moth phobia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the best things we can do to help is creating way-stations for these important insects. Skip exotic plants in your yard and go for local flowering species. <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/plant-of-the-week/asclepias_syriaca.shtml" target="_blank">Common milkweed</a> is essential to the butterfly communities on the east coast. Bees love almost all flowers but try to go for ones <a href="https://thehoneybeeconservancy.org/plant-a-bee-garden/" target="_blank">with big single heads</a> as they tend to have more nectar. </p>
<p>You can even help if you live in an apartment! See if your landlord will allow flower boxes. Or perhaps you can build a <a href="https://gardentherapy.ca/bee-bath/" target="_blank">bee bath</a> somewhere on the property where it's unlikely to be noticed. Just make sure to add water regularly! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I especially like how he mentions that our European honey bees are in fact invasive species. For thousands of years not a single honey bee was on the american continent, yet our wild flowers and plants thrived the entire time. I lived near a wildlife refuge for a large part of my life and I could tell reddit all about how people would try to protect a certain animal or creature or plant because it was cute, or made berries that tasted good, despite it wreaking havoc on the refuge daily.</p>
<p>I almost feel like this uproar for the decline of bees are by farmers wanting more political support for their apiarists ways, but this isn't r/conspiracy so I'm not going to elaborate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the bee is able to decide male or female when releasing eggs? How on earth is she able to tell the difference? Fascinating! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cause those plants weren't dependent on honey bees, rather other pollinators. A lot of the important crops we use honey bees to pollinate, almonds for example, aren't indigenous here just like the bees. I'm pretty sure honey bees aren't native to Europe either and were brought to Europe just like they were to America. </p></div>		</li>
