			<div class="markdown"><p>They technically should be able to echolocate through air. Just a different medium that the sound waves are travelling through. Although this could also be a big difference because sound travels faster through air than water. </p>
<p>Edit: below guy(s) are correct. Was thinking that but wrote the other. Whoops. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got that backwards. Sound travels faster through water than air. About three times as fast too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is incorrect. The speed of sound through seawater is around 1500 meters per second whereas through air it’s about 350 m/s. </p>
<p>Sound through a solid is much faster still. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely not. Notice the lack of external ears. They rely on sound conduction through tissue to the inner ear. Tissue has similar acoustic impedance as water, hence most of the sound coming in through water passes through tissue without much reflection from the tissue-water interface. In air, because of the high impedance mismatch, pretty much all sound is reflected from the air-tissue interface and hence the dolphins don't hear well. There are also issues about the different sound speeds and delays the dolphins are adapted to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess not, or the echolocation would be much less precise, given that the echolocation would be specialised/tuned to operate in water. Comparatively, medical ultrasound imaging can not operate through air - it requires fluid contact. The difference in refractive index from air to fluid is so extreme that 100% of the ultrasound is reflected by the interface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to travel through an interface when they're above water though. I agree that it's likely worse in air but look at bats that have amazing echolocation in air</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think (hope) he means in nature. So with bats they echolocate 99-99.9% of the time. They can use their echolocation to catch an insect in flight before going after another a few seconds later. So it’s accurate but it’s active and some insects have adapted to hear and thereby avoid them.</p>
<p>That being said, their eyesight is pretty much as good as ours. So very occasionally you will get a bat that for whatever reason chooses not to echolocate. Maybe it’s tired (energy), maybe it’s trying to be a bit more subtle (predation - gleaning), but this more frequently happens whilst it’s still light.</p>
<p>I’d be amazed to hear that dolphin eyes are even approaching vestigial and it would really surprise me to learn that they echolocate ALL the time. They are an incredibly intelligent species And most intelligent species take visual cues from each other (body language etc) which likely adds to vocal information.</p>
<p>That all being said I’m a general ecologist with an interest in bats (amongst other things) and my knowledge of dolphin behaviour comes from watching TV shows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've been told by the dolphin experts yes, they do echolocate ALL the time.  They have eyes, but they don't rely on them.  They can pick up things like body language through echolocation.  They can even &quot;feel&quot; textures through echolocation.  </p>
<p>It's to the point that when I showed up to check out the dolphins, the trainers actually gave me a dolphin missing an eye.  When I asked about it they said &quot;oh yeah, he's pretty old.  His eye probably isn't in there but it's hard to tell.&quot;  These are meticulously well maintained dolphins and their trainers were totally unconcerned and really didn't even notice a missing eyeball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They echolocate all the time.  Through air and water which is how they perceive the world.  When trainers lift their arm or aim a rod somewhere, they can still &quot;see&quot; this through echolocation.  Plus, almost all the trainers use whistles incoordination with the visual signals.  Plus, they can see, they have eyes (most of them) they just don't use them.</p></div>		</li>
