			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you want to. Counter intuitively when you fast your body switches over to a self repair mode. As long as you have enough fat on your body it can burn it as a fuel source.</p>
<p>Fasting for up to 3 weeks can be really good for many immune disorders. However for most people I would say going into ketosis and staying there for a while will help out assuming you have the fat to do it. </p>
<p>However if you have medical conditions outside of just getting sick you should consult a doctor before fasting for any extended amount of time past a few days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a medicine called cyprohept. They gave it to my son when he was younger to help promote his appetite. It's used a lot for HIV patients and anorexics from what I read. It did great for my son on and off. He ate more when he was on steroids though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a palliative doctor (admittedly not a researcher), but this is the core of how we view the cachexia syndrome. Sadly, many weight gain agents (e.g. corticosteroids, megesterol) cause fat gain but not lean mass gain. Cachexia (what you seen in cancer, COPD, heart failure, TB, etc.) is different from starvation in that you don't go the usual carbs --&gt; fat --&gt; protein loss pattern. It's why cancer patients look skinny in a very different way from just thin people; they're losing a lot of muscle mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An umbrella term for this is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickness_behavior" target="_blank">Sickness behavior</a>. Cytokines released in the periphery (outside the brain) from trying to fight pathogens can cross the blood brain barrier, then activate your brains immune cells (microglia). Microglia can move through the brain and regulate neurons in specific regions, including regions that regulate hunger, etc. I'm sorry I don't know more about the anorexia behavior, I focus more on the sickness behaviors depression and anxiety so if anyone has questions, I can try and answer! </p>
<p>Edit: and it's not just pathogens that cause these cytokines to be  released. This is one of the reasons stress makes some people lose their appetite! Stress can regulate immune cells to release cytokines which turns back onto the brain to change behavior. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sickness behavior can cause a low libido (and low motivation). Here's a paper that reviews some of that, but this paper focuses on sex differences, so they say female rodents in these studies were more likely to have low reproductive behavior. But this isn't to say males don't also experience some level of low libido.

<p>Edit: to clarify, there are many cytokines with many specific functions. The one's I know lead to sickness behavior are called 'pro-inflammatory' cytokines (such as IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6). But there are anti-inflammatory cytokines that may have the opposite effect (but don't quote me on that! I'm just not as familiar with anti-inflammatory cytokines). </p></div>		</li>
