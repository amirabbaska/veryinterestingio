			<div class="markdown"><p>The last piece of the puzzle - why logic machines can do calculations - is Boolean algebra.</p>
<p>Boolean algebra, named for George Boole who did a lot of work pioneering math in binary operations, lets us do math using only binary values - 1's and 0's. So, that development lets us perform standard mathematical operations with only the binary values, which means we can do standard math with a logic machine.</p>
<p>The final step that really tied this all together was when Claude Shannon showed (for his friggin <em>master's thesis, at the age of 21</em>) that you can use Boolean logic to perform <em>any</em> computation. This means that a logic machine can perform not only standard math, but any operation that we can formulate as a mathematical operation. So now computers are not just calculators but Turing-complete, generalized computation machines.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have the same opinion for magnets. As a kid you think they are magic. By the time you're an adult you might have had it explained, talking about charges and photons and Maxwells equations. I however am pretty sure that's just a really long winded way of saying &quot;fairy dust&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are three different types of magnets: natural magnets, artificial magnets, and electromagnets. Natural magnets are naturally magnetized minerals. An artificial magnet is typically a piece of iron that retains a magnetic field induced upon it from a natural magnet. Lastly, electromagnets are created when electric current flows through a coil of wire. When a magnet retains its magnetic properties, it is considered a permanent magnet. When a magnet retains only part of its magnetic properties, it is considered a temporary magnet. All magnets are polarized as well. Just like the Earth, which is a magnet itself, magnets have north and south poles. These poles are identified as red for north, and blue for south. Similar to the laws of electrostatic charges, unlike poles attract each other, and like poles repel each other. The reason natural and artificial magnets have a mysterious force surrounding them is due to their atomic properties. In every atom, electrons orbit around the nucleus. As the electrons orbit, they produce an electrostatic charge which in turn produces a magnetic field. The direction of the magnetic field is inherent on the direction of the electronsâ€™ orbit. In a magnetic material, the electrons orbit in the same direction. However, in non-magnetic materials, the electrons do not orbit in the same direction, thus cancelling their magnetic properties. Non-magnetic materials that react to magnetic fields are called ferromagnetic materials. <del>In a ferromagnetic material, atoms are arranged into groups called domains. Each of these domains is magnetic, however the domains are not aligned with one another, and therefore they cancel the magnetic properties of the material. Yet, when a magnet is brought near a ferromagnetic material, the poles of the domains align with the poles of the magnet. Now the ferromagnetic material is magnetized.</del> The size and strength of a magnetic field is indicated by the lines of flux. Lines of flux are invisible lines that surround a magnet; they exit out of the north pole and enter back in through the south pole. The length of the flux lines indicate how far the magnetic field stretches and the density of the flux lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field. Unlike natural and artificial magnets, electromagnets get their magnetic properties from electric current. Similar to how the movement of electrons around an atom produces an electrostatic charge, the movement of electrons through a conductor produces a charge as well. Keep in mind the fact that electricity is the flow of electrons. The direction of the lines of flux and the polarity of an electromagnet can be determined using the left hand rule. According to the left hand rule, when a wire is grabbed with the left hand and the thumb is pointing in the direction of the current, the fingers will point in the direction of the lines of flux. If the fingers of the left hand are pointing in the direction of current flow, the thumb will be pointing to the north pole of the electromagnet.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with &quot;explaining&quot; magnets is this: Usually, by &quot;explaining&quot;, we mean &quot;reduce to a simpler concept. But the electromagnetic force is one of the four fundamental forces of the universe. There is nothing simpler to reduce it to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea. They say if you really understand something you can explain it to an idiot. OP did a good job of explaining but I'm dumber than an idiot and got lost after the word &quot;this&quot;.</p>
<p>Basically, Semi-conductors are magical devices made with Asgardian science. You can imbue transistors with Asgardian magic in the form of wand. And if you know how to use Asgardian magic, it'll flow through the wand and do math really quickly. Got it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to what /u/Brumisator said:</p>
<p>While processors do a lot of things, all of them contain something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit" target="_blank">Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</a> which handles the calculations on the lowest level.  This is where the 1's and 0's of a program are translated into operations.</p>
<p>The ALU at it's most basic is a bunch of operations fed into a digital switchboard known as a multiplexer.  The operations include things like Add, subtract, multiply, and divide for arithmetic.  And AND, OR, and XOR for logic.  To name a few.  The multiplexer takes in all the operational inputs and selects one for output based on the 1's and 0's of a program's instruction.  The part of a program's instruction that goes directly to the ALU is called the <strong>opcode</strong> (short for operation code).  The inputs for the operations are loaded from memory (loading, writing, and decoding memory is kind of handled by the processor, but elsewhere from the ALU) and are at least 2 inputs.</p>
<p>For example, let's say an ALU was composed of 4 operations: Add, Subtract, AND, OR.  This would be a pretty crappy ALU, because it can't perform all types of basic logic (ie. is not functionally complete).  But it's just an example.  Because we have 4 operations to pick form, the opcode for the ALU is 2 bits long (4 possible combinations: 00, 01, 10, 11).  The relationship of opcode to operation is arbitrary.  Compilers for programming languages worry about that sort of thing, today.  So let's say for this ALU: </p>
<ul>
<li>00 = Add</li>
<li>01 = Subtract</li>
<li>10 = AND</li>
<li>11 = OR</li>
</ul>
<p>It has 4 inputs, 1 output, and 2 selection (ie. opcode) bits.  So, let's make it do something with it.  We'll load a value for stored at memory address <em>00000101</em> and ADD the value 2 to it, and then store that at memory address <em>01000111</em>.  In binary, this instruction could be structured like: [Add Opcode (2-bits), Input Memory address (8-bits), Output Memory Address (8-bits), Value to add (8-bits)].  That comes to [00,00000101,01000111,00000010], or more compactly 00000001010100011100000010 (this can get a little crazy in size, which is why short-hand notation like octals and hexidecimal were created for readability).</p>
<p>After decoding the instruction, the processor requests from a memory device whatever value is stored at <em>00000101</em>.  We'll call this value <strong>X</strong> for short.  The processor then passes <strong>X</strong>, the value of 2 (<em>00000010</em>), and the opcode (<em>00</em>) as inputs to the ALU.  Within the ALU, <strong>X</strong> and 2 run through all 4 operations in parallel.  The results of these 4 operations go into the multiplexer.  Since the multiplexer is given an opcode of <em>00</em>, it selects just the result of the operation where <strong>X</strong> and 2 are added together.  So the result of adding X+2 is outputted by the ALU.  Then the processor handles storing that value to memory address <em>01000111</em>.</p>
<p>This is a very basic example of how a processor works.  It obviously gets a lot more complicated.  And I glossed over a lot of things for the sake of readability and focusing on the ALU.</p></div>		</li>
