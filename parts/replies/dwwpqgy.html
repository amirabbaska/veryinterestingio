			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a lot of people are responding to me by reminding me that salt water dries people out, but they are overreacting.  Just being in the salt water is drying you out, and it isn't like you're going to suddenly go from well hydrated to dehydrated just from a half mouthful of brine.</p></div>		</li>
