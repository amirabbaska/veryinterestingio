<p>It gives a scale of the universe, starting at us (i.e. stuff in the range of 1 to 10 meters), and from there you can scale up or down and see what's found in that range.</p>
<p>The smallest particle that we know of (according to that little animation) is the neutrino, at 10^-24 meters. A Planck Volume (the grid-like block spoken of above) is <em>ten orders of magnitude below that</em> at 10^-34 meters. <del>So that's basically the resolution of our universe.</del> ^Editing ^out ^because ^my ^quantum ^physics ^is ^too ^rusty ^to ^make ^blanket ^statements ^like ^that...</p></div>		</li>

<p>That can't be right. 3D volumes are affected by length contraction, which means that what seems like a Planck Volume to me might look like a cubic light year to a different observer. Obviously if the universe would have a resolution of a cubic light year we would've noticed it by now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It kind of means if you try to trap a particle in a very small volume, it's velocity and direction will become huge</p>

<p>is <em>uncertainty</em> in velocity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This in effect means that if you measure one of the two very well, the other needs becomes more uncertain (as in actually will take values of a larger range). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is explained mathematically because the two are related by a Fourier transform. The more localized is one function, the more delocalized is its Fourier transform. Viceversa, the more delocalized a function is (e.g. like in the case of a perfect sinusoid that goes to infinity in both directions) the more localized is the fourier transform (a delta function)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, talking about Fourier transforms definitely was overkill for an ELI5, haha. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, in a way one can argue that Planck's constant really is a fundamental unit of our Universe; our Universe is not continuous, but rather grid like on extremely small scales (heck, Planck's constant has a value of 6.63 * 10-34 Js, which is so ridiculously I don't even know how to give a proper example). And the size of these blocks is directly proportional to Planck's constant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good way of communicating the scale of the Plank length, if nothing else, is that the size of a full stop . is about half-way between the size of the Plank length and the size of the observable universe in logarithmic units, so the number of full stops you can fit from one side of the observable universe to the other is about the same as the number of Plank lengths you can fit from one side of a full stop to the other.</p></div>		</li>
