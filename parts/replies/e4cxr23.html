			<div class="markdown"><p>The tradeoff at that point is orbital period. For every few minutes that this satellite would spend close to the sun, it might spend years hanging out far away from it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but cant we just fire stuff at the sun and have it just miss? Like granted your never gonna see the probe again but you did get some good sciencey readings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you essentially short-stroke the orbital period by placing 3 stationary mechanisms in an equilateral triangle to intercept and redirect the probe continually? Mechanisms such as magnets that could decelerate and again accelerate the probe?  Or is that crazy talk...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't work. To be in an orbit it has to be below the escape velocity at the given distance. If it would fly just above the surface it could get a speed of up to 600 km/s. That still means 15 minutes to travel one time the radius of Sun, it will spend at least an hour very close to the Sun. And that is the minimum time, with maximal heating per time. Without heat shield a probe would just boil away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The maximum speed it could reach at perihelion would be the Sun's escape velocity - 618km/s. Since the Sun is 1,390,000km wide, it'd take no less than 37.5 minutes to cross its disc - and that's ignoring that it won't actually be travelling at that maximum speed the whole time. That's definitely long enough to heat up!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’ve seen that play out with a MacBook Pro left in a car all day in the sun. The case itself was totally fine but the laptop was completely bricked and never turned back on because the actual internals were shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you can touch red hot iron with a proper glove, right? There will be some heat flow through the heat shield, which has to be channeled into space. But when you have low thermal conductivity in your heat shield, even if the front side is at 5800 K, the back side can still be at 300 K for many hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A heat shield wouldn't be made of aluminium like your laptop + convection is not a thing in vacuum.</p>
<p>You'd want a heat shield thermally isolated from key components and a way to radiate this heat out.</p></div>		</li>
