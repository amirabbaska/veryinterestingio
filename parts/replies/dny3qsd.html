<p>What's the mechanism behind this? Is it just displacing oxygen, leading to a lower blood oxygen level which triggers EPO production? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, basically simulates low-level  hypoxia which stimulates you to produce blood in order to do a better job of taking in oxygen. Mechanistically it is proposed that HIF1a, a hypoxia induced factor stimulates EPO expression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely you could do the same thing by increasing the nitrogen level in the air you're breathing. And I'd think that nitrogen would be both cheaper and harder to detect (since air is like 70% nitrogen anyway).</p>
<p>Or does the body respond to an increase in environmental nitrogen in a way that it doesn't respond to environmental argon and xenon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely sure, but xenon or argon would be heavier, which would let it sit in your lungs longer and continue to displace oxygen in your lungs.</p>
<p>For helium or hydrogen you'd need some sort of rebreather that would constantly be feeding in the non-oxygen gas.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Xenon is supposed to trigger the production of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and subsequently erythropoietin, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Triggering the production of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a&quot; reads like it could be a very fancy way to say &quot;makes people short of breath&quot;. What is it actually doing; how is it triggering that?  To me, at least, there's a qualitative difference between reducing blood oxygen by reducing the amount of oxygen in the air you breathe, and artificially reching into and messing with the process (in the kidneys, IIRC) which measures blood oxygen and if necessary tells the body that you're short of breath and should make more red blood cells.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomly assigned either to a group spontaneously breathing xenon 30 % (Xe/O2 30 %/60 %) or a group breathing control gas (N2/O2 40 %/60 %) for 45 min. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know that gasses with very different molecular weights do weird things with partial pressures of oxygen. I am not sure whether 30/60 Xe/O2 is equivalent to, more oxygenated, or less oxygenated than normal air. But that control gas is basically atmospheric, and wow, does it have a lot of oxygen. </p>
<p>I am thoroughly confident that an 85/15 N2/O2 control gas would also &quot;trigger the production of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and subsequently erythropoietin&quot;. Because you'd be short of breath. That's what an altitude tent does, and they work.  </p>
<p>It's like saying that &quot;salt makes people sleepy, at 10pm we had some volunteers drink a water/salt mixture, and gave the control group triple-shot espressos. After a couple hours, the control group was significantly less sleepy than the test group.&quot;  Well obviously the control group won't be sleepy or short of breath, they're on a few hundred milligrams of caffine or 60% O2!</p>
<p>What I really want to know is what would happen if you let someone breathe regular atmospheric air, dissolved some xenon in saline or something, and trickled that solution it into their kidneys or bone marrow (or wherever the process that produces HIF 1a is). </p></div>		</li>

<p>They're both <em>much</em> more oxygenated. That's why it's odd that it increases HIF-1<em>a</em></p>
<p>Of note here is the fact that there is no process in healthy humans that makes you feel anything when your blood/tissue is hypoxic. &quot;air hunger&quot; or shortness of breath, is actually triggered by a buildup of CO2 since you accumulate a toxic amount of CO2 long before you deplete available oxygen. </p>
<p>Oddly in individuals with chronically poor gas exchange and high carbon levels this mechanism will reverse.</p></div>		</li>
