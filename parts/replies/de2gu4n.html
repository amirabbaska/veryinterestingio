			<div class="markdown"><p>My father is an interventional cardiologist. He's the guy that threads a tiny wire from your thigh up your arteries and into the blood vessels surrounding your beating heart while wearing clothes made of lead, because it's all done while looking at an Xray. Basically: his fine motor control and hand-eye coordination is world-class and always has been.</p>
<p>... but his handwriting is abysmal. It's atrocious.</p>
<p>My mother's hand-eye coordination and fine motor control is average, probably less than average due to her age now, and she was put into school very early (she was born after an acceptance deadline, but some shenanigans with the Catholic schools having a different admissions program got her in at a younger age than everyone else in the grade)</p>
<p>Yet her cursive is gorgeous (though her printed writing is meh.)</p>
<p>And I can say for sure that this is nearly entirely due to social pressure.</p>
<p>My father was the youngest child of WWII refugees who were so poor that they would play roulette every month to see if they could afford shoes. Writing, especially writing english, was not important to him as a child, he hated it in fact.</p>
<p>My mother was the oldest child of an english teacher and a translator. They weren't particularly well off, but you bet your ass they valued neat writing.</p>
<p>I think boys in general are pressured by their parents to gain skills that are logic and sports-related. Girls are conditioned to gain skills of an organizational and repetitive kind. The result is that girls embrace the difficult work of practicing neat writing (studies show young girls enjoy tasks labelled as difficult more than boys do), while boys would much rather be running about practicing the skills their parents value in them and being told to sit down and draw a neat looking alphabet 100 times is just boring and stressful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a stereotype for doctors as well. So much so that <a href="http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1578074,00.html" target="_blank">people die because apothecaries and nurses misread the prescriptions</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree with this, I'm a girl and my handwriting changed drastically after I finished school. I started writing how I felt like I should write (small and in all caps like my dad) instead of how I wanted people to view my handwriting (loopy and bubbly and girly). It's not that I was that concerned, I just thought that's how a girl was supposed to write but I was definitely trying a lot harder to write like that because I was told I had boys handwriting... Jesus that's stupid,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to say I'm always glad to find there are more people besides me who prefer to write all in caps. I picked up reading and writing a bit early but because of this when I wrote I would only write in all caps because capital letters were more recognizable and I was still having trouble differentiating some lower case letters from each other (such as b and d, g and q) and I continued to write that way even at school and eventually teachers became concerned and I was basically told if I didn't start writing using lower case letters I'd have to repeat whatever grade I was in at the time (1st, I think.)</p>
<p>So I started writing the way they wanted me to for assignments but continued, and still continue to write in all caps if I'm writing something that essentially only I will see. At this point I continue to do that not just because I'm more comfortable writing that way, I honestly think it looks better and somehow more professional. Nevertheless I still get self conscious about it, I wonder if someone else reading it would think that </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here! My dad wrote in all caps and I always admired his handwriting so I learned at a very young age to write that way. I just thought everything looked nice and neat but when it came to standardized testing, I was told if I wrote in all caps it would be an automatic fail so I took a LOT longer to write everything out because it just wasn't natural to me. I'm now a manager of a juice store and my employees appreciate how legible my handwriting is on all the sticky notes I write them lol </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember boys being made fun of if their hand writing was too &quot;pretty.&quot; They'd tell them, &quot;you write like a girl,&quot; in the same way they'd yell, &quot;you throw like a girl.&quot; Keeping your handwriting a little messy and ugly is a quick fix to avoid seeming femininely elegant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the reason right here. As a kid I was proud of having neat handing writing until about middle school when the other boys started making fun of my hand writing for being girly. My hand writing wasn't girly - it was just legible. And I remember the girls all thought it was cool to write with &quot;bubble&quot; letters for everything. So there was a lot of social pressure on the girls to fit in and write like this. </p>
<p>But to play devils advocate, I also remember that most of the girls in school were far more organized than the most organized boy. Maybe it translates to handwriting. </p></div>		</li>
