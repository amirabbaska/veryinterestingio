			<div class="markdown"><p>So, say you're standing next to the atomic blast. There's first going to be a huge amount of gamma radiation, which if I understand what I've read correctly, will damage you, but not vaporize you. Them comes the flash, but if you're really close, the flash doesn't really happen because it's caused by radiation from the atmosphere heating and absorbing radiation. Then comes the blast wave, which is just an immense amount of pressure built up by the expanding gases in the blast. The blast at this range is a plasma which is really fucking hot, but it's also not exactly dense unless you're riding the bomb like Slim Pickins. So does it really vaporize you instantly as it washes over you? or does it take a moment. What would you feel?</p>
<p>I read some back of the envelope calculations about the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and it seems like, based on the altitude of the airburst and their yield, it's unlikely even a person directly under the blast would have been wholesale vaporised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's saying that the heat might not sustain long enough to achieve the vaporization.  </p>
<p>There were a number of schoolgirls that were inside a building that was directly underneath the air burst at Hiroshima (Not Nagasaki I think) and they survived with mild injuries so if it takes only a few hundred feet and some relatively small layers between you and the blast to survive, in order to be vaporized you would probably have to be within something like 50-100 feet at the furthest and without any kind of protection.  </p>
<p>The actual destructive power of a nuclear blast is often overestimated because Hiroshima and Nagasaki were primarily wooden cities.  In a modern city, most building would remain largely intact other than the ones right at ground zero (which, again, is usually a few hundred feet below the detonation so the maximum <em>area</em> of damage is larger but the <em>magnitude</em> of the destruction at ground zero isn't total) and people similarly, but to a significantly smaller extent, are able to withstand the worst effects of the blast at a surprisingly small distance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gamma radiation normally won't heat you up that much, however standing near to ground zero will heat you up (thermalized). The blast will then push the already warm body (possibly already dead depending upon distance) and heat it at the same time this push and heat means that finding anything significant of the human body will be difficult for a ground burst, however an air burst will have a tendency to push the body into the ground so may have less of a scattering effect. In addition parts of the body protected by a wall, pillar or other similar object may be more intact than parts fully exposed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the actual fireball of heat that vaporizes a person close enough to a nuclear detonation. The immediate impact of alpha, beta and gamma radiation is miniscule compared to the heat produced in the detonation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If directly above, yes. If say a few hundred meters from ground zero, you would leave a long shadow. Similar to a late afternoon sun-cast shadow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nothing. If you are that close you are likely dead before you can even slightly begin to know what happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah probably not the worst way to go. Unless you're far away from the blast
Then it could be one of the worst ways to go. All the radiation sickness</p></div>		</li>
