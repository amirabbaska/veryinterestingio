			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this.  I have the same app.  You set up &quot;windows&quot;, eg 15-30 min before your &quot;must be awake time&quot;, and when it senses you are now only lightly asleep it play the alarm.  Makes a huge difference even though frequently I am woken up 10 min BEFORE my alarm is supposed to go off.</p></div>		</li>
