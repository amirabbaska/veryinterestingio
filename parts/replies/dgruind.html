<p>Black body radiation is calculated by using the absolute temperatures to the 4th power, <strong>not</strong> the differential. </p>
<p>OP, the problem with your calculation is that you need the view factors to calculate the percentage of area that the radiating energy is hitting the other body, making the energy balance F<em><em>1-2</em></em> A<em><em>1</em></em> T<em><em>1</em></em>^(4) = F<em><em>2-1</em></em> A<em><em>2</em></em> T<em><em>2</em></em>^(4).</p>
<p>If you apply reciprocity to the two bodies (defined as F<em><em>1-2</em></em> A<em><em>1</em></em> = F<em><em>2-1</em></em> A<em><em>2</em></em> for any two surfaces), then you will find that the temperatures will be equal in the absence of other energy sources, resulting in zero net energy transfer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true, but when you consider that any black body is also <em>absorbing</em> radiation from its surroundings, it's useful to express the net energy gain/loss in terms of the difference between its temperature to the fourth power and the surrounding temperature to the fourth power.  In the case that OP describes, the two bodies can be considered to be surrounding each other.  Therefore, the energy <em>exchange</em> is proportional to the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a non linear process, if would be proportional to the difference in  T<em><em>1</em></em>^(4) and T<em><em>2</em></em>^(4), <strong>NOT</strong> (T<em><em>1</em></em> - T<em><em>2</em></em>)^(4). This isn't linear conduction or convection. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I hate this. The point of a <em>Gedankenexperiment</em> is to tease out the mechanics of a theory, not to attack the practical assumptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Stephen Boltzman law states that the energy emitted/absorbed by a body is proportional to its surface area times the difference in temperature to the fourth power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't correct, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law" target="_blank">Stephan-Boltzmann law</a> states that radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the thermodynamic temperature, not that it is proportional to some kind of difference.</p>
<p>Indeed it seems in this scenario one body will be heated beyond the temperature of the other. From the second law however we know that our model must be incomplete, so what did we ignore?</p>
<p>The situation actually consists of <em>three</em> bodies, namely the Sun, the Earth and the photon field, which has its own entropy. By just setting the emissions equal we ignore that there is a photon field present that takes up quite some heat. Note that this is the difference to the more common scenario of the sun heating up the earth and earth in turn radiating away until it is in some kind of equilibrium. There the universe acts as a heat bath, but here we intentionally isolate our system.</p>
<p>So the more complete equation would be P_from_field_to_earth - P_to_field_from_earth = P_from_field_to_sun - P_to_field_from_sun. Unfortunately, I do not know the relevant equations, but introducing the photon field will resolve the dilemma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense intuitively:
Once the body B is hotter, the heat would be transferring back to the body A. According to second law. Thus after a while the system reaches equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>
