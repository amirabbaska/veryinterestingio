			<div class="markdown"><p>Could we take brain scans of animals and then breed together the ones with the  most similarities to the parts of the brain that give humans speech?</p>
<p>we seem to be able to manipulate the shape and anatomy of dogs to an incredible degree, it seems shocking to me that humans haven't chased introducing a second intelligent life form to earth by breeding for intelligence. It would be the closest thing to meeting an alien lifeform!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Selective breeding is good at quickly refining a pool of existing traits down to what the breeder wants, but it's limited by the same thing as evolution: rate of mutation. If a breeder wants to make a smart dog, they are limited by the theorical &quot;smartest possible dog&quot; the genes in the current population can create. Once you've bred that dog, you have to wait many generations for dog brains to mutate, which will create a new population with a new &quot;smartest possible dog.&quot;</p>
<p>Humans, in our evolution, had extreme natural selection pressure for intelligence, but it still took millions of years for language, fire, farming, and all that other good stuff, because selection, whether natural or directed by us, can only <em>select</em> from the variety of traits mutation provides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hrmm, I see. Perhaps a way to work around that is simply to breed for a massively increased mutation rate? If we were super serious about achieving this I imagine we could make a breeding pool of 100 million dogs to collect from the traits that are desired, mutation rate and brain power.</p>
<p>I'm fairly sure dogs have a much higher mutation rate already than certain species like crocodiles that haven't changed in millennia. So breeding for increased mutability parts per thousand seems possible. That combined with a huge breeding pool and it might be possible to break that mutation cap and increase brainpower beyond the smartest dog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the advance of humans, how much was of it was becomming biologically smarter, and how much was just the society discovering new things?</p>
<p>Like could you expect a human from 1 million years ago to learn calculus if raised in a modern society?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you talk a little bit about the natural selection pressure for intelligence? What separated us from other apes, for example? I have always been taught that bipedalism and fire really catalysed the change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's science fiction (as opposed to science fact), but if you're interested in this idea then you should check out David Brin's Uplift series of books.  The first one, Sundiver, is a tad mediocre, but the two follow-ups (Startide Rising and The Uplift War) are excellent.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intelligent dogs don't make good pets. Collie's are considered the most intelligent breed, and they need constant activity, and games or training. We have bred for docility and obedience, and only much less for inteligence which often links to behavioural issues, such as with wolf-dog hybrids which at least up to F4 generation can just decide they don't like their owners. </p>
<p>Intelligence doesn't just manifest for an individual human, the environment they grow up in is crucial. And that would have to be totally rethought for dogs, especially their opportunities to socialise, things for them to do, and avoiding leaving them bored on their own. </p>
<p>The dog gene pool is large. Their is more variatiin just with some single breeds of dog, than in the whole human gene pool. It is very possible the mutations or gene associatiins needed to boost dog intelligence are there, but a selection environment would have to be created that could distinguish it. That is, not just success on one or a small subset of intelligence measures to get treats. But happiness and wellbeing from developing intelligence, and open-ended opportunities to exercise and develop it. </p>
<p>The deeper question is, what is intelligence. It seems intuative, but is very problematic to define, and even more so to measure. Probably research this, would be the motivation for work like this with dogs and other species. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things: 1) I think a few birds have passed the Aesop’s fable test of cause and effect. 2) regarding the density, do you know if it’s mostly due to the heightened visual sensory input? I.e. is the neuronal density associated mostly with visual processes opposed to some region akin to a prefrontal cortex?</p></div>		</li>
