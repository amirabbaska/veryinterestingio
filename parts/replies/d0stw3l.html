			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the wrong way to think about it. Neutrinos are only affected by the weak force (and gravity). The weak force has a very short range and this goes a long way in explaining why the neutrino interacts with normal matter so little. Neutrinos don't interact via the electromagnetic force that we're more familiar with. Because of this they have a ridiculously small area that has a possibility to interact with an atom. On the other hand if you were made up of W and Z particles, then you'll light up like a Christmas tree with all the neutrinos going through you. </p>
<p>We're used to interacting with &quot;stuff&quot; because we're full of particles that interact via the electromagnetic force. Electrons repelling each other; making bonds with each other - that is the universe we see because we're, literally, made to see/interact with that force.</p></div>		</li>
