However, different credentials on the laptop are actually a local admin.  Every time I run something that needs elevated privileges, instead of a &quot;you sure you want to do this?  YES/NO&quot;, I get, as Kakistos153 mentioned, a more complicated verification popup on the &quot;secure desktop&quot;.  Instead of a yes/no question, I have to actually put in a user/password of the OTHER account on the laptop that has the permissions to do what I want.</p></div>		</li>
