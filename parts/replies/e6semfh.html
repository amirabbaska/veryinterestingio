			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the weight has nothing to do with anchoring. In many ships the first segment of the chain is heavier so that it lays flat on the bottom and let's the anchor dig into the mud or sand, the rest could be rope.</p>
<p>I don't think having a heavy chain all the way to the boat (when not needed for it's tensile strength of course) would help much, as you are keeping it suspended from your boat (thus doing nothing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look, you keep saying this in multiple areas. A little knowledge can be dangerous. Whilst you are correct that for small boats anchors hold them in place via lateral forces, in any decent sized ship it is the cable that holds the ship in place. The anchor is only there to hold the end of the cable in place.  </p>
<p>When seeking an anchorage in a large vessel there are a number of calculations that must be performed depending on, the depth of water, wind/sea state, swing radius and the amount of time that you will be waiting. The output is always a length of cable, not number of anchors or weight of anchors.  </p>
<p>Given that your comments now respond to the top two answers I'd be grateful if you could amend your answers so as not to confuse people.  </p>
<p>TL:DR: in large ships the cable holds the ship in place.</p></div>		</li>
