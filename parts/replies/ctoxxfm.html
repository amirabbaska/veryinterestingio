			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. They would also see you moving slowly. It's weird and kinda paradoxical, but you can't really compare &quot;real time&quot; until you're in the same frame, at which point someone (or both) needed to accelerate and that acceleration provides the resolution to the paradox.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, both sides would view the other as moving slower? How is this possible?</p>
<p>If you put an identical atomic clock in both time frames, and you could &quot;see&quot; the other clock without leaving your own time frame, how would they compare? Isn't it necessary for them to either maintain the same time or have one clock move faster than the other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If by things, you mean wall clocks and the like, then sure, but there are bigger and more distant things out there that you can reference.</p>
<p>Think about it like this: Even at the speed of light it would take hours to cross our solar system, but from any point in that path, the stars off in the distance look essentially that same.</p>
<p>Instead of a wall clock outside your ship, try using a distant Pulsar to keep time. Or even just the orbits of our neighboring planets.</p>
<p>With that said, there are other optical effects that make observation difficult. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQnHTKZBTI4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQnHTKZBTI4</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes it is. It is possible to travel to the future (from the Earth point of view) by going very fast, in very basic words. Astronauts have been doing it on the ISS (although they've only traveled a few seconds into the future). By the way, the ISS travels at 7.66 km per second, that's 0.0026% of the speed of light and it's enough to make a difference. GPS technology needs to take into account time dilation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is to meet one of them has to be accelerated. This changes things because now the one being accelerated is no longer in an initial frame. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox#Resolution_of_the_paradox_in_special_relativity" target="_blank">Here</a> is the wikipedia article on it. I am short on time at the moment so I can not give a more indepth explanation. If you need one just replay again and I give one when my time frees up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what you mean by point of view. If they are moving towards Earth, time would seem to go very fast on Earth until they're actually there and they can see and realize that they've effectively traveled to the future from an Earth point of view (why did you assume they were going away from Earth?).</p></div>		</li>

Only the speed does. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#Time_dilation_due_to_relative_velocity" target="_blank">Here</a> is the equation for time dilation in special relativity. It is not a vector equation, everything there is a scalar. The direction does not matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>General Relativity applies to accelerating frames (Special Relativity applies only to the &quot;special&quot; case of moving constant velocity). Observers in relative acceleration disagree on even more than the timing and spacing of events - they disagree about things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging" target="_blank">gravitational fields</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unruh_effect" target="_blank">temperature</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm sorry, but no. The &quot;Special&quot; in Special Relativity refers to spacetime being flat rather than curved. Special relativity can handle acceleration <em>just fine</em>. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The laws of physics tend to pick up extra terms and complications in accelerated frames. You already get this in Newtonian mechanics, where F = ma will pick up a bunch of extra terms in an accelerated frame (rotational acceleration, coriolis force, centrifugal force, probably something else I'm forgetting). In special relativity, a frame of reference from the &quot;rest frame&quot; of an accelerated observer has things like a variable speed of light (only if the light is far from the observer, who needs to always measure nearby light at c) and an event horizon (the accelerated observer can outrun a light ray!).</p>
<p>This asymmetry is &quot;fixed&quot; in general relativity, where all equations are written in a way which applies equally to accelerated observers. But if you're in a situation without gravity, you can basically just use SR, though using a geometric formulation is easier for accelerations.</p></div>		</li>
