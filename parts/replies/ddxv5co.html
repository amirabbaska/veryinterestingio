<p>Like Chem trails</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love chem trails. It's one of my favourite conspiracy theories. The first time someone told me about it, I thought they were joking. Turns out they were serious. </p>
<p>I did some research on it, and I found a site that had absolute <em>proof</em> that chemtrails were real. Their proof? They called the Department of Transportation and asked them what is in chemtrails. The DoT said they had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. <strong>That proves it!</strong></p></div>		</li>
