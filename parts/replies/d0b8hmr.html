<p>But I, too, would like to know. Preferably from someone with evidence and not just a poor coffee person screaming in horror;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>though everyone is right, you mentioning it being cold press brings up a memory of an old cafe of mine. we were making whole bean cold press, which took 4 days to steep and was a 1lbs to 1 gal. ratio. after one steep, i decided to see what would happen if i did what you described-- took the used beans and made coffee with them. the only difference is that i re-roasted the beans because they were very wet. most people can roast beans fairly effectively at home on a stove, so you shouldn't have any issue there.</p>
<p>what i found was, after re-roasting used cold press beans and making a pourover from them, it was actually a pretty tasty cup of coffee for a decaf. it's worth an experiment, i would say. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>step 1. take some beans</p>
<p>step 2. put them in water</p>
<p>step 3. wait</p>
<p>its not really comercially viable so ive never found a shop that did it (besides the one i worked at, and they no longer do). but you should definitely make it at home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been brewing coffee like this for a few weeks. Here's my set up:</p>
<p>Huge Ball jar from Michaels art store
Glass carafe with cork lid from Ikea
Camping folding silicon coffee filter holder from Amazon</p>
<p>Put grounds and room temp coffee in Mason jar.
Let sit 12 hours.
Put the filter holder on top of the carafe with a regular paper filter.
Pour mud into it, and repeat 3-4 times jiggling when needed.</p>
<p>I end up with a full carafe of nice smooth caffeinated coffee. Way less effort than it seems, and it's really worth it to an iced coffee drinker like me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Swiss water decaf process is similar to what you're doing, except they also use a little trick (and also use green beans for maximum extraction, but that's a separate issue).</p>
<p>They &quot;steep&quot; the green beans, then run the liquid through a charcoal filter. All the flavour-related chemicals pass through, but the caffeine is caught by the charcoal filter. The beans are now caffeine free, but also essentially flavourless. They throw that shit away. (This is what you're producing, but less drastically since you're using roasted beans.)</p>
<p>They then do it again with another batch... but using the same water. The caffeine was filtered out, but the flavour-related chemicals remain. Since the water is saturated with those chemicals, far less of those compounds are drawn out this time. But the caffeine is still extracted. This time, you get caffeine-free beans that <em>didn't</em> lose all their flavour.</p></div>		</li>
