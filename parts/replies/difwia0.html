			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who falls asleep to Netflix quite regularly, I can say that I did not grow up in a household that had TVs on regularly, and did not have a TV in my room growing up.</p>
<p>As some others have said I use it to distract me from my thoughts. Growing up I had really bad insomnia, and my mind was constantly going down rabbit holes when I should have been sleeping. I had some really interesting thoughts, but living on diminished sleep all the time just sucks. </p>
<p>The key for me is to have a TV show engaging enough that I can tune in and distract myself, but not engaging enough that it will keep me up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly the same. Racing thoughts are my problem, my brain refuses to shut off. And when there is nothing to engage my problem solving obsession, i start to solve the problems in my life and that shit does not work. At all.. it goes round and rounds and get stuck to same awful moments and some really dark shit... Tinnitus does not help but i've found that it is not the problem, only when i notice it. White noise helps with tinnitus and i do fall asleep like a child when in a nightliner (ex-roadie, falling asleep in your bunk with the bus motion and the sound of diesel engine using narrow rev band.. yup, sleepy time in minutes, also it is after very hard work... but i still needed sleeping pills i can over the edge and then it is bad, hyperactive, i have always had insomnia and sleeping difficulties, ever since i was a toddler)</p>
<p>I use mix of old and new, FOX animation block (simpsons, american dad etc) is my all time favorites; there are so MUCH of them that even if i have repeated them for 8 years soon, i still encounter episodes i don't remember (rare, but happens), plus the new episodes mixed in. I have about week long playlist that i randomize every now and then.. Craig Ferguson has been one that has lately been guaranteed, it makes me chuckle and i fall asleep feeling really happy. Then there are few sitcoms, something that has multiple seasons. If the timing is right, i can watch one new episode and when it switches to old episodes, i kind of just drift in the sleep. What could be 4 hour tossing and turning can be 22 minutes and i am out like a stone at the end credits of first episode. Or not, it still can take hours but at least it ain't so freaking boring then. Forgetting that you are suppose to fall asleep is my biggest hurdle and i use weed for that. Combo works almost as good as chemical lobotomy (i had VERY strong pills)</p>
<p>One thing that has made a huge difference and really, is 100% mandatory, not an option: audio dynamic range control. Mainly, a limiter. it means that our audio adjusts itself so that it never exceeds certain limit and when it doesn't it gets louder until we reach that limit (it isn't max volume, it has limits how much it adjusts volume). It is like having a butler who turns your TV up and down so it never bothers you, only that it does that in a fraction of a second, so fast that not even sudden explosions go thru..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You sound the same as me except having really bad insomnia. Used to sleep in quiet and darkness but ive somehow converted to using a TV or even music (though music tends to keep me awake cause i like listening to it too much). I like it though, sounds or lights dont bother me at all when trying to sleep! But I have an overactive mind definitely, cant stop thinking about things to fall asleep and thats where it helps a lot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I have bipolar 1 disorder and have always had problems sleeping. Your rabbit hole comment resonated with me. It's true. It's why I listen to rainymood.com every night. It calms me and typically stops the rabbit holes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientifically I can't prove this, but as someone who turns the tv on the feel safe when I sleep, this makes sense. I feel very vulnerable in complete silence and freak out at every little noise I hear. With a tv, I feel safer because it helps keep me occupied and masks noises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fell asleep with the TV on until I was like 14. Now I fall asleep to a playlist of podcasts or compilations of radio shows like Howard Stern. I never analyzed it until now but I think I'm one of those guys too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was little and slept in the same room as my parents, they never had the TV on at night, so for me, it's not that. Now, I sleep with the TV on/music playing every night, because if there isn't some background noise to distract me, my thoughts would keep me awake.</p></div>		</li>
