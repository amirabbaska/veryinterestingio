			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a super exact number, but since you know the frequency, f, of the light being sent out, each photon had an energy of h*f. You can get the total energy of your laser pulse and back calculate the number of photons going out.
Then your photovoltaic cell that is the receiver can essentially count each photon it receives from the current (freed electrons) that are generated. That can be converted into a number of photons.
But I bet you can just divide energy received by sent, gets you that fraction, since we aren't expecting a frequency shift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should add, it's been a while, but I believe the outgoing beam/pulse passes through a mirror that reflects 99% and 1% passes through and hits a detector to measure how many photons are in the 1%. Just like the received photons, then just scale 1% to 100% and you got the total energy of the outgoing beam, which then you can calculate number of photons using h*f.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny enough, one of the problems with scaling up the experiment is the possibility of receiving multiple photons in return. The fundamental technology is based on single photon avalanche diodes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was curious how this compared to the distance the moon actually traveled in that time (to the moon, not round-trip), so I did a little digging.  Based on the orbital details listed in Wikipedia, and assuming my math is correct:</p>
<p>Mean distance to the moon:  385,000km or 1.28422177 light seconds</p>
<p>Mean orbital velocity of the moon:  1.022 km/s</p>
<p>Distance traveled by the moon in the time it takes the laser to get there:  1.28422177 * 1.022 = 1.31 km</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really don't have the background to answer that, but my guess is that it only matters on the return trip.  You have to lead the moon when you shoot at it (to compensate for the movement of the moon), and the moon has to lead you when shooting (reflecting) back (to compensate for the movement of the receiver due to rotation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting point.  If the reflector sends the beam back on the exact path it arrived on, in theory it would hit earth at the location the beam was sent from before rotating for â‰ˆ3 seconds.  But if I had to guess, that's a small enough distance that it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Edit:  I was waaay wrong, the surface of the earth is rotating at 460m/s.  Which means that potentially the beam will be arriving almost 1000km east from you!</p></div>		</li>
