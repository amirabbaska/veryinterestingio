			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is a measure of a material's internal energy (for each degree od freedom), so higher temperature means the gas molecules/atoms are more likely to already be ionized. Even if they're not, there's more energy in other degrees of freedom that can be redirected to ionization under external electric field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Primarily it's an issue of having enough  energy in the system to overcome the thermodynamic/kinetic barriers. Hotter materials contain more heat and thereby more energy is already in the system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My house was built in 2001 and it's full of those old, U-shaped CFL light fixtures.  Newer CFLs light up instantly when warm, but the old ones flicker and click for 2-3 seconds no matter what.  So annoying.  And I can't bring myself to replace them until I use up all the bulbs, which I apparently bought a lifetime supply of at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just toss all the CFLs in a bag and drop them off at Home Depot to recycle while picking up LEDs you won't have to change again for at least a decade. Get one receipt per box of LEDs so its easier when you have to send proof of purchase in for any that die prematurely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just don't skimp on the quality and buy some with a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_rendering_index" target="_blank">good CRI</a> if you don't want to look like a ghost. Good quality LEDs with a CRI &gt;90 have become very affordable over the past few years.</p></div>		</li>
