<p>Also interesting, many of the ingredients of plastics and rubbers are highly toxic and extremely flammable. Most synthetic materials are made from ingredients you wouldn’t want to handle outside of a controlled manufacturing setting. Not too much to be afraid of after it’s been manufactured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify.  A tire is made of different components.  You have a tread layer, side wall and the inner liner.   The inner liner is what's responsible for keeping the air in.  A good tire will have an inner liner made from a halogenated butyl rubber, for example, bromobutyl rubber.  </p>
<p>Now, keeping in mind that rubber is an elastomeric polymer which means that it's structure is something like a bunch of spaghetti strands and it will flow, but very slowly.    For the butyl inner liner to keep its shape, adhere to the inside surface of the tire, and have good impermeability to air it needs to be cured.   Curing will form cross-links between the spaghetti strands which will prevent them from flowing and make it difficult for air to pass through.    One method to cross link is UV radiation.  </p>
<p>As butyl rubber is one of the more expensive rubbers in a tire build, the amount a tire contains will vary.  Really cheap tires will have a thin inner liner.  A thicker inner liner will better retain air in the tire.  </p>
<p>Fun fact: cross linking rubber creates a permanent chemical bond between the rubber strands.  This is the reason why rubber does not melt when you heat it and would instead burn if you try to torch it.  </p></div>		</li>
