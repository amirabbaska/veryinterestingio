I feel like she is not contributing toward the direction that I want my life to go towards.  a little resentful, but open to the big peace.  I am counting on you as a ice machine guy who will do his best, please advice</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I would lay it out there for her. Tell her how you feel and what your vision for the relationship is. If she doesn't share that vision, is it worth going forward? Regardless of time put into the relationship, it's never to late to start over. You don't want to stay in a relationship that is smoke and mirrors.  :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From /u/bart889 , the 2nd half is more relevant to you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clear commercial ice is made in a machine called a Clinebell chiller. It freezes water from the bottom up, and as the ice freezes it forces dissolved air and other impurities upwards into the unfrozen water above the ice. Before all the water is frozen, the &quot;dirty&quot; unfrozen water is discarded, and the clear frozen column is then removed and cut up.</p>
<p>You can approximate this at home by taking one of those styrofoam coolers and filling it with (filtered then boiled then cooled to room temp) water, and then placing it (without the lid) into your freezer. It will freeze from the top down, and will force any impurities into the remaining liquid water, like a Clinebell in reverse. When about 2/3 of the water is frozen, remove the block of ice. It should be almost perfectly clear. Discard the remaining water, which will look dirty beyond belief. Then cut up the block of ice into 1&quot; cubes for your artisinal-style cocktails.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea lol. Sorry - I'm on the commercial end and really don't know much about freezing water at home. Someone with more knowledge of water chemistry would be better suited to answer that question.</p>
<p>However, I would guess that boiling the water first would clear it out because it would get the air out of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Scotsman makes one called a DCE33 which makes a bit cylindrical cube.  It retails around $1400 I believe. </p>
<p>Ice-o-Matic makes one called the HISU050 which makes cubes. And a GEMU090 which makes nugget ice.</p>
<p>If you're thinking about buying for the home, keep this in mind: buy something with a commercial warranty. You can get a fridgidaire, whirlpool, etc and it will probably be worthless in a year or two. But if you buy a commercial &quot;under-the-counter&quot; unit, it's going to be made with higher quality parts, have a longer and more comprehensive warranty and be easier to repair in the future. </p></div>		</li>
