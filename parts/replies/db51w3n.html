			<div class="markdown"><p>I just think Anthropocene is a terrible word. And I know from experience it causes people's eyes to glaze over. There are a lot of alternatives--from the Plasticene to just the Obscene--but my personal favorite is the Poubellian (from the French for trash can.) Just sounds nice (poo-bell-ee-en.) Still I suspect we're stuck with the Anthropocene.</p>
<p>As for scientists, as you know, there is no question that the physics of CO2 trapping heat are undeniable. The ocean is becoming more acidic (and a lot hotter, even if you can't tell when you take a dip.) Weather is gonna get even weirder. The biggest differences I see are in what scientists from different countries tend to be worried about. So in China it might be drought while in Canada it's the methane bomb lurking in the permafrost. That said, every scientist I've talked to is worried that people are not moving fast enough--and at a big enough scale--to address the challenge posed by climate change to human civilization.</p>
<p>Oh, and scientists realize the planet will be fine no matter what happens. It's humanity we have to worry about...</p></div>		</li>

<p>I say something very similar:<br />
&quot;It's not the Earth we're trying to save&quot;<br />
