			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think a small fish would be able to displace the water enough to break the surface tension of the water and eject it from the bowl in significant quantities. The surface tension of the water would keep it together in roughly a sphere. If the water was splashed around the lip of the bowl it would just stick to the outside, it wouldn't go flying everywhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that depend on the size. A small fish would probably be safe in a free floating water bubble, but larger species definetly wouldn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't most fish jump? And doesn't jumping require breaking surface tension and overcoming gravity? I imagine a fish &quot;escaping&quot; a ball of water in zero-g would be easier than jumping on earth.</p>
<p>That said, the surface tension of water does cause it to form films on things in zero-g (I think there is a video of Chris Hadfield with his arm encased in water). It seems plausible to me that a fish could &quot;escape&quot; the larger mass of a water ball, but still retain a thin film of water surrounding its body due to surface tension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if you were able to move the bowl really quickly you'd get a cavitation bubble.  Those aren't pressurized and collapse on their own (that part might kill the fish).</p>
<p>If air managed to get under that was the same pressure as outside you wouldn't have a pressure difference to force the water back in though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as the flapping the fins to create a bubble goes- no, this wouldn't happen. To create a bubble, outside air would need to be added. Otherwise, this bubble would actually be a void, a vacuum. You can't just make a bubble from nothing, unless it we're able to extract enough gas from the water to do so, which it can't. Just because there's no gravity doesn't mean that pressure and vaccum are somehow negated.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Also, the continued text from the article you linked-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are some of the results of animals in orbit? Fish and tadpoles swim in loops, rather than straight lines, because there is no up or down to orient them, Lewis says. If a light shines, the fish use that as their guide source and swim towards the light. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i agree, even if the body of water with the fish were floating in open air the surface tension would hold all the water together. This would not stop the fish from shooting out the side of the water. If the fish were able to navigate properly and knew to respect the water edge it could swim around within the water without much issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Mantis Shrimp is my favorite example for this. They strike so fast they can create vapor bubbles that then collapse into a shockwave. Still not a void, hence the word vapor, just as you explained. So a plain fish won't be making an vapor bubbles anytime soon, even in space.   </p>
<p>(Just agreeing with you and talking about my favorite sea creature)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you can create gas in water purely from movement, specifically through cavitation, which creates a bubble of extremely thin gas, a near vacuum with a bit of water vapor. Thus collapses almost instantly, and as far as I know, only Mantis Shrimp are capable of doing that (specifically the type with the pistol type claws).</p></div>		</li>
