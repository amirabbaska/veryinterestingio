			<div class="markdown"><p>Facebook has a Most Recent view that puts posts in chronological order, though posts will float to the top again once someone does something like comment on it. Most Recent even has a unique URL that you can bookmark or add to your home screen on mobile making it easily accessible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just about engagement.  Facebook specifically sells feed promotion to publishers.  Users might then infer that the promoted content is genuinely well-liked since it's adjacent to organically popular content.</p>
<p>This service would be harder to mask in chronological view.  It would also remove the valuable-by-association effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you see a chronological feed you know to stop scrolling when you see old content, if its non-chronological you will have to scroll further to satisfy yourself that you have seen all the new posts. This creates more chances to insert ads without affecting the posts to ads ratio.</p></div>		</li>
