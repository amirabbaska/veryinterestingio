			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they physical? How do they travel through metres of 'earth' and get detected? Do they leave behind a 'hole' that is the width of them from where they hit earth to where they end up?</p>
<p>God damn, this thread is incredible and I love science. I just don't have a clue haha</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, they're passing through you right now. At sea level, it's mostly muons.</p>

<p>They are moving very fast, and sparsely interact with matter. But there are a lot of them, and if you record data with a large array of detectors for long periods of time, you rack up a lot of cosmic ray events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the spectrum. If they come from the high redshift classification then you'd have to call them cosmic, but from our own solar encabulation it's hard to pinpoint without some kind of low density field acceleration incident. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The particles that can cross the detectors are muons, produced in the upper atmosphere - by different particles coming from outside the solar system. Unfortunately they are both called &quot;cosmic rays&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We try to call them &quot;cosmic muons&quot;, as in &quot;muons which originate from cosmic ray collisions&quot;. But people get lazy.</p></div>		</li>
