			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer!</p>
<p>An adendum question if that's okay: what physical temperature does an object need to be to emit as much IR as an IR LED? Ie why don't hot objects show up the same way on camera sensors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're trying to compare apples and oranges :) IR from an IR LED has a much shorter wavelength than heat-generated IR. IR actually covers a really wide range compared to the range of visible light. Visible light is 400-700nm and IR covers 700nm-1000000nm (or 1mm). </p>
<p>This is also why you can't trigger a PIR sensor (passive IR, those security motion sensors) with IR LEDs. </p>
<p>IR LEDs typically emit around 900nm and I believe heat generated IR is around 15000nm!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there a relationship between temperature and photon frequency? Or how does an incandescent bulb work? Iron can easily become red hot in a small fire.</p>
<p>So presumably there is a temperature where a very hot object mimics the effect of an IR LED.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really accurate. The radiation generated by a hot object has a spectral distribution which depends on the temperature of the object. This is called black body radiation. The warmer the object is, the higher the spectral peak. </p>
<p>For the temperature ranges that we usually encounter (say 0-50 C) the radiation peaks in the ballpark of 10,000 nm, which is probably the origin of your confusion. As things get warmer, the peak moves higher. Since the spectral distribution is a curve rather than a single wavelength, higher frequencies are also emitted at lower levels. At around 600-700 C those higher frequencies start getting high enough in the visual spectrum that a red glow starts to appear (red hot). As the heat increases, the spectrum keeps creeping up to include orange and yellow frequencies, and eventually green and blue as well. Since they all are being emitted, the light looks white (white hot). Keep going and eventually the blue frequencies dominate, though at that point the peak is well into the UV range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify the last sentence, heat-generated IR covers the whole spectrum, of course, all the way to visible light.</p>
<p>An object glowing red from heat, for example, is putting out energy over the whole IR spectrum--we're just seeing the high-frequency tail of the curve pushing into the visible spectrum. </p>
<p>A white-hot object is putting out significantly more energy across the spectrum: the visible-light slice is more evenly affected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: because it needs to be very hot to be picked up the IR sensor of the camera.</p>
<p>An object needs to be around 550°C to 600°C to start to glow in the visible spectrum, but in this case only a tiny amount of the heat radiation is in the visible range (roughly 400nm to 700nm wavelength).</p>
<p>A detector in a  consumer camera is typically only sensitive to light in a bit wider range than the human eye, <a href="http://www.andor.com/learning-academy/ccd-spectral-response-(qe)-defining-the-qe-of-a-ccd" target="_blank">this source says about 300nm to 1000nm</a>. So I'd guess an object would need to be maybe 400°C (750F) hot to show up in a digital picture, unless you're talking about a camera that's specifically designed for the far IR spectrum.</p>
<p>If you want to know how hot an object needs to be so that the peak of its spectrum is similar to that of an IR LED, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law" target="_blank">Wien's displacement law</a> answers that. If you plug in 1µm as the central wavelength, you get 2900K / 2600C / 4700F.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do. Try pointing a camera at a red hot object, such as the heating element in a grill or toaster. You'll see that when your eye perceives dull dark red, the camera will pick up purple or white. </p></div>		</li>
