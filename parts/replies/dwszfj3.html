			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a small/mid sized corporate grocery store and this is never a reason we move things around, and i have good reason to suspect that the same is true most places too. What people forget is how much labor and variability goes into the cost of moving things around. Sure, end caps and displays are always changing, but thats just good business practice in pretty much any sort of business. Once we have a sector/aisle set to the way we like it, ill do everything in my power to keep it that way though. Financially it just doesnt make sense to spend so much time and energy to move things around just for the sake of change. On top of that, yea, customers are likely to spend more time looking, but there will also be a significant number of customers who get frustrated and or dont have the time for that nonsense, thus losing sales from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, outside of end caps, the only reason we have to change stuff is cause other things get discontinued or we have to bring in something new and over time the whole area just gets disorganized. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top dog retailer is Walmart and the reasons listed are the same reasons why Walmart does it. I'd say it works for them. Customers dont have the time for that nonsense the first time they experience it. Then a week later they go back and buy that product since the steam blew off already. Plus, they buy something extra that they never noticed before. You'll also notice that sometimes the best selling items are towards the bottom shelf. Most people don't want to bend over for an item they don't care for, but if it's something they need they will obviously do it.</p></div>		</li>
