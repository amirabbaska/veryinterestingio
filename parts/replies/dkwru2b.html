			<div class="markdown"><p>We're accustomed to the three phases of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.  A phase diagram has axes of pressure and temperature, allowing you to map under what conditions a substance will be in each phase.  Generally, at low temperatures and high pressures, you'll get solids, then as temperature increases and pressure decreases, you'll get liquid and gas.  There will also be three important lines on this diagram that chart the sublimation, melting, and evaporation transitions.  </p>
<p>Some substances, including water and carbon dioxide, have a particular temperature and pressure above which they become supercritical fluids.  A simplified way to think of this phase of matter is a mixture of both liquid and gas properties.  The substance is so hot that it wants to be a gas, but it's under enough pressure that it can't fully become gaseous.</p>
<p>Supercritical fluids can dissolve things like liquids, but take the volume of their container like gases.  They also have some crazy solubility and miscibility properties that can make them especially good at dissolving other molecules.  Environmentally-friendly dry-cleaning process can use supercritical carbon dioxide, and a colleague of mine in grad school used supercritical water to dissolve very insoluble nylon polymers.</p></div>		</li>
