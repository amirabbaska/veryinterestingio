			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. If you look at the US sanctions against Russian officials, some of them were only on name only, as they had no us holdings the US can go after. </p>
<p>The goal here is to find other countries to apply sanctions as well, so that basically the only place you can do business is your own. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scope of the sanctions are anyone doing business in the US and wishes to continue to do business and hold assets in the US.  If they didn't pay the fine they couldn't sell in the US and other countries/US allies could impose sanctions on them as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the right answer. it's not about the origin of the goods. if you don't comply you lose access to the US market and the US controlled global financial system.</p></div>		</li>
