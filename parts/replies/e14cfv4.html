			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, very true. My dim witted cousin was told she could drink the condensate from an air conditioner by her roommate, since it was “essentially distilled water.” Drank it, got legionnaires disease, didn’t go to the hospital for a week and almost died. That was almost exactly a year ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if it is boiled and the steam is condensed somewhere else instead of just boiling it to make it hot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However you could use this for grey water,  Relieving stress on potable supplies.   An example being islands in the ocean have plenty of humidity but not high counts of potable water.  However if you could store the water produced by air conditioning systems(with some minor chlorine treatment to keep it from getting nasty) low flow toilets could probably be filled from an air conditioner filled cistern.</p>
<p>I have heard some cruise ships do this,  provide flushing water partially from the HVAC systems.  Since nobody will drink from the toilet bowl.</p></div>		</li>
