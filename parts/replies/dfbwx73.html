<p>On the other end of the ultra-wealthy spectrum, Buffet and Gates are using their money to change the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand correctly, if this passes they stand to benefit financially; the ultra-wealthy will receive a massive tax cut if the AHCA passes.</p>
<p>They're certainly not innocent in the whole &quot;America is now shit&quot; scenario, but if we're going purely by your line of logic they would be voting <em>for</em> this instead of putting money up against it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not going to save nearly enough to make up for what they're pledging in support.  </p>
<p>To the Koch's, and other ultra rich people it's not about a return on personal investment.  They're ideologically driven and are willing to use their fortunes on achieving that ideology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A charitable foundation is only required to divest 5% of it's total value each year.  This is far less than the average growth rate even after inflation.  More significantly, generations of heirs will collect huge salaries to sit on the board of directors.  The $28 billion worth of shares in microsoft that Bill Gates has sold to fund his foundation are almost all growing free from all future capital gains taxes in Berkshire Hathaway, Waste Management, Canadian National Railway, Caterpillar, Wal-Mart, Fed Ex, UPS, Ecolab Inc., Crown Castle, and Coca-Cola.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>they throw out some contrived shit about replacing it with better healthcare that Americans deserve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't want it replaced with anything, actually. They don't want the government involved in Healthcare. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I highly doubt the koch brothers are worried about their healthcare expenses...or those of average Americans. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're wrong, then. Libertarians think freedom from government is freedom from tyranny for everybody. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what do they stand to gain?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're die-hard Libertarians. They put their money towards causes they believe are right. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm sure it has to do with money</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it was about money, then they'd keep their money and not spend so much trying to influence politics. You've got this reversed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>because apparently they don't have enough already...but what specifically?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They give money to nonprofits because of their personal convictions. Just like liberals do the same. Both liberals and conservatives give their money to causes they support. </p></div>		</li>
