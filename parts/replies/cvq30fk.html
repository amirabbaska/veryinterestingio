<p>I don't believe this is correct. As I understand the human body does not eliminate metabolic waste via feces. Rather, feces are only the remains of materials not adsorbed in digestion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incorrect. The liver removes toxins from the blood and dumps them in the feces. The kidneys also remove toxins from the blood and dumps them in the urine. Sometimes the liver changes the drugs and then the metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. And when I say toxins, I don't just mean metabolic waste, I include drugs. While the renal route is more common, the hepatic route is an important pathway to drug removal.

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL. Thanks : )</p>
<p>I had been under the impression that defecation was not included in &quot;excretion&quot;, and that non-food waste was more-or-less not present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Shortly&quot; is a matter of opinion, different drugs get absorbed into the system at different rates. Also, the rate at which material passes from your stomach into your intestine can vary, too. I do not know gastric emptying times in the human. And there are drugs that can speed this up. Metoclopramide is the classic one. </p></div>		</li>
