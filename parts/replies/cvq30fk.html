			<p>&gt; by dumping it in [....] your feces<br><br>I don't believe this is correct. As I understand the human body does not eliminate metabolic waste via feces. Rather, feces are only the remains of materials not adsorbed in digestion.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Incorrect. The liver removes toxins from the blood and dumps them in the feces. The kidneys also remove toxins from the blood and dumps them in the urine. Sometimes the liver changes the drugs and then the metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. And when I say toxins, I don't just mean metabolic waste, I include drugs. While the renal route is more common, the hepatic route is an important pathway to drug removal.

			<p>TIL. Thanks : )<br><br>I had been under the impression that defecation was not included in &quot;excretion&quot;, and that non-food waste was more-or-less not present.</p>		</li>

			<p>Nope. Our bodies - and all other mammalian bodies, for that matter - have all kinds of ways to get rid of toxins: urine, feces, breath, sweating. This is why those people who try to sell you colonic cleanses to de-toxify your body are full of shit. Your body is already detoxifying in several ways at once, all the time. </p>		</li>

			<p>Questiom: if the level of the drug is highest shortly after you take it, as you say, why if I have diarrhea or vomit during the next 4 hours it's possible that my body didn't absorb the pill?</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;Shortly&quot; is a matter of opinion, different drugs get absorbed into the system at different rates. Also, the rate at which material passes from your stomach into your intestine can vary, too. I do not know gastric emptying times in the human. And there are drugs that can speed this up. Metoclopramide is the classic one. </p>		</li>
