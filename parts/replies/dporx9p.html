			<div class="markdown"><p>2G won’t be going away for a while. Some carriers want to get rid of it, even though they have no reason to (AT&amp;T). A decent amount of carriers have to support it, as the CDMA protocol requires it to find towers. As for the case for getting rid of 2G, there isn’t much of one. While it is much slower, it takes up very little bandwidth, is built in to the transmitter already (no extra costs), has wider signal reach, and allows older phones to operate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supporting 2G requires reserving some spectrum for its use (instead of 4G). 2G allows fewer users per MHz (users/ amount of spectrum). So getting rid of 2G is good for everyone else on the network that doesn't have a 2G only device.</p></div>		</li>
