			<p>Hi Shaven, as of now, all we have done is get bacteria to propagate X and Y in its DNA, and we initially avoided putting X and Y into a gene.  What we are doing now is just that, so we can examine how the unnatural information is retrieved in the form of RNA and then protein.  This is where we will see the largest effects.  But what we know now, is that storing the increased information does not really effect the bacteria, which we are very excited about.  To be clear, in our paper, we do report that expressing the transporter proteins themselves (which is required to get X and Y into the cell) does slow growth a little.  However, Yorke Zhang in my lab has already found a way to eliminate this, as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the system.  Hope this helps and thanks for the question.</p>		</li>

			<p>I keyed in on this line in the NPR article<br><br>&gt;&quot;This is embarrassing. We have really horrible names,&quot; Romesberg says. &quot;They are abbreviations for very complex chemical names.&quot; He explains that because his lab has made and investigated many possible molecules over the years, &quot;we couldn't give every one of them a cute little name like X or Y or alpha or beta â€” because we simply examined too many of them.&quot;<br><br>and was curious just how many different molecules you've tried over the years. Where did other possible molecules fail that these ones succeeded?</p>		</li>

			<p>We have tried around 300 compounds in vitro. They were just less successful than our current X and Y because their fidelity in replication in vitro was not as good. We have not tried other compounds in our in vivo system.</p>		</li>

			<p>Speaking of fidelity... do you know what the error rate is at this point in the research?  Is it comparable to the 4 canonical bases?</p>		</li>

			<p>Replication fidelity of the unnatural base pair in vitro (for example, in PCR) is over 99.9 %, which corresponds to 10-3 error rate per nucleotide.  In a living cell, we were able to achieve &gt;99.5% fidelity, which is ok for most applications, however, we are working on improving this number beyond 99.99% to make our base pair indistinguishable from natural ones for practical purposes.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I don't know anything about DNA, but wouldn't adding X or Y cause a frameshift mutation with the already existing DNA? Or am I missing something?</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, but only if you put them in the middle of a gene, and then only if you put them in <em>in addition</em> to what was already there, rather than replacing an existing base.  They'd probably be doing a simple swap, like this:<br><br>Original:<br>&gt; GCA TTC AAG CTC<br><br>New: <br>&gt; GCA TYC AAX CTC<br><br>What those middle two codons would translate to depends on what tRNAs the lab cooks up.</p>		</li>

			<p>He said they only inserted the nucleotides in non-coding regions, so that wouldn't be a problem!</p>		</li>

			<p>Well it would if the non-coding regions were regulatory.  Non-coding regions, just means that they do not code for a protein, but they could be regulatory regions in which case it would matter and could have a phenotype!</p>		</li>

			<p>Right, sorry. I figured they went for regions that were actually useless, not just regions that didn't code directly for proteins, my bad!<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Don't you find it likely that these added chromosomes are somehow flawed, or inefficient, or cause some sort of fundamental issue for evolution, given that life had not naturally evolved to be this way?<br><br>What procedure did you need to use?<br><br>Do you think that it is the nature of the mechanism which originally produced DNA, that it is as it is, without those extra chromosomes, and this is not something that can possibly evolve, but must be produced by some event of sorts?<br><br>Do you think that it is plausible that something like that could come to exist all on its own on a planet elsewhere for example?</p>		</li>
