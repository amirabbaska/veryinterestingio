Satellites will not do for gaming, or real-time audio/video.  For general communication sure, but there are certain things that terrestrial fibre and cellular networks  cannot be beaten at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Low Earth Orbit (which SpaceX's plan involves) latency is actually pretty low. We are talking about the ballpark of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/spacexs-falcon-9-rocket-will-launch-thousands-of-broadband-satellites/" target="_blank">25ms</a>, not the traditional hundreds of milliseconds that geosynchronous orbits have.</p>
<p>The only issue is you need more satellites to cover the area and since they move around relative to ground, more advanced antennas that can track them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an extremely optimistic estimate. You'll have 14 ms just from the speed of light if bouncing from one satellite. That means they are leaving only 10 ms for all the terrestrial transmission, routing, etc.. Given the SNR is not going to be great, you can't expect much in terms of bandwidth either.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That sounds quite expensive. You'd not only have to add the costs of the antenna, the installation (does it have to be mounted outside?), but with moving mechanics, it's going to increase your power bill and fail more often than your router and landline. Would bad weather influence the connection?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that  25 ms to the pusher then the satellite back to the user, or is that to multiple remote locations? If the first, wouldn't there be more latency if it had to send it to another location on earth, especially if its paths involved satellites?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>article I read yesterday, these LEO satellites will only have a latency of 10-20ms, so really not anymore than ground based servers based in other countries. The high latency is from geo-stationary satellites (in the order of 400-600ms), not the LEO constellation proposed.</p>
<p>EDIT: article <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/net-neutralitys-peril-boost-prospects-global-satellite-broadband/" target="_blank">https://www.geekwire.com/2017/net-neutralitys-peril-boost-prospects-global-satellite-broadband/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But because LEO satellites are hundreds of miles above Earth, rather than thousands, the network lag time would amount to 30 to 50 milliseconds. That’s competitive with terrestrial networks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So err, 30-50ms, but still fairly acceptable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Latency is not the only factor defining a good internet connection.</p>
<p>Package loss is another important metric. Basically, a data package (e.g. TCP package) gets lost or distorted so it cannot be used. This is much more of a problem with wireless communication since they are more affected by interference than fiber networks.</p>
<p>At least current satellite network technology also has a smaller bandwidth than fiber.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you'd still have to use a terrestrial system to connect your satellites to the internet. You definitely won't compete with cable based solutions when it comes to speed. You will add additional lag, there's no way around it as long as elon musk doesn't setup his own server farms at his satellite base stations. So you have to add that to your current internet speed. So you'd be at least as bad as Australian internet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fair enough.  LEO satellites are an improvement but the altitude of a satellite also dictates several other factors; mainly its field of view (lower altitude, smaller coverage) and longevity (lower altitude, much shorter lifespan).  These make an LEO cluster exponentially more expensive - as Iridium found out, you need far more satellites for the same coverage and they need to be replaced much more often.</p></div>		</li>
