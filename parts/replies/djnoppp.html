			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem isn't the fine, a monetary disincentive is a fine idea.</p>
<p>The problem is the fine going to the issuing agency directly.</p>
<p>This sets up two problems, it gives them a source of income, and therefor an ability to spend not overseen by legislators. And it gives them an incentive to find a way to fine you, justified or not.</p>
<p>Fines <em>should</em> be paid directly back to a municipal or state body and not directly earmarked for the department that issued them.</p>
<p>This re-establishes oversight over the departments budget, and removes the incentive to hand out frivolous, or trumped up fines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Health inspector here. You got fined for using dry rags to wipe messes. You should have a sanitizer bucket which the rags are left in. You wipe down the counter then place the rag back in the sanitizer to prevent bacterial growth on the rag.</p>
<p>I don't fine the first time though.... But I should... I see the same places have the same violations at every routine inspection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why don't you fine? I'm an inspector too but in a different field (nuclear materials). The way I go into an inspection is to assume the management wants to be fined and to have them prove otherwise. If I give a warning but feel they might have a hearing problem I cite a violation. ..just to make sure they don't also have a reading problem. From Nov. (2016) to June (2017) I cited about $50,000 in fines.</p></div>		</li>
