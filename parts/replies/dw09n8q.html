			<div class="markdown"><p>I would have taken school so much more seriously if teachers simply explained &quot;why&quot; we were learning things.</p>
<p>EDIT: Adding to this snarky comment bc of how intensely this resonated, both positively and negatively.<br />
I'm referencing my past as an angry middle school / high school student in advanced classes who wanted to go into the arts, and hated every second of class.<br />
Now, I work in VFX and motion design, and I constantly find myself looking up old trig and algebra lessons to use in my programs and coding. It's fun, it's straightforward, and it helps me do my job.<br />
I get that kids can be difficult, and that I very well may have hated it just as much if I knew why this or that is useful. But maybe we could consider working more of the &quot;why&quot; into the curriculum itself. Hang in there teachers &amp; students!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this (if anyone was disagreeing). My company hands out lab notebooks that are explicitly remain the company property, with numbered and dated pages.
EVERYTHING goes in them - lab tests, meeting minutes, random idea.
One of the important reasons is that we do a lot of business in China. The patent law there is a little different to the US - patents are awarded to whoever thought of the idea first, not who applied/was approved first. So keeping records of every idea you had and crucially <em>when</em> you had it are very important. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's definitely possible. It's also really easy to commit perjury. The reason people don't do it (as far as we know) is because if you get caught you will permanently lose your job, your carreer and will be put in jail for a long, long time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same here. The books are also embossed with a unique serial number and is traced as a company asset.</p>
<p>We don't us the composition books I remember from school though... IIRC (since I'm home and not at work), the lab books we use are made by Nalgene.</p></div>		</li>
