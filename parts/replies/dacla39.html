			<div class="markdown"><p>To anyone unaware, one of the Millenium Problems was solved and the person that solved it invented some math in order to do it. At least according to my memory of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GItmC9lxeco" target="_blank">Numberphile video</a>.</p>
<p>And I thought it went like this: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motion = flow = change = derivative</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to describe a derivative. I just picked one that appealed to me (flow of &quot;stuff&quot; whether it be data or water). Likewise, integrals are their own beast even though they are taught second and thought of as a reverse derivative. Other names for an integral are accumulation of change, history, or memory.</p>
<p>In robotics and electronics, integrating quantities are often referred to as &quot;memory&quot; because they reflect the history of the quantity measured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many open conjectures in number theory can at least be stated in a relatively simple manner. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose a^x + b^y = c^z for some collection of integers a, b, c, x, y, and z where x, y, and z are all greater than 2. Conjecture: there must be some prime number p that divides a, b, and c.</li>
<li>Start with any number x, and repeat the following procedure: &quot;if x is even, divide it by 2; otherwise, multiply it by 3 and add 1&quot;; for example, 5 --&gt; 16 --&gt; 8 --&gt; 4 --&gt; 2 --&gt; 1. Conjecture: No matter what x you start with, if you repeat the procedure enough times you will eventually reach 1.</li>
<li>Conjecture: Every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers.</li>
<li>Note that 6 is equal to the sum of all smaller numbers that divide it evenly: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 28 also has this property, since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28. Conjecture: no odd numbers have this property.</li>
<li>Conjecture: There are infinitely many pairs of primes spaced 2 apart from each other (for example: 3 and 5; 5 and 7; 11 and 13; 17 and 19).</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>proof</em> of any of these would almost certainly be impossible to understand without spending years studying mathematics, but the problems themselves seem deceptively simple.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I must say I was stunned to realise that this remains unsolved. It's a great one because it seems so simple. But in practise it is anything but.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a bit of a start:</p>
<p>Eventually, x must become a power of 2. It gets there by its prior transformation being of the form (3z+1). Thus, 2 ^ y=3z+1 and y=log(2,3z+1). This is a continuous function with infinity as its limit. This gives us both {y} and {z} as infinite sets, and consequently an infinite set {y,z} where both are integers and solutions to the equation. </p>
<p>I have no idea how to prove that the procedure will never recurse infinitely, skipping all powers of 2.</p></div>		</li>
