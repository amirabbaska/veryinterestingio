			<div class="markdown"><p>it's too short lived to test, but the leading theories seem to indicate that, while not necessarily behaving like a metalloid, it would behave least like a halogen of anything in that column of the periodic table. with the most notable difference being the -1 oxidation state is theorized to be the least common oxidation state for 117. Wikipedia cites a book called &quot;Transactinides and the future elements&quot; to back up this claim, but I don't have access to it since I'm off my university's wifi, so I can't confirm with 100% certainty </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  It's a question about words, not the actual world.  &quot;How does element 118 act&quot; is a question about the actual world.  &quot;Is element 118 a noble gas&quot; is a question about what to call it.</p>
<p>That is to say: &quot;Noble gas&quot; is a category <em>extensionally</em> defined by examples -- helium, neon, etc.  If it were defined <em>intensionally</em> -- by a list of sufficient and necessary conditions -- then there would be a sharp dividing line of what's in and what's out.  (Of course, this dividing line would not itself have any physical significance!)  As it is, membership's a bit fuzzy -- some things act more like the protypical noble gases, some less.</p>
<p>Where do you draw the line?  The answer is, it's irrelevant.  The world is the same regardless.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think about it, isn't it more &quot;meaningless&quot; to <em>answer</em> a supposedly &quot;meaningless&quot; question than it is to ask it? The irony here would be funny if it weren't for the fact that it could discourage OP and other people from exploring science even further.</p>
<p>After all, any question that has an <em>obvious</em> answer is not worth asking. At the same time, there is no such thing as an answer without meaning, and therefore there is no such thing as a question without meaning or a &quot;meaningless question&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyways, a transient element could realistically be transmuted into a more permanent form through means unknown at the present time. Therefore, its initial status as a &quot;noble gas&quot;, or otherwise would indeed be a relevant factor to consider. Limiting all scientific inquiry to what is possible now would literally be the death of science. Therefore, this is indeed an interesting question as you so wisely put it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Helium hydride was sort of &quot;forced&quot; together in a labratory and does not result from the mere mixing of H and He in an STP environment (it's technically adding another proton to helium, which helium really doesn't want). As for xenon, the parent comment mentions that as you go down the periodic table, the rules for certain groups such as noble gases become less concrete. This means that the heavier noble gases will not quite follow the same rules as the lighter ones. This is why xenon can react to a <em>very limited</em> number of compounds and elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but there's a big difference in how stable.</p>
<p>Xenon trioxide you can actually make enough to touch (not that you should) at room temperature, and you can expose it to air and water etc without it immediately disappearing.</p>
<p>Helium hydride you can detect a few molecules of it briefly in a vacuum at very very low temperatures via spectroscopy.</p>
<p>The other noble gas compounds are inbetween, based on how far down the table they are</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, but is it proper to talk about velocity of electrons within electron shells? Traditional E&amp;M theory would have those electrons radiating energy and decaying their orbits, but that can't happen when the atom is in it's ground state. My understanding is that QM resolves this in that electron orbitals become &quot;stationary states&quot;. Then, it no longer makes sense to talk about &quot;orbits&quot; in terms of a particle with a defined velocity moving around a nucleus -- right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons in stationary states still have associated momenta, so you can still define the expectation value of the velocity of an electron in a particular state. &quot;Stationary state&quot; doesn't mean, having no motion, it just means, stationary with respect to time evolution. An electron in a single stationary state will remain in said state. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting, but all electrons have relativistic effects; that's what magnetism is. It's the relativistic effects of the electrons traveling at the speed of light and bending space around them. That's why there's no &quot;magnetism particle&quot; for the magnetic field. So when electric charges travel through an electric field, it doesn't move in our reference frame, like we would expect without relativity; it bends and we think there's another field acting on it. So, I think somewhere something was over-simplified, and I'm not sure what that was. </p>
