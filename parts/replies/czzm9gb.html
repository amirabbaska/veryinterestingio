			<div class="markdown"><p>I do like the &quot;Hurley model&quot; that he and his co-authors propose, but yeah, I don't know how receptive scientists have been of the theory. I'll expand a bit on the model. </p>
<p>The basic idea is that mirth is sort of a vestigial brain-state that is being overstimulated by humor. There isn't necessarily a selective advantage for humor itself, so the model suggests; instead humor overstimulates something else that is useful to us.</p>
<p>Our ability to construct narratives and anticipate future events is what was evolutionarily valuable to usâ€”that ability helped us prosper. For instance, we could imagine how a predator might want to behave, and thereby we could avoid deadly encounters with that predator. And so, we needed the cognitive ability to find errors in the narratives we would create, to avoid falling prey to false narratives that lead us to make the wrong aniticipatory move. And that ability to debug our narratives is precisely what is being overstimulated with humor. </p>
<p>The opening of a joke leads us down one path of reasoning, but then the punchline knocks us onto another path. The anticipated narrative we created at the beginning was incorrect, and that jolt of finding ourselves on the revised, correct narrative is where we find mirth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found the book quite convincing, and it was a pretty entertaining read as well - every subchapter opens with a joke or two illustrating the point in question. </p>
<p>What sold me most is the overview of the different types of humor and the historical perspective of the different theories, and how looking at humor as <em>primarily</em> evolved for the debugging process allows one to account for the different subtypes.</p></div>		</li>
