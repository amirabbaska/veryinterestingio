			<div class="markdown"><p>Technology can often outpace policy and ethics (go watch the 20 year old movie GATTACA for a precisent. taste) .  We are close to having a $100 genome (or less), and yes I think it may be standard of care to be sequenced, in order to stratify risk and prevention, smarter diagnosis, and more personalized Rx...  </p>
<p>Of course this has insurance implications, in the US the Genentic  Non discrimination act (GENA)  helps, but more protections across insurance etc will need to put into place.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_Information_Nondiscrimination_Act" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_Information_Nondiscrimination_Act</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While we are approaching a 100 dollar genome, we still don't have efficient means of dealing with sequence data. How far away do you think we are to individual genome assemblies with variant calling. What are the notable applications for whole genome sequencing as opposed to targeted genetic testing, and what other major milestones do you think remain for us to achieve practical personalized genomic medicine? </p>
<p>Hope that isn't too many questions wrapped into one! Your work sounds quite fascinating. </p></div>		</li>
