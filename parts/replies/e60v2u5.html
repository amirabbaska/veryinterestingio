Yes, you have an infinite number of infinitely short distances to cover, but you also have an infinite number of infinitely short periods of time in which to do so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like, yeah, no matter how short the journey there will always be a smaller distance that needs to be covered first, but there’s also an equally small unit of time to do it <em>in,</em> so you’re fine, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. You're referring to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality" target="_blank">cardinality</a> of the sets of those two types of numbers, which is basically the size of the sets. Whole numbers (integers) are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set" target="_blank">countable</a>. Real numbers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set" target="_blank">uncountable</a>.</p>
<p>The intuition is that you can &quot;count&quot; all of the whole numbers without skipping any if you have an infinite amount of time. I.e. if you start counting at 1, you can pick a number and know that eventually you'll reach it. You can't do that for real numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. The whole (or natural, as they're called) numbers have a certain (infinite) cardinality, which is often referred to as Aleph-0. The real numbers (which is the set of all possible numbers, decimals, the pi kind of strange numbers and all that) are more in number than this Aleph-0. This was proved by Georg Cantor, in what is called the Diagonal Argument. </p>
<p>The set of real numbers between 0 and 1 has the same size as the set of ALL possible real numbers (yes, this seems crazy, but it's true) so that number is indeed larger than the size of the set of all whole numbers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  The whole numbers are countably infinite.  The real numbers (and sets of all real numbers between two numbers, like 0 and 1) are uncountably infinite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson%27s_lamp" target="_blank">Thomson Lamp Paradox</a>. There is a difference between the Zeno situation and Thomson's lamp. The main difference is that of convergence. Zeno's paradox represents a convergent sequence, and so we can talk about the end product. Convergence is basically synonymous with the existence of an end result. Thomson's Lamp represents something where there does not exist an end result.</p>
<p>It's kinda like that joke about mathematicians going to a pub. The first orders a pint of beer. The second orders a half a pint. The third orders a quarter of a pint. Etc. The bartender then just pours two pints and gives it to them. This works because there is an convergent &quot;end result&quot; to this infinite process. If a similar situation happened, with a mathematician coming into the bar at faster, and faster rate, asking for the light to be on or off, then the bartender would just have to throw them out because there is no end result that they are all gravitating towards.</p>
<p>So processes things like this are only mathematically valid if there is convergence. Of course, none of these things are physically valid, because you can't chop things up infinitely small like that. A similar situation is that it is mathematically valid to take a solid sphere, break it up into a few pieces and put it back together as two spheres of the same volume as the original one. Mathematically valid, but not physically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem arises when you try to shoehorn physical things like lightbulbs into abstract mathematics.</p>
<p>Either it is a physical lightbulb, or it is a mathematical, abstract lightbulb.</p>
<p>If it is a physical lightbulb, then its behavior is constrained by physics. At some point the switching back and forth will be rapid enough that the electric fields do not have time to propagate between the contacts and the lightbulb and drive a current; so there is a maximum upper limit to the rate at which bulbs switch on and off, which is set by the material properties of the bulb and the wire lengths etc. Once this maximum limit is reached, it will continue switching back and forth at that rate.</p>
<p>Otherwise let's consider an abstract lightbulb that is not constrained by physics. Then the question reduces to asking: what is the limit of the sequence (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1...) at infinity? The answer is: &quot;undefined&quot;. This is a clear, precise answer, and since it is not a physical lightbulb, this answer is perfectly acceptable.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Or more strictly.  Asking &quot;What value does the series (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1...) approach?&quot; is a question too soon.  First you must ask &quot;Does the series (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1...) approach a value?&quot; </p>
<p>The answer is of course &quot;No&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this correct but I remember doing this proof in my undergrad </p>
<p>Sum from 1 to inf( 1/2^n ) = (1/2 + 1/4 + ...)</p>
<p>Let S = Sum from 1 to inf( 1/2^n ) </p>
<p>S = (1/2)(1+1/2+ 1/4 +...)
2S=(1+1/2+ 1/4 +...)
2S-1=(1/2+ 1/4 +...)
2S-1=S
S-1=0
S=1</p>
<p>Expand to any sum in the form 1/n
S=(1/n+1/n^2 +...)
S=(1/n)(1+1/n+ 1/n^2 +...)
S<em>n= 1+1/n+ 1/n^2 +...
S</em>n -1= 1/n+ 1/n^2 +...
S<em>n -1 = S
S</em>n-S=1
S(n-1)=1
S=1/(n-1)</p>
<p>The the trick of the proof is to recognize that you have the same sum on the right hand side after factoring out the fraction </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to use the more standard form of 1+r+r^(2)+r^(3)+...=1/(1-r).</p>
<p>What you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Formula" target="_blank">is the idea of finding the value</a>, but a key, important part of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Proof_of_convergence" target="_blank">actually proving that S exists and is finite</a>. What you have done is show that if S exists and is finite, then it must be 1/(1-r), but there are cases where S is not finite. Take, for instance, r=2, which is the series 1+2+4+8+... In this case S is infinite, so it cannot equal 1/(1-2)=-1. But, given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number" target="_blank">different number systems with different geometries</a>, this S <em>is</em> finite and so it equals -1.</p></div>		</li>
