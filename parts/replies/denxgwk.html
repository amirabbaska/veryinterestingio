			<div class="markdown"><p>The Maryland factoid you provided is interesting. Thanks for providing some proof for your argument. </p>
<p>The free market argument against Maryland's system would be that it pushes down doctor incentives and worsens patients outcomes. Is there a shortage of doctors or hospitals in Maryland? How does their quality of care compare? If you don't know off the top of your head i'll try to look it up later. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any hard numbers for you but I have anecdotal experience for you as somebody who's lived in Maryland  their whole life.  </p>
<p>NIH and John Hopkins are both in Maryland, as well as local systems like Anne Arundel Medical Center which offer excellent care and patient outcomes.  We definitely benefit from being a small state and having DC.  </p>
<p>I'm from Southern Maryland and will commute the hour North for specialist appiontments.  Not because we don't have them in rural parts of Maryland but because I can go to the best in the country with just a little travel time.  It's nice.  Compared to family in Virginia and Ohio I've been completely spoiled by Maryland.  Longest I've waited for a specialist has been two weeks.  </p>
<p>Wish I had numbers for you but the quick Google search was mostly comparing the US to Canada and not a state to state comparison.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I honestly didn't expect there to be widespread shortages and such, I was just curious.</p>
<p>Even if there's a mild down pressure on doctor supply / quality, you'd kind of hope that society would make the trade for significantly higher accessibility. I disagree with the temporarily embarrassed millionaire explanation for why many people don't want to make that trade.</p>
<p>I suspect that a lot of people who are comfortable with exorbitant healthcare costs because they believe that they're contributing towards advancements in technology in the future. Once that super specialized genetically tailored cancer treatment is last generation, we'll all be able to afford it, right? They think measures to bring down the top end profit margins hurt technological advancement, and maybe it will! Nobody tries to quantify to themselves how many bankruptcies and inaccessible care a vaccine is worth though. </p>
<p>The worst case scenarios need to be made way better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strict &quot;Free market&quot; thinking doesn't apply in medical situations.  If you or someone you love needs medical care to stay alive, you will pay anything or go into perma-debt.  This creates a massively unfair situation which will be exploited for profit. Some form of pricing control is necessary to protect people from this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I generally agree with your point, you've gone and ignored my question! In fact, I'm sensing an underlying message in your comment that my question isn't even worth asking. I disagree.</p>
<p>When it comes to political stuff like this, neither side is ever 100% right. Directly confronting arguments against your beliefs helps you refine and improve your own opinions.</p>
<p>I expect politicians never to cede any ground. I expect them to beg every question and red every herring. In the low stakes environment of online discussion, I wish people would talk TO each other more and PAST each other less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That and tort reform. US is the only nation with such an active lobby of trial lawyers who have successfully fought to keep tort reform from happening. Traditionally the trial lawyers have been left-leaning as a bloc but their lobbyists work with both sides. Not only do the large settlements directly drive up costs, but also increase through more expensive malpractice insurance as well as the huge list of unnecessary tests which get administered as part of an anti lawsuit checklist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I agree. Tort reforms are needed to remove caps and protections which providers have put in place to limit their liability for negligence and malpractice. Patients who are disabled for life, via malpractice or other failures, should have reasonably expected lifelong costs reimbursed, not capped. Likewise for minor injuries or damage, reward should be commensurate with the cost. </p>
<p>Tort reform as identified in your comment, reduces consumer options and rights, in favor of businesses. The system is already pitched in business' favor. Casually painting trial lawyers as left-leaning, seems like a projection of partisan beliefs, as if that is an argument in and of itself. It's not. </p>
<p>I believe in consumer/citizen rights over the rights of business to lobby for zero tolerance legislation that harms families that deserve larger than lobbyist-legislated payouts, regardless of how many real and alleged scammers you or lobbyists perceive. This is why courts exist, each case is reviewed on its merits. Passing sweeping restrictions encourages business to allow negligence and malpractice, since they will never pay for the damage they caused.</p>
<p>Supporting tort reform from a business side is an outright anti-consumer position, pushed by the ill informed and industry connected individuals with financial incentive to disinform the public. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting reply. Appreciate the alternate viewpoint, but disagree on unlimited caps for pain and suffering. Also, where is the consumer protection against the lawyers? They seem to be the only ones who get any real money in the big class-action suits and then the costs end up getting passed to consumers one way or another. </p>
<p>Also, once the government steps in as a single payer then caps have to be put in place in order for the programs to stay afloat financially...which might explain why US did not go with single payer when BO had majorities in Congress, and instead went with half-assed ACA (that, and the health insurance were giving big money to dem campaigns and to Kathleen Sebelius's shakedown program).</p>
<p>Edit: Also, it is a farce to challenge the observation that trial lawyers are primarily a democrat lobby...yes the first is a biased source but there are plenty of others: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a reason for the pro-trial lawyer bias evident throughout the &quot;reform&quot; proposals: The top contributor to President Obama's presidential campaign was the legal industry, whose donations came to more than $43 million. More than 80 percent of the money given to Congress by lawyers, mostly from the plaintiffs' bar, went to Democrats -- almost $22 million. As Howard Dean admitted at a town-hall meeting in Virginia, there is no tort reform in any of the Senate or House health-care bills because &quot;the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers. ... And that is the plain and simple truth.&quot; <a href="http://www.heritage.org/commentary/the-power-the-plaintiffs-bar-why-democrats-are-avoiding-medical-malpractice-reform-all" target="_blank">http://www.heritage.org/commentary/the-power-the-plaintiffs-bar-why-democrats-are-avoiding-medical-malpractice-reform-all</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems to be a mixed record from what I've seen. A lot of the cost is administering unneeded defensive medicine, which doesn't go away after tort reform as protocols become national in scope. On the other hand, malpractice insurance is often lower in states with reform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.</p>
<p>Lawyers, don't forget the lawyers.  Everyone sues anyone for anything in this country (USA).</p>
<p>Also, to those who believe the &quot;health care is rationed under socialized medicine&quot; argument, guess what?  It's rationed in America too.  The rationing is just done by economics, i.e. those who can afford it get it and of those who can't afford it themselves, just enough of them to keep society from completely destabilizing <em>do</em> receive socialized medicine, aka Medicare/Medicaid</p></div>		</li>
