<p>TV stations make money selling ads during the shows.  </p>

<p>A lot of the commercials you see on local channels actually air for free and the station gets paid if someone calls the number or goes to the URL on the commercial.  They're called Per Inquiries.  </p>
<p>If it's a major network station airing in a large market, they'll have very few Per Inquiries and almost all paid spots.  If it's not a major network and/or is broadcasting in a smaller market, they're almost all Per Inquiries.  </p>
<p>Also, syndicated shows come with commercials in them, so the TV station isn't making money on those.</p></div>		</li>
