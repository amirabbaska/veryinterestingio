			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good answer! I came to wonder alot about time and this seems very logical with &quot;moving through space-time&quot; at a constant speed. I just studied linear algebra and if I understand it right it means that ||&quot;space-time speed&quot;|| is the same, but we can move in different direction, and if we move faster the times go slower. And therefore the time is relative as well, right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I've never understood about the twin paradox (quack quack) - and the concept of space-time mote broadly -  how does that square with the idea that time is an illusion and a construct, that all things exist just in the &quot;perpetual now?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that time is not an illusion, but that instead time may be far more &quot;space-like&quot; than people think. The twin paradox proves that we have a speed that we move through time just like we have a speed that we move through space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually makes a ton of sense.</p>
<p>But I still remember something about Q.M. showing that all of time occurs simultaneously... Does that sound any kind of correct or accurate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible only for objects with zero mass, eg, photons.
It is impossible for say, humans in a spaceship to travel at the speed of light. This is what michaelthecoder was referring to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is could be explained by newton's first law: a body will keep its motion unless a force is applied and newton's second law: a body will change its velocity (speed) if a force is applied in the direction this force is applied.</p>
<p>If we assume that space is a complete vacuum we know that friction is non existent, if we apply a force on an object it will increase its velocity in the direction of the force. Since there will be no other force acting on it it will keep its velocity. If we would apply a constant force to this object without another one to counteract it, the object will keep speeding up.</p>
<p>Of course space is not a complete vacuum but close enough that friction can almost be neglected, only thing we need now is a force. The force needs to overcome friction to increase speed of the object, if we give this endless amount of time the object will approach a limit which is the speed of light.</p>
<p>If this is incorrect please inform me.</p></div>		</li>

<li>Assuming you're in a vaccuum doesn't work anytime you have an atmosphere. 2. What Force are you talking about? By principle a force needs the object to have mass, which photons don't have. There's a reason light speed can't be explained through Newtownian physics, it just doesn't work. </li>
