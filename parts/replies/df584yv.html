			<div class="markdown"><p>they do indeed - in Florida here there are giant limestone caverns filled with water under us. When the water table drops then we risk sinkholes, which are fortunately rare to newly open up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doctorate in relevant sciences here: They don't in the way those terms are usually used. Usually when people say &quot;underground river&quot; they actually think &quot;river in a subterranean tunnel&quot;. However most groundwater is just saturated soil or rock with enough holes (pores) for the water to flow through (sometimes very very slowly). In these cases the ground water often still flows to somewhere lower elevation, like to a surface river or the sea.</p>
<p>There are a few actual underground streams and pools, especially in limestone terrain. However, they're in relatively few regions, and accounts for very little groundwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's great bud.  But underground streams, and lakes are actually pretty common around the world.  Which is all that is being discussed in the comment you replied to.  It has nothing to do with the amount of water that makes up the groundwater.</p></div>		</li>
