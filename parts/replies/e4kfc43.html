			<div class="markdown"><p>One, super interesting thing to add here, not only are there massive anomalous blooms happening but the species composition of sargassum has changed. There are multiple species (or forms) of pelagic (free floating) sargassum and for the last 100 years (since we've been researching it) it's been primarily 2 species. These blooms, however, are made up almost entirely of a previously rare form and, again, nobody knows why.</p>
<p>This is my specific area of research so I'm super excited to have something I am an expert on to comment on. Happy to answer more questions if anyone has them! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. There are several cultures that do have preparation methods for sargassum but due to its bitter taste, the preparation method involves the use of sugars and hard sauces.</p>
<p>In essence, although its technically edible (as in you wont die from eating it), its not enjoyable and the only way to make it enjoyable might not be worth the effort to eat it in the first place. </p>
<p>I guess you could use it as compost though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow this is my specific area of research so for once I can answer!</p>
<p>Sargassum isn't really edible at all. In fact, even most of the fauna that live on it while it's floating out in the ocean don't eat it but rather use it as a physical habitat. Some communities have used it as fertilizer while others have used it to shore up dunes but in areas of inundation, there's too much for even that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any estimates of <em>how</em> beneficial Sargassum is to the ecosystem?
I read conflicting accounts of whether it is a source of food for fish or just shelter.  How many tons of fish might be swimming below those new Sargassum 'meadows'? I think of the new blooms as big boon to the ocean (and a bane to tourism). Is that a sound hope?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No but it provides a floating mid ocean structure for fish that are edible. If you are offshore trolling and come across patches you circle them because the bait the offer protection to attracts the game fish you are after. Mahi Mahi especially can be found here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sargassum, as in the Wide Sargasso Sea?</p>
<p>Just speculating, but maybe increased carbon content in the ocean is beneficial; high temperatures impede photosynthesis, but perhaps slight increases can be beneficial?</p>
<p>Agricultural runoff and changes in oceans currents induced by global warming could possibly be involved as well, or even changes in the jet stream.</p></div>		</li>
