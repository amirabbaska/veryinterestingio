<p>We often look at a person's overall body shape to quickly judge how they will hold up. I can totally see myself favoeing the odds of the one with narrow waist and wide hips given two females of equal BMI. </p>
<p>Given all the health stuff like resilience to stress and stuff I wonder about how much of it is because of the attractiveness. Cuz it's easier to be pretty, you know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry for being an idiot, but isn't a low ratio something like 4:5 and a high ratio something like 2:5? Wouldn't that mean that more slender women (non hourglass) are considered more attractive? I feel like I'm wrong as hell so please correct me.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Hey thanks a lot guys. I knew I was getting something fundamentally wrong. I thought ratios worked as though 2:5 is a high difference and 4:5 is a low difference. No idea where that came from or when I figured that out. I appreciate the help!</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you got it backwards, hourglass figure means <strong>low</strong> WHR, which means good health, high fertility and atractiveness. </p>
<p>2/5 = 0.4 &lt; 0.8 = 4/5</p>
<p>2/5 is low ratio</p>
<p>4/5 is high ratio</p>
<p>See wikipedia for further reference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ratios are just fractions so the&quot;highest ratio&quot; means the fraction that represents the highest number. 4/5 is larger than 2/5 so the ratio is higher. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ratios are easiest to compare when normalized by the first number.  If you re-write 2:5 as 4:10 (which is mathematically the same) then you can more easily compare and see why 4:5 is a lower ratio than 4:10.</p></div>		</li>
