			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, cellular machinery is <em>highly optimized</em> to transcribe DNA into RNA, that's the core step of gene expression. An RNA virus can do <em>one</em> RNA to DNA insertion then have the cell just churn out RNA like a factory quite easily producing hojillions of copies of viruses per cell. In contrast, DNA copying is a much more laborious and cumbersome step in cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&gt; cellular machinery is <em>designed</em>  </p>
<p>If we're going to shun the words 'point' or 'purpose' we should probably avoid 'designed' as well.  </p>
<p><em>edit</em> 'highly optimized' is a great way to put it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m ok with <em>design</em>. Though it may imply an intelligence it doesn’t require one; simply a purpose. Cellular machinery is purposed to, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, RNA is less stable than DNA and therefore offers the organism more genetic variability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. Reverse transcription has low fidelity, which introduces the variability. Low RNA stability really just means it is targeted by RNAases, which are abundant in the cell, leading to rapid destruction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there's issues with this explanation and it's more complicated than that. for example, DNA is more stable than RNA, meaning that the virus might not get the chance to properly integrate into the cell because it's destroyed more easily. </p></div>		</li>
