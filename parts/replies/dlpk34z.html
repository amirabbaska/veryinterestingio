			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a similar method for asking yes/no questions:</p>
<p>The surveyees are asked, for instance, whether they've had extramarital affairs. If they have, they  answer yes. If not, they flip a coin and answer no or yes for heads and tails respectively. It's impossible to tell whether a single person has had an extramarital affair or flipped the coin and it landed tails, but it's easy to estimate the overall proportion, multiplying the number of no's by 2 (because there's 50% chance for either outcome) and dividing by the total number of answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you see a positive answer (it doesn't need to be &quot;yes&quot;, for the respondent's comfort it might be a colored square), you can't tell whether they've had an extramarital affair, or haven't had but flipped the coin and it landed tails â€“ that's why we need a neutral random event with known probability to add &quot;noise&quot; to that otherwise embarassing information.</p>
<p>Of course people may still be reluctant and the overall outcome may be a little biased towards &quot;no&quot;; you can read elsewhere in this thread how pollsters deal with this problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called a &quot;list experiment&quot; by the way. It unfortunately means you can't link individual-level variables to the behavior or opinion you're trying to measure for (you can only get the average number of people in the population who engage in the stigmatized behavior.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, that tells you the share of respondents who have have done the fifth thing AND not the four things.  To infer how many people have done only the fifth thing requires assumptions, like &quot;different forms of drug use are independent&quot;, which is an invalid assumption.  With a large amount of surveys with many different sets of drugs, you could get the correct answer, but it might take a lot of surveys.  </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not sure what you mean here. The answers to the first four items difference out, given a large enough sample size. So suppose the mean in the first group is 3. If you'd only ask the same four items to the second group, you'd expect a mean of 3 there too. If the mean you find is 3.1, that 0.1 difference must be caused by the introduction of the fifth item. Prevalence is thus 10% The answers to the first 4 items do not matter (theoretically).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you drink coffee or tea, but tea drinking is stigmatized (nobody likely limeys) while coffee is not.   </p>
<p>I ask &quot;do you drink coffee&quot;.  50% say yes.  Then I ask &quot;do you drink coffee or tea&quot;.  60% say yes.  </p>
<p>How many people drink tea?  Well, suppose that everyone who drinks coffee also drinks tea (that is completely possible).  Then 60% drink tea.  Now suppose that nobody who drinks tea also drinks coffee.  Then 10 percent drink tea.  Now suppose that tea consumption and coffee consumption are uncorrelated.  Then 20 percent drink tea.  </p>
<p>If you only ask these two questions, then you need to make very strong assumptions about the joint distribution of tea and coffee consumption if you are to infer true rates of tea consumption. </p>
<p>Is that clear?  </p>
<p>I should add that the above explanation indicates how you can bound the correct answer (Manski bounds).  If coffee consumption is rare, then you know that the true rate of tea consumption will be in a narrow range.  For example, if only 2 percent of respondents drink coffee and 10 percent drink tea or coffee, then between 8 and 10 percent drink tea.   </p></div>		</li>
