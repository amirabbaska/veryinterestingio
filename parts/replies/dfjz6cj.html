			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the orbital velocity of the moon is just above 1000m/s i would say somthing below that. It's pretty Quick in human scale. But the ISS flyes around at 7000m/s so</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's roughly the speed of a 5.56 mm rifle round (depending on the rifle), so I'd say it qualifies as very quick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have said &quot;subsonic&quot; rather than &quot;low speed&quot;. This, and a large smaller-to-larger moon size ratio is what led to a &quot;pancake&quot; rather than a crater, according to the study.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that the far side is hit a lot more. It could easily have experienced the same phenomena that created the nearside lowlands. They've just been erased from the far side due to substantially more impacts.</p>
<p>From an impact crater perspective, this question seems based on a misunderstanding because the far side of the moon definitely has more and larger craters.</p></div>		</li>
