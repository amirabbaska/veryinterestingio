			<div class="markdown"><p>The gravity from a huge object such as a galaxy will bend the path of light, acting like a lens to focus the light from a more distant object and allowing us to see it at a greater distance than we would be able to otherwise.</p>
<p>It does not make a nice, even lens, however, so the image we get of the more distant object is smeared and distorted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The dimple in spacetime (that we call gravity)  caused by the mass of the galaxy bends light behind it allowing us to calculate some features of the galaxy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a lens both COLLECTS and bends light rays. Just as a magnifying glass can make normally safe sunlight into a focus which can burn, by taking all of the light collected by the area of the lens and focusing into a much smaller area, increasing its effective intensity. Well, it turns out gravity can also bend light and produce a similar effect to a lens. A larger area of light ( now the size of a star or other galaxy) can collect some disperse rays of light from an object behind it or close to it from our perspective and focus them a bit more down onto an earth sized scale, if the positions happen to be right. This is why its called gravitational lensing, the gravity of some massive foreground object is creating a light collection and bending region for all objects positioned behind it from our perspective. Since just like the magnifying glass, light from very far away and/or faint objects can now be observed due to the lensing effect, whereas they might have been too faint to see before.</p></div>		</li>
