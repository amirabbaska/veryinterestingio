			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is wrong.  Capacitors are a huge factor in why we restart things after 30 seconds.  While an instant reboot is enough to trigger software resets, there are still circuits on the board that never lost their charge, so they will be in an unknown, and possibly faulty, state.  Routers and gadgets like them aren't just a computer.  They are a collection of custom chipsets with a very specific purpose, so the 30 seconds ensure the entire set goes back to a known state.</p>
<p>Of course there are still issues with ISP timeouts and things like that, but the main reason is hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is totally wrong. Capacitors are the reason for the 30 seconds. The capacitors may discharge faster than that so you could get away with say 20 seconds. Not all capacitors are the same so the 30 seconds is just accepted as a general rule of thumb. This can be observed with Xbox power bricks and PC power supplies that have an external LED. Unplug it from the wall and watch the LED stay on for a few seconds.</p></div>		</li>
