			<div class="markdown"><p>perfectly?  no.    close <em>enough</em> yes.   </p>
<p>there's a <em>lot</em> of image processing going on..  And the field of view that's being photographed is pretty small by comparison, AND the exposure is pretty long....</p>
<p>from what i'm told the final image you get is the result of several shots taken in succession.  so whilst it appears to be &quot;real time&quot;, there's quite a bit of process lag, and some of the finer details get lost..  which is why they take a LOT of exposures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do some astrophotography and can pitch in here. You're right. We take multiple exposures of the object and &quot;stack&quot; them together to increase the signal to noise ratio. Not sure if these professional telescope images work differently but it would be unsurprising if they used the same/similar tactics </p></div>		</li>

<p>So what you're saying is... Zoom and enhance <em>is real</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not image processing..... It's using deformable mirrors...</p></div>		</li>

<p>E.g. put one north of the laser, one east, combine the input from the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The laser is mainly reflected by the upper atmosphere, above the atmospheric perturbations. It appears like a star to the telescope, and you can measure the full distortion with it (with a 2D sensor at the telescope). You can get better results with more than one laser guide star but if you are interested in a small region of the sky only a single one is sufficient.</p></div>		</li>
