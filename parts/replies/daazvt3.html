			<div class="markdown"><p>your portable CD player isn't a problem.  the problem is electronic devices like cell phones that broadcast and transmit wireless signals. The cell phone signal can interfere with flight electronics.  See the other thread up now explaining that.  Your CD player doesn't broadcast wireless signals so its not affecting anything.</p></div>		</li>

<p>1) Plenty (untold numbers) of people have flown with their electronic devices, (including phones) on and running. I've seen numerous reports of people actually talking on their phones during takeoff/landing, only pausing to hide their phone when the flight attendant comes by.  None of these cases has ever resulted in a crash. Ever.</p>
<p>2) If my little $100 flip-phone can cause a multi-million dollar plane to crash, well... then there's something seriously wrong with how they build that plane. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Phones <em>can</em> interfere with electronics, though - you might've noticed interference in headphones or other devices when a phone call goes through. It can be shielded, as they are in most large aircraft, and typically isn't a problem (you'll notice some pilots on that thread describe it first-hand) but it's still a risk. There are some pretty serious accidents due to faulty or incomplete communication between planes and ATC, so having a signal drown out or cut off an important message could be deadly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The main reasons they don't allow active cell phones on aircraft are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The same reason many airlines don't have a row with the number 13. It's a non-problem, but it makes people nervous.</p>
</li>
<li>On lower altitudes, the cellphones will connect to a large number of base stations, and switch between them rapidly, causing a large load on the mobile network. Nowadays, many aircraft have their own base station, for improved service, and then transmits all the phone traffic to the gorund through one channel, so it's less of a problem.</li>

<p>It's also so your phone, laptop, whatever doesn't become a projectile in case of a crash.</p></div>		</li>
