<p>I don't even work second or third shift, but my room is still. Covered in layers of blackout curtains. There's almost no perceptible light difference between midnight and noon in my bedroom. </p>
<p>So I argue this doesn't truly pertain to sleeping between two sets of time periods. It's more sleeping under specific lighting conditions. I could also just as easily sleep 10 pm to 6 am under a tanning light and see the same effects you're describing.  </p>
<p>As for being awake through artificial light though, wouldn't anyone working the same job be exposed to the same artificial light regardless? Everywhere I've ever been that's open 24 hours has all the same lights on at 2 am and 2 pm. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not convinced that's the case. In the absence of any light exposure at all, humans drift towards closer to a 25 hour cycle. Can you back up the point you're making with evidence, that effects of different sleep/wake times depend on exposure to UV light in one's sleeping location?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it isn't the lack of any light exposure. It's the lack of light exposure <em>while sleeping</em> and getting light exposure while awake. The blackout curtained room would only be occupied during sleep, not all the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So do people that live near the Artic have an increased risk of cancer since they sleep during the day for months at a time?  </p>
<p>Or is this more about the typical behavior exhibited by night time workers: less sleep overall, less healthy food choices, long shift jobs.  Also these in turn are linked to either high stress professions (e.g. nurses, 911) or low income positions (e.g. stocker).  And iirc the position/class typically causes the bad choices, not the inverse...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I would like to read up the paper. I can definitely see the correlation between people who work nights being more prone to  cancer. But that could have multiple factors - stressful work, lesser pay, reduced social life, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is panicking about a <em>Reddit
comment</em> that cites zero sources. When was this thesis written? How many sources did they cite? Were these quality scientific sources or pop science sources? If they cite studies, how reliable are these studies? Also, a college thesis is not the same as a strong study backed up by research and published by an expert in the field. This &quot;cancer bc you go to bed late&quot; might be a legit concern but one citation-free paragraph should not be freaking people out. Source: am an academic librarian and I try to teach people to think critically before believing claims such as this one. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Those claims definitely don't pass the smell test, I will have to invoke [<em>citation needed</em>]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in an area that has this, endlessly dark days and sometimes continually bright nights, and I've never heard of an increased risk of cancer due to it, but it sounds plausible.</p>
<p>Also I work in the emergency services, so my chances aren't seeming to good based on these posts...</p></div>		</li>
