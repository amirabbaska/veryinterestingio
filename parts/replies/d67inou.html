<p>Great answer but I think there is one very large and noteworthy &quot;exception&quot; that should be included for the sake of having a complete answer to OP's question - the equator.  </p>
<p>Since the Coriolis Effect is absent on the equator, equatorial currents tend to diverge poleward and that divergence causes the equatorial surface water to be replaced by nutrient-rich deep water.  The process is called &quot;equatorial upwelling.&quot;  And given the intense insolation on the equator coupled with an abundance of nutrients, the fairly narrow, thin band of the ocean located on the equator is one of the most biologically productive regions on earth rivaling that of shallow estuaries and tropical rain forests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little confused, is the Coriolis Effect only about things moving to the most outward position and it is absent because it already is most outward? Is this somehow simplified and only looking at earth's 2d surface? Because the way I understood it the Coriolis Effect should be the strongest on the equator because it's rotating the fastest and should spin sediments directly upwards?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the Coriolis Effect gets stronger near the poles and weaker near the equator and is non-existent along any line of latitude, the equator or otherwise.  </p>
<p>CE occurs because (1) Newton's 1st Law of Motion requires that objects retain their initial momentum when a new and not opposite force is applied and (2) there is a difference in speed from latitude to latitude due to constant rate of rotation for unequal distances. </p>
<p>The reason the effect increases as you move poleward is because <del>the earth is not spherical.  Rather, it is more properly termed an <em>oblate spheroid,</em>  kind of smushed from the top/bottom and therefore bulging a bit (about 42 km) at the equator.  Essentially, that means that the rate of curvature, and hence the rate at which the speed of rotation is changing, increases poleward.  I don't know how to ELI5 that last bit but if you need clarification, I'm happy to help out if I can.</del>  edit: see /u/quadrahelix's clarification below!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer but why it is that it seems like the opposite it true?  I feel like I see tropical waters teaming with such diverse life. There's plenty out in the cold water too as I think that's where most of our fish come from and now I'm realizing relative to how much life is in cold water there's no comparison. And now I've answered my own question but I'm going to submitted this anyway. </p></div>		</li>
