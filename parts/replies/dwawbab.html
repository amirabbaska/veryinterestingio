			<div class="markdown"><p>So the &quot;Calories&quot; you think of from food are actually kilocalories.  If you consider drinking a glass of ice water at 0^(o)C, and noting that a calorie (little c) is the amount of energy it takes to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius, the math works out:</p>
<p>16oz of water = 473.18 grams*37 degrees (raising from 0^(o)C -&gt; 37^(o)C = 17,508 calories = 17.5 kilocalories.  </p>
<p>So you burn 17.5 Calories* drinking 16oz of ice water over body-temperature water.  So while this effect is small, it isn't zero!  That shit can add up!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It is convention to use capital-C Calories to denote a kilocalorie.  Thanks to /u/TheExplicit for catching the error!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well think of it this way. 8fl oz is 237 mL which is 237 g of water. 2째 C needs to be heated to 37째C. 1 calorie is the energy required to raises 1 gram of water 1째C. 237*35=8,235 calories. The calories we refer to in our diet is actually a kilocalorie, or 1000 calories. So you theoretically burn about 8 calories by drinking an 8 oz glass of ice water.</p>
<p>Probably not too significant, and of course I'm not saying anything about physiology here, just doing a bit of math. </p></div>		</li>
