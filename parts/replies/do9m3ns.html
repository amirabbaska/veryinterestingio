			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive a smart car and one of my rims is dinged (bent). It holds and and has lasted over 4000 miles without any issues but it does lose air regularly. (I.e. I fill my tire every 7-10 days because the light comes on). I've thought about getting it fixed but the tire place wanted $60 to send it to their guy to straighten it. It's aluminum alloy and for a used replacement it wouldn't be much more than that. </p>
<p>What's the best option I have?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd replace it altogether. Go online and look around. Search &quot;2010 Smart Fortwo OEM wheel&quot; (or whatever year/model you have) and get an idea of the price. Then call a shop and see what they would charge you to order a new one and install. Then find out what they would charge to mount and balance your old tire on a new wheel that you brought in (one you found yourself online).</p>
<p>Generally that's your cheapest option for replacing a wheel and I would recommend replacing the wheel over getting it repaired. It would be different if you were on 1000 dollar wheels, but I doubt a replacement smart car wheel is going to run you more than 100-150 USD.</p>
<p>Edit: that 100-150 is for a new wheel, if you're comfortable buying used you could find one a lot cheaper. Then, like I said, you'd just be paying a shop to mount/balance your old tire and transfer over your TPMS sensors. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scrolled through looking for this answer. I've been driving up to the mountains regularly each weekend. I would get a &quot;low pressure warning&quot; when I would get up there, but it would go away when I got back to town. </p>
<p>Until it didn't go away. I was curious if each time I drove up and back if I had lost a little pressure at a time until I reached the threshold that threw the sensor. </p></div>		</li>
