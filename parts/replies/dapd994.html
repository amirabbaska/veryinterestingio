			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a similar thing with the Y2K problem (teenagers, you can google that).</p>
<p>Hundreds of billions of dollars were spent over a period of several years to prepare systems for the event, and afterwards, when the date passed without any headline-grabbing system crashes, a lot of technologically impaired people claimed that it the whole thing had been some kind of hoax or a media fluff piece.</p>
<p>People in general don't appreciate the hard work of experts when they weren't directly affected by whatever problem those experts solved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Crazy, how even with the internet and  access to information so easily, people are still trapped in a bubble of false information now.  </p>
<p>Like use some critical thinking people.  There's a ton of shit that goes on in the world out there, just because you stopped seeing shitty posts on your facebook timeline doesn't mean that it stopped existing.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why, but critical thinking seems to be in short supply among the general public. I'm a nurse, so critical thinking is vital to my livelihood and developing it was a big component of my education. It takes practice to utilize it properly but once you're used to it, it's a little difficult to not apply it to everything...</p>
<p>So while I can see why some people might not have a honed sense of critical thinking, it's pretty awful that most people don't even try to consider a deeper meaning or different perspective in a situation (when often just a shred of critical thinking would more simply and quickly resolve the issue). </p>
<p>Can I tell you how discouraging it is to see new nurses coming into the field with a complete lack of critical thinking and who never do a thing to work on the skill? It's more &quot;bang your head against the wall&quot;-worthy than one might think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The conspiracies weren't &quot;Ebola isn't real&quot; the conspiracies were &quot;why did the news drop it so early&quot;, the knee jerk reaction when the news stops reporting something so important so quickly is &quot;what were they hiding&quot; and it's perfectly natural to be skeptic of others intentions</p></div>		</li>
