To insulate  against radiation you need a reflective  material that redirects the IR back to the object instead of absorbing it. This is why thermos flasks have mirrored interiors.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Not necessarily, the blanket will absorb your radiation, and thus heat up, slowing the rate at which the air that you've heated loses energy to the blanket, and the blanket will re-emit some of that back towards you, as well. <br><br>The <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/emissivity-coefficients-d_447.html" target="_blank">emissivity of cotton is 0.77</a>, the emissivity of <a href="http://www.thermoworks.com/emissivity_table.html" target="_blank">human skin is 0.98</a>. So even if the surface of the blanket did heat up to the same temperature as your skin, you would still be losing less energy to your surroundings through radiation than you would be without the blanket. </p>		</li>

			<p>This is incorrect, generally. Reflective surfaces are used in combination with transparent insulators (such as the air/vacuum in a thermos flask), but make no difference if the insulator is not transparent, such as a blanket. See also Pseudoboss11's reply. </p>		</li>

			<p>Sure thing! You can measure the rate of heat lost from a surface using a value called the heat transfer coefficient. This value is used to characterize convection. Natural convection has a value of 5 W/(m^(2)-K), while forced convection from something like air blowing on you would be around 30 W/(m^(2)-K). (The units here aren't terribly important, just know that a higher convective coefficient means heat is lost more rapidly.) Radiation doesn't typically use these coefficients, but you can easily determine an effective heat transfer coefficient. At room temperature, this effective coefficient is about 6-7 W/(m^(2)-K). So it's actually very comparable to natural convection. The reason you hear radiation isn't significant is because people normally compare it to forced convection. In that case, it probably doesn't matter. But when you're talking about hot food that's just sitting out, it can definitely play a major role in heat loss.<br><br>Edit: Formatting</p>		</li>

			<p>I think multiple layers would actually be less efficient of an insulator than one very thick layer. The unsealed gap between layers allows air to mix. <br><br>Layers are great because the amount of insulation can be customised to the environment (you can take one off if it gets too hot), and the material characteristics can be different (like sweat wicking base layer and wind blocking outer shell). </p>		</li>

			<p>I guess it's sort of semantics at this point, but it's not really trapping heat, it's trapping air.  Heat (in a thermodynamic sense) is energy, and the heat in this scenario is contained within the air.  The blanket isn't trapping that energy, it's trapping the air that contains the energy.<br><br>It's technically incorrect to say that it's trapping heat because they work equally well with cold air, in which case it'd be trapping a &quot;lack of heat&quot;, so to speak.</p>		</li>

			<p>I mean, if we're going to talk semantics, just because it also traps &quot;lack of heat&quot; doesn't mean that it <em>doesn't</em> trap heat as well. Trapping &quot;lack of heat&quot; is really the same thing as trapping &quot;presence of heat&quot; - the blanket impedes heat transfer across its boundary and thus reduces the rate at which the inside of the blanket and outside are driven to thermal equilibrium. Whether or not it keeps something hot or cold is a matter of which side you take to be &quot;inside&quot; versus &quot;outside&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>All of the answers are correct! When speaking about convection, the mechanism by which a blanket works is by trapping air (Which I would agree in this instance is different from trapping heat. If you had a metal blanket or something, then you would say it is still good at trapping air, but it would obviously be bad at trapping heat). When speaking of conduction, we are specifically referring to the ability to prevent heat transfer, so a blanket also does manage to trap heat (and I would also agree that trapping heat means the same thing as trapping cold because it simply refers to the energy present in the system).</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, I just wanted to emphasize that it prevents heat transfer, both convective and conductive.<br><br>I can't say that I agree that preventing the flow of warm air (ie convective transfer) isn't <em>also</em> trapping heat... the effect is ultimately still that heat transfer is impeded.

			<p>I have no idea what those blankets are like, but yes I am saying it would be bad at trapping heat because the material is a good conductor. If the blankets you're talking about can keep a person warm they probably aren't great conductors. And about to talk out of my ass here, but in these examples, I would say that preventing convection is much more important for regulating temperature than  conduction is. So even if those blankets were good conductors, I think that effect is far outweighed by them preventing convection.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes that was my point actually. A blanket prevents heat transfer, whether it is keeping things hot or cold depends on how you define it. To me, &quot;trapping&quot; heat means that it impedes the system reaching equilibrium, such that there is a difference in heat across the boundary. Which side you look at defines whether you think of it as trapping heat or lack of heat... both are complementary non-equilibrium states (in a closed system).<br><br>It is both keeping heat from entering one side and from exiting the other.</p>		</li>
