<p>No the blanket mostly absorbs the IR thereby taking heat away from the object. To insulate  against radiation you need a reflective  material that redirects the IR back to the object instead of absorbing it. This is why thermos flasks have mirrored interiors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think multiple layers would actually be less efficient of an insulator than one very thick layer. The unsealed gap between layers allows air to mix. </p>
<p>Layers are great because the amount of insulation can be customised to the environment (you can take one off if it gets too hot), and the material characteristics can be different (like sweat wicking base layer and wind blocking outer shell). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it's sort of semantics at this point, but it's not really trapping heat, it's trapping air.  Heat (in a thermodynamic sense) is energy, and the heat in this scenario is contained within the air.  The blanket isn't trapping that energy, it's trapping the air that contains the energy.</p>
<p>It's technically incorrect to say that it's trapping heat because they work equally well with cold air, in which case it'd be trapping a &quot;lack of heat&quot;, so to speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if we're going to talk semantics, just because it also traps &quot;lack of heat&quot; doesn't mean that it <em>doesn't</em> trap heat as well. Trapping &quot;lack of heat&quot; is really the same thing as trapping &quot;presence of heat&quot; - the blanket impedes heat transfer across its boundary and thus reduces the rate at which the inside of the blanket and outside are driven to thermal equilibrium. Whether or not it keeps something hot or cold is a matter of which side you take to be &quot;inside&quot; versus &quot;outside&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trapping heat is exactly the removal or restriction of thermal transfer. It perfectly correct to say that a blanket traps heat because the blanket restricts convection and conduction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>i posted a q on /r/askscience a month or two back asking if we could consistently define things (physics) in terms of cold rather than heat.  unfortunately no-one answered.  it seems to me like you'd just need to flip a sign in various places and thermodynamics should work out ok, but radiative transfer seems odd...</p>
<p>however, i didn't think about it too much.  absolute zero is weird, but i am not sure it's a problem.</p></div>		</li>

You might be better off just not using covers depending on the length of time you will be under them.</p></div>		</li>
