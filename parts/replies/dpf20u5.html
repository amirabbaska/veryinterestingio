			<div class="markdown"><p>The big bang didn't take place in any direction.. the big bang took place in all directions. It's hard to visualize, because we think of an explosion starting at a point and expanding out. That's not how the big bang was. Everything is expanding from everything else on a big enough scale because it's not so much expanding (even though I just used that word) as it is stretching. If you worked out a fixed point from where it was stretching out, you would find it is whatever fixed point you are measuring from. Whether it's here, or in a galaxy a billion light years away, the measurements for where the center point is in terms of space expanding was where you took the measurement (at a big enough scale)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a 12 inch ruler made of rubber. Stretch it out so its twice as long as it was. If you were at number 0. Then you would see that number 1 is now two inches (an increase of 1) away from you. Number 2 is now 4 inches away from you (an increase of 2) and Number 12 is 24 inches away from you (an increase of 12). Everywhere is getting further away from you, and the further away things are accelerating faster. You must be at the centre of the universe where everything is expanding from. </p>
<p>But what would you see if you were at number 6?  Numbers 5 and 7 were one inch away and now they're two. Numbers 8 and 4 were two inches away and now they're four. Everywhere is getting further away from you, and the further away things are accelerating faster. You must be at the centre of the universe where everything is expanding from.</p>
<p>And the same is true for any point in the universe. The universe isn't expanding out from a point, it's <em>all</em> expanding. And if you rewind it backward you'll see the Big Bang happened <em>everywhere.</em></p></div>		</li>
