<p>It goes down to shorter wavelengths (1mm) as well, though those radio waves can also be called microwaves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would pass some of it but a lot of it would get reflected, so it would be like a house of mirrors. When there is a change in the material that's much smaller than a wavelength, there's a tendency for reflection (as opposed to bending)</p>
<p>This is why a dirty mirror doesn't reflect visible light well: That thin layer of dust creates a gradual impedance change that is much thicker than a wavelength. Also, the rainbow effect of oil on water: when the oil is just the right thickness it will reflect blue, but not red. At a thicker part of the slick, the reverse is true.</p></div>		</li>
