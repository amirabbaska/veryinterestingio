			<div class="markdown"><p>My allergist told me that hormones can cause allergies to change. I developed a LOT of new allergies between 18-21 including food allergies which I'd never had before. That's the age that all those pubescent hormones settle down. She also (correctly) guessed that there might be changes again when I got pregnant so we were watching carefully. For 9 months, my fish reactions decreased to the point where I didn't even react when I accidentally took vitamins containing fish oil. A reaction to vegetarian sushi rolls a couple weeks post-partum made it clear that it wasn't permanent.</p></div>		</li>
