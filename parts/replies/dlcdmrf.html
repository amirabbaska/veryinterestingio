			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;This is labeled as 2016. It is out of spec, since the current year reads 2044. Per state and federal regulations, we can not use out of spec parts.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Poor, no.  A competent engineer would not certify that a calendar would be again usable after 28 years of unknown storage conditions and potential intermediate use-cases (e.g. coaster).</p>
<p>Besides, without user modification (which would obviously void the warranty) the calendar would still read &quot;2016&quot; and therefore would continually report the incorrect year if reuse were attempted.  It would therefore most certainly not be fundamentally equivalent.  :p</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Who said anything about certifying anything? The question is, how many years will it be before my 2016 calendar <strong>can</strong> be used again. Proper storage of the calendar is the asker's responsibility. It was a mere request for information, not a binding contract.</p>
<p>edit: Plus, warranty? Who has a calendar warranty? And besides, there are non-permanent ways to identify something. Post it notes anyone?</p>
<p>edit 2: Also, what is the fundamental use of a calendar? To tell me the year? A calendar with no year is much more useful than a calendar with no days. That's why i said fundamentally equivalent. You cited details, not fundaments</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's better than the over-engineer's answer: <strong>Each character is comprised of many sub-character segments which are combined into intricate and fundamentally recognizable parent shapes that again are used for larger and larger combinations with the sole purpose of conveying a rigid table of alloted times in a cyclical repetition of familiar yet different events. Well make them all different so people have to buy a new one each year. </strong></p></div>		</li>
