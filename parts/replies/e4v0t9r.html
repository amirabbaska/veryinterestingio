			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe for him but most military is like this. It's because you get worked to death. For me, waking up at 5:30am then going for a 5 mile run, then going back into work after breakfast to work for 8 hours. It is very tiring and you will just passout most of the time. </p>
<p>Lastly, when you are on duty or assignments like out in the field, you usually get shitty sleep overall so you are always tired. When you finally have a chance to relax then you have no choice but to fall asleep. </p></div>		</li>
