			<div class="markdown"><p>i recently read an autobiography written by a wwe ref that was really interesting.  It turns out there's a bit more to it than you'd think.  The ref's have earpieces connected to the backstage (ie vince mchmahon and company) and are responsible for relaying real time information to the wrestlers from the bosses.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Referees are often a really important part of a match.  A good ref you won't notice, but a bad one you will.  They do a lot of things like holding the blade, relaying spots, commercial cues, and can communicate with people in the gorilla position if something needs to be changed.  They also know exactly how long the match should be and when to take it home.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you make very good points.  In jimmy's book he says the best compliment he could get from a fan was &quot;oh, I didn't know you were in that match&quot;</p>
<p>Since you mentioned the gorilla position it reminded me of bobby heenan's autobiography.  In it he says working commentary with Gorilla Monsoon was the best part of his entire career.  I'd recommend heenan's book to anyone, not just wrestling fans, it's hilarious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Referees are SUPER important. The wrestlers need to know at what point of the match to do specific spots, and that comes from the back via earpiece, or from the ref gauging the crowd's reaction. They keep the whole ship afloat in clusterfuck matches like a battle royal, they patch a wrestler up who's legitimately bleeding too much, and they add to the drama. There's a huge difference in crowd satisfaction between a roll up and a swift three count, and a drawn out three count after a grueling battle.</p>
<p>I really want a behind the scenes documentary about them, but I guess it's not possible because although the WWE are flirting with kayfabe being dead, they're not ready to (quite literally) expose the man behind the curtain just yet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wouldn't call pro wrestling a sport. It's more of a performance art.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's every bit of a sport as other activities that get the &quot;sport&quot; label. I mean, is figure skating a sport?  What about gymnastics?</p>
<p>You could easily have a row of judges giving a score to groups of two wrestlers on how realistic of a match they were able to put on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I consider a &quot;sport&quot; anything with a consistent rule set where you try to get the most out of the human body's physical limitations.</p>
<p>Figure skating is physically taxing, so is gymnastics. Theatrical performance on the other hand, is not.</p></div>		</li>
