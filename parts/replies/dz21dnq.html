Bible literalists are very loud about their beliefs, and their beliefs are very important to them, evolution fundamentally clashes with their beliefs. Denominations that accept evolution, evolution doesn’t clash with their beliefs so they are indifferent to it and have no reason to vocally support the same way literalists would.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm a member and staff at a famous Evangelical church and I take much of the Bible literally, but only the parts that seem to be intended to be taken literally, which is not all of it. The part that conflicts with evolution is Genesis 1 and 2, which to me is clearly not meant to be taken literally as the chapters contradict themselves about the timeline, but also for other reasons I don't need to get into in detail here as it's easily found with Google.</p>
<p>But yeah my dad is a full literalist who believes the scientific community is pushing evolution as a conspiracy to discredit Christianity even though they know it's false, which in my mind takes far more faith to believe in than Jesus Resurrection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The strong disagreement with evolution is among Young Earth creationism ie a world created by god that is less then 10 000 year ago from a literal reading of the bible. Their belief in incompatible with evolution and a lot of other sciences like geology, cosmology to name a few.</p>

<p>This is the one thing that I don't understand with churches (being someone that grew up being forced to go) isn't this 10 000 being taken from Psalms where it says a day for god is like a thousand years for us?</p>
<p>But Psalms is a book of poetry and songs right? So why is it taken literally?</p>
<p>The way I see it, majority of stuff in the old testament be it rules or stories, are like a parent trying to teach their children using easy to understand examples, rather than actually being literal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 10000 is mostly based on adding up lineages. If you add up the ages of sequential Biblical figures, you get around 6000 years since God created the universe. How they get from 6000 to 10000 is a mystery (an excuse to say &quot;we're not as crazy as THOSE fundamentalists&quot; maybe?). It's definitely not a poetic interpretation. It's purely arithmetic.</p>
<p>You will find that to any particular reader of the Bible, anything can be taken as a historical account, a prophecy, a parable, or poetry <em>based on whatever they're trying to demonstrate.</em> Most of the verses you find Evangelists using as evidence that the Old Testament prophecised Jesus are actually talking about things that <em>already happened in the past</em> quite explicitly. When you call them on it by pointing out the verse is historical, not a prediction, they will come up with an excuse about how it was an allusion to what was gonna happen in the future so it's still prophetic.</p>
<p>I mean, even the New Testament writers did this. Matthew read the prophecy that Jesus would ride into town on two donkeys (a misreading of the source he got his story from, as he was certainly not an eye witness), so he just wrote the story as &quot;Jesus rode into town on two donkeys&quot; without explaining what that even means or how it's possible to ride two donkeys at once -- a story that isn't present in any of the other writings. He was not concerned with writing a true accounting of the events. His only goal was to prove Jesus fulfilled a prophecy. So he wrote the story exactly as he believed it was prophecised, which was not only incorrect but incomprehensible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about Daniel in the OT, right? Brilliant little book, written during the reign of Antiochus (Seleucids/Greeks), ~500 years after the time it alleges to have originated in. Its &quot;prophesies&quot; are thinly veiled metaphors for the (very real and historically documented) rise and fall of various regional powers, culminating in the death of Antiochus. We can date the book because its predictions for Antiochus' death and a war is inaccurate! </p>
<p>The book of Daniel answers a question very important at the time: how do you practice your culture and religion under a hostile regime? Here, the practice outlined is to make the body itself a temple, to move away from channeling divinity through external objects and towards integrating religious practice as a ritual of the mind. Daniel marks this very seminal moment when the Abrahamic faith started prioritizing the internal life and practice of its followers over anything else.</p>
<p>In terms of structure, it's a double chiasm, which is a literary structure analogous to palindromic words, with a reverse parallelism. Two of them! And what gets lost on modern readers is that the chiams are in different languages, a great nod to the fact that the whole book is a text within a text. The inner text would be contemporaneously legible to those familiar with the history of their homeland and cultural traditions, but the guise of historical fiction provided cover. </p>
<p>tl;dr these books are so much more fascinating when read with historical context and good literary scholarship rather than interpreted as historical truth. Modern readers of Daniel, I think, tend to assume that their understanding of texts (as serving certain technical, cultural, and social functions, and as having to be read in light of these functions) are universal, which detracts from the bible so much.</p></div>		</li>

That said, it's within reason to believe that the body could have <em>evolved</em> to get to that point, and then God &quot;breathed&quot; (Gen 2:7) the first <em>human</em> souls into these two bodies (as opposed to prior bodies having <em>animal</em> souls), thus creating the first two actual-people ever, the ancestors of all of us.

</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think this is actually true. Although there isn’t an official stance on whether or not Genisis is historically accurate, most Catholics believe and are taught (at least in church and catholic school) that Genisis and most of the old testament are allegorical stories, not literal events. </p>
<p>Also, what you said about the soul is spot on. The focus is on the creation of the soul, not the body, which absolutely leaves room for evolution and such.</p>
<p>From Pope Pius XII:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the teaching authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions . . . take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter—[but] the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an atheist who has read the bible from pure curiosity, I find it strange that that isn't the official line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Genesis 2:5-7 5 Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I don't speak Hebrew so can't comment on the correctness of the translation, but it seems to me God is giving Adam a soul. </p>
<p>Also the fact that there are no plants despite the fact this happened in Genesis 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day. Genesis 1:11-13</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes me feel like Adam and Eve were created AFTER the sixth day.</p>
<p>Basic timeline of how I see it; god creates the earth. God creates everything. God creates mankind and tells them: (Genesis1:28) God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.” God has a break. God comes back and sees that there is no <em>agriculture</em> (again, can't speak to the correctness of the translation) and decides to fix it by giving humans souls. </p>
<p>If humans already exist and God comes back to give them souls, this also explains how Cain gets a wife from Nod, when in the traditional interpretation all of humanity is supposed to consist of Adam, Eve, and Cain.</p></div>		</li>

It doesn't say they were the only humans He made, just that they were the first ones to be made. If they were the only ones that He made, that wouldn't make any sense. Most likely, Adam and Eve were the only ones named, because they were the only ones important to the story of how humanity got booted from Eden.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not talking from a position of authority here.  Disclaimer, bible reading Christian who believes in evolution, vaccinations etc.</p>
<p>There is a theory kicking around in some respected places that there was a 'mental' stage of evolution.  That homo sapiens sapiens evolved <em>physically</em> @ 200,000 years ago and the physical remains are more or less us but that there was a psychological revolution @ 50,000 years ago when suddenly you get more cave art, more symbolism, hints of the first religions etc.  It could be seen as God breathing in the human souls.  </p>
<p>Or it could be a load of horse feathers as more discoveries shed more light on the matter. Arguments go back and forth about dating and whether it was truly new behaviour and how it spread yadda yadda yadda but it is an interesting idea.  </p>
<p>tbh I just enjoy watching the documentaries and lectures on YouTube (from actual universities that teach evolution) and trust that God knows what He is doing.  I suspect that Darwin didn't see any division between his faith and his studies.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, except he did. Though mind you that the doctrine at the time was still obviously incompatible with what he had figured out, so it really would have been surprising if he had seen no conflict between the two. Only much later did the doctrine get adapted to what we had now figured out about the world, as it's kinda hard to sell a &quot;faith&quot; that pretty obviously contradicts what is widely known to be reality to the educated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know so much if it's god breathing life into humans or the development of culture and cultural evolution. </p>
<p>Cultural innovations can spread so much faster than mutations through natural selection. Think of how many generations it would take for an advantageous mutation to spread through a population vs. how many generations it took for literally everyone to have an iphone. Cumulative &amp; donated culture are some of the key things that sets humans apart from all the other animals. </p>
