			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43194.pdf" target="_blank">Before Obamacare passed in 2014, health insurance for members of Congress was handled exactly the same way as it is for every other federal employee.</a>  They were eligible for the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program and could pick from the same plans as everyone else. <a href="https://dchealthlink.com/" target="_blank">Since 2014, members of Congress and their staff are required to purchase plans from the Obamacare DC marketplace, DC Health Link.</a> And they are specifically required to buy &quot;Gold&quot; tier plans (not Bronze, Silver, or Platinum - only Gold) if they want the government to continue picking up some of the tab. The government's contribution is 72% of the average premium of all the participating plans, but is capped at 75% of the insurance premium for the plan the Congressman picks - which, by the way is lower than in private industry, where the employer generally picks up about 80% of the tab. Congressmen do have a few perks, one of which was essentially a prepaid physician plan for $500/yr that covered routine medical exams and treated minor illnesses, etc.
And they and their families can go to military hospitals for free but <strong>only within the National Capital Region</strong>.</p>
<p>[The rule on continuing health insurance into retirement is the same as it is for all federal employees - <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/health-care-for-congress-examined/2012/05/07/gIQAFZZi8T_blog.html" target="_blank">they must be eligible for a federal annuity (which requires five years of service for Congressmen), and they must have been continuously enrolled for the last five years.  The government continues picking up no more than 75% of the tab.  Unfortunately for the Congressman, however, his health insurance gets more expensive because once he has retired he can't pay his premiums with pre-tax money anymore.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regard to the healthcare issue, your premise is flawed, Congresspeople don't get free healthcare for life, they just get the option to continue paying for their employer healthcare plan (like many other people who retire from their jobs).  They also don't get a pension unless they serve 20 years (unlike, for example, the President who gets a pension regardless)</p>
<p>See, e.g.: <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/salaries-and-benefits-of-congress-members-3322282" target="_blank">https://www.thoughtco.com/salaries-and-benefits-of-congress-members-3322282</a></p>
<p>Additionally, even if they did get free healthcare there's a problem of scale there.  There are 535 congresspersons at any given time, but approximately 1.6 million active duty servicemembers and another 800k reservists at any given time.  If you consider turnover there are probably fewer than 2,000 living current and former U.S. Congress members.  By contrast there are an estimated 22 million veterans and currently active servicemembers.  </p>
<p>Paying for healthcare for 2,000 people is a very different proposition for paying for healthcare for 7% of the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In regard to the Presidential Pension, before 1958, the U.S. federal government provided no pension or other retirement benefits to former United States presidents. It was partially a response to Harry S. Truman being completely bankrupt after his presidency.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's worth noting that no-one made it past two terms before FDR, who died three months into his <em>fourth</em> term. Term limits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#History" target="_blank">had been discussed</a>, but it wasn't a practical issue until FDR came along.</p></div>		</li>
