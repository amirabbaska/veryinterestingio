			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason humans can do that is our freakish ability to sweat. You have to remove the heat that builds up. Dogs can run for much farther distances in freezing temperatures.
And before you come at me with “What about horses? They sweat” They do, but they eat a shitting low energy diet of grass so they spend most of their time eating to get enough calories. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses sweat, but they also produce way more heat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 1000 lb. horse requires about 15,000 calories daily at rest, 25,000 calories daily at light work and 33,000 calories daily heavily worked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while a horse may burn consume 10x the calories of a human while exercising, it doesn't have 10x the surface area to dissipate that heat across.</p></div>		</li>
