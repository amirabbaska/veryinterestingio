<p>You put three marks on it : two on the equator, about 90 degrees apart, and one on the poles. I claim that no matter how you spin the sphere, you cannot get all three points to have equal centripetal force directed away from the center of the sphere.</p>

<p>What if, on the sphere/globe, I draw the circle which goes through all 3 of those points?  Then, I choose my axis of rotation to go through the center of this circle (and also through the center of the sphere/earth).  Why wouldn't this produce equal centripetal force at the 3 points?  (Certainly not at every point on the sphere though, only those on the circle)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why the argument holds. The force in your case would not be directed away from the center of the sphere (as in being parallel to the connection of the sphere's center with the drawn marks).</p></div>		</li>
