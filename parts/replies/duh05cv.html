			<div class="markdown"><p>All the good rice (in Vietnam at least) is exported for profit and that leaves the country with subpar rice. I can confirm because my parents on their last trip to Vietnam brought rice that we bought in America that was imported from Vietnam back to the mother land and us kids were giving them shit until they explained to us why </p>
<p>Edit: my parents actually buy rice thatâ€™s imported from Thailand. Oops </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, seriously. Rice has to be the highest yielding crop if you consider the required land+labor. Not many people on a small plot can grow enough rice for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Corn apparently out-yields rice, but not by much and it's a lot harder to grow and process. </p></div>		</li>
