			<div class="markdown"><p>Many &quot;SIDS&quot; babies are &quot;suffocated&quot; babies.  This is the problem with co-sleeping.  Also, putting a bunch of stuff in the crib, such as stuffed animals, fluffy blankets, big fluffy &quot;mattress&quot; type things, etc, is all just stuff that can end up over a baby's face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure.   Only that this technique has proven to work.  Perhaps it stops the baby from getting any covers over their faces by either waving the cover up over their head, or from gradual wiggling further down the cot and winding up with their face under the cover.</p>
<p>The fairly tight, tucked in cover helps stop them rolling onto their stomach and face.</p>
<p>By the time they are old enough to really move a lot around their cot, and get onto their stomach anyway, they are past the SIDS danger age.</p></div>		</li>
