			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly worse. Assuming the above comment is 100% correct in summary, all online data does not require warrant. This could be Facebook of course... But it could also be GPS location, time logs, communications that in any form or way are stored digitally and to the internet (or whatever &quot;online&quot; means). There would be literally no way to avoid surveillance without going full Doomsday prep. Anything is up for grabs and since it's warrantless, they can try to charge you with something if they sift through everything and find probable cause within data stored online whether you had any part in it's storage online.</p></div>		</li>
