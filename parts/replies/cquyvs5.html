			<div class="markdown"><p>If you play 50 songs a day in your car and 100 songs a day on your phone/PC, only one of them has to match up to be played twice. That's very likely.</p>
<p>If &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot; played every day on both of your devices, now THAT would be too weird to be random.</p>
<p>Another example:

<p>But you're missing out on all the sweet new 80's music that's been coming out lately!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you haven't synced and added new songs, and you play at about the same frequency on all devices you would expect the same result (sequence of actions) to be performed on all your devices. Since the algorithm that plays the songs is deterministic nothing is weird about being on almost the same status or similar status when run in parallel with same initial conditions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why does it do it in the first place! Dont call it shuffle/random then. Call it &quot;gonna play some songs that we think you should listen to.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Semi-related, but I have sometimes put the same song in a playlist twice  (usually by mistake), for instance both the studio album version and the greatest hits version, even though they're identical. Since this song is then twice as likely to come up on random, it'll feel like it gets played more than others. So that could explain some of it for huge playlists, but doesn't account for much of this behaviour.</p></div>		</li>
