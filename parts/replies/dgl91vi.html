<p>Greasy onion rings, probably longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the reason that the patient needs TPN, there could be food that lingers for a long time. Many patients are allowed to eat a bit for pleasure and to prevent GI atrophy, but they may be on TPN because of severe GI dysmotility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for those who don't know:</p>
<p>TPN is total parental nutrition, basically an IV food line that puts fats, sugars, salts, and amino acids directly into the bloodstream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. Most patients who are on long-term TPN don't have an obstruction (since those usually get fixed or are due to cancer that kills the patient or makes the patient go on hospice). Other reasons to be on TPN, that are more common in long-term/home TPN patients, are short bowel syndrome and dysmotility. SBS patients often can eat, they just don't absorb enough nutrients. Dysmotility patients vary quite a bit in what they can tolerate. Some can't even take medications through their gut and have to have everything IV; others are able to get part of their nutrition through eating or tube feeding and use TPN to make up for calorie or nutrient deficits. Putting even a little nutrition through the gut reduces the risk of complications such as translocation of bacteria, liver dysfunction, cholestasis, and pancreatitis. It also improves quality of life for many patients to eat or drink a little, even if it is drained out of a gastrostomy tube.</p>
<p>I have been on TPN for 10 months now due to generalized dysmotility and visceral neuropathy. At first, I had to have my G tube draining to gravity 24/7 or I would have horrible pain and nausea just from my own secretions. I've gradually been able to tolerate more since getting my gallbladder out and I get about 1/4 of my calories through my gut through a mixture of tube feeding, drinking liquids, and eating soft, easily digestible solids. I am in several support groups with patients on TPN for a variety of reasons and everyone's experience is different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those wondering, TPN=Total Parenteral Nutrition.  Which is when someone is being totally provided with full nutrition intravenously (through their veins) instead of through the digestive system.  So, /u/Kahlnen is saying that even when he has autopsied someone who died while they were totally restricted on oral intake there was still a scant amount of fluid in the stomach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many people on TPN are also on drugs to reduce stomach acid secretion (H2 receptor antagonists and/or proton pump inhibitors), so I wonder if that affects your numbers. </p></div>		</li>
