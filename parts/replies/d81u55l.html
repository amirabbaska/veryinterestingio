			<div class="markdown"><p>How much do we really need to worry about neutrons though.  </p>
<p>Proton + Proton -&gt; 2He -&gt; 2H + β</p>
<p>2H + Proton -&gt; 3He</p>
<p>2H + 2H -&gt; 4He</p>
<p>2H + 4He -&gt; 6Li</p>
<p>3He + 4He -&gt; 7Li</p>
<p>7Li + 2H -&gt; 9Be</p>
<p>And so on in this fashion.  Can we not proceed, in principle at least, in a similar fashion making use of β+ decays to produce our neutrons instead of adding them externally? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This process is theoretically viable, but only up until iron (26).  What you're proposing is literally the nuclear fusion chains that occur in stars, but nuclear fusion is only an energetically-favorable process for nuclides up to iron. Every atom of every element heavier than iron was forged via supernova.</p>
<p>Also, we don't realistically have a way to implement these processes with the level of technology available today. If we did, we'd already have fusion power plants; synthesizing new elements would be the least of the applications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can create Uununoctium from high energy bombardment of californium or curium with calcium though, surely we could manage any specific element from lighter components.  We of course aren't going to be making any appreciable bulk, but why wouldn't be able to get any specific element? </p></div>		</li>
