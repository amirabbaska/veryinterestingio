			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I guess that would depend on how it is forcibly getting released. Your emotions at the time of the adrenaline release is also an important consideration. If you are forcing an adrenaline release because you want to sky diving or do extreme sports you are probably feeling a euphoria from that adrenaline which would be positive feedback to the neurons in your brain.</p>
<p>If the forced adrenaline release is due to being put in repeated stressful situations like a morning commute through road construction on a congested interstate, then your neurons are receiving the feedback that this stressful and it will have a negative impact.</p>
<p>If the adrenaline is being forced through the use of substances the euphoria effect will eventually habituate and you will either create a tolerance or an adverse effect. For example when people use highly caffeinated drinks for an energy rush, the more frequently you drink caffeine the less effective it becomes and get what is called the caffeine blues because instead of increased energy, the caffeine begins to make you sleepy.</p>
<p>Is that what you meant by forced adrenaline?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That one, mister! And the mainly positive effects (sharpness, strenghtness, focused vision) would be less perceived or not happen at all with regular adrenaline prescription? If not, the body will stand them without further damage? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't think you can force yourself to release adrenaline unless you suffer  from anxiety in which case your body releases adrenaline when your doing everyday normal things like buying apple juice causing you to sweat,have crazy thoughts,nausea, heavy shoulders, and be irritable to everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see, but I not only meant by doing naturally but also by taking some drug/medicine. And if those side-effects 'destroy' the body (and how they do that).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's an extremely strange feeling to be hopped up on that good brain go juice and have nothing to use it on.</p></div>		</li>
