So these industries have convinced the folks in power to withdraw. The nation as a whole would be totally fine under the agreement, but specific industries and companies would likely hurt. </p>
<p>The argument is that environmental regulations are bad for business. Now technically &quot;they are&quot; because having to pay to dispose of your waste costs more than dumping it in the river, so that's a negative impact of increased costs. It's a dumb argument though because then you destroy the landscape and cause problems for everyone downstream. Other things that are similarly &quot;bad for business&quot;; paying employees instead of having slaves, requiring breaks ever, providing any form of benefits, having safety equipment or standards, etc. It's a crap argument they are selling people but people are believing it. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes and no. It depends what you mean by &quot;proper&quot; treatment.</p>
<p>It does have regulations, but that doesn't mean the current ones  cover everything. Either because the old ones weren't strict enough, or there's new science that says a certain chemical is harmful that we didn't know about before, etc.</p>
<p>For example, back in the day, we didn't know lead was harmful, so it was put into gas and everything. We eventually phased that out around the 70s. Now we're finding out that even tiny amounts still have really big effects, so we might need to restrict it further.</p>
<p>Also, the EPA doesn't only stop stuff like dumping into rivers. A lot of recent work has been on getting power plants to reduce emissions via the Clean Air Act. (Coal power plants spew a lot of junk out of those smokestacks into the air)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How would involving the agreement make it different?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By agreeing to be a part of the agreement, we were agreeing to get emissions down. There's a lot of different ways, but one of the big ones is coal power plant emissions.</p>
<p>Technically, the agreement doesn't say you <em>have</em> to reduce coal power plan emissions, it just sets a goal to cut total emissions (and one of the obvious ways is cutting down those power plant emissions, which often means shutting down those coal plants, or retrofitting them with new cleaning equipment which is pretty expensive).</p>
<p>So you could technically be in the agreement and not cut power plant emissions, or not be in the agreement and cut them anyway,  but they kind of go hand in hand. By having the agreement, there was an incentive for the EPA to find ways to reduce emissions. Now, it doesn't have to. It still could (although this administration hasn't shown much desire to).</p>
<p>It's also important to get other countries on board. It doesn't do us much good if we go green and everyone else doesn't, since this stuff is happening on a global scale. The symbolism and commitment etc is important on that scale</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US is not bound to any targets through the agreement.  It's flexible and the US can set its own targets.  By being in the agreement the US gets some leverage over countries like China, and can put pressure on them to reduce their emissions.  By leaving the US loses this.  </p>
<p>Recent years have shown that economic growth is no longer strictly tied to increasing emissions.  So it's not really clear that the agreement does limit US growth, and in support of this argument many American companies have come out in support of the agreement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as usual probably. Sovereignty with a hint of &quot;it would cost money&quot;.</p>
<p>The US have refused to sign a shitton of stuff over the past century with no argument other than &quot;we want to keep our sovereignty&quot;.</p>
<p>Haven't even signed CEDAW, which was the &quot;Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women&quot; from 1980, signed by 186 nations. Because women who aren't discriminated threaten the nation's sovereignty or whatever.</p></div>		</li>
