			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true with some super aggressive fish. I said most, not all. You can also name piranhas who will attack things bigger than themselves.</p>
<p>In general, most fish are opportunity feeders. They what they can now. As much as possible. If it can't fit in their mouths, they generally don't care. Now, if you deal with territorial fish, then yes they can isolate other fish away from food sources. This is generally not a problem in fish tanks, unless you feed in a single spot. Other than that, there are some fish which are nibblers, who will try to eat anything they can put their mouths on, and scavengers who pick at things that don't move.</p>
<p>So yes, there are many types of fish. But in general, a fish won't go after and kill something that's the same size or bigger than itself. </p></div>		</li>
