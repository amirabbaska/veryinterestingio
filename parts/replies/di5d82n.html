			<div class="markdown"><p>If a nuke is detonated close to the ground its blast is somewhat less effective, but it creates much more fallout because matter from the ground is mixed with the explosion and irradiated. This fallout isn't just &quot;pretty unhealthy and can give you cancer&quot; like I thought it was before reading about it. It is short-term lethal, and can be responsible for <em>more deaths than the blast itself</em>, over much larger area. So if the goal is as much indiscriminate killing as possible, then a ground level detonation could be more effective.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://www.nukestrat.com/china/Book-173-196.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> from a study of the feasibility of American nuking of Chinese missile silos in remote, sparsely populated mountains in China. The idea was to see whether these these could be preemptively nuked, and if so what the cost in lives would be, with the hope that very few lives would be lost. However, they find that to have any hope of destroying the silos, the nukes would have to be detonated at ground level, which would result in enough fallout to kill 20 million people by itself.</p>
<p>(The second half of the report, about a Chinese counterattack scenario, is also worth reading)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the purpose of the bombings was to end the war with a display of power, not to indiscriminately kill as many people as possible and contaminate the area for a much longer time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the question was about atomic bombs in general, not the bombing of Japan in particular. In a mutually assured destruction scenario, for example, where the goal is to maximize harm to the opponent, it might make sense to explode the bombs at ground level. To the extent that anything makes sense in MAD.</p></div>		</li>

It is crazy to think about the fact that a bomb can be made so powerful that as stated in the article &quot;Much of its high-yield destructiveness was inefficiently radiated upwards into space.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Tsar Bomba that was test-detonated at 50MT was actually a scaled-down version of the final 3-stage design* which had an estimated yield of 100MT. </p>
<ul>
<li>a three-stage weapon uses a fission device to 'spark' a fusion device, which is then used to ignite a third, larger, fusion device.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much of today's nuclear weapons are <strong>far</strong> less powerful than the test devices of the 1950's and even the deployed weapons of the 60s and 70s.  The reasons being improved targeting accuracy and warhead survivability.  </p>
<p>For example, if you launch a missile with a single warhead on a ballistic trajectory with primitive terminal guidance, your missile's target is easy to calculate and therefore possibly intercept.  In addition, hardened targets like silos may survive near misses. So, where one 500 kT direct hit would do the job, three 2MT warheads might be sent instead, in hopes that two got through and hit close enough.  Hence the tens of thousands of warheads in the arsenal of both sides at that time</p>
<p>With the advent of MIRV'ed missile's, target prediction became much more difficult, greatly increasing survivability chances of the warheads, and with more sophisticated terminal guidance, each warhead can deliver it's payload within a much smaller error radius, obviating the need for excessive yield, and a massively redundant stockpile of warheads (which peaked at over 31000 in 1967.)</p></div>		</li>
