			<div class="markdown"><p>There is evidence that low doses actually <em>prevent</em> cancer.</p>
<p>Two notable studies- one, Denver, CO has naturally high radiation from both cosmic rays (less atmosphere to shield it) and uranium deposits.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DC_Rocky-Flats-Cancer-Incidence-Ratios-1980-1995.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DC_Rocky-Flats-Cancer-Incidence-Ratios-1980-1995.pdf</a></p>
<p>Esophageal and stomach cancers are elevated, which could be from ingesting uranium dust.  But leukemia, lymphoma, and bran/CNS, lung, colon cancers, and all averaged together, are notably lower than expected by average for the demographic.</p>
<p>Second was in 1982, a cobalt-60 source contaminated steel recycling and thousands of residential buildings in Taiwan got made with hard-gamma-emitting rebar.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_scrap_metal" target="_blank">It wasn't discovered for 10 years</a>, but an attempt to study the cancer rates only found <a href="http://ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_english/low-dose-Cobalt-taiw-06.pdf" target="_blank">it was strongly PROTECTIVE</a>.  Like 97% effective in preventing cancer over 20 years.</p>
<p>Well, you're free to question the data.  Gross mistakes are possible.  But caution, science does not mean scrutinizing and dismissing just the data which does not agree with your beliefs (even if &quot;common sense&quot;).  While the link between ingesting radioactive iodine and cesium causing iodine and bone cancer respectively is well-proven, the idea that all low-level radiation contributes to cancer risk over time is much more speculative.</p>
<p>In this case, people have speculated that low-level long-term radiation leads to the body learning to destroy these damaged cells with broken replication mechanisms rather than allowing them to proliferate into cancer, effectively immunizing them to cancer.  But the mechanism is entirely speculative.  The data could be entirely wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Taiwan cobalt-60 study says exactly that, IF the data is correct.  It could easily be faulty due to data collection problems.  But they'd have to be MASSIVE systemic errors to get a 97% reduction- virtually complete immunity- instead of an increase.</p>
<p>Then again, exceptional claims require exceptional proof.</p></div>		</li>
