			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. The economic results from legal considerations is very interesting. I'm going to look more into that, as well as the ecosystem engineers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll just add the Chatham Island Black Robin are currently up to <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/black-robin/" target="_blank">250 individuals.</a> This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_robin" target="_blank">article</a> goes a bit more into detail about how they brought the numbers up and the behavioural issues. </p>
<p>They're not the only bird from my part of the world which has come near extiniction and been brought back we also have the <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/takahe" target="_blank">Takahe</a> thought extinct for 50 years or so and the <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/kakapo" target="_blank">Kakapo</a> thought functionally extinct till a population was found in the 70's. </p>
<p>In all cases the rebounds are closely tied to predator reduction/elimination, sometimes entire islands are made predator free (Kakapo and the Robin) sometimes it's intensive trap lines to make inland islands (Takahe), coupled with some intensive management of breading populations though nest minding/fostering/supplemental feeding in some cases/artificial insemination and so on.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Firstly, most of these cases aren't the result of a species 'rebounding' so much as being rediscovered, either by chance or by extensive searching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to throw in that the majority of &quot;rediscovered&quot; species are small animals that, naturally, will be harder to spot. A larger animal like a thylacine is less likely to be rediscovered.</p></div>		</li>
