			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up the idea behind this is when debt makes the economy grow, there is more taxable commerce in the future, and if it grows faster than the bond's interest, then the government is actually making money. Especially for recession spending, if you have low interest like U.S. bonds, it's usually a good idea. </p>
<p>Why do people buy low interest bonds, if they grow slower than the economy? Usually as a lower risk, lower yield investment as they near retirement and don't want to risk being forced to partially liquidate during a recession or to keep working.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's where the whole concept of bond-based debt can come unglued.</p>
<p>The US &quot;rolls over&quot; our bonds.  If we have bonds about to mature (pay out) in, say, 2018, we DO pay those out and then we go for more bonds to replace those, on a continuing cycle.  Now, that's fine as long as trust in those bonds remains high.  In that case the amount of interest we'll post on the new bonds will be about the same as the old.  We can keep that juggling act going for a very long time, maybe close enough to &quot;forever&quot; as doesn't matter.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Let's say things change and the buyer interest in new bonds drops.  This can happen several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confidence in the US economy drops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confidence in other economies rises, making their bonds more popular.</p>
</li>
<li>General worldwide economic issues.  (The US Great Depression started with a bank collapse in Austria.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases the new debt will come with higher interest rates to entice buyers.  And that's when shit can get real.  This pattern is basically what's been happening to the weaker European nations (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain, the &quot;PIIGS&quot;).</p>
<p>It can happen to us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and whereas Greece and Ireland (Iceland too?) can just get some prop up from the EU and its larger states, Italy and Spain have much larger economies and particularly banks which would require much larger bailouts.  </p>
<p>Considering that we in the US bailed out the banks by writing a trillion dollar check and then doing QE for trillions more, the scale gets pretty unreal. And that was just for some bad housing loans. I only have an above average understanding of the bond market, but from what I've read about derivatives (scary calculus words, aaaah) linked to bonds, there's something like $700 trillion worth of liabilities out there in the world - basically 10 years of the entire world's economy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that'd kinda how I'm understanding all this too. While the original post was reassuring that we're not in as bad a shape as I thought, it doesn't mean we should keep having large deficits for the reasons you described.  </p>
<p>Just speculating as my understanding of macro-economics is flimsy, but I'd think the key would be keeping the rate of growth in the debt less than or equal to the rate of growth in the GDP in the long run.  Is that true? </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is my concern too. Not that we can't pay at the moment, but that if US bonds ever become less of a sure thing we're not in any kind of position to stop issuing new ones. And we aren't setting ourselves up to lend worry free in, say, a recession, by doing it routinely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another point is that bond funds are also a hedge for when the market gets volatile. Say you expect the stock market to have a major correction (aka, its about to tank because of skittish investors, major news event, banking crisis, morons in office), and you have a really big retirement fund. Well, you get to watch that fund shrink over the next so many months, not pretty. Or, you move some of your stock funds into bond funds, and when the stocks are giving negative returns you still pull in 1-2% and don't lose the capital. Then once the floor is reached, you go back into your preferred stocks as they recover. </p>
<p>Of course all this works as a gamble, if you're wrong, you are not earning 5-15% in stock growth, just 1-2%. So opportunity loss vs actual loss. Some people advise against it, I prefer to do something rather than nothing. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If that's still the case, it's more a historical relic. There's been a lot of talk (still heavily debated) in Japan about finally reforming a military; if they did, we wouldn't prevent it, even if technically the clause still exists. TBH, with the context of China, it'd probably be encouraged</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>I'd also mention the debt in comparison to something like GDP. Helps put it in perspective a bit, instead of just &quot;trillions!&quot;. Otherwise good explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japan does have a military. However it is restricted to &quot;self defence&quot;, hence its name, JSDF. Well, JMSDF, the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. That is the one I have experience with. They have jets, helicopters, navy ships, submarines, missiles... everything a military needs. The difference being that it is technically not an expeditionary force. Though it would not take much to change that should the agreement be renegotiated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The US gave them back the rights to change their Constitution in the '50's. We have not had the right to force anything on their government for a very long time. There have been numerous attempts within the Japanese government to remove the self-defense only clause but it has never passed due to the amount of resistance by the Japanese themselves to the idea.</p>
<p>Also just because their military is self-defense only does not mean they do not have one. They spend between 40-50 billion USD a year on it. </p></div>		</li>
