			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partly correct (the redshift/distance to a galaxy determines how far in the past we're seeing it) but that doesn't answer the question of &quot;how old the galaxy was&quot; when we saw it. By analogy, if we look at an old photograph of a person, using redshift measures how old the photograph is (how long ago the light we're seeing came from) but it doesn't tell us anything about how old the person (galaxy) IN the photo is. See my answer above and that of astrocosmo for more info about how to tell how old the galaxy was WHEN we saw it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no IS or WAS. The young galaxy that you're seeing is its real age to you. It's not analogous to an old photograph, because this is relativistic we're talking here. Relativity is the reality of our universe, not a speed limitation. That being said, our sun is about 8 light minutes from us. While you'd like to think an image of its past, what you're seeing is actually present to you. It's what that matters, because there's nothing you can do to ever see the instantaneous image of the sun right now in absolute time.  If the sun was to disappear right now in its absolute time, it will take 8 mins for Earth to feel the loss of sun gravity right at the same time you lose sight of the sun visually. Relativity changes the way we think of time, because it's not absolute universally.</p>
<p>You and I are not only separated by distance but time too. You could be a hundred milliseconds away from me in time. There's no way you and I could interact instantaneously to be able to make sense of an absolute time. </p></div>		</li>
