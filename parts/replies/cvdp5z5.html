			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Unless marijuana is federally legalized the federal government will always have the power to shut it down in states that have legalized it, although it may become impractical if it becomes legalized by most states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes. Weed remains illegal under Federal law in WA &amp; CO. It isn't illegal under State law. This means that State Troopers, and city police can't do anything about it. But if you light up in front of a Federal officer, you're taking chances if s/he's in a good mood, or looking to make an arrest. A committed anti-drug President could dramatically increase federal funding for law enforcement in both states, and arrest everyone they find smoking. It's a matter of choices/priorities.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really, it just means we have state sanctioned shops where you can purchase recreational marijuana.  The Fed's in theory could shut it all down in a second but the Obama Administration has generally been tolerant and allowed it within reasonable guidelines (in WA you have to be 21+ to buy / Cannot set up a shop within 1000 ft of schools, parks, etc). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure... that is entirely possible.</p>
<p>But it would also be a dangerous move politically.  The public's opinion of marijuana is generally in favor of legalization.  Other states (Florida is the one that comes to mind) are already making moves similar to the Colorado and Washington laws. </p>
<p>The Feds have seemingly decided to just let this battle go... expecting that soon enough states will have voted to legalize that it just becomes the law at the federal level too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're actually wrong. Abortion isn't legal because the federal government says so, the Federal Government can't even tell states what not to ban, unless they tie federal funding to a requirement to do that. Abortion is legal because the supreme court ruled back in the day that the government can't limit a woman's access to an abortion. The federal government wouldn't do anything if Alabama outlawed abortions, someone would simply file suit, and the courts would strike down the law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, ultimately it comes down to what the federal government deems worth enforcing.  If a President or government is elected in the future that decides that pot laws need to be enforced they will eventually shut down every state that's passed their own legalization laws.</p></div>		</li>
