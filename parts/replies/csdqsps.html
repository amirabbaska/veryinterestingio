			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the model, but a new question just popped up for me. </p>
<p>Gravity is the curvature of spacetime, so the photon, for it's own point of reference, it's travelling through spacetime in a straight line. If it keeps going in a straight line, but the curvature of spacetime is directing it into a black hole, we must be able to theorize where this photon is popping out of the black hole again, right? Or is a black hole really like a bottomless well for all energy that's getting 'sucked' into it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a couple of points. 1) A photon actually has no &quot;point of reference&quot;.  The only way to really conceptualize this is that from its point of reference the entire universe is completely singular - there is no space, there is no time. There is nothing and that nothing happens all at once. 2) An external observer does, in fact, view the photon is going in a straight line as long as you are willing to allow the word straight to mean something different than what you are used to. Light (and anything moving with no external force) moves along geodesics, which are &quot;straight lines&quot; in curved spacetime.  So the newtonian statement that objects move in a straight line until acted upon by an external force is generalized to the statement that objects moves along geodesics unless acted upon by an external force.  But note that gravity is not a force in GR, it is the thing doing the space-time bending and therefore it is the thing that defines what the geodesic, or straight line, paths are in the first place. EM forces, or applied forces cause deviations from geodesics. 3) Yes, a black hole is basically a bottomless well, except for hawking radiation but based on your question this caveat will probably not be helpful to consider.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is gravity a thing curving spacetime, or is it the curve of spacetime?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Straight line really means &quot;path that if you look at it closely enough looks like a normal straight line&quot;.  Here's an example from a more familiar curved surface, the earth.  If you're walking around the equator you're following one of the &quot;straight lines&quot; of the globe.  But it'll always seem to you that you're walking in a straight line.</p>
<p>It turns out that near a black hole all the straight lines that cross the event horizon of the black hole continue down to the singularity in the centre of the black hole and don't come out again.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could trace out a line that the photon will follow, but if it actually crosses the event horizon, then it will never pop out again. Inside the horizon, space-time is so heavily distorted that there is simply no &quot;out&quot; anymore. On the inside, every direction, even the one you just came from, points inward towards the center, or some degree sideways. There is no direction you can travel that will get you further from the center than you currently are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Light has energy, and gravity acts on energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this is confusing to me.  Does it mean that gravity affects magnetic fields (or does force not count as energy)?  What about other types of energy, electricity/vibrations/etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well both explanations should be equivalent (they're not. If you use a 'relativistic mass' concept to calculate how light behaves in a gravitational field you're going to be off by a factor of 2 in most of your equations), and if you consider gravity as warping space-time then it becomes obvious that magnetic fields, vibrations et cetera are indeed affected by it. After all, these all work inside the now curved space-time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, any kind of energy.  It's just that the effects are often way too small to see (For usual objects &quot;E = mc^2 + other energy&quot; and the other energy is waaaaay smaller than mc^2).</p>
<p>Besides black holes, we can see the effect of gravity on light through gravitational lensing, which is a deformation of light from galaxies or stars by the gravity of things that are between them and us, up to <a href="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/02/09/hst_lens_smile.jpg.CROP.original-original.jpg" target="_blank">extreme cases</a>.</p>
<p>As a final thought, even your own mass is mostly energy. If you sum the mass of the fundamental particles in you (electrons and quarks), you get only 1% of you mass. The rest is actually mostly the kinetic energy of the quarks zooming around inside the protons tin the nuclei of your atoms.</p></div>		</li>
