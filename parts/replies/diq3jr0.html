			<div class="markdown"><p>How can you fault someone for not wanting to admit to a police officer that they were breaking the law? Seems like an entirely natural reaction, and is well within rights. What would you rather, the person lie and say &quot;I don't know,&quot; or choose not to answer the question at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it true the regular police hate the transport police? Something to do with the black and white nature of their job, speed/drink limits etc. Whereas part of regular policing involves a degree of thought as to whether a crime has actually occurred?</p></div>		</li>
