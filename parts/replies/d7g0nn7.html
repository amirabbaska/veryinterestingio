			<div class="markdown"><p>in 2d, it's literally just as simple as multiplying angular velocity (in radians of course) by the radius of the circle. Going 5 radians/sec around a circle of 4 meters in radius? 20 meters per second is your speed.</p>
<p>In 3d, if you are only in a 2d plane, then use the 2d method. So, 10m from the center of the planet (I'll assume you mean 10m from the center of earth at 0 degrees latitude, the equator), the answer is 0.000073*10 = 0.00073 meters per second.</p>
<p>On the surface, that's 6371000 meters from the center, so 0.000073*6371000 = 465 meters per second, or the oft-quoted &quot;1000mph&quot; speed (specifically, the linear velocity) at which a person on the equator moves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Heads up, you put surface 6371000 meters from the surface, rather than the center.</p></div>		</li>
