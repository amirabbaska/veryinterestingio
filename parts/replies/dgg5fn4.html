			<div class="markdown"><p>wow, this makes me feel much better about chicken and <em>waaaaaaaaaaaaay</em> worse about beef.  I'm totally down cutting out as much beef as possible from my diet now.  </p>
<p>The gain seems negligible when moving to soy or rice products, but seems pretty amazing when moving to potatoes.  Tl;dr:  More potatoes and chicken, less beef.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I respect that a lot. </p>
<p>Obviously you're not vegan but /r/vegan has info on and is keenly interested in the environmental impact of animal agriculture. Worth a look if you're into the science behind everything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome comment!</p>
<p>Do you also have numbers on fats?</p>
<p>I guess varying carbohydrat-densities of plant products would not really matter since it is basic CO2 fixation and release after consumption/decay (continuous circle with unlimited energy from the sun). Could this be translated to fatty acid synthesis?</p>
<p>As a general answer to OPs question I would say that the higher the yielder of the product is in the trophic foodchain the more circles the energy has gone through (locomotion, metabolism, storing) which allows more opportunities to leave the circle as a bad byproducts (methane for example).</p>
<p>Consumption of products coming from lower in the foodchain would have less of an environmental impact
(plant vs fish).</p>
<p>This disregards all other factors like human use (transport,cultivation) or natural methanogenesis during organic decay,...</p>
<p>Pseudo-Sience, out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a simple matter of whether the water is usable afterwards. Farming needs a certain amount of &quot;clean&quot; water: not salty, not full of bacteria or chemical contaminants. </p>
<p>The supply of clean water is limited by how fast the water cycle can turn it around: how much rains on the catchment area and flows in through surface water (rivers etc.) and underground water.</p>
<p>Irrigation and other farming uses of water also have an environmental impact. The water carries salts and fertilisers into parts of the soil where they don't help, or where they make it difficult to grow plants, and carries fertiliser into water bodies. Water plants then grow there, and when they rot, this uses up all the oxygen in the water, killing fish and causing other problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. In some cases, water used in agriculture is drawn from from aquifers through deep wells. Much of the water will drain off in some way, but it will take a long time to make it back to the aquifer. Thus we sometimes see aquifer depletion because withdraws are happening faster than they are naturally replenished.</p>
<p>When thinking about water usage, it's good to keep in mind a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where did the water come from, and how will it return there?</li>
<li>How much energy was used to prepare the water for its purpose? For example by pumping, heating, purification, etc.</li>
<li>Will the process introduce waste into the water that makes it more difficult or impossible to use in the future?</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, municipal water conservation efforts in wet areas are usually based around the cost to purify water and deliver it through pipes, whereas conservation efforts in drought areas are more concerned with the depletion of reservoirs and aquifers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's certainly usable.  Rain falls on pasture, grass grows (incorporating a small percentage of the water), cows eat grass, remaining water drains into nearby stream, which feeds a river, from which we can take water for other uses.</p>
<p>Otherwise cows would weigh about, hmm, eighty thousand tons, and have the overall structure and solidity of water balloons.</p></div>		</li>
