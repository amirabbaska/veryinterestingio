			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question. Here is an article I found on it: <a href="http://www.futurity.org/breath-sensor-body-fat-1569382/" target="_blank">http://www.futurity.org/breath-sensor-body-fat-1569382/</a></p>
<p>Sounds like its more measuring acetone levels instead of CO2 levels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, people burning fat have lower amounts of CO2 in their breath. This is because the body either burns fat or glucose, and glucose creates more units of CO2 per unit of glucose burned than fat does. You can measure this in breath, and it's called respiratory quotient (CO2 production/O2 intake). An RQ of 0.7 is when someone is burning mostly fat/ketones, while an RQ of 1.0 is when someone is burning mostly glucose.</p></div>		</li>
