			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re not wrong. Carbon monoxide poisoning is an issue that doesn’t just go away as soon as you leave the affected area. Victims are very often put on oxygen, because they need the extra oxygen while their blood is essentially hobbled. It’s also a big reason platelet transfusions are needed, since that’s a quick way to essentially go “holy shit, they need more oxygen carrying capacity <em>right now</em>.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact on carbon monoxide: Carbon Monoxide is used in the beef industry to keep the meat looking fresher for longer. This is because of the molecular orbital interaction of the p orbital of the CO and the d orbital of the metal causing a bright red color to occur. So meat houses will have the meat in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide to keep it from browning as quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really accurate. Every CO toxicity patient gets O2. It's not so much that they need the extra O2, it's the increase in partial O2 pressure that allows it to kick CO off of hemoglobin so it can be eliminated. CO has nasty effects aside from merely taking up room that O2 needs, it needs to be eliminated as quickly as possible. This is why severely poisoned patients are given hyperbaric oxygen therapy, there's a lot of CO and it needs to be eliminated rapidly.</p>
<p>Platelet transfusions are not given. There have been some studies on blood cell transfusion exchange but AFAIK that is not standard of care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you have little dudes that eat metals and use them to power up, these little dudes can't tell what they are eating. Some metals make their tummies upset and they can't eat any more. Sometimes they can't even digest the bad ones, and they are left with their bellies full of food they didn't want, so they can't eat what they do want. These little dudes are vastly important to your health, so only give them the yummy metal.</p></div>		</li>
