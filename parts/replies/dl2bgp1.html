			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't actually true, at least in central/southern Arizona. Rooftop Solar peaks around noon. Electricity usage and AC use peaks when people are coming home, around 5pm. By that point, rooftop solar is producing only a 1/3 or less of what it was at noon.</p>
<p>Also, solar produces the most in the spring and usage is most in the summer. Because of this, there are a lot of hours in the spring when energy prices now go negative (there's more solar being produced than there is load, so you have to pay someone to take up the excess power).</p>
<p>This isn't to say solar doesn't help. Especially solar that tracks the sun, which you typically see on large plants but not the stuff you put on a roof, has a much higher generation output when ACs are running most in the evening. But really, even if you have solar on your roof, natural gas is doing the heavy hitting for your Air Conditioning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're getting buried, but as some one that works in the electricity industry, you are exactly right. Solar power is doing almost nothing to alleviate peak demand, which is roughly 5-8pm during the summer in most of the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does A/C peak when people come home though. Is it because the didn't run it while they were gone so their house warmed up and they turned it on later. With solar power it would be more efficient to keep it on during the day and not let the house warm up in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're right, but it's not a problem. Cool the homes down more than necessary at noon when you have the power to do it, then cool just the minimum amount to keep a bearable temperature until nighttime. Concrete walls, cellars etc. store coldness quite well. Also, cool down the freezer down as hard as possible during noon, and you don't have to run its compressor during nighttime when there's no solar power. Just the same, heat up the hot-water-boiler when there's power, to use the water when there is not. You can still make hot water and run the air conditioning and whatnot if there's a need, as long as the majorityvof people use these simple patterns. As s nice side effect everyone would save a crapton of money.</p>
<p>There are solutions, we just have to be a bit smarter about them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the type of issue we should look for better solutions, like building homes in a way that minimizes the need for air conditioning</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Building design and architecture can also help alleviate. Before ACs, shade, air vents with the right angle(s) and material, along with open concepts and methods to preserve cool were often used in desert environments, especially through Mid East. These were not only 0 energy consumption, they also had 0 noise pollution and provided a southing and natural atmosphere to live in. Modern designs don't take into account the nature and env. as much as they should anymore... copy and paste construction methods in the last 3-4 decades destroyed that. Seems to be changing, but slowly. </p></div>		</li>

And the cooling is still very 'inefficient'. (not really efficiency, since you're taking energy away.)</p></div>		</li>
