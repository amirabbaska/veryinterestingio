<p>This is likely the biggest factor. In theory most refugees will only need short term assistance before being able to support themselves. The mentally ill will require long term aid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Massive upvote. Have worked with several outreach programmes doing promotional work for them. Same question comes up time and time again - Why are they homeless?</p>
<p>Here's the deal, 90% of the homeless have drug and alcohol problems. And most also have underlying psychological problems. Being homeless exacerbates these, as does substance abuse.</p>
<p>In short, it's a horrific fall down winding staircase, and the fall breaks the stairs so you can't climb up. (Ie. damaged relationships with family, criminal record etc...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I sometimes think through the following hypothetical: What would I do if I woke up one day with no home, money, ID, family or friends? How would I get my life back on track?</p>
<p>Even without mental issues, drug problems or a criminal record I've struggled to come up with a viable path back to being a productive member of society. I can't imagine how tough it would be for someone who's also battling their own demons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was reading about some interesting programs now being implemented for this, especially in UT. Theres a change in thinking developing where its too difficult to address a lot of the  mental health issues if people are homeless. Fundamentally this groups ultimate concern is survival. They cant always deal with addiction and health concerns, so in the case of UT they just give them homes to stay in. And then it becomes much cheaper and easier to resolve their other issues. Started to save lost of money between cost to arrest and try them, social workers spending time to locate them when their on the street, etc. ill try to find a link and post it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't work with the homeless, but one of my good friends does. I live in a small town with one of the best out-patient behavioral health centers in the state. Hospitals will literally give veterans/people struggling with addiction a bus ticket and send them here. But then they have no where to stay and very few of them can get jobs to support themselves. We've ended up with an unfortunately large homeless population and it's heartbreaking to watch my friend struggling to find shelter for these people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also regionally specific. My dissertation was based on a comparative analysis between rural homelessness and its urban counterparts. Urban areas definitely do possess the greatest mentally-ill homeless population, although it's generally not the case for rural spaces. Rural homeless individuals suffer more from unforseen matters (physical illness, poor regional job market resulting in lay-offs, gentrification, etc.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by mentally ill.  If it's just depressive symptoms, then homeless individuals are almost 4x more likely to suffer than the general population and it's a problem everywhere, not just urban areas.  The problem is there isn't a ton of data on the subject.  And I'm betting if you did your dissertation on homelessness and mental health then you cited my old boss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incorrect. No one is putting homeless veterans on busses simply to shuffle them around. That is a ridiculous claim and I'm guessing you have nothing to back it up aside from small town gossip. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This bit is important. A lot of veterans, even those who are free of serious mental problems fail to apply to get the benefits they have earned. Secondarily, once/if one does put in an application it is up to the veteran to prove that they are eligible to get them. combine this with the wait times it takes to process each claim many people get discouraged and dont followup on their stuff.. or simply never apply to begin with. </p>
<p>Now with regard to the mentally ill, or homeless population there in... even getting the application started may not be possible for them, let alone putting together a packet of paperwork to prove eligibility, following-up on process status and all of that jive. What makes things worse thereafter will be lack of immediate locatability for the individuals in question once claims are approved, declined or additional information is requested. </p>
<p>If looking at refugees things may be much more &quot;streamlined&quot; and simple.. that is, even when language or culture etc. are barriers if you have a person or group willing and able to work with you to process claims and paperwork things are much simpler to deal with.</p></div>		</li>
