			<div class="markdown"><p>Many ways. We indirectly observe that this is somewhat common but it is not easy to detect as inclinations are very difficult to calculate.</p>
<p>Things like distant companions, in this case a binary star, can excite high inclination and to varying degree on a system. Planet planet interactions can do this too, particularly in the period of when a protoplanetary disc has nearly completely dissipated. Another way would from warped protoplanetary discs (we have observed these but their impact on planet formation is not well understood). Huge collision is the least likely of these. Any collision large enough to affect the inclination significantly would destroy the planet in question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do, but the speeds change, so that they're always getting further apart or closer together.</p>
<p>The key piece of physics here is that objects in a higher orbit move slower, which is Kepler's Third Law. These two moons are in very nearly the same orbit, but Epimetheus will generally be either further away or closer to Saturn. For the sake of argument, let's say it's closer. That means it orbits faster, so it starts to catch up to Janus. As it gets closer, however, Janus's own gravity pulls it outwards, and its momentum causes it to cross Janus's orbit and end up further from Saturn than Janus is. Since it's now further from Saturn than Janus, it moves slower, and starts to lag behind, though bear in mind it's still moving in the same direction, just a little bit further out and slower.</p>
<p>Once it's lagged behind by enough, it starts approaching Janus from the other direction. Now, as it approaches Janus, Janus's gravity pulls it inwards, towards Saturn. Once again, it crosses Janus's orbit, and is now closer to Saturn again, so it starts accelerating away from Janus until it goes all the way round and starts catching up from the other direction, at which point we're back where we started.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsHBE3DWCP4" target="_blank">This video</a> provides an illustration of what I just described. The footage on the left shows what it looks like from the perspective of an observer floating freely in space - note that both moons always move in the same direction, and the smaller moon just moves faster or slower depending on whether it's inside or outside of the larger one's orbit. The footage on the right shows what it looks like from the large moon's perspective, and you can see that the small moon moves in a horseshoe shape, hence the name &quot;horseshoe orbit&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that the video is not a physically accurate simulation - the crossing process occurs every 4 years, while the moons orbit Saturn every 17 hours or so. The process in the video is just sped up for illustrative purposes.</p></div>		</li>
