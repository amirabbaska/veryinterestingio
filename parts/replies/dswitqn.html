			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - if I remember correctly, when the esophagus is irritated repeatedly by very hot foods, it defensively adapts to become more like stomach tissue, which has a thick protective mucus-producing layer. Unfortunately, all the irritation and cell turnover and maybe changes in gene expression make the cells more vulnerable to becoming cancerous. The phenomenon is called Barrett's esophagus. I don't know if it causes any increase in stomach cancer, but I think there might be other dietary factors responsible for higher rates of stomach cancer in east asia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could very well be true. There is evidence that frequently drinking hot beverages leads to higher rates of esophageal cancer, but that it requires higher temperatures than most people (at least Americans) drink.</p>
