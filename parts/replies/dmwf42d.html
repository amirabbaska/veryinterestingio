			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good points.  I doubt the US would willingly use area of denial weapons as a first response in any case.  I forgot that, as /u/rhomboidus stated, that sanctions are often more of a political tool than anything.</p>
<p>I just thought it was strange that a weapon meant to deny an area from any human activity would be neglected from sanctions by the UN regardless of the country/entity of origin.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also an uncomfortable fact of modern (and general) society that many weapons stand to be developed with the understanding that using them would be monstrous, but that they also must be well understood before a foe with.... more flexible perspectives on morality develop and use them. Pandora's box stands to be opened, so understanding and familiarizing oneself as much as possible for what's going to emerge is important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the issue that cobalt bombs quite frankly aren't reliable. They US has done a lot of 'interesting' hypotheticals without actually getting anything out of it. Cobalt doesn't convert very well so the chances of a super dangerous bomb being made from it are fairly low.</p></div>		</li>

<p>OT: One might argue, a bit like AI and drones right now.  It is the wild west, with no appreciable ethical boundaries.  We are in a race for the best and brightest and I expect this will be the next area for proactively examining non-proliferation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, absolutely. The law is always a few steps behind ethics and even further back from technology. We're constantly faced with issues that 20 years ago nobody would've even considered.</p></div>		</li>
