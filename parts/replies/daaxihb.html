			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would that keep you up at night. Everything would be maintained by the AI. We could have world wide communism where everything's free and everyone has everything they want and are equal. no politicians, no elections, just go to the beach all day long, or just do research, anything you want.</p>
<p>Can't wait.</p>
<p>Edit: Y'all need to lighten up a bit with your doom and gloom. If the AI is only used for coming up with solutions and ideas instead of given the power to implement it by itself, it wouldn't have any power to &quot;destroy all humans&quot;. Worst comes to shove, computers need power to run, cut the source and it'll die. Also, EMPs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a book called &quot;A whole new mind: why right brainers will rule the world&quot; by Daniel Pink. He argues that as we outsource more and more of the left brain (analytical) jobs to other countries and artificial intelligence, right brain (creative/empathic) roles will have more value placed upon them. Examples of left brain/ analytical jobs; accounting, farming, factory work. Examples of right brain/creative jobs; Sales, arts, counselling etc... basically anything that involves creativity, emotion and intuition.</p></div>		</li>
