			<div class="markdown"><p>So I actually worked on an assembly line that manufactured the seatbelts for the Toyota Camry. If you bought a Camry in 1993, there is a 50% chance I built your seatbelt. </p>
<p>There is a tiny ball bearing sitting a tiny saucer like device. Coming out from the saucer is an arm that is anchored at the elbow. Imagine holding a tennis ball in the palm of your hand with your arm bent at the elbow at a right angle. </p>
<p>When the vehicle decelerate, the ball bearing moves forward, which causes a rotation at the elbow. The top of the device, the shoulder of you will,  moves forward and locks a small gear which in turn locks the belt shaft (thing the seatbelt strap is wrapped around). </p>
<p>The ball is tiny, maybe 1cm in diameter. The arm that I described is light weight plastic. The device is not locking the belt. It locks a gear that locks the belt. That’s why this tiny ball bearing and cheap piece of plastic is able to keep you from hurtling through the window (of a ‘93 Camry anyway). </p>
<p>Hope my explanation made sense. I’m not a engineer and I was a dumb 22 year old when I worked there. I only remember this because I was so shocked that such a little piece of engineering could stop this tremendous amount of force. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Nothing like getting into a mate's car and he's pulled away so quickly you didn't get you belt on, and you still can't because he's flogging the crap out of it. With mates like that, who needs enemas?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally many modern cars will have additional seatbelt pretentioners that deploy when they detect a collision and actively pull the seatbelts tight (hopefully quicker than your body gets pulled forward). When those go off, you likely won't be able to pull the seatbelt out again until you get the seatbelt repaired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, and they use a small explosive to deploy that mechanism in a matter of milliseconds. There was a post the other day in /r/autos on this and in there was a link to some guys who do high speed videos on YouTube showing one deploying. Until maybe the last 10 yrs it was a spring under tension that was released.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation, but the mechanism is called an inertia reel, with a centrifugal clutch being a component of one. </p></div>		</li>
