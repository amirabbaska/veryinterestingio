			<div class="markdown"><p>There is, in fact, a max velocity you will hit falling from infinity at rest into an object via gravitation free fall, which happens to also be the escape velocity. So for Earth, if we removed the atmosphere and dropped something onto it the object will be going about 11km/s (this is ignoring the sun, I believe if you include it, it ends up being ~40km/s) </p>
<p>EDIT: As per the very good point below by /u/RobusEtCeleritas I've update the text to reflect this was from rest. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's only true if you fall from rest. Anyway this is not a &quot;terminal velocity&quot;, which refers to the maximum speed you can achieve when subject to some velocity-dependent drag force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, if you start moving you can exceeed that. I misinterpreted as starting from rest, as a skydiver would (at least in the verticle direction). I'll edit the original post to reflect that important distinction, thanks for pointing that out! </p></div>		</li>
