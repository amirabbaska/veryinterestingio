<p>You should also not reuse a bottle that has melted or has holes. This could potentially be dangerous. You might spill your drink and trip in the puddle.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's plenty of shit that's sold but unsafe and have been plenty of things sold that we have later found to be unsafe. Asbestos weednfeed(I think it was called) cigarettes lead based products all sorts of shit we have later discovered are fucking horrible for us and sometimes established industry fight to not have the products removed or out right lie and cheat to keep the truth hidden.</p>
<p>Don't assume shits safe just because someone says so, it's never unreasonable to question as long as you keep an open mind. Like Di hydrogen Mon oxide my be a perfectly safe chemical regardless of what Facebook says. </p></div>		</li>
