			<div class="markdown"><p>It's immune related- overly vigorous immune response to minor trauma -I used to get them a lot (especially after eating nuts) and feared them.   Dermatologist gave me prescription-strength topical steroid to put on them to decrease maladaptive immune response. They go away muy rapido now , and I don't seem to get them as much.  Your mileage may vary.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get them after I bite my lip too, but I think there are other causes too.  The way I understand it (after reading about canker sores in order to find a cure/help healing) is that scientists think there are a bunch of different kinds of canker sores that have similar symptoms but are possibly caused by different things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's immune related.   Overly vigorous immune response to minor trauma.  Possibly because the mouth is fairly dirty and prone to minor trauma, the body errs on the side of caution and overdoes it leading to incredibly painful ulcers.  Hydrogen peroxide helps a little bit, so does avoiding nuts, but there is nothing like a prescription strength topical steroid (like cortisone, only industrial strength) to put on those suckers.   Three treatments a day and I usually forget the 3rd treatment because they are feeling SO much better.   They go away muy rapido now, and I don't get them as often.  Your mileage may vary.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so.  There are several kinds of T-Cells, one kind is allergen related (histamine response), but I don't think that kind is involved in canker sores.  But I'm not an immunologist, so take that with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Anti-histamines aren't going to hurt if you follow the instructions on the box tho, so give it a shot.</p></div>		</li>
