			<div class="markdown"><p>It is growing fatser and faster, eventually so fast that the distance between galaxy superclusters will increase at a rate exceeding the speed of light. At that point, the night sky will appear totally dark except for a few points for any human that would still exists.   </p>

<p>Theoretically couldn't we travel between clusters with wormhole technology? The video only accounts for traveling with propulsion engines.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Whatever the length of the rope and the relative speeds of the ant and the stretching, <strong>providing the ant's speed and the stretching remain steady</strong> the ant will always be able to reach the end given sufficient time.</p>

<p>since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe" target="_blank">the universe appears to be expanding at an increasing rate</a>, i don't think the ant gets to the end of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would there not be a point where the combined mass of everything in the universe would exert enough gravitational force to pull you back, much like an orbit? I always think of that one Vsauce video on the topic of a flat Earth, and how travelling toward the edge would become increasingly difficult as you get pulled toward the center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>absolutely! except just you wouldn't get pulled back, the entire universe would. and then it would get destroyed.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch" target="_blank">the Big Crunch</a> is one theory for the end of the universe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the universe's expansion speed does not exceed the escape velocity, then the mutual gravitational attraction of all its matter will eventually cause it to contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>edit: this could end up with a singularity (black hole) that could spawn another big bang and create another expanding universe. i think there are theories that it might recreate our specific universe, and we are reliving the same timeline over and over again. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>how would that (big crunch) be possible if the spacetime eventually expands faster than speed of light, and the objects with mass can't move faster than speed of light, so gravitational attraction would not matter? basically the matter would continue to &quot;fall&quot; towards the center of mass of the universe but never reach it because new space will keep appearing faster? am i missing something or is this exactly what is covered by &quot;expansion speed does not exceed the escape velocity&quot; clause â€” basically lightspeed is the escape velocity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard of the Big Crunch but never associated it with gravity. Can gravity have the same kind of physical effect on space as it does on matter? That seems... counterintuitive.</p></div>		</li>
