<p>Entanglement that is not maximal is also called partial entanglement.</p>
<p>Measuring a quantum particle is a bit like doing a strange coin flip.</p>
<p>If two particles are not entangled with each other, then measuring them is like flipping two independent coins: Knowing the result of measuring one doesn't change the expected result of measuring the other at all.</p>
<p>If two particles are maximally entangled with each other, then measuring both of them is like flipping one coin: once you've measured one, you know what the other one will be.</p>
<p>If two particles are partially entangled with each other, then measuring both of them is somewhere in-between: Knowing the result of measuring one changes what you expect a measurement of the other one to be, but it doesn't make you certain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that an important thing to note about entanglement is the following: say you have two entangled particles, if i measure one and you measure the other, we will agree on the answer. This is different from saying that I measure my particle and therefore I cause your particle to be a certain way. </p>
<p>For example, say in the lab frame I measure my particle first and then you measure yours. One might say that my measurement forced your particle to be a certain way. However, imagine a different observer moving close to the speed of light, in their frame you measure first and therefore they claim that your measurement caused my particle to change. This is what I mean by we agree on measurement, there is no causality. </p>
<p>Just a note. Obviously this doesn't have much to do with the original question but it is a nuanced thing about entanglement which I find cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What exactly do you mean by &quot;used as a communication method&quot;?</p>
<p>While certain interpretations of QE imply that some sort of information transfer is happening behind the scenes, entangled particles (even in the simplest pairwise entanglement) can <em>not</em> be used as a communication method; the behavior of one particle is indistinguishable from a random unentangled particle unless you receive the full information from the other particle in some other way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Partial entanglement can be used in things like quantum key exchange or bell test experiments.</p></div>		</li>
