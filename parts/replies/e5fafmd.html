			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd need a very good telescope indeed--and a very large one.</p>
<p>At 200 lightyears, being able to resolve objects spaced even a meter apart would require a resolution of about 1.09&times;10^(-13) arcseconds. Using diffraction-limited optics, your superscope will need a primary mirror at least 91.7 million kilometers across. Or 9.17 <em>billion</em> kilometers across, if you want one-centimeter resolution. Ten kilometer resolution, enough to see cities, would only require a 9,170 kilometer mirror.</p>
<p>Still, you should go ahead and spring for the heavy-duty tripod though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a physical limitation due to the physics involved.</p>
<p>For brightness: Think of a light bulb sending off 1 million photons in a big sphere radiating away from itself. If you were 10 feet away, youd collect quite a lot of them. But if you were 20 feet away, you dont collect half as much, you collect one quarter. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">inverse square law</a>. As you get further away, even less of the light reaches you. If you are lightyears away, so few photons reach you that your &quot;photon catching net&quot; needs to be insanely huge in order to collect enough to form a bright enough image to see. Things like stars give off so much light that we're still able to see them at incredible distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are these calculations based on technology we have today, or is this just a general calculation that no matter how much technology we have, the fact would be we'd need a 9 billion kilometer wide telescope?  I know you mentioned diffraction-limited optics, not sure if that answers my question and I just don't know enough to know that it does lol</p>
<p>The reason I'm asking is if you think of the televisions from the 90's when I was young, they were big (say, 50&quot; or so and square), but the resolution was terrible (about 480p), now we have smart screens on our phones that are 4-5&quot; and have 2k resolution at nearly 600 ppi.</p>
<p>If say in 100 years the trend keeps going, could this 9 billion kilometer wide telescope possibly be, say, 30-40 meters wide, or again, is your calculations not limited by technology?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution" target="_blank">Angular resolution</a> is limited by the nature of how electromagnetic waves propagate. It varies according to wavelength; my figures are for visible (specifically blue) light, and near-infrared light would require perhaps 25 times the aperture to achieve the same resolution.</p>
<p>You can enhance the resolution of acquired images with modern image processing techniques such as deconvolution of the point spread function, but <em>CSI:Miami</em>-level &quot;enhancement&quot; is still science fiction and probably always will be.</p>
<p>That being said, a 40-meter telescope might someday be able to <em>detect</em> a brightly-illuminated city on the dark side of a planet 200 light years away, but it would not be able to <em>visually distinguish</em> two such cities a few kilometers apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say we did have a telescope that is, 50 light-years out there and can relay back info to us and has mad zoom capabilities. Can we see a city as it was 50 years back. Like if I zoom into a racetrack. Will I be able to see the race that took place 50 years back?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, the telescope would see things that were 50 years old from when it took the picture, but since you can't send the telescope out there in any less than 50 years, you'll never be able to see into the past. If you magically send it out at light speed, then it takes a picture and send it to you, the image will be of the time you sent the telescope out, and you'll get to see it 50 years after that. Or in other words it will be a digital mirror. </p>
<p>Upon some reading, the quasar is only active on the order of millions of years. That might be enough to get life started, but probably not to get some weird civilization of intelligent beings evolved just in time for their sun to disappear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of problems:  </p>
<ol>
<li>The sun is way brighter than the earth. 50 light-years out it will overwhelm the light from earth.  </li>
<li>The earth spins. Your window to see the earth from a telescope would be very limited.  </li>
<li>The motion of the earth, in both, its orbit and spin would make the picture very blurry if you were tracking a city.  </li>
<li>The atmosphere would also add distortion. This is why we have telescopes on top of mountains and in space for looking further away.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that there was a massive telescope that would let you zoom at a 1800's town and it's people - how is it possible that you would see people walking and doing their chores, considering that a person reflects a limited amount of photons and each goes in a different direction - which at a massive distance means that they are spreading to different regions of the universe?</p>
<p>In fact, shouldn't that be a factor also when looking  at big objects billions of light-years away? Even with a couple of lenses side by side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's counter-intuitive, but the definition of &quot;brightness&quot; that matters here does not actually go down with distance. The amount of flux you get <em>per square degree of view</em> is constant, excluding stuff like dust in the way etc. That's way a wall doesn't get hugely bright when you place your eyes against it.</p>
<p>So yeah, the <em>total</em> flux you get from an object decreases as 1/distance^(2). But if it's a resolved object, that emission is spread out of some number of square degrees of sky. If the object is 2x closer, then you get 4x as much flux, but it's also spread out over 4x as much of the sky, so the actual brightness in terms of flux per square degree of sky is constant. And that definition of brightness is actually the natural one that we use to say how bright something is - for the reason I stated above, that using the total flux means that a wall gets &quot;brighter&quot; if you are closer to it, which isn't the case.</p>
<p>However, this is only for the peak brightness you can get with a telescope. The brightness you see through a telescope depends on the magnification, provided you want your image to be in focus. There is a peak brightness you can see at a certain level of magnification, and the bigger the telescope, the higher magnification you can get at this peak brightness. So you do want to have a big telescope, to make sure you can get enough magnification without making the image really dim, but also to make sure you have enough resolution to actually see anything. Of course you can just take a really long image if it's too dim, although you won't see much detail if you're trying to photograph individual people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply, but my question was probably more basic or dumb than you realized. I meant that if a surface reflects light - and if<br />
light is particles/waves, and there's say 1 million photons that spread like billiard balls, each to a different direction, so they would spread so thin, that there is no coherent image to see. Or is there some physical reason that makes the photons to &quot;stay in shape&quot;?</p></div>		</li>
