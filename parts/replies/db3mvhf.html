<p>This doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about chemistry to dispute it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guano" target="_blank">guano</a> is basically urine, but made for things with wings or scales that can't afford to carry gallons of water around. It's nitrogen waste (from protein) burned in oxygen until it's uric acid and other salts that can be &quot;squeezed&quot; out of the body without needing to be &quot;rinsed&quot; out. Your phosphate, carbonate, and nitrate salts are all burned to completion in oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So wait... Is it common to refer to this process as producing &quot;guano&quot;, even in the absence of animals?</p>
<p>Or do animals have such a massive impact on that process that they're contextually relevant?</p></div>		</li>
