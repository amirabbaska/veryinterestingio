			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the interesting info. As someone in a completely different field, I keep hearing news about the price of solar dropping, and also about increasing installations of offshore wind turbines. Is wind technology improving at a similar rate to solar tech?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, wind is improving fast too, but not as fast as solar. With wind, everyone's basically settled on the design (three blade, horizontal axis) as the most efficient in most circumstances, so all you can really do is reduce component weights, improve control systems and, most importantly, increase scale. The power output correlates with the swept blade area, so if you increase the overall height of a turbine you get much more power output per unit of resource used, if you see what I mean. This is why the trend is for bigger and bigger turbines.</p>
<p>With solar, it's much more high tech, so there's a lot more things you can do. E.g. different doping of materials, different techniques for surface treatment, techniques like atomic layer deposition to deposit really thin layers of material and save on resources, and completely different chemistries entirely (i.e. non-silicon based panels). So generally speaking there's more space for innovation within solar.</p>
<p>Having said that the major driver of solar cost reduction in recent years hasn't been technological improvement, it's been production moving from Germany/Japan/USA to China.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you're the right person or this is the right place to ask but I've been curious about this. </p>
<p>With the non-silicon materials (GaAs?) are there any concerns about heavy metals polluting the environment and groundwater near the fabs? How does that compare to say, coal extraction or fracking? </p>
<p>And this is more of an economic question, but do you know what percentage of the total cost of solar is covered by government subsidies (as far as the utilities installing the plants are concerned)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth saying, offshore wind prices have halved in the UK over the last five years, the learning curve for wind is generally considered to be lower than solar, but not by much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you look at how solar fits into the wider power network? A simple kWh analysis misses the point. Capacity requirements are as important if not more so than a simple energy analysis.</p>
<p>The difference in output from a solar panel isn't the main reason that solar panels are much better in spain than the UK. It's because peak power in Spain coincides with the time that solar panels are generating. </p>
<p>Solar panels make a real contribution to capacity requirements in cooling peak systems. <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjai9_ApOLXAhVBRZQKHTkEARAQjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Freneweconomy.com.au%2Fsummer-on-the-nem-what-the-extreme-heat-didnt-do-to-demand-76173%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw34W4KZ27RnPG-YNEk4yIYd&amp;ust=1511993367762049" target="_blank">This is summer South Australia demand showing how Solar has reduced peak requirements.</a></p>
<p>That's a real benefit. Solar in the UK doesn't help with peak requirements because it's a heating peak system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. And this is one reason the UK is better suited to wind power, since we get more wind in winter when demand for heat is higher.</p>
<p>It's very difficult to do the kind of analysis you're talking about because there are all sorts of confounding factors and non-linear parameters, but it's a key area of research at the moment, so you can expect more developments soon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For sure. I'm currently putting many non-billable hours into making a system model to try to answer these sorts of questions. Hopefully it'll pay off in the future. I'd link you some of the stuff we've done but don't really want to dox myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't heating be done almost entirely with insulation if the cost of energy is high enough? One of my builder contacts makes passive houses.  They have a 500W air exchanger and a heated bathroom tile floor (another 500W on a thermostat+timer) Some people go crazy and add a 100W towel rack.</p>
<p>But the point being that heat is easy, but historically it has been done poorly because coal/electricity/N. Gas is so cheap</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if it is easy for new builds it is still a large upfront cost, and retrofitting old buildings can be extremely costly.  Industrial buildings as well can be tricky, as they are often large open structures with many heat sources (maybe intermittent).</p>
<p>The future will certainly be better but unless energy costs skyrocket it will be a long time until retrofitting existing structures becomes a priority.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, you're the perfect type of expert to ask this question I've wanted answered for a long time to!</p>
<p>So electric and hybrid vehicles use less energy to travel more miles. But is it still better for the environment to buy a new electric or hybrid vehicle, than it is to buy a used diesel/petrol vehicle and keep it running as long as possible? I'm all for electric cars and plan to own one someday, but I find it hard to believe that buying a brand new product is still better than re-using someone's old vehicle and running it until it's dead. </p>
<p>Considering the impacts of gathering raw materials, transporting, and manufacturing, let alone the impacts of producing electricity to charge these vehicles (which will be more or less depending on the area and how electricity is produced there), should we all be buying new things or using old things until they die first? Also, to buy a new vehicle means that  used vehicle goes to waste. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, it's better to buy a new car. The idea that we should continue running old vehicles is a bit of a popular myth (I think Top Gear may be guilty of pushing this one... I love those guys but they're bloody useless when it comes to anything environmental). Most assessments show that roughly 80% of the life cycle environmental impact of an internal combustion vehicle comes from actually running it: bear in mind that it's not just tailpipe emissions we need to think about, but all the emissions associated with extracting, refining and transporting oil too. So the longer you run that vehicle, the more you're simply extending the major component of its environmental impact.</p>
<p>You may find some more useful info on this stuff <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Your point about producing the electricity is true, but unless you live somewhere that's extremely reliant on coal it's still likely that electric cars are better (far more efficient overall energy chain).</p>
<p>Oh and finally, bear in mind that recycling levels are very high for end-of-life vehicles, so when you dispose of an old car the scrap yard will typically recover about 90% of the material and pass it on to recyclers.</p></div>		</li>

I found it quite interesting, you might too, but be aware of two flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it's only based on CO2 emissions,</p>
</li>
<li>the emissions from the production of the batteries are excluded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: Formatting..</p>
<p>Edit 2: another thing to consider: like /u/FigRollLife said about solar panels, there is probably much more room for improvement in the domain of electric vehicles that gas-powered ones</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice comparison, very useful. But omitting the batteries...</p>
<p>I'd expect the batteries to be the main contributor to production emissions and end of life emissions. It feels as if excluding them skews the numbers. Akin to excluding the coal from steam engine emissions.</p></div>		</li>
