<p>This is really key. Humans are extremely prone to permanent migration, even over great distances. That's why we are now found all over the earth; it's also why our populations keep mixing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, In answer to OP, There may have been subspecies once, But we fucked and killed them all out of extinction due to our constant relocation and moving.</p>
<p>The one story that stands out to is the fact that many Tibetans are genetically related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisovan" target="_blank">Denisovans</a>. Perhaps it's still prominent is because they haven't mixed as much with others, due to the acclimatization required to live where they do.</p>
<p>I wonder if certain tribal cultures around the world could be prominently related to a specific hominid that once lived. I think ultimately that would give us an understanding of what we are and why we look so different, yet very similar.</p></div>		</li>
