			<div class="markdown"><p>I hadn't heard of it before either. &quot;Normally&quot; it's not something that comes up. My doctor was originally diagnosing shift worker disorder (I work overnight) until realizing the switch to nights had been made because I was awake all night anyhow... My doctor actually made a joke about me being sure I'm not allergic to garlic or have a problem with sunlight.</p>
<p>I have been on amitriptyline for a few months now, and take that in combination with melatonin, magnesium, and vitamin D. My doctor has approved this, and with enough activity I am able to fall and stay asleep for about 4-6 hours.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the reason you sleep is to rid your body of adenosine, and you don't produce that much, not sleeping should be fine for you right? Do you feel tired or groggy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem comes in that the adenosine production happens while you are awake, period. It builds up and can have detrimental effects on your system when levels get too high. (Think hallucinations from sleep deprivation, mania, extreme emotional responses such as tears or anger.) For my system in particular, the adenosine levels have to be extremely high for melatonin production to be enough to keep me down. I just don't produce enough to get the sleep my body needs. Unmedicated, I would sleep for 9-10 hours once a week, for an averaged amount of 2-3 hours a day. I could be physically exhausted (adenosine buildup) but not be able to shut my brain off enough to sleep for more than a few hours. I do apparently process/purge adenosine fairly quickly, but if I cannot both physically and mentally shut down, at the same time, I end up in a vicious circle. Sleep being necessary for your body to repair any damages done while awake, a lack of sleep like that can have some very negative long term effects. </p></div>		</li>
