			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding to this I think a common thought people have is that the theory of evolution means that any specific trait you looked at evolved because it was strictly advantageous so they assume there must be a good reason to pick scabs if they itch. But it could be the case that we only evolved itching for other reasons like removing insects and dirt, and the fact that it also leads to us picking scabs isn't a beneficial thing on its own, it's just that not having an itch reflex at all was worse. </p></div>		</li>
