			<div class="markdown"><p>That would also make sense with why it seems to get worse as you get older. I used to think the old people around me were just being jerks, but as I am encroaching on middle age, it just gets worse. </p>
<p>And it's not an &quot;If it's too loud, you're too old&quot; thing, because I'm a metalhead and the music that gives me a headache is generally hippie shit. (So the opposite should be true.) </p>
<p>But learning becomes more difficult and takes up more resources as you age past 30, so this explains a lot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I was cleaning up the house with my girlfriend yesterday and on a normal day I'm happy listening to metal, rock, punk and the like. She's decided to clean to the sounds of Mumford and Sons and whatever similar bullshit IheartRadio can churn out. I was near tearing my hair out listening to it. I could see the knitted cardigans in my mind's eye as I cleaned. Hell on earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least it wasn't this new age pop-country or hip hop/rap. While I'm open to most music, I draw the line at that shit and we're gonna clash if we date. Common ground in music taste is a little bit of a factor for me. Not be-all-end-all, but it is a factor. It sounds shallow, I know. But it's true.</p>
<p>I went on a date with a girl over the summer that was into that new age pop-country, hip hop and other horrible (IMO) forms of &quot;music&quot;. I figured this out when she decided to play this stuff from her phone while we were smoking in the garage at a party. I'm thinking....&quot;Well, I guess we're not compatible in that box either.&quot; <em>(There were a couple other &quot;boxes&quot; in which I don't think we were compatible, and even though she's a nice girl and she's cute and we got on alright, I think we would've clashed in a few areas, had we taken things to a serious level.)</em></p>
<p>So, when I drove her home, I plugged in my phone and cranked Pantera's &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; on the whole ride back.......</p>
<p>Because I'm a dude that lives, breathes and sleeps metal.</p>
<p>She didn't object to it, surprisingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Annecdotally, when I was in middle school, I intentionally listened to pop and rap music that I couldn't stand to be able to relate to my peers. It took some time, but I got used to it and started to enjoy it. I've done the same thing since to indulge boyfriends and try to widen my horizons. However, the older I get, the less patience/inclination I have to try to enjoy things that I find unenjoyable just because someone else is into it. </p>
<p>Call it self esteem or the intolerance of adulthood, but I tend to stick to the music I enjoy and don't really try to develop interest in the kind I don't. I have found myself won over by music I don't like after hearing it semi-frequently (but not often enough to really hate it). </p>
<p>So maybe it has more to do with exposure than the brain's propensity to learn. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This boils down to whether you pursue music.  People who listen to one genre or indeed only a few bands for the majority of thier adult life, are not pursuing music for the love of music, but rather music for comfort.</p>
<p>Comfort music people end up listening to &quot;classic golden hits of YOUR genre radio from YOUR youth FM!&quot;  And calming there is &quot;no good music these days.&quot;</p>
<p>While people who like to discover new music and have open tastes...  They are aware there is great new music released all the time, and it doesn't give you a headache or belong to &quot;the kids.&quot;</p>
<p>tldr:</p>
<p>Only people that listen to the same 3 bands all their life do the &quot;old people hate new music&quot; thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find that I hardly ever like a piece of music the first time I hear it. When I find a great track by a band I've never known existed, I go to check out the whole album, and what do you know - I don't care for it at all. However, if I wait a couple of days and come back, it may turn out that I actually do enjoy the whole album.</p>
<p>I'm trying to find new music that I like all the time, and yet it seems like I'm very susceptible to this &quot;predictable music&quot; effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say I'm passionate about music and try to discover new bands to listen to. This year I've got really into Ezra Furman and Goat, neither of whom I'd listened to before.</p>
<p>However, I do feel like as I get older pop music gets worse and worse and a lot if it is intolerable noise. In particular I really cant understand the current craze for Grime in the UK at all.</p>
<p>For me what you say doesn't ring true. And it's not like I limit myself to one genre. Whilst 90% of the music I like is guitar based there is a big variety within that (from Harry Chapin to Metallica) and I also listen to some electronic music and a few bands I like I don't think even fit nicely into a specific genre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I lean much further toward the latter. I simply like listening to music.</p>
<p>Sure there are some I like more / less than others, but I can and will listen to just about anything. I'm not really a fan of modern country (I prefer the more bluesy-folky kind to the more poppy of late), but my brother likes it, so I'll listen to it when I'm with him.</p>
<p>Recently, I've gotten into &quot;Electro Swing&quot;, which is, as the name states, a mashup of electronica with swing music. There's always something new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's likely you can't hear the music correctly. Your taste in music gets set in your early teens, and you get accustomed to that genre, those songs. As you age, your ears get fucked up, and it becomes increasingly difficult to hear and understand music you aren't used to. &quot;Your music&quot; is generally stuff you're familiar enough with that your brain can fill in gaps where your hearing fails. This is actually why older people are always complaining about the next generations' music.  </p></div>		</li>
