<p>Actually, I disagree. If the male lion doing the taking over/cub-killing has enhanced physical characteristics compared to the previous head of the pride, then his offspring will have enhanced physical characteristics as well.</p>
<p>The reason that lions kill the cubs of the previous head of the pride is to make the females go back into heat.</p></div>		</li>
