			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered about scenes in fiction where there is a poison and a antidote . For example in Indiana Jones 2 opening scene, Indy is slipped a poison by the villain and then has to get the antidote. Is there any realism in that? Are there antidotes that completely reverse the effects of a poison?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes for example if you are dying from an opiate overdose (coedine, heroin, etc) you are given Narcan. In simple terms it goes to every receptor that has bonded with the opiate and kicks it out. It's an incredibly painful sensation apparently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually doesn't kick them out, it just stops the receptors from essentially 'receiving' information, effectively neutralizing them. This is why you're kept in the hospital for at least 6 hours after an overdose, after the narcan wears off the the heroin becomes active again and if you did enough you can start to overdose again. Unfortunately I've been forced to become an expert on this garbage, I lost both of my sisters to overdose last year and it has really directed my career.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Narcan (naloxone) is an opioid receptor antagonist meaning it changes the conformation of the opioid receptor so that other opioids cannot bind to it.  Recreational opioids are agonists meaning they bind to the opioid receptor, thereby activating it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've ingested methanol, a way to keep it from killing you is ethanol. </p>
<p>See, the same process the human body uses to digest ethanol (the alcohol in alcoholic beverages) will latch onto methanol, which is a different alcohol. Problem: when fed methanol, this process produces stuff that will kill you dead (formaldehyde and formic acid). Solution: in the presence of both, that process will consume the ethanol first, letting the methanol work its way out of your liver without being processed, where you'll proceed to piss it out. </p>
<p>Note: fomepizole will do the same thing as ethanol here, but if it's unavailable, ethanol will do the trick. Just call emergency services, they'll know that to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are definitely poisons and antidotes - atropine <em>is</em> the antidote if you have been poisoned by sarin. The problem is generally dosage - you can't just cure someone completely with no danger unless you know how much to give them, because the antidote may well be harmful if you give too much, or ineffective if you give too little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anesthetist here. In anesthesia the medications glycopyrrolate (very similar to atropine) and neostigmine are intentionally (and very commonly) given together to reverse neuromuscular blockades. As you can imagine, anesthesia trainees are constantly reminded to give both drugs. </p>
<p>In healthcare, dextrose and insulin are also given together to temporarily lower dangerously high potassium levels. Giving one without the other can be dangerous - particularly insulin without dextrose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question for you if you don't mind. I recently had a pneumothorax surgery and when I came out and finally woke up (3hours after the 45min window they gave my SO), I felt fine for about 45 seconds. Then I had a fit essentially where my body was violently shaking and I could not control it. Three nurses came by to hold me down and gave me a shot of something in my iv. What caused that and what was given to me? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anesthesiologist here - shaking after anesthesia is a relatively common thing with some dispute over what causes it. Top theories are low body temperature (anesthesia changes your temperature regulation so you don't vasoconstrict to maintain temperature in a colder environment), pain, or a reaction to the anesthetics themselves. Studies are mixed on the cause.</p>
<p>They gave you a narcotic, likely Demerol because it has the strongest effect on shaking. The shaking is uncomfortable and can raise your metabolic rate so they're usually on top of it right away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why don't they mix the two drugs?  Or package them in a way that makes you have to go out of your way to administer one without the other?</p>
<p>It seems like packaging them separately is just creating an opportunity for human error.  I'm a software engineer, not a medical professional, but whenever I see training where you have to say &quot;always remember to do X&quot;, that just screams automation to me.  There are some things that human beings are naturally horrible at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My speculative response is that perhaps the safe &amp; effective ratio between the two drugs varies from person to person based on metabolism, size, age, etc.  As far as I know, anesthetists make the big bucks because they have to formulate and maintain a unique dosage for every single patient, and failing to get it just right is lethal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is they absolutely do - for this indication. For other uses of the two drugs, they are packaged separately. For reversal of neuromuscular blockade, the relative doses are about 1:5 to work for most people, in special situations, you might make your own recipe, but this is really quite unusual. Here is a photo of the vials the hospitals I have worked in use (could only find a pic with pethidine too): <a href="http://www.respond2articles.com/ANA/forums/storage/32893/1339/pethglyc.JPG" target="_blank">http://www.respond2articles.com/ANA/forums/storage/32893/1339/pethglyc.JPG</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which drugs are you talking about, glycopyyrolate and neostigmine, or insulin and dextrose?</p>
<p>I think it's just practicality really. Both insulin and dextrose are used individually in patients. To mix them together would mean you can literally only use them for the purposes of treating high potassium. Insulin probably also has a lower shelf life than something as basic as dextrose, and when you combine them and only use them for high potassium, you limit its useability and so the shelf life may come into play more.</p>
<p>As for glycopyrrolate, again this has other uses, since it typically reduces respiratory secretions it isn't always given together with neostigmine. Indeed in the setting of end of life care, glycopyrrolate is used for terminal patients precisely to reduce respiratory secretions and make the patient more comfortable. So again, combining them restrict their use to specific indications, whereas keeping them separate may require two syringes, but broadens its useability and ultimately will be cheaper for the hospital.</p>
<p>Aside from those considerations, dosing may also come into play, as it allows you to precisely vary how much you want to administer of each. Granted for insulin/dextrose in hyperkalaemia there is a set protocol/guideline (10 Units of soluble insulin in 50mL of 50% dextrose), but guidelines can be different in different locations/hospitals so increased flexibility is definitely useful.</p></div>		</li>
