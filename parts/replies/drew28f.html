<p>The slope of the beam (change in deflection per unit length) is the integral of the bending moment/torque</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This integral leaves you with the total deflection - does that mean the changing the average deflection takes the same amount of force? Flexibility is a material property, so apparent change in flexibility would either be an illusion or require a change in the material - but with that said, the material would change if it deforms permanently, and the deflection alone wouldn't tell you how much is stored like a spring and how much is spent deforming, heating, etc. (and springiness is certainly dependent on those two.) This is a bit too much for me to reason through.</p>
<p>I was hoping I could use the units alone to figure this out, but I don't have a great experience with dimensional analysis - one time I had a long argument with a TA over whether or not radians were a unit (I said they were) and each of us had decent examples. They're listed as the derived unit m*m^(-1) on the SI wiki page, which is a bit vindicating, but the page on radians says they're unitless in dimensional analysis - wouldn't distinguishing steradians from radians be just as important as distinguishing area from length? I do strongly-typed programming these days and it only bothers me more that elimination isn't universally right or wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually get a function when you integrate. For the 200 ft beam, I would integrate my moment function (times a constant representing material properties) from 0 to x, where x is my axial position. I would then end up with an equation for slope in terms of x. Integrating again gives an equation for deflection in terms of x.</p>
<p>As for the average deflection, it depends not only on the amount of force but also its point of application. For example, pushing down at the end of a beam results in a lot more deflection than pushing down near the base.  You could make the average deflection of the two beams match by moving the force on the long beam, but the deflection function would be different.</p>
<p>For examples of what these functions look like for different load cases, I recommend checking out an undergraduate Mechanics of Materials book. I have one by Hibbeler that has a nice chart at the back. You can also get some results if you Google “slopes and deflections of beams.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I'll check that book out. For simplicity's sake I was imagining the forces applied at the endpoint exactly perpendicular, and using the average deflection so that the distribution of the deflection doesn't impact the comparison. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it means it would take the same amount of moment/torque (force times length of lever) thus much less force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps Im misunderstanding, but this applies for cantilevered beams. While OP asked about railroad beams, which have multiple continuous support.</p>
<p>I guess that while you are correct, you are not answering OP question.</p>
<p>In Op scenario, the bending occurs only dependant of the module of elasticity of the material. Is that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure if OP meant something cantilevered or something with multiple points of support. If it is the latter case, the problem becomes more complicated as it would be statically indeterminate and you would have to apply some more advanced methods to determine the reaction forces at each point, but the basic principle of integrating the bending moment remains the same.</p>
<p>You also have the weight of the beam itself, which is of course larger in the longer case. Its relative contribution to the overall deflection will depend on how large the applied load is compared to the weight.</p>
<p>The modulus of elasticity of the material is independent of the size of the beam, so that is not the distinguishing factor between the two cases.  It would come down to the weight of the structure and the bending moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is totally oposite. Because a railroad beam is supported ontinually by the floor. </p>
<p>The bending is not aligned to gravity, nor is it bending by its own weight. </p>
