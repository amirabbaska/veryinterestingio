			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Photons are mediators of force, so splitting them only results in smaller energy versions of themselves. The other posts here are not getting to this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You cannot &quot;split&quot; a photon.</p>
<p>Various processes will absorb a photon and emit two photons. This is akin to turning a $20 bill into two $10 bills. You cannot cut a $20 into two pieces worth $10 each, but you can use a cashier to convert one into the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me if any of this is silly, but can you give me a quick confirmation that I have this right?</p>
<p>Photons are essentially points, and don't have mass. But they do have a probability density like other particles, right? Wavelength being the measurement we use for a photon's energy level, does that probability density change with different energy levels? Do lower-energy photons have a wider probability density or am I still wrongly trying to impose ideas which involve mass onto this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about gravitons, but it <em>is</em> the same for quarks/gluons. The mechanisms involved are a bit different since these are strong force interactions, but the effect is similar. If you try splitting up quarks - in a particle accellerator for instance - by increasing the collision energy, all you will get are more and more quarks/gluons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sightly related question. Current solar panels work by having one photon hit the cell with enough energy to excite one electron. What is the reason we can't put a crystal in front of a solar cell in order to split the high-energy photons into 2 lower-energy photons, both of which are still capable of exciting one electron each, thereby generating twice the current per photon? Would there just be too much reduction in energy from each split photon to result in excitation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photons with longer wavelengths have less energy, and when they excite an electron, they transfer less energy to it.</p>
<p>If you split a photon into two with longer wavelengths (conserving energy), each will have half the energy of the first to transfer to an electron.</p>
<p>In the worst case, the photon would be of long enough wavelength that it wouldn't have enough energy to excite an electron, so it would just be transferred into the material as a vibration in the crystal and be dissipated as heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary reason is that parametric downconversion like second harmonic generation is a GROSSLY inefficient nonlinear process at conventional (low) light intensities. For instance, in order to get substantial (eg. 30%) efficiency in a typical SHG system one needs megawatt or even gigawatt scale pulses of laser light.</p>
<p>Second, the material used to convert light in this manner is HIGHLY expensive and exotic single crystal material such as bismuth barium borate, periodically poled deuterated potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and lithium niobate. Therefore it will be completely impractical to use for something like solar power. However you can use the property of <a href="http://phys.org/news/2013-05-fluorescent-future-solar-cells.html" target="_blank">fluorescent materials</a> called the Stokes-shift to absorb high energy photons and re-emit them closer to the peak absorbance of the semiconducting photovoltaic material's band-gap to potentially increase overall efficiency of the system.</p>
<p>Conversely, one may bypass the entire process of converting high energy photons into more efficiently electrically converted low energy photons before being absorbed by the solar cell, and instead try to use the high energy photons directly to create multiple excitons in the PV's <del>recombination</del> depletion layer. A process called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_exciton_generation" target="_blank">multiple exciton generation</a></strong> which has attracted considerable increasing interest in recent years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, my senior design project at Uni involved simulations of various graphene lattices with the goal of multiple exciton generation. It would certainly be a major breakthrough.</p>
<p>Anyway, you gave a great answer, thank you!</p></div>		</li>

<p>AFAIK, there hasn't been any significant or commercial progress on this in the last few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (they are bosons), so two photons can occupy the same quantum state. This is what happens when you have constructive interference. So two photons can essentially become one photon, which you can then split as described above.</p></div>		</li>
