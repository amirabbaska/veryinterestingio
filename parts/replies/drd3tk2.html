			<div class="markdown"><p>some metal is safe. however it is easier to say no metal is safe rather than explain to the general public what is safe and what is not. i was surprised when my convection microwave came with a metal rack that can be used in both modes.</p>
<p>metal is dangerous not because it overheats but because it reflects microwaves. your spoon is inside the liquid so the energy is absorbed before it even gets to the spoon. if you used a metal cup however, or wrapped food in foil, the reflected waves have nowhere to be absorbed and so reflect back to the magnetron which can damage it. same as running an empty microwave. </p>
<p>another problem is metal objects gain an electrical charge. any sharp or pointed metal edges will induce sparks and arcing between a metal object and the walls of the microwave which can damage both. literally burning holes in the walls. the metal rack i mentioned came with my microwave has all rounded edges and the legs have rubber feet so they cannot arc.</p></div>		</li>
