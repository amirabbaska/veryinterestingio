<p>Number of times you can read/write to the memory can also vary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spot on.</p>
<p>V90 for instance is required for 8k recording, from a quality brand you're going to be paying $150+ for 128 gigs with a 300MB/s speed. Where as for cell phone use, or general storage, the same capacity can be had for $40.</p>
<p>It's not an insignificant difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Random speed is definitely a statistic worth looking for - a lot of USB sticks are atrocious for random writes, which makes copying a folder full of smaller files a very slow operation even on a &quot;fast USB 3.0&quot; stick.</p>
<p>Personally I have two Sandisk Extreme 3.0 sticks, which have random write speeds of close to 10 MB/s (~&gt;2000 IOPS) when <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/usb-3.0-thumb-drive-review,3477-3.html" target="_blank">many other USB sticks</a> drop to 0.01 MB/s (~3 IOPS) when doing random writes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Endurance (admittedly less a thing with thumb drives than with an internal SSD).  Increasing capacity and lowering price by moving to smaller nodes, and cramming more bits into a single cell (MLC&lt; TLC, QLC) both lower the amount of times the drive can be written to before it fails.  The number is high, but TLC and QLC lower that number by a lot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has had 6+ thumb drive failures in the last year, I would gladly pay triple the price for high quality memory.</p>
<p>They'll sit in my bag for a few months, then suddenly I need the OS image on them.  I put it in the drive, and see like 50 volumes of various sizes, of format &quot;RAW&quot; and nothing will mount.  Ugh.  This happens to me more often than the drive works.  I have tried several different brands to the same effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the above, I used to work in final packaging for a flash chip manufacturer and there are a couple of way. </p>
<p>You could add whole chips to a flash drive and get larger capacity or you can add individual dice to the package to get the same effect. Depending on the company, a 128gb chip could have a single 128gb die inside or two smaller 64gb die side by side. You can even stack them in a dozen different configurations for space savings. Just because it has laser marking for a specific size means nothing on what's on the inside.</p>
<p>Another way is to package say a 128gb die but at test there are too many cells that are dead and you mark it as a 64gb or something  smaller. Margins are so thin you save every package possible. </p>
<p>Then, you get to the interface protocols as mentioned above. Package designers and chip designers get very creative. We would buy parts from Best Buy or get engineering samples from distributors and decap them to see how it was assembled. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Mass market chips go for cheap and high capacity. Then you get into the more niche markets where customers care about transfer speed and reliability as much as, if not moreso, than capacity, and you can add a significant markup to the cost because enthusiasts will pay.</p></div>		</li>
