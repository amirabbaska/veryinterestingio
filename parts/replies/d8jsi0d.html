			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but only if the gif is randomly selected from a pool of all coin-flipping gifs, and only until the gif is selected.</p>
<p>Once the gif is selected, the outcome is determined, same as when the coin lands and stops moving in a traditional coin flip. At that point you're not dealing with probability anymore, but instead with your certainty of the outcome.</p>
<p>Also, if you get into the nitty-gritty, when selecting the gif, the pool is you're working with will probably not be &quot;all coin-flipping gifs&quot;. If you use Google, the pool is &quot;all coin-flipping gifs searchable via Google&quot;, which is different from &quot;all coin-flipping gifs&quot; or even &quot;all coin-flipping gifs on the internet&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a good point, and why I was vague in my wording. If I had said &quot;all gifs that exist on the internet&quot; then you would also have to condition on the probabilities of selecting different kinds of gifs. &quot;Distribution of gifs that you encounter&quot; would maybe be more accurate, but is a bit cumbersome. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair. Should've stated that I'm operating under that assumption. If I take that assumption away, though, we get into determinism vs indeterminism, and that's a whole other fish to fry.</p>
<p>Maybe it'd be better to say the outcome <em>has occurred</em>? Same effect, for the purpose of the point I'm trying to make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except we don't know the distribution of gifs either.</p>
<p>You're also assuming that the gif is selected from the gif pool with uniform probability, which is something else that we don't actually know.</p>
<p>In the Bayesian approach to probability it's perfectly acceptable to say that the odds are 50/50 when we have no additional information about the distribution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we can find the distribution of gifs because there is a finite amount. We could do some research and theoretically find every coin flip gif on the internet, and then the probability that the flip is heads is (# coin flip gifs where the result is heads)/(total # of coin flip gifs)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. If you randomly selecting one of two gifs - one head, one tail - the chance is 50/50. If you change the selection, you will get difference expected outcomes.</p></div>		</li>
