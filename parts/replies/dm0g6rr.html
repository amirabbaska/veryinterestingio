			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. We just chose 3 arbitrarily, it could have been any number. For it to not be 1/9, other numbers would have to be less or more likely to be the middle number, which makes no sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see you've changed the question around, to where the question that's really asked is 'are some specific numbers more favored to be in the middle square (or any certain square)?'.</p>
<p>The answer depends.  If you are only speaking about published puzzles in books and newspapers... there could be some kind of human bias in the puzzle maker or the selector of puzzles for which number happens to be in the middle.  For example, maybe 7 is in the middle more than other numbers because we associate that with a lucky number, so we see it and get happy thoughts.. I don't know... it could be anything like that.</p>
<p>Assuming that bias isn't there, the more general answer to the question is no.  No specific number favors any specific square for many of the arguments already outlined here.  I think the simplest argument is recognizing the fact that the numbers 1-9 in Sudoku do not represent any real world values.  They are just 9 squiggly symbols whose sole purpose is that they are all unique from each other in visual appearance.  Any 9 symbols will do.  You can play sudoku with A thru I, or make up 9 arbitrary symbols of your own.  If dad still doesn't buy it, you can take any finished Sudoku and subtract 1 from every number (turn 1 into a 9) and you can thus then have any number in any box you want by subtracting again and again and etc.  You can even have -1 thru -9, 101-109, -4 thru 4, etc etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That may help you see that none is favored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party but I think I see what OP's dad and math friend are saying.</p>
<p>For the sample of all Sudoku puzzles, the probability is 1/9 (from a purely-mathematical perspective, assuming no human bias).  However, every Sudoku puzzle begins partially filled in.  This of course changes the probabilities for the rows/columns/boxes to &gt; 1/9, which would affect the probability of a given number being in the middle.  Even putting a 1 in the corner and nothing else would change the probabilities for the entire puzzle.</p>
<p>But as most answers said - if you look at all Sudoku puzzles ever and assume a random distribution, it's 1/9 (9/81 for the board = 1/9, or just 1/9 for each row/column).  But the probability of a 3 being in the middle of an individual puzzle that you're sitting down to solve, yes, that's different not precisely quantifiable without seeing the puzzle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting perspective but you have to be careful how you frame the question. It seems to me that the best way to say it would be &quot;given a partially completed Sudoku puzzle, what is the probability that a valid solution to that puzzle has a 3 in the center square?&quot;</p>
<p>If you want to ask about the sample of all possible valid arrangements, start with a blank grid. This gives 1/9 as discussed above.</p>
<p>If you start with one taken from a book or newspaper or whatever, then it will have a unique solution. This means the probability of a 3 being in the middle is 0 or 1, since the puzzle is completely determined. You may not know which one it is, but that doesn't matter because in this case there is only one member of the sample population- the unique solution to the puzzle.</p>
<p>It gets interesting when you consider partially completed grids with more than one solution. For example, what happens if only one square is filled in? Well it depends, if that one square is the middle square and it's not a 3, then our probability is 0. If it's the middle square and it is a 3, then we get 1. If it's in the middle box of 9 squares and not a 3, then it's 1/8 because any of the 8 remaining numbers is equally likely. A 3 in the same position gives 0, since you can't have more than one 3 in the center box. Other squares will give more cases to consider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there may be a difference between the ensemble of all possible Sudoku grids, and the subset that gets put in newspapers. For example, the locations of the givens in basically every published sudoku puzzle are symmetric under 180 degree rotation, but there's no real reason for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely possible that there's some 'human bias' in selecting puzzles that results in the distribution of published puzzles being different than the theoretical distribution.</p>
<p>However, answering this question is not possible by just sitting around and using math.  You'd have to actually go out and collect published puzzles and then perform some statistics to see if a bias is detectable.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>There probably is - published puzzles on a newspaper are perhaps expected to be solvable, for example. Isn't the answer the same, regardless?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku" target="_blank">The arrangement of numbers in Sudoku puzzles have greater Shannon entropy than the number arrangements in randomly generated 9Ã—9 matrices because the rules of Sudoku exclude some random arrangements that have an innate symmetry.[27]</a></p>
<p>Perhaps due to this, some cells do indeed have greater probability to hold certain numbers? Or maybe one can 'cycle' the actual numbers while maintaining their relationships such that any number can go anywhere with equal likelihood and it is the relative positioning (mathematical relatively between any number of cells and any number of other cells) that is not random. </p>
<p>Suppose you wish to generate a sudoku. You decide on a shape by creating a 3x3 matrix of 3x3 matrices, which results in a 9x9 matrix. You begin inserting numbers are random, discarding any that break any rules of the game, render the puzzle unsolvable or allow for multiple solutions. You start with the middle cell and note its value as 0. Every other square is a positive integer from 1 to 8, which represents not the actual value but the difference from an actual value to the centre cell. By declaring the cell to be, say, 3, you implicitly define the values of all other cells.</p>
<p>I suppose you could take any sudoku puzzle and use it in a similar way to generate new puzzles with the same mathematical relationships within the puzzle, between cells, by declaring each cell, minus 1, to be a relative key to changing the cells. </p>
<p>Anyways, I'm understanding that the values themselves are random, but this relative arrangement is not random. If each relative arrangement has a set of 9 different values with equal likelihood, then indeed there is no special aspect of the arrangement that means any value is any more likely at any cell.</p>
<p>Said another way, the quality of the numerically relative arrangements of cells are not wholly random, but the quantities or values in any given arrangement are random. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are wrong for the simple reason that Sudoku has nothing to do with numbers. Replace the Numbers 1 to 9 with nine letters, nine emojis or nine arbitrary symbols. The puzzle is still the same, but you may see that there is no reason for any Emoji to appear more often at any place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, the set of items in sudoku, numbers 1 thru 9, were arbitrarily selected. Therefore it is in fact not a number puzzle but a more general set-matching puzzle. </p></div>		</li>
