<p>The spectrum of Anti-Hydrogen is identical to hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Photons are their own anti-particles, so there is no need for a separate classification of &quot;antiphoton&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time when antimatter is used for science or medicine, it is not like they pull out a bottle of antimatter or something.  </p>
<p>One example where it is used commonly is positron emission tomography.  Many different positron sources can be used, which are all radioisotopes of one element or another. </p>
<p>This analysis relies on the positrons encountering electrons and annihilating to produce gamma rays </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also use antimatter in this way in measuring ultra-small levels of magnetism in materials using Muon Spin Resonance (uSR). Here muon spins are detected by give off anti-particles as their procession decays which annihilate with normal particles, giving off gammaâ€™s, which are picked up by detectors. <a href="https://www.psi.ch/lmu/" target="_blank">https://www.psi.ch/lmu/</a></p></div>		</li>
