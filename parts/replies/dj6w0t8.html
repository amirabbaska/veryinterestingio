			<div class="markdown"><p>I really noticed this last weekend when my wife and I were hiking. It was really humid out and breathing was difficult. We got through the first mile then I hit a wall and wanted to stop... We rested for a bit as I tried to shake it off, then we managed to keep going for another seven miles. It also helped that we climbed above the humidity at 2.5 miles.</p></div>		</li>
