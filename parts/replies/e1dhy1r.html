			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate the well-written explanation. As other have also explained, “country” is just a term, not an explicit set of guidelines. The definition of country, as it applies to the United States is much different than its usage when calling England a country, or so I have learned.</p>
<p>I happened to be looking at a map of England to see how far Wolverhampton was from Birmingham, and when I saw “West Midlands”, I thought of that as basically a “state” inside the country of “England”, which led me to wonder what the United Kingdom’s term was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this is a bit off-topic, but there are two things called the West Midlands. There's the West Midlands county and West Midlands region (Wolverhampton is in both).</p>
<p>England's regions are just convenient ways to divide it for statistical purposes. They don't have any sort of government.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Worth noting that the Blair government initially planned to introduce regional government to England. A referendum on the issue in the North East showed that people were firmly against. However, there's lots of evidence that opposition was based on the exact arrangements (the area covered, and the fact that some local services would be provided by this authority) rather than the concept, and recent polling suggests that there is quite strong support for that sort of devolution within England.</p>
<p>Then there's the London Assembly, which is essentially what one of these regional assemblies could have been like, except that it only deals with the local services that would have been provided.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The county level must have the same type of government purpose as a county here in the US? (Being responsible for schools, law enforcement, public works, waste management, etc.)</p>
<p>The “West Midlands” region would be compared to the “Midwest” here in the States, I’m sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As another user has said, &quot;West Midlands&quot; can refer to two entities that are roughly in the same place but are very different sizes. The one that you saw on the map is likely to be the <em>county</em> called &quot;West Midlands&quot; rather than the area that's to the Western part of the middle of England.</p>
<p>Counties generally have a level of government (and sublevels for each city) to administer local services like rubbish collections, road repairs, voting registration, local tax and schools (to some extent). Some of these things are done on a county level and some are on a city level. I don't know enough to know exactly which ones do what, and it likely varies across the country. So every now and then we have County Council elections that generally don't seem to change much. I couldn't tell you who my local councillors are or what recent ones have done in the last few years. I know there are several in each area but I don't even know which party has the most in my area. This is separate from our member of parliament who is involved in law making for the whole country and is generally accountable to (or 'responsible for' depending on how you look at their role) ~100,000 people rather than perhaps a few thousand per councillor.</p></div>		</li>
