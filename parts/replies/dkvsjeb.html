			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you may have missed mentioning the most obvious reason. The nose primarily functions to keep water out of the respiratory passages. We can't close our nose like we can our mouth, but the shape of the nose, the position and size of the nostrils, and nostril hairs themselves (which are hydrophobic), all serve to block water from entering the nasal passages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, from a design point of view, our bodies are not that well constructed. Our spine isn't really made for walking upright, for one. The way the nerves branch out from between vertebrae makes them extremely vulnerable to compression.</p>
<p>Similarly, our head is just one big point of failure. If anything happens to it, we're toast. GG, centralized nervous system.</p>
<p>Our circulatory system? It depends on us nearly constantly moving to function. Ever notice that when you have to sit for a while, your feet get a little sore and you wind up fidgetingâ€‹? That's because if you don't keep your muscles moving, your circulation stops. Those little movements (toes wriggling, feet shifting, etc) are what pump your blood back up to your heart.</p>
<p>All of it works <em>well enough</em>, but it's far from well designed. More like cobbled together and functional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have <em>not</em> managed every other convenience. We don't have prehensile tails, or poison fangs, or more efficient two-stage lungs like birds have, or camouflage skin like a mimic octopus, or negligibly senescent biology like some very-long-lived animals, or the radiation resistance of a tardigrade, or retractable claws, or the eyesight of a hawk, or the eyesight of a mantis shrimp, or the hearing of a bat, or...well lots of conveniences that would seem to be theoretically adaptable to the human body.</p>
<p>Natural selection just kills things; it doesn't give you what you need to survive or thrive -- that stuff all comes about (or doesn't) completely randomly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Provided we're the right side up, water can only enter the nostrils from the bottom. Without anywhere for the air to escape (provided we don't breathe in) it just stays there, blocking water entry.</p>
<p>It's also why people swimming the underwater backstroke have to come up with innovative techniques:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent post. I was going to post a mini-thesis since this is what I do for a living but you hit the salient points. I'd just like to add that the design leads to parabolic airflow so air is simultaneously pass over the turbinates to filter and humidify the air before it hits the lower airway while also passing high into the nasal vault to hit the olfactory region for smell. Also having an external nose as we do allows us to have the &quot;nasal valves&quot; which is the narrowest part of the nose and allows us to sense the actual flow better, and the muscles of the external nose to some degree regulate airflow by dilating the nasal valves open when we exercise ( for example) or constrict it when we smell something unpleasant. </p>
<p>It also keeps rhinoplasty surgeons like yours truly in business.  :-) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post as well! Honestly yours should be at the top, lol.  ENT is not my subspecialty (general internist here, with a comparative anatomy background), and the info you gave here is really specific and interesting.  Was just by weird timing I answered first, then this topic blew up.  Love your username, btw!</p></div>		</li>
