			<div class="markdown"><p>Fatigue can occur from lactic acid production as a result of short-duration, high-intensity physical activity. If lactic acid is not cleared from the muscle tissue it disassociates into lactate and H+. The increased H+ concentration lowers pH and increases acidity. Muscle acidosis negatively affects energy production and sarcomere contraction. </p>
<p>Fatigue can also occur from PCr and glycogen depletion, decreased blood glucose levels, excess Pi (as you said), ambient heat and muscle temperatures, and failure of neuromuscular systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are all true. But they are all hypothesis. I've met some professors that think lactic acid has nothing to do with fatigue. My guess is that fatigue occurs from a combination of these chemical reasons plus a dose of neuromuscular feedback inhibition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotta love all the no context answers, lol. Seems like nobody bothers to define what they're talking about. You seem to be talking about fit people. For 90% of people in this thread the answer is &quot;because they're out of shape, and need to move more&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
