			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the details it's been at least a year since I read this, but usually shuffle isn't random. It goes based on like higher rated songs/most played songs. In the beginning it was completely random and everyone hated it because they'd be listening to rap and then a country song would play or whatever. I believe this was strictly itunes though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I recall (unfortunately I can't find the news article now), iTunes originally produced a random permutation of the current playlist when the shuffle button was pressed; but, as a truly random permutation would obviously not evenly distribute tracks based on metadata, users were wondering why they were getting four songs by the same artist in a row when shuffle was turned on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is funny because what people feel random should look like isn't what actual random looks like.</p>
<p>A professor would actually do this experiment in her intro to stats class. Have most students invent a sequence of random coin flips, but have some students actually flip a coin and record the sequence. She'd be able to identify the true random sequences with very high accuracy, simply by picking those sequences that had the longest string of consecutive heads or consecutive trails. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I hate this. I put shuffle on to hear something other than the songs I play the most. Why do people have so many songs on their iTunes that they don't like?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree some companies shuffle algorithms suck but two different problems are described in the post you responded to. </p>
<p>First, regarding the random shuffle algorithms, the reason people hated it was because no special effort was put into ensuring the whole library is played before replaying tracks. In other words, each song is picked completely randomly. You could, statistically, here the same song 3 times in 4 hours and not hear another song for a month. The &quot;randomness&quot; of selections weren't well expressed by such small samples.</p>
<p>Instead they started shuffling the whole library once and playing through the shuffled list.</p>
<p>The second problem, not wanting clashing music back-to-back, depends on the implementation I suppose. It's been a decade since I used an iPod but all modern players let you sort and shuffle by genre, playlist, mood, or whatever. it makes sense because people prefer different music styles for different occasions. Maybe Apple does a crappy job of trying to automate this preference, idk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It even has a slider that adjusts the randomness (pretty sure it says something along the lines of &quot;hear the same artist fewer times in a row&quot;) - not sure how that acts when it's only one album by one artist being played, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a three song playlist once and accidentally set it to shuffle and only noticed when it went in reverse (after song 1 it played three, then 2, then 1 agian). After some experimenting I found that the algorithm never send you back to the same song or to the next song on the list. That was with an older version, I don't know if they've changed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a way to walk through why it's 1/n!, where n = number of songs:</p>
<p>If we have a 2-song album, then there is a 1/2 chance that it plays Track 1 first, and then a 1/1 chance that it then plays Track 2 second. So total chance is 1/2*1/1 = 1/2</p>
<p>If we have a 3-song album, then there is a 1/3 chance that it plays Track 1 first, and then a 1/2 chance that it plays Track 2 second (assuming Track 1 is eliminated in the shuffle algorithm). Then a 1/1 chance that it plays Track 3 third. So total chance is  1/3 <em> 1/2 </em> 1/1 = 1 / (3 <em> 2 </em> 1) = 1 / 3!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both your and /u/Greebo24's answers are correct given your assumptions about how the shuffle works. Their assumptions are each song is equiprobable and <del>songs can repeat (the shuffle can play the same song twice in a row)</del> (<strong>EDIT:</strong> no idea why the hell I said this, it's very obviously the same assumptions as in the next sentence). Your assumptions are that each song is equiprobable, but once a song is played it is out of the mix entirely.</p>
<p>I think some much more realistic assumptions to go off are that the songs are equiprobable (it becomes much harder if they're not), but that, while songs do not necessarily get taken out of the mix entirely, shuffle guarantees that at least the next song is different from the current one.</p>
<p>Given these assumptions, along with n songs in the library and an album of k songs, the first song playing has a probability of 1/n if nothing else is currently playing, because if there were then it would be 1/(n-1). Then for the next song there are only n-1 choices because of the guaranteed skip, so the probability of the second song in the album coming up is 1/(n-1). Similarly, the probability of the third song coming up after that is 1/(n-1), and so on. Multiplying together these k probabilities (because they are theoretically independent) gives is 1/[n(n-1)^(k-1)], given that no song was currently playing initially and the first song played was completely random as well, and if we start with a song already playing then the overall probability is simply 1/(n-1)^k .     </p></div>		</li>

<p>If the &quot;they&quot; in &quot;their assumptions&quot; you are referring to us u/greebo24, then greebo actually also assumed that songs cannot repeat.</p>
<p>If songs can repeat and are equiprobable, then the odds of an album being played in the correct order are 1/(n^n ), where n is the number of songs in the album, and it is only those songs that can be selected.</p>
<p>I think. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Edit: I reread your comment and I think I misread you. Also it appears you've properly generalized the problem to k available songs and building in the non-repeat.</p></div>		</li>
