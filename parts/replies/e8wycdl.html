			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but let's compare transistors alone
Intel 4004 had 2400 transistors. 1971.
AMD threadripper 2990WX has 19,200,000,000.<br />
That's an increase of 8000000 times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My methods were quick, dirty, suspect and most certainly wrong.</p>
<p>I compared my current office computer's 3.8GHz i7 to my computer in 1980, an Atari 800 with a 1.7mHz 8 bit CPU. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Divide 3.8GHz by 1.7mHz = 38,000/1.7=21,229.05. This should have been 3,800/1.7=2122.905. I moved the decimal by accident, but let's carry on with the wrong number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply this by 4 to compensate for moving from 8 bit to 64 bit. I could have used 8x but I was conservative 2,129.05 x 4 = 84,916.20. Round this to 85,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we correct the error in step one and multiply by 8 instead of 4 in step 2 and multiply by another 4 to account for 4 cores rather than 1, we get: 2,129.05 x 8 x 4 = 68,129.6 not too far off.</p>
</li>
<li>Keep in mid that these calculations were made in support of a joke rather than a thesis. So, rely on them at your own risk.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there's so much going on under the hood that this isn't even remotely accurate.</p>
<p>The absolute balls to the wall most powerful CPU in 1980 was the VAX-11/780, with 1,000,000 operations per second in Dhrystone. The Threadripper 2990WX manages 880,000 million.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the way:</p>
<p>1.7 mHz = 1.7×10^-3 Hz = 0.0017 Hz</p>
<p>1.7 MHz = 1.7×10^6 Hz = 1700000 Hz</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And nearly 10,000,000x from 1971.</p>
<p>An Intel 4004 was capable of 92,000 IPS in Dhrystone.</p>
<p>An AMD Threadripper 2990WX is capable of 880,000... million.</p>
<p>Actually CPUs are around a million times faster if you consider best in class in 1980 to best in class now.</p></div>		</li>
