			<div class="markdown"><p>Last church I was a part of, the pastor was retiring/stepping down. His son was an associate pastor who wanted to be elected as Head Pastor. He said in front of the church that if he didn't get elected that he and his family were leaving the church. They elected him, then he demanded that he got $90k salary and a new vehicle for him and his wife every year. The vehicles he demanded....Expedition and Camry...granted it could've been worse, but for him to demand these things or he will throw his sucker in the dirt was just pathetic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh he got what he demanded...which is one of the reasons I left that church. That along with the fact that the pastor would send out letters to people that hadn't paid tithes in 30 days that if they didn't pay a tithe by the 45th day they weren't welcome at the church. </p>
<p>Also, we have a rehabilitation group called Home of Grace in our community. It is for women who are alcoholics or drug addicts. They attend the church as a group every Sunday. One woman who went through the rehab program and was sober for 2 years was seen leaving the liquor store by a member of the church. Pastor found out and went to her home. Now, any person with a logical mind would think he was going to offer help. Nope, he told her that since she had slid back into her old ways, that she wasn't welcome at the church anymore.</p>
<p>I decided then that church wasn't doing anything good for the community and was just grabbing money while trying to keep the image of &quot;these are the perfect Christians.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I'm a pastor's kid (30 years old now). We were always on the lower end of middle class and 60 hours would have been a light work week for my dad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OC, but dad is a pastor. Anyone you contact will  be delighted to have an extra volunteer. They may want you to come to a service or two before you volunteer, but most likely they will just extend the invitation. I doubt your beliefs will cause any issues, esp since agnostics aren't typically obnoxious and/or preachy. As far as finding local resources, I would look for Christian and Missionary Alliance churches (biased here, they paid my dad's wages for 20 years), their main focus tends to be community and global outreach rather than planting or expanding churches, and look up CAMA Services, they are the specifically-outreach-focused branch. Glad to have people from all philosophies trying to leave the world a better place!</p></div>		</li>
