			<div class="markdown"><p>Laminar is an unfamiliar word outside of scientific contexts, so I'll just add that it means something like &quot;made of layers&quot; or &quot;acts like a layered thing.&quot;  Laminar flow is the opposite of turbulent flow, and you can see a startling <a href="https://imgur.com/cGBIbi0" target="_blank">demonstration of highly laminar flow in a liquid</a> here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The apparatus is the <a href="http://www.flintbox.com/public/project/6027/" target="_blank">Couette Cell</a>, developed at the University of New Mexico, which also produces the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p08_KlTKP50" target="_blank">video source of this gif</a>.  There are no paddles, but rather an inner cylinder that turns.  You can see where it extends above the surface of the liquid (all of which is corn syrup, including the injected dyed portions).  </p>
<p>Paddles would cause turbulent flow, but turning the inner surface (cylinder) means that the layer immediately touching the cylinder is moved along, and a layer touching that is moved along with slightly less energy (because drag by the layer outside of it) and so on.  The outermost layer moves the least, because it has drag from the outer cylinder. </p>
<p>Picture a really slick deck of playing cards, where the cards have some, but very little friction to one another.  It's easy to spill or splash the deck by lifting one corner, but the top card always gets the furthest because it has a kind of telescoping effect-- it moves a little, and the card below it moves a little, and so on, and the top card gets the sum of all the little movements. The card at the bottom barely moves because it drags on the table.  So, playing cards, laterally at least, have laminar flow. What you're seeing here is laminar flow around a cylinder instead of across a table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the navier stokes equations only describe the movement of the particles caused by convection. The cigarette heats the air up, which causes its density to drop, thus buoyant forces result in elevation of the air close to the cigarette. The smoke from the cigarette flows with the air around it. </p>
<p>To speak to OPs question, the smoke stays in lines in the short time after leaving the cigarette and does not appear to dissipate because it the smoke particles have not had time to noticeably diffuse through the air. The rate of diffusion is defined by Ficks Law. </p>
<p>On these small time scales, convection is the dominant driving force for mass transport so navier stokes is sufficient to describe the system and ficks law is not needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if memory serves me, proving the Navier-Stokes equations or modifying them for turbulence is one of the Millennium Prize Problems. That'll get you $1 million. </p></div>		</li>

In three space dimensions and time, given an initial velocity field, there exists a vector velocity and a scalar pressure field, which are both smooth and globally defined, that solve the Navier–Stokes equations.</a></p></div>		</li>
