<p>Humans also realised that by breeding the males and females with the most and best wool, the offspring would usually end up with even more wool than the parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This much understanding isn't even necessary. You can have the breeding working perfectly without understanding it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Breed sheep to shear them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get hungry during winter. Only keep the most valuable sheep (best wool) because you simply can't afford to feed them all and eat none. Naturally, you wouldn't slaughter your best wool-giver first.</p>
</li>
<li>Breed every year. Since you just ate the ones with less wool to make it through the winter, you are now selecting for amount and / or quality of wool.</li>
</ul>
<p>See, you don't even need to understand breeding. You only keep the sheep with the best wool so you can shear them again next year. The fact that this also means they're the ones that continue to reproduce is an involuntary by-product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what's cool about genetic selection, both natural and artificial, that many people fail to grasp--&quot;nature&quot; does't <em>know</em> what it's selecting for. There's no conscious decision being made when selection occurs. Humans ignorant of the principles of breeding made equally unconscious selections. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there's still wild species of sheep, or &quot;cousins&quot; of domestic sheep, like Mouflon, who, in the wild, don't grow as much wool compared to regular sheep, and typically shed it the way most other animals shed their excess hair/fur/etc, or it gets caught in shrubbery, which acts in a similar manner to a brush.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably the one I was thinking of. I don't know the sheep personally, so I didn't know his nickname was Shrek.  I always just called him Mike.<br />
Or Wooly Booly if we were drinking.</p></div>		</li>
