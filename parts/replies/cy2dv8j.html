<p>But remember that solid matter absolutely dominates photons in terms of gravity generation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't answer the question though. What you are saying is like dismissing gravity by saying electromagnetic forces absolutely dominate gravity in terms of force generation. The question is simple, does a single proton, or would 10^10 non-colliding photons generate gravity. I believe it does, but I don't think physics has the answer to that right now as we simply do not understand what gravity is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is a big difference, an standalone photon can not create a black hole, because energy is relative (the measured energy depends of the observer frame of reference). Different observers can measure different amount of energy.</p>
<p>So what is needed to create a black hole ?: an observer invariant quantity: Rest Mass.</p>
<p>So you need at least two high energetic photons travelling in opossite directions to create a black hole. Because a two photons object (not traveling in the same direction) has rest mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to understand this. Forgive these no-doubt foolish questions. If photons create meagre gravitational fields:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This implies that an individual photon must have a larger radius than the tiny, but non-zero, Schwarzschild radius associated with the mass-equivalent for the photon's amount of energy, yes?</p>
</li>
<li>What prevents one from collapsing below that radius?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think so. Unfortunately, I know a lot more quantum physics than relativistic physics, so I don't know the details of photon locality. </p>
<p>Photons are generally modeled just like other free particles (at least in non-relativistic quantum), i.e. as a wave packet. A photon generally has a pretty narrow bands of possible wavelengths, so a localized photon wave packet (a photon zooming through space) generally has a decently wide spacial extent. That means its &quot;radius&quot; is usually pretty wide. </p>
<p>Now, unfortunately, I have no idea how gravity works in quantum physics and no idea if relativity screws with the wave packet model for photons. </p>
<p>As for 2, if I'm right about this, by the uncertainty principle, a photon with a narrow band of possible wavelengths necessarily is pretty wide. </p>
<p>If you had a very wide range of possible wavelengths, maybe the wave packet could be narrow enough to go below the schwarzchild radius. But again, I'm only confident this reasoning works at low velocities (which photons are categorically not characterized by). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if all those photons are travelling in the same direction?  Do you end up with a black hole travelling at the speed of light, due to conservation of energy and momentum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm supposing that since they need to all be aimed at a spot where they will converge, they will have to be fired from different directions. When they meet and the kugelblitz forms, conservation of momentum would take over and it would shoot off in the average direction of momentum... at the sine of the speed of light? Of the angle they meet at, I mean. </p>
<p>I'm basically picturing exactly what the Death Star looks like when it fires. Since a kugelblitz is &quot;so hot it surpasses the Plank temperature, the temperature of the universe 5.4 x 10^(-44) seconds after the Big Bang&quot;, I could see why someone might call it &quot;the ultimate power in the universe&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
