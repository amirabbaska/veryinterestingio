			<div class="markdown"><p>In some cases, such as insulin, fat injection is specifically used because it does slow the absorption.  It allows a diabetic to take one shot that can last hours or even a day, rather that need frequent small doses you'd need for an injection into a vein.  It's also less painful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely - it only depends on the substance and dose. Hitting a vein would generally require lower dose than hitting a muscle.</p></div>		</li>
