			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I have no idea actually, we hired a company that had specially engineered TVs and equipment for that sort of thing. No idea if they’re still around, this was almost 10 years ago that we used them. As a producer I just wanted to use an HDTV but the director was going for a specific look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's CRT's, modern LCD's aren't like that. CRT's would only emit a single &quot;point&quot; of the picture that would travel across and down the screen, once ever roughly 60th of a second, with the rest of the screen being unilluminated. An LCD always emits a picture since the thing actually making the picture are the liquid crystals, while they are illuminated by a backlight that is always on (or they dont have a backlight, like the orignal Gameboys for example). The liquid crystals will change the picture either with a line traveling down the screen that will &quot;reposition&quot; the pixels (progressive scan, like 1080p) or by changing every other line each frame (interlaced, like 1080i). Well OLED displays are different since they can actually turn off the backlight for any part of the screen that is supposed to be black, but they still dont flicker with the refresh rate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They still have a refresh rate though; so you get some artifacting (not the same artifacting as when you film a CRT, mind you) due to that not meshing with the shutter speed of the camera, similar to how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovBerdYcd54" target="_blank">helicopter blades</a> and wheels look weird on film sometimes; same reasoning, different effects. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guNrJ5hj0aQ" target="_blank">this clip</a> there's some strobing on the screen that I'm fairly sure isn't there when viewed directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're mostly correct here. But that's only if the panel uses a DC backlight. It is possible and not uncommon for an AC backlight to be used instead, which will cause the screen to flicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting thing to do is look at an LED clock under a strobe light in an otherwise dark room.  The clock is only visible when the strobe is on, but the LEDs are visible when they are pulsed on.  If the clock is just sitting there on the table, nothing is all that unusual.  Now pick the clock up and move it back and forth a bit.  It looks like the digits are sliding off the clock.  YMMV based on the frequency of the strobe, whether or not the LEDs are actually pulsed, pulse frequency, and probably a few other factors.</p></div>		</li>
