			<div class="markdown"><p>At the atomic level &quot;touch&quot; is a very fuzzy concept. </p>
<p>But I'm guessing that some of the forces don't work the same way as they would between regular atoms. For example, normally atoms are surrounded by electrons but anti hydrogen will have positrons instead, the differing charge (if nothing else) will mean that atoms bouncing apart doesn't quite happen the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking of atoms as billiard balls. They aren't like that. They're spread out things which are like probability distribution functions. Each individual component of an atom - the electrons, protons neutrons - or, more accurately, the individual quarks - are spread out things.</p>
<p>You can never say &quot;the electron is <em>here</em>&quot;, you can only say &quot;the electron is smeared over this region of space, and the <em>probability</em> of it being <em>around</em> here is x%&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, it's spread out over the whole of space, although far away, the &quot;probability&quot; is tiny. Really, really tiny.</p>
<p>If there's an electron and a positron far away from each other, their probability waves will interact - but not much, since the &quot;probabilities&quot; are so tiny. As they get closer, the probability that they could be called &quot;touching&quot; goes up. Close enough, and there's a high chance they'll spontaneously reform into two photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, all anti-atoms are as stable as their normal matter brethren.  </p>
<p>However, as many have pointed out, they will annihilate with normal matter unless in a vacuum.  But that is only because in Earth normal atmosphere, it is all normal matter.  </p>
<p>In theory, if there was an anti-Earth, antimatter would be as stable and have almost exactly the same attributes as normal matter.  </p>
<p>There are some questions around why there is less antimatter than matter, so there could be some differences that crop up, but as far as I know, a human made up of antimatter could breathe antioxygen and swim in anti-water seas, and exist just like we do.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, if we were to shake hands with them, it would be like a nuclear bomb going off.  Or less dramatically, it would probably be more like an energetic fizzle which pushed us apart unless we impacted at a speed which would prevent the released energy from knocking us apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it not possible that the dispersion of matter and antimatter was unequal? Could it be that we just happen to live in an area of the universe where more matter than antimatter ended up, and after the matter/antimatter annihilation was over, the matter that was left formed into what we see in the visible universe? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is one theory for what happened.  </p>
<p>However, if that is the case, it is confined to a location outside of the observable universe, which is admittedly thought to be pretty large.  </p>
<p>As far as we can tell, there is no sign that antimatter is dominant in any place (or time) that we can observe in the known universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that were true, we'd most likely be able to detect the annihilation occurring at the boundaries between the matter-rich and antimatter-rich zones. We don't see that, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There would have to be a place in the universe where the two meet. A border between matter and anti-matter world. And we would be able to detect the anihilation effects there.</p>
<p>Also anti-photon is just a photon, and experiments such as <a href="https://home.cern/about/experiments/aegis" target="_blank">https://home.cern/about/experiments/aegis</a> did not find any hints of antimatter behaving differently in terms of gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having it not be observable is definitely a possibility.  We have not been able to observe it in any space or time that we have been able to view to date, but there is believed to be a huge expanse of the Universe that is not observable to us and never will be (short of some very, very wild kind of FTL drive or something).  </p>
<p>But here I need to note, there is no such thing as an anti-photon in the same sense as there is antimatter.  Both normal matter and antimatter are created by the same types and kind of energy.  </p>
<p>In other words, a hard gamma ray may generally coalesce into a pair of particles, one normal matter, one antimatter.  So, for instance an electron and a positron are created from the same energy.  If they collide, then energy is released in the same amount used to create the pair.  </p>
<p>So, energy is just energy and photons are just photons.  At least when we are talking about matter/antimatter anyway.</p>
<p>As for anti-gravity, it is important to note that gravity is also just plain old gravity.  It is the curvature of space-time, and antimatter does not interact any differently to gravity than matter to gravitation.  </p>
<p>Antimatter is different than normal matter only in that each particle has an opposite charge from its normal matter twin.  Electrons being negative and positrons being positive, but both having the same mass and other characteristics.  </p></div>		</li>
