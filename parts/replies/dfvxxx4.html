			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it gets bigger, but it's not really a practical problem yet or any time soon as storage is pretty cheap. Also there are light clients available too for phone / mobile users... which in the context of the above Bittorrent analogy are like perpetual leechers always downloading and watching, but never storing for long.</p>
<p>In the future (probably 2 years), there will be some upgrades that mean you only really need keep track of the last 4-8 months of history. So the spreadsheet will grow (adding rows faster the more people use it), but at some point rows at the top will be deleted about as fast as they are appended to the bottom and the total rows at any given time will roughly stabilize. Archive nodes will maintain the whole history, should it be interesting to anyone... kinda like the Internet Archive / Wayback Machine, but they won't be strictly necessary.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not strictly true. It could be a macro that acts as a will / inheritance. The code would simply state that as long as Bob presses a button at least once a year, the money stays locked up.  If Bob dies, then the next time the timer expires Alice can claim the inheritance. At no time can Alice steal the inheritance, and no bank or 3^rd party was required.</p>
<p>More practical Smart Contracts will likely use data feeds (called Oracles) from vetted and reputable sources much like we do today with the Weather Network providing you daily weather report, or the Bloomberg stock ticker feed telling you today's stock prices.  These services <em>could</em> cheat or lie, but they would lose significant reputation if they did. They could also put up a security deposit that they'd lose if anyone could prove they lied too; improving the level of trust that you could put in them.</p>
<p>Most consumers of these data feeds would also use contingencies like a second opinion that stops automatic execution incase the main feed disagrees with other feeds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In which case it's a source of information they both trust.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm not saying that these information source wouldn't be trust<em>worthy</em>, but a certain level of trust would still be required.</p></div>		</li>
