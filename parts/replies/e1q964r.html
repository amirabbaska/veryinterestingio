<p>Stairs just KILLED me for years, like I was in D1 athletics but still panting after a few floors. Then a physical trainer got me to change my walking posture. Bam after a few weeks of being sore just from walking around, I could run up stairs no problem. </p>
<p>They make that weird elliptical that can shift  apart laterally, you could try that and see if you have any leg muscles that are trying to slack off. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Aaaargh..... <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures" target="_blank">SIGNIFICANT FIGURES</a>!!! You don't know the potential energy to the nearest microJoule (a laughably small amount of energy equivalent to raising this 62kg person by 2 nanometers)</p>
<p>Your initial measurements are not that accurate! At best, let's assume you can measure the floor height to the nearest millimeter, so H=2.438m. Then let's assume the person's mass is measured to the nearest 1/10 of a kg, so 62.0kg. Doing the calculations with proper sig figs, the potential energy would be 1480 J, or 1.48 kJ.</p>
<p>Don't add a gazillion decimal places just because your calulator spits them out.</p></div>		</li>
