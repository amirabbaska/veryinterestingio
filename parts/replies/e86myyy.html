			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Mostly no. When talking about energy sources for life you are talking about some high energy molecule that you are breaking into lower energy molecules and using the energy difference to power the chemical reactions of life.</p>
<p>For most terrestrial vertibrates it is glucose or some other form of sugar. When it comes to microbes that rely on breaking down &quot;minerals&quot; its just using a different high energy molecule. These might include cyanates, nitrates, nitrites, or some other nitrogen group, alkenes and alkynes, or (more commonly in underground or deep sea) various sulphur compounds like sulfoxides, sulphones, or thiocyanates or some other energy holding molecule from the vast majority that exist on earth. Some microbes are even evolving to break down the bonds in plastics. </p>
<p>Why are minerals important for both us and microbes? Because minerals, such as iron, iodine, calcium, sodium, and zinc, copper, and so on, are used throughout the body as ions in a number of ways. Free ions are used as signalling molecules as their charge allows them to strongly influence enzymes and proteins (calcium especially but also sodium, choride, and potassium). They may also form complexes with proteins or enzymes with their charges being used to help fold the protein, influence its activity or behavior, or allow it to carry charges temporarily during chemical reactions (an example is iron in hemoglobin which bonds oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood, or copper in hemocyanin which does the same function but in crabs and other crustacians)</p>
<p>So yeah, we have this need for minerals because we evolved from microbes that use minerals in their basic biochemistry. Honestly i dont think its possible to have biochemistry that supports life without some use of minerals. But when it comes to energy sources those can be nearly any molecule that has energy in its bonds that can be extracted. You just need to develop the biochemistry to break down a specific bond. All plants and animals just developed from microbes that broke down sugars and so that is the biochemistry that we as humans have. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes.  </p>
<p>Because Archaea are closer to Eukarya, than either are to Prokarya (Bacteria).  That can't happen by random chance, they definitely shared an ancestor somewhere.  </p>
<p>Now technically it's possible that Bacteria and ArchaeEukaryotes stem from two totally different origins using this logic, but I still doubt it.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends what you mean by technically possible. All life uses the same genetic code (more or less) ie the nucleic bases UAU transcribe to a Tyrosine, UGU give a Cysteine and so forth. There is no reason for the code to be conserved apart from common origin. The chance of it being the same code, by chance is an astronomically small number.</p></div>		</li>
