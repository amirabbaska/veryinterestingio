<p>I see your point though. If I'm getting paid 8 hours to let's say put stock on the shelf and I get it done in 6 hours how come I can't get full 8 hours pay.  I guess that's the difference between getting paid by the hour and getting paid by the job.  </p>

<p>Same reason places rush to spend their budget at the end of the year. The guy in charge will see you didn't use it all so obviously you don't need that much and it gets cut. For work they see you do it in 6 and assume all the other times it took 8 were you &quot;not working.&quot; I fucking hate that mentality because the amount of time it takes to do something could change for an infinite amount of reasons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;just hurry up and get the job done and I'll let you ride the clock till your shift ends&quot;. Did they even listen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, &quot;riding the clock&quot; does not sound at all like an attractive option to me. I fucking hate being bored and having nothing to do. If I have to stay for the full eight hours anyway, it makes no difference to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yours is a productive proletariat philosophy. A good one, I believe, for I share your sentiments. It's labor with incentive of healthy activities (goofing off is psychologically healthy, which translates into healthier work.)</p>
<p>Sadly, not everyone shares that philosophy. Even to their own detriment. The neo-corporations like Google seem to embrace it, but those fossil age corps still try to squeeze every penny out by force.</p></div>		</li>
