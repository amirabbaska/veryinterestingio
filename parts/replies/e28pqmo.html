			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it's pretty poetic/romantic that the chemical closest to &quot;love&quot; doesn't have a drug like that.</p>
<p>Do the other emotions have chemicals associated with them or do they work entirely differently? The asymmetry in biology of humans makes me nuts, contrasted with how many charts and whatnot of writing help show a circle of emotions where they are kind of &quot;on the same level&quot;, like just different colors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never thought of it that way! That is pretty poetic. You could say that melatonin is responsible for sleep, DMT is possibly responsible for dreaming, and adrenaline is responsible for alertness. Funny thing is, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin" target="_blank">melatonin</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine" target="_blank">DMT</a> are almost identical, chemically speaking, to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin" target="_blank">serotonin</a>. While we're at it, have a look at <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocin" target="_blank">psilocin</a>, the active component of magic mushrooms. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline" target="_blank">adrenaline</a> is very structurally similar to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine" target="_blank">dopamine</a>. Similarly, check out the structure of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine" target="_blank">amphetamine</a>.</p>
<p>Basically all of the chemicals responsible for our mood are minor variations of 2 basic structures: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine" target="_blank">catecholamines</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptamine" target="_blank">tryptamines</a>.</p>
<p>I'm leaving out opiates, but I really think they are more a physical feeling than mood or emotion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That IS crazy. And while we are on a Q&amp;A roll here haha, are anger or jealousy derived from others or is there like an anger chemical?</p>
<p>The more people answer questions the weirder humans seem and the more questions come up. I have a lot of respect for the people figuring this stuff out, and more generally to the people educating others on reddit. It is also fun to notice that people answering science questions often have a lot better writing and formatting too in comparison to some other posters. I don't intend to bash anyone but often subreddits of like movies and games are full of long posts without paragraphs and and, well, less than stellar writing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mdma is probably pretty close to replacement for oxytocin. I know it basically just releases all your serotonin, but it definitely feels like love. </p></div>		</li>
