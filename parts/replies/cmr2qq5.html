			<div class="markdown"><p>A study was just released (was hearing about it on NPR today) that stated that the water found by the Rosetta probe did not match water found on earth... Not really sure what that means as far as the formation of our earth and its H2O but it seemed to suggest water was here when the earth was formed and did not come from comets at all... Sorry for not providing a link. Im on mobile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to the <a href="http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2014/12/first_measurements_of_comet_s_water_ratio/15106937-1-eng-GB/First_measurements_of_comet_s_water_ratio.jpg" target="_blank">Rosetta results</a> today that people keep mentioning:</p>
<p>You can look at how much Deuterium is in your water compared to normal Hydrogen. How big the D/H ratio is can tell you if the water came from the same sources.</p>
<p>Based on today's results and decades of previous studies, it's looking more and more likely that most of the water on Earth didn't come from distant comets (stuff from Jupiter's neighborhood and beyond), of which the 67P comet that Rosetta is orbiting is a member.</p>
<p>Instead, Earth's water probably came from stuff nearer the asteroid belt and things very close to the inner edge of the snow line. Which in my mind makes sense because those are the objects most likely to get mixed inward and collide with the proto-Earth. You wouldn't have to change their orbits too much to toss them into the Earth like you need to do for a distant comet to come barreling in and deposit its water on the Earth.</p>
<p>All this needs to be studied more carefully though, and it'd be great if we could get D/H measurements from a lot more objects out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO the study published today doesn't really prove anything except that Comet CG--- wasn't formed at the same orbital distance as Earth, what you have to bare in mind is that comets could have originated on any planetary orbit and then either migrate out to the Oort Cloud due to gravitational effects and stayed there forever, or have impacted with a planet early on in the Heavy Late Bombardment. Just because one comet holds heavy water compared with Earth doesn't mean the other 99.9999% of comets don't share the same type of water. It just shows we have barely scratched the surface of our origins and need to keep undertaking missions to understand more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clear up the comet and astroid thing, don't think of them as comets/astroids that come from outside our system. Think of the big rocks being formed as the sun did. So the water was formed by the cloud of hydrogen. There were also little ones, like said above, that dropped water off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's certainly a possibility. There's a whole class of planets called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_planet" target="_blank">waterworlds</a> that are predicted to exist with oceans 20x deeper than ours and no land. We haven't officially confirmed any yet, but there are some candidates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's keep in mind though that many of the features of the Earth may or may not be dependant on those very collisions and to some degree on the effects of the water itself.</p>
<p>A waterworld is absolutely an interesting possibility but we just do not know enough about system formation to tell at this point. We know extra-solar systems exhibit variations (so it isn't inevitable that the Sol system would be like it is) but we do <em>not</em> know that we are rare or unusual at this point.</p>
<p>We might be an outlier or the commonest system imaginable. With only one system investigated in anything approaching depth and that one barely scratched, it is hard to draw any hard conclusions. Now, I <strong>would not at all</strong> just draw a false equivalence there either though. It seems <em>likely</em> that we could have been hit more and had too much water but we really don't know how that would have progressed. Perhaps some would have been lost (water impacts producing more heat or ejection) or terrain would have been more vertically inclined (deeper trenches in the oceans, more volcanism, more gravitational variance) or frankly, whatever. It falls into the unknown but not unknowable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting. When you say the Earth is only ~0.03% water, are we taking only the surface water into consideration here,or does this also include water that lies in the mantle and deeper? Cause I remember reading somewhere that the mantle could hold up to 10x the amount of water than is present on the surface. Am I mistaken here? Thanks! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if that number contains subsurface water or not. You're right there's a lot of uncertainty on how much water there is below the surface, but even if it were 10x the surface water, that wouldn't change things all that much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's why I love science. Every time one question gets answered,it raises 10 more new ones. And people get to work trying to answer these new questions. It truly speaks to the resilience ,curiosity and the 'never being satisfied without an answer' nature of the human race!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This volume of RiMG has an interesting section on mantle diamonds as tracers for geodynamics and mantle chemistry. Shirey's dataset does contain evidence from diamond-hosted inclusions that there is a much more significant amount of water located in the transition zone than was previously thought. This is a massive reservoir. Then again, its a tiny sample set.</p></div>		</li>
