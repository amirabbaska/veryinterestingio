			<div class="markdown"><p>generally fasting is fine.  almost everyone has enough body fat to fast for 24-36 hours with no issues.  if someone is diabetic, this is not the case, but generally it is fine.  i started fasting 2x per week for 24 hours or so, and it is fine.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I have done is cut out breakfast and snacks. I only eat one small meal and one big meal a day. One at midday and the other 7 hours later. I allow myself one diet soda a day which I have after my last meal. Then it's fasting period between 8pm and midday the next day. It seems to be working g great for me. If I'm feeling exceptionally hungry I will have a black coffee at the time I used to eat breakfast to keep me going.
Also eat I g healthier home cooked meals rather than take aways and junk.
No idea on the yo yo as I haven't stopped it.
The other benefit I've found is I haven't had any indigestion, where unused to suffer a lot with it. However this could be the change in food not just the fasting. </p></div>		</li>
