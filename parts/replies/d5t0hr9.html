			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to latch onto you as the most correct answer in the thread with some research I did recently.</p>
<p>There's a couple issues with providing a direct answer and as you said there is no consensus in the scientific community about the question. However, the safe answer to the question is that you probably shouldn't be worried about the clathrate gun hypothesis. There is evidence of releases in the geological record coinciding with sharp increases in temperature but the causal relationship between the two is debated. However, probably most importantly, as we learn more about methane hydrates the probability of it being a major issue gets less and less over time. The conditions in which they form and exist have become more constrained. The concentrations of them in oceanic sediments has drastically declined. The mechanisms of how they contribute to climate change has been with increase clarity revealed to be less rapid than what we initially thought. The current understanding is drastically more informed and less catastrophic than when hypotheses of apocalyptic temperature increases as a result of a clathrate gun were formulated.</p>
<p>Some good additional reads about the question:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So oceanic stores of hydrate seem less worrying for a variety of reasons (microbes, timescale of release), but how concerned should we be regarding tundra-based methane hydrates escaping? Are those concentrations alone not enough to prompt massive warming?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If a car looks suspiciously dangerous and may or may not be faulty, then it would be &quot;safe&quot; to assume that the car is dangerous.
But when we're talking about the clathrate gun, then it's suddenly &quot;safe&quot; to assume that it's not dangerous. </p>
<p>Why is it that we suddenly abandon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle" target="_blank">precautionary principle</a> whenever we discuss the climate? Why isn't the &quot;safe&quot; answer to assume that the clathrate gun is firing and to do whatever we can to shut it down?</p>
<p>edit: it's the scientist's job to provide accurate information. Don't say &quot;we can't tell the public that the clathrate gun might be firing because slowing/shutting down civilization is too painful.&quot; That's for politicians to decide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I generally agree with your overall sentiment, however...</p>
<p>The climate is a complex mechanism, influenced by many many moving parts across the globe, many of which (as is evidenced by the two posters above excellent analysis of the clathrate gun phenomenon) are not fully understood. To act callously and vigorously to reverse or prevent any give process can have severe unforeseen adverse effects.</p>
<p>To contrast this, a car, while complex, is very well understood by comparison, as well as being a contained, easily manipulable system. For example, Swapping the petroleum based fuel of it's internal combustion engine out in favor of an all electric one has consequences on the car system that are very well understood. Reluctance to do so is normally born not from unknown dangers, but socioeconomic concerns (I am of course, ignoring the climate/pollution impacts of the automobile for this explanation). More to the point, however, A car in motion is dangerous by default. There are few things in this world (especially those occurring naturally) that are as dense and mobile as an automobile. In short, it is highly volatile, as very small changes can have substantial impacts. A car in motion, whether it stays a constant course or not, is a considerable danger.</p>
<p>The climate however, is - in the context of humanity and the current life and ecosystem present on Earth -  a stable system. Is it changing? Yes. Is it possible for it to become unstable? Yes. Is it volatile? No. Given that our understanding of the climate and the various interactions of its considerable parts is not fully understood, it is unwise for us to go full-throttle in our attempts to exact change on any given aspect of the climate. In short, the less the climate changes, and perhaps more specifically, the slower that any change does occur, the better (generally). </p>
<p>To bring this full circle then, the &quot;safe&quot; answer is not to proactively exact change on the climate (or any given element) but to reduce our impact on the climate. So, we should be doing everything we can to reduce our impact, while we learn as much as we can. If we panic people by saying the Clathrate gun is firing (or that we should assume that it is), we will likely end up with people making rash, uninformed decisions that can do more harm than good. </p>
<p>Which brings me back to what I opened with. I agree, there is certainly more that we can do to reduce our impact. But if the Clathrate gun is firing, our &quot;safe&quot;ist course of action, given what we currently know, is still the same as if it weren't firing. That said, we can certainly do more in that aspect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess ultimately whether you are concerned is your choice to make. But it still should be influenced by the available evidence. I'll quote from my second link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harvey &amp; Huang (1995) carried out a detailed evaluation of the potential impact of
clathrate destabilization with global warming. Clathrate stability depends crucially
and very nonlinearly on the amount of warming: less than 4 ?C warming means that
comparatively little clathrate is released; however, when warming is 10 ?C, large
amounts of methane are liberated. They concluded reassuringly that, given worst-
case scenarios, the impact of methane emissions on global warming would be to add
10-25% at most to the forcing. This conclusion is comforting, especially for a worst-
case scenario, but depends on several factors: that the estimate of the amount of
vulnerable clathrate in the Arctic is correct; that Arctic warming is predictable in a
one-dimensional model; and that surprises (such as release of major gas pools) are
absent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on my understanding I choose to be concerned at the prospects of global warming and many related issues, but remain comforted in the fact that methane clathrates will likely not apocalyptically contribute to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm inclined to agree with that reasoning, especially considering the large sediment surface area with which methane must contact to reach atmosphere.

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is one known enzyme that can carry out the oxidation of methane - methane monooxygenase, MMO (ammonia monooxygenase can do this too but a less efficiently). All aerobic methanotrophic bacteria utilize methane as the sole carbon and energy source. MMO converts methane to methanol, then methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde and formaldehyde is assimilated into biomass via pathways similar to the calvin cycle during photosynthesis. It is pretty incredible that this enzyme can complete this conversion at ambient conditions because like you said methane is a very stable molecule with a strong C-H bond.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In negative delta G we trust :P</p>
<p>I actually worked briefly on trying to engineer methanotrophic metabolic pathways in to more conventional model organisms. It didn't work very well and it was only a short rotation sort of project. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rate and scale are obviously hugely important, but what of the claims that it will only take the release of less than 1% of Arctic methane reserves to <em>double</em> the atmospheric methane content and cause catastrophic warming?</p>
<p>The bit you cited seems to show against &quot;widespread&quot; release, but a lot of the discussion surrounding this so far is that it the released amounts don't need to be anywhere near &quot;widespread&quot; to be totally catastrophic.</p>
<p>I'm a layman who admittedly isn't putting time into reading through these studies, but I guess I'd just like to hear some basic reassurances that the release of even such a tiny fraction is very unlikely. It seems like it would be so easy to melt the (relatively) tiny amount of permafrost necessary for such a small-but-devastating fraction to be released.</p>
<p>Second question: I've heard numbers thrown around like +50C warming within decades (and thus the end of basically all life) if (worst case) the gun is &quot;fired&quot; and the runaway effect starts releasing <em>all</em> the stored methane. Is that totally scientifically absurd, or are we just ignoring the possibility because it <em>seems</em> so absurd? </p></div>		</li>
