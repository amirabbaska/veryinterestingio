			<p>When I was probably 8, I was playing around near my gtandparent's friend's house. Somehow a stick stabbed my leg and I didn't notice it. I could run around for about 30 minutes. Then I was near everyone and I pull up my pants and I saw blood and a stick. I started crying. Which was funny because I didn't felt anything.</p>		</li>

			<p>To add to this - a lot of times, injuries can occur during high stress environments, such as while running from something or in a sport. Stress causes your body to release adrenaline, and adrenaline dulls your nerves, making it so your brain won't recognize small injuries until later. </p>		</li>

			<p>Follow up ELI25:<br>These mediators are called prostaglandins which are proteins that act upon your pain receptors. Essentially, more prostaglandins = more pain.<br>Here's how it works; when cellular injury occurs, the phospholipid membrane is disrupted and is no longer this neat bi-layer. This allows phospholipases to attack the phospholipids; the phospholipases convert the phospholipids into arachidonic acid; cyclooxygenase then converts the arachidonic acid to something else, and that happens a couple more times with other enzymes and what not. Eventually the molecule produced from this chain of reactions is, wait for it, prostaglandins.<br>A lot of pain/inflammation medication works by inhibiting this process at the cyclooxygenase stage, so that less prostaglandins can be produced.<br>EDIT: I'd like to clarify that I am by no means an expert on this topic, I just so happened to have gone over this exact thing in my class that day!</p>		</li>

			<p>I'll try to interpret.<br><br>The top commenter referred to &quot;inflammatory mediators&quot;. They are chemicals that bind to special types of nerve cells. The brain interprets this binding as &quot;pain&quot;.<br><br>Cells have a two-layered membrane that controls what chemicals can enter and exit, and this acts as a boundary between the cell and the outside. This membrane is mainly made of specially modified lipids (because of how they interact with each other in a water environment), and must stay intact to keep things running smoothly in the cell. Basically, when you feel a cut, burn, or other injury, this membrane is broken. The cell has enzymes that act on the lipids when the membrane is broken, changing them into other types of lipids. Some of the lipids are progressively changed until they result in the &quot;mediator&quot; chemical mentioned at the beginning. Some pain medication stops these progressive changes, so the chemicals that bind to the &quot;pain&quot; nerve cells are not produced.</p>		</li>

			<p>Cool, I assume the phospholipases, cyclooxygenase, and other enzymes are actually there for another reason, and not just to cause suffering?  Presumably if their action is blocked by the meds, we can live without that portion of their behavior, at the very least.</p>		</li>

			<p>Inflammation is part of the body's response to harmful stimuli. It's characterized by pain, redness, swelling, and heat. It can be caused by lots of things - infections, physical trauma, burns, irritating chemicals, etc. For example, if you sprain your ankle, you'll notice a few hours later that the ankle has swelled and become red and hot.<br><br>The purpose of inflammation is that it's your body's way of activating its repair mechanisms. When you sprain your ankle, you cause physical damage to your ligaments. This is detected by cells in the area, that start emitting chemicals that tell the body &quot;Hey, something's wrong, come help me!&quot;. Your blood vessels in the area see these signals and dilate, to allow more blood to get the area. This causes the area to swell. Immune cells in the blood then infiltrate the area, and start eating up any damaged or dead tissue (or if it were an infection, start fighting the invaders). All of this cellular activity uses a lot of energy, which is why the area produces heat as well. And of course, it hurts: the pain is your nerves picking up on the &quot;emergency&quot; signals, and sending signals to your brain, to get you to pay attention. It's the body's way of letting you know that it's damaged: it wouldn't be good if you tried to keep walking on your sprained ankle because you couldn't feel that it was damaged.<br><br>Source: med student</p>		</li>

			<p>Hah! One time I was working and suddenly I see blue. &quot;What the hell&quot;, I think to myself, &quot;this is new&quot;. Turns out it was the sky as I had accidentally decapitated myself. I smirked but couldn't shake my head as my body kept on working.</p>		</li>

			<p>I remember when I was about 14 or 15 years, me and a few friends were sitting on the veranda and goofing around. At the neighbors house, a carpenter was working on their porch, so we would sometimes watch him do his thing.<br><br>At one point, he manages to shoot a nail right through his thumb with a nailgun without flinching. He just stood up and looked at it for a few seconds, noticed that the blood was more or less a continuous stream, then calmly rang the doorbell of the house he was working on to ask the owner for some bandages.<br><br>Me and my friends were standing there wide-eyed looking at this bad-ass guy, not believing how you could be so calm in the face of such a (in our minds) mortal injury.</p>		</li>

			<p>Can confirm. My ex gf worked as a server and it was her dream job to work he restaurant industry. Asshole customers wouldn't listen to her about the food being cooked a certain way and be upset. She would super heat the plates in an oven and put the food on it. Grave it bare handed and bring it to the customer who would ignore her when she said hot plate and end up getting angry because she was right lol.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah so old time waiter with hands that can withstand the fire of a thousand suns here... So what was said above is true about building up calluses. But also you learn techniques to mediate the actual heat you come into contact with...so for instance you have a plate that is hot as fuck, but has a wide rim. So instead of holding it in the middle where all the heat is, you hold it along the rim.  Or alternatively you reduce the surface area you are coming in contact with so only your actual fingertips are touching the plate but your palm has a buffer of air between it. From here you can alternate the fingers and palm areas that are directly touching it, and let the burning ones cool while fresh fingers handle the load... I also feel like the nerves and/or pain sensation reduce them selves down due to training them not to overload...so instead of internally fearing the burn, you already know it won't hurt much so you tell your brain to stfu about it already </p>		</li>

			<p>Yep. I, too, work in [hot] food service. Have another friend who used to work the fryer at Dairy Queen. Both of us can reach into a pot of boiling water to get stuff out (straight into the oven, in the frying pan, etc.,), and both of us regularly warn our other friends (who did not work in similar jobs) to not do that, because it was stupid.</p>		</li>

			<p>A lot of it is also how you hold the plate. The edges and the ridges generally hold less heat than the smooth parts of the plates. When I carry plates also depending on how it was in the window, one side can be lava and one side can be just warm.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes. I still feel my skin being burned, but it doesn't really hurt. Hard to explain. But there will be times when I tell people the plates are insanely hot when I'm carrying them with my hand. I'll walk back to the service well and have someone touch my hand and they will pull back because it hurt them. </p>		</li>

			<p>yeah the gloves where thick and heavy so so they made my weld crooked and messy in the end most of us would just use our hands so we could get a stronger cleaner weld. just a bit more info we didnt grab it directly on the weld or cut we grabbed it by the furthest part but metal being a conductor it still burns like a MF you just get calluses and deal with it for the sake of the job .<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Marking a steak is searing the outside on a grill to get those diagonal grill marks. So for like a wedding of like 120 people, you don't grill 80 steaks to order, you mark them, then finish them in an oven, then keep them warm until they're ready for the main meal. Sometimes more steps involved, but that's the gyst of it. When there is a 150 person wedding and all the entrees come out at the same time, that's probably 2-4 cooks' work.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think it's a combination of both things. For example, many years ago I decided to try a &quot;mind over matter&quot; thing whenever it was really cold, and just pretend it didn't bother me. Doing that makes the cold more tolerable. But for people who spend a lot of time in the cold, they have actually adjusted to being cold all the time, they aren't constantly using force of will to keep them from feeling like they're freezing. <br><br>Related to that, at my old job (cook) we had a regular who loved things really spicy. We liked trying to put the burn on him, and nothing fazed him. It became a challenge, so eventually we got ghost peppers and make this brutal sauce with them. He got a little sweaty. <br><br>At that point, it's clear you probably don't have as strong a response to spice as other people, because physiologically most people are clearly in distress when they eat peppers like that. </p>		</li>

			<p>Contrary to myth, 'spice' from capsaicin does not physically burn your mouth. It simply causes a burn-like reaction temporarily. You build up a tolerance to it over time. But physiologically, your tongue does not change, your reaction to it simply does.<br><br>&quot;The burning and painful sensations associated with capsaicin result from its chemical interaction with sensory neurons. Capsaicin, as a member of the vanilloid family, binds to a receptor called the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1).&quot;<br><br>Yes, I'm the person quoting wiki. No shame here<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin</a><br><br>Edit: I'm ignorant about what smoking does to your tastebuds, but anecdotally, my uncle puts a hell of a lot of salt on his food and he's a-pack-a-day kinda guy</p>		</li>

			<p>I know this will get buried, but you're right about being numb to it now! Pain is one of the things felt by free nerve endings, and can be an indicator that damage is being done to the tissue it innervates and the nerve itself. Free nerve endings don't have much in the way of protection unlike some other mechanoreceptors (there's a deep touch receptor, for example, that is encapsulated, providing more protection) and so are more prone to becoming damaged and working less well as a result. If you're getting along fine without it, I wouldn't worry about it. It's a pretty common thing in a lot of serious cooks.<br><br>TL;DR: The reason you're not feeling pain in your hands is because the nerves in charge of sensing pain have done got all fucked up by all the times your hands got burned cooking.<br><br>Edit: a word.</p>		</li>

			<p>I used to work at a very busy subway restaurant. We didn't use the metal paddle because it was too dangerous and slow to swing around while doing 100+ sandwiches an hour. We put the sandwiches in the high-speed toaster oven, and took them out with our flimsy plastic gloved hands. I did this for six years. I no longer feel pain when my fingers are burned/cut or scraped. I have several scars on my arm from accidentally touching the hot oven. It sorta sucks, but it's kind of cool. I make quesodillas and grilled cheese sans spatula.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not an expert on the subject but I remember hearing somewhere, I feel like it was my highschool bio class, that burns like that often aren't felt because of the quick destruction of nerves near the skin.<br><br>It could also be that since you burn yourself so often your body has adapted by callusing your hands more than it did before.<br><br>Again, not an expert, just educated guesses.</p>		</li>

			<p>The types of burns that destroy the nerves are third degree burns, and those are ones that actually burn the skin away. And while the third degree burn itself won't hurt because the nerves aren't there the entire area around it will be second degree burns and those nerves are still there and will be intense pain.</p>		</li>

			<p>So is it possible that blind people don't even know if they are bruised or burned?</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm sure lots of the time yes! But also, blind people are probably very sensitive to touch and are more in tune with how their body feels, like Daredevil, but a bit less cool.</p>		</li>

			<p>To add to this, most small cuts and bruises dont hurt unless touched. They go unnoticed until you accidently irritate the area or if you see it (because your mind will make note of you being injured there causing you to focus on it which can lead to mild pain/discomfort).</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, little paper cuts and what not hurt so bad because of the air hitting them. When you have something that bleeds, it acts as a barrier to the air</p>		</li>

			<p>Can confirm. Recently took up rock climbing and as an amateur I'm very often scuffing and grazing myself all over but it's not until the day after when I'm using that body part for something else that I realise.</p>		</li>
