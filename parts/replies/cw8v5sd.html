			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up ELI25:
These mediators are called prostaglandins which are proteins that act upon your pain receptors. Essentially, more prostaglandins = more pain.
Here's how it works; when cellular injury occurs, the phospholipid membrane is disrupted and is no longer this neat bi-layer. This allows phospholipases to attack the phospholipids; the phospholipases convert the phospholipids into arachidonic acid; cyclooxygenase then converts the arachidonic acid to something else, and that happens a couple more times with other enzymes and what not. Eventually the molecule produced from this chain of reactions is, wait for it, prostaglandins.
A lot of pain/inflammation medication works by inhibiting this process at the cyclooxygenase stage, so that less prostaglandins can be produced.
EDIT: I'd like to clarify that I am by no means an expert on this topic, I just so happened to have gone over this exact thing in my class that day!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From injury, a chain of chemical reactions happens resulting in chemicals (prostaglandins) that actually cause the sensation of pain.</p>
<p>Pain/inflammation medication disrupt this chemical process, so you don't end up with those pain-sensation-causing chemicals, or at least fewer of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool, I assume the phospholipases, cyclooxygenase, and other enzymes are actually there for another reason, and not just to cause suffering?  Presumably if their action is blocked by the meds, we can live without that portion of their behavior, at the very least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflammation is a really common word, and the other word isn't required to understand the answer (although the parent word &quot;medium&quot; is extremely common too).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the time, it's not the actual injury that hurts, but rather inflammatory thingies that are delayed in accumulating to the site of injury. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exact same thing as
/u/nowayIwillremember said: It is the inflammation that causes the pain. You were satisfied with the answer without learning what mediators are and what they do. Because you didn't need to. /u/nowayIwillremember gave you no additional information that what you already knew. All he did was to restore your confidence that you <em>did</em> know what /u/Murmann said.</p>
<p>Glancing over a sentence about an unfamiliar subject you subconsciously think &quot;this is medical stuff, so I don't know it&quot;. But it isn't, and you do. Believe in yourself and give yourself a chance.</p></div>		</li>
