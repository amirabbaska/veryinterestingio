			<p>Smart. If the injury isn't bad enough to cause too much inflammation, we aren't bothered by it. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; it's not the actual injury that hurts, but rather inflammatory mediators that are delayed in accumulating to the site of injury.<br><br>well that, and adrenaline</p>		</li>

			<p>When I was probably 8, I was playing around near my gtandparent's friend's house. Somehow a stick stabbed my leg and I didn't notice it. I could run around for about 30 minutes. Then I was near everyone and I pull up my pants and I saw blood and a stick. I started crying. Which was funny because I didn't felt anything.</p>		</li>
