			<div class="markdown"><p>My sense is that these thoughts are more likely to happen because we watch movies. On a lower level, below conscious thought, movies are real to us. Sure we can separate ourselves from it, but our subconcious doesn't. So we end up somewhat traumatized by events such as murders and we have sort of a light PTSD, but it's not as bad because we consciously know it wasn't real. But it still affects the thoughts that bubble up from our subconscious, and since it is such an intense and stimulating thought, and a thought that our subconcious thinks is very important for us to be prepared for, we have a tough time not thinking about it.</p>
<p>The people it's bad for are schizophrenics, because they have such a tough time differentiating between what their subconcious is sending to their conscious. A symptom of that is that they literally hear and see things that aren't there, which is to say they literally see and hear things from their subconscious. From what I've read on Reddit, and take of this what you will, but schizophrenics from regions without modern entertainment don't have the same occurrence of evil voices and visions.</p>
<p>But my sense is that perhaps we're all a bit like that. The difference is that people who aren't schizophrenics can much more easily tell the difference between thoughts that are real or not.</p>
<p>This is just what I think based on life experience and observations, I don't necessarily believe it. ;-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if you may be right.  I suffer from intrusive thoughts, and I've always been really sensitive to movie violence or macabre news stories.  I can't watch horror movies or even Game of Thrones because I remember every detail and it all comes back to me at random moments.  Lenore Skenazy, who wrote &quot;Free Range Kids,&quot; questioned why we are terrified for our kids' safety when objectively the crime rate has fallen drastically.  She brought up the 24 hour news cycle and the graphic TV violence  that wouldn't have been shown 50 years ago.  I don't think our lizard brains are good at keeping fake TV violence in a neat box away from our real memories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. Maybe thats why i have dreams about overwatch so often.</p>
<p>I don't even remotely obsess or compete in overwatch, I'm only at like 2600 SR, but I often play before bed.</p>
<p>Lately I've been dreaming about playing. Extremely weird nonsense has been happening too, recently got into Ready Player One and SAO (anime) and now I'm dreaming about playing INSIDE overwatch.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is definitely interesting to read about, and gives me some info about why that's been happening. </p></div>		</li>
