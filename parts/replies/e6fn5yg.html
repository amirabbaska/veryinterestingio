			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the electrical charge disperses from the point it &quot;hits the ground&quot; and since the ground would considered to be at 0 volts and the bolt at tens of million volts, it will depending on the resistance of the earth, take some distance before the voltage reaches zero.</p>
<p>If you stand close to the &quot;hitting point&quot;, the potential between your feet can reach to high values and a current will flow up one of your legs and down the other. So even if the bolt doesn't hit you, you can get electrocuted this way.</p>
<p>This is the reason to why some advice says to run away from dangerous spots with only one feet on the ground at the same time.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The charge (electrons) physically move from clouds to ground (or vice versa). The Earth is one huge conductor, which is why it's used as ground potential so often, eg. the neutral wires in your house are literally connected to a huge stake in the ground outside your house.</p>
<p>Voltage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage" target="_blank">is just a difference in charge potential</a>, so it doesn't &quot;go&quot; anywhere, it just equalizes once the charges move.</p>
<p>IIRC the clouds have so many electrons from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboelectric_effect" target="_blank">friction transfer</a> with the wind, causing such a high (negative) potential.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happens through the nitrous oxides.  Nitrogen gas and oxygen gas plus electricity generates ozone and nitrogen oxides.  You can see this by running the stream of air from an air-fed ozone generator through a water solution.  The nitrogen oxides are visible as the orange gas, and react with water to form nitrates.  The nitrates are washed to the ground</p></div>		</li>

<p>nitrogen fixation</p>

<p>That term typically refers to a process that makes nitrogen available to a plant's root system from consumption. <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281980%29037%3C0179%3AANFBL%3E2.0.CO%3B2" target="_blank">Huh, I guess they say lightning is responsible for the production of NO2 which is used in this process.</a></p></div>		</li>
