			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was younger, like 12 or 13, sometimes in the evening when I got <em>really</em> bored, I would see how long I could hold my eyes as still as possible while looking at one of the little stars on my wall or ceiling. I found that once I was able to lock my eyes in place long enough, my vision would start to blacken entirely. I could never keep it black, though (probably for the best),  since any movement at all would clear up my vision right away.</p>
<p>It's kind of nice to have an answer for why that happens so many years later lol. I was always too anxious about what my optometrist would say to ask him. Plus it's kind of a weird thing to do to begin with and I was already self conscious enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once I was drunk, at a friend's place, couldn't sleep because he was having loud sex in the bedroom just behind the wall of the living room where I was. I started to focus on his Wii's LED to try to beat it in a no blinking contest. My vision went black like you described. Now I know I wasn't winning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory the neurotransmitters in the portion of the retina that is constantly being activated by staring at the exact same spot will simply run out and thus you will perceive blackness since the signal fades.  Looking away will activate different retinal cells which have enough neurotransmitters to pass a signal to your brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically right except for the sake of being exact it's not neurotransmitters which run out, but photo pigment which is present in your rod and cone receptor cells on the retina. </p>
<p>This kind of mechanism is also the reason that if you stare at one thing for ages and then immediately look at a blank, white surface you get a kind of photo negative effect of the thing you were staring at. Let's say the object was just completely red. While staring at it all your red cone cells will have used up all their pigment and won't actually be activating any more because of this (the reason you still see the object while staring at it is because your brain fills in the gap, so to speak). When you then turn to look at a white surface though, your red cells which had been looking at the object still can't activate, even though your other eye colour cells can. For your brain to see &quot;white&quot; it needs all your colour cells to be active at once, so with those red ones missing you get a red-negative sort of shadow of the thing you'd been looking at!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is completely correct.</p>
<p>The movement will active more rods in the eye. There are substantially more rods then cones, and the rods thrive on movement.</p>
<p>Fun test: night, get it pitch black then turn on a very low soft light and try to stare at someone is isnt moving. They blur into the blackness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a result of running out of neurotransmitters. Neurons are programmed to adapt (that is, stop releasing their neurotransmitter to the same stimulus) via various mechanisms. We are wired to detect changes, not absolutes (at least in terms of vision, I'm not sure about other senses).</p>
<p>The effect referred to above by /u/MuffinFairy is known as the Troxler phenomenon. It does not have anything to do with rods being more sensitive to motion as /u/FuzzyWazzyWasnt below me implies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The visual effect is described as the loss of vision as the brain cuts off the unchanging signal from the eyes. The result is &quot;seeing black&quot;, an apparent sense of blindness.</p>
