			<div class="markdown"><p>You can use an electron gun which shoots a beam of electrons. If you think about it as a beam of electron then they are really technically are moving one at a time, but they are moving very fast.  If you decrease the current, which is basically how fast the electrons are flowing, you can eventually be pretty sure that you are firing individual electrons at a time. Just as a disclaimer, this may be slightly oversimplified, just in case someone feels like explaining the practical way it is done in more detail, but this is basically how it works.</p>
<p>EDIT: What I wrote is misleading or maybe my terminology is wrong (see the guy below's comment). When I say &quot;flow&quot; of electrons is controlled by the current I mean how many electrons are moving at once, so maybe that is the wrong way to put it. Anyway the speed of individual electrons, alone or together, is controlled by the voltage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think elections would be more complicated so I'll explain photons: </p>
<p>Take a laser beam. You know the color very well, so you know the energy per photon very well.  </p>
<p>You can measure the power of the beam (energy hitting a detector per second).  </p>
<p>Divide power by photon energy and you have photons per second.  </p>
<p>Divide that by the speed of light (in meters per second, say) and you have photons per meter. (Meter of laser beam) Usually there are LOTS of photons per meter. </p>
<p>If you want fewer photons per meter, you just run your laser through an attenuator (darkened glass) to decrease the beam power until you have few enough average photons-per-meter that you're confident they go through your experiment one-at-a-time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation reminded me of something that I don't understand from the &quot;forget the information&quot; part.</p>
<p>Let's say that you put a sensor after the slits to determine which slit it went through and writes it in some readable support (let's say a file with a signal with 0's and 1's where 0 is the first slit and 1 is the second slit). You also record somehow the interference (or no interference) pattern so you know whether you collapsed the wave to a particule when observing it or not.</p>
<p>Ok let's now assume that you use another similar sensor but it is actually broken and you don't know that it's broken: it is still recording 0's and 1's but with random values. My question here is: would one observe interference (because we are not really observing anything) or no interference?</p>
<p>Another similar question. You now have a mysterious sensor that just gives random 0's and 1's, but in reality it does detect the slit but encodes it in a way that is unknown to you (let's say that there is a lot of random stuff but if you actually see the pattern 010101, it means first slit and the pattern 101010 is actually the second slit, and anything else being no slit or unknown). Since you don't actually know this pattern, I suppose that one would observe the interference pattern. But is this true? </p>
<p>What if one observes the interference pattern but after some years of research someone finds the pattern and you now know what slit was detected years ago? The pattern of interference or no-interference is already recorded from that experiment years ago, so I expect that it would not change... but this seems like a loophole or some misunderstanding that I may have.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what if one observes no interference with this mysterious sensor? Wouldn't that suggest that there is a way to extract the information from the measurements? If that's the case, I could come up with a complicated sensor that captures a particular measurement (let's say something unlikelt like humidity) and see that if there is no interference then there must be a way to decode the humidity to determine what slit the photon went through.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the problem with people saying &quot;observation&quot; when they talk about the collapse of quantum wavefunctions - people assume that &quot;observation&quot; has to be done by a conscious mind. It would be more accurate to talk about &quot;interaction&quot; instead of &quot;observation&quot;.</p>
<p>So let's examine one of your examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You now have a mysterious sensor that just gives random 0's and 1's, but in reality it does detect the slit but encodes it in a way that is unknown to you (let's say that there is a lot of random stuff but if you actually see the pattern 010101, it means first slit and the pattern 101010 is actually the second slit, and anything else being no slit or unknown). Since you don't actually know this pattern, <strong>I suppose that one would observe the interference pattern</strong>. But is this true? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's consider a variation on this. You don't know what the pattern is, but there's someone next to you that does. By your logic, you would see an interference pattern, and they would just see the two lines. Or possibly you'd see the two lines when they were looking, and the interference pattern when they weren't, so if they looked towards it and away then what you see would change. Quantum stuff is weird, but not as weird as either of those.</p>
<p>In reality, it's the <strong>detection equipment</strong> that has &quot;observed&quot;/interacted with the system, not you specifically. If <strong>anything</strong> is obtaining the information from the system by interacting with it, then <strong>everyone</strong> sees the two lines, instead of the pattern.</p>
<p>So to answer your questions: as long as the sensor interacts with the system in the right way, then regardless of whether it stores the information correctly, or whether you know what information it's storing, or whether you will know the information it's storing in the future, then two lines are observed instead of an interference pattern.</p>
<p>The bit about &quot;forgetting the information&quot; has to be done with a second interaction. So if your &quot;forgetting&quot; doesn't involve the original system at all (deleting data on a hard drive, encoding it in a way that someone doesn't understand, or whatever), then it doesn't restore the interference pattern.</p>
<p>Basically it works this way because you can't interact with a quantum system without changing it, and you (generally) can't extract information from a quantum system without interacting with it. You can tell what colour a car is without affecting it, because cars are big, and you do your measurement with something tiny (photons). But when you're measuring tiny quantum things, it's like checking the colour of a car by chucking another car at it, and seeing if it has differently-coloured paint on it afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok thanks for the explanation. It certainly made me scratch my head for a while.</p>
<p>If I understand your point concerning the detection equipment, I could then use the observation of a interference to conclude that my equipment does not observe/interfere with the photon. Equivalently, I can use the observation of non interference to conclude that my equipment can observe/interfere with the photon even if I cannot interpret whatever output the detector gives.</p>
<p>So, if we wondered if photons interact with neutrinos, electromagnetic fields, air pressure, love mojo, or whatever, I just need to set it up on those slits and observe the interfere or non interference.</p>
<p>Does this seem correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slow down there sport. If you put a detector that interacts with the system but does not record correct information (such as the eraser), you would still see an interference pattern. So it's not just the interaction of an outside entity with the system that collapses the wave function. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is completely ignoring the fact that interacting with the system does not always collapse the wave function. You can shine light on the electrons as they pass through the slit and as long as you do not record any information about them, the interference pattern remains.</p></div>		</li>
