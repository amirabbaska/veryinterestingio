			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never seen this coordinate system used in industry. It seems like this would be useful from a perspective of calculating orbits of existing objects (comets, foreign objects) but not planning the orbits of future objects. It seems like a backwards approach. Keplerian elements (posted below) are a more logical way of modeling orbits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when you use prediction, you basically use the position/velocity in the IJK coordinate system and combine it with a future time of flight. </p>
<p>One thing I can say is that Air Force Space Command uses this coordinate system (among other data) for the tracking of objects/debris in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Use this system all the time. We usually call it ECI, or earth centered inertial. And then there are a bunch of specific frames based on that depending on exactly how you define, for example, the North Pole.</p></div>		</li>
