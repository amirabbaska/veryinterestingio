			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, I'm not so sure about a lot of these answers.</p>
<p>Based on the OP's link, I would think that because air is a better insulator than water, you'd actually gain heat <em>faster</em> when immersed in hot water, compared to the air.</p>
<p>It all boils down to the density of the medium you're in.  In air, there's lots of air molecules to transfer heat to you.  But water is many many times more dense than air.  You're surrounded by water molecules, meaning faster energy transfer.  </p>
<p>The OP only looks at when you're cooling down, but for that to happen, you have to be hotter than the water (or air) that surrounds you.  So if the water is colder than you are, it's faster at cooling you down.  If it's hotter than you are, it's faster at heating you up.</p>
<p>And 100 degree air isn't so bad?  If you're in a desert with dry air then it doesn't feel super uncomfortable.  As you add more water to the air (humidity), it begins to 'feel' hotter. Because it's denser.  Again this goes against what the OP is saying.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, with air, your body's natural ways of cooling down help out. Sweating is designed for hot air.  If you're in hot water, your sweat just gets washed away without cooling you down.  Being immersed in hot water seems more dangerous to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do both, you gain and lose heat energy simultaneously. This is because the body constantly creates thermal energy via metabolism and radiates off the excess. In 100 degree weather, if you get on a crowded bus it's uncomfortable because everyone is radiating heat as well as soaking in the hot weather. </p>
<p>In air however, you lose heat energy much slower than in water. So your body compensates by sweating, panting, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be gaining heat. The net transfer of heat will be into your body given that your temperature is lower. There is a previous reddit answer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1u3642/eli5_why_is_a_hot_shower_or_a_hot_tub_so_amazing/" target="_blank">here</a> with many answers to it. I don't think there's a definitive answer to OP's question.</p>
<p>The video you posted is great. Cold tiles feel colder on your feet than carpet even though both are same temperature. But the key here is that they draw heat away from your body because net heat transfer is from hotter object to cooler object. In the air/hot tub case, your body temp is ~98.6F so net heat transfer is into you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it like we are a car. The engine (or metabolism) runs the car (our muscles) and creates heat that is eliminated by the radiator (respiration, radiation and perspiration) and maintains an average temperature of 200F (98.6F). You would gain a little heat at first until you reached an equilibrium, then you would be adding heat to the water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would gain heat until you reached equilibrium, yes. And then you would have no net gain or loss. Your body would try to radiate more heat to the water but it wouldn't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your evidence seems to be contrary to OP's question, not in support of it.  Could you explain how this makes the more intense heat less stiffling?</p></div>		</li>
