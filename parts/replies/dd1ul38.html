<p>They may not have known nuclear physics, but it's a fact that you can put critical amounts of certain compounds together and atoms will be transformed into different elements. You can say that's not alchemy and not chemistry if you like, but you're just doing mental gymnastics then, because it certainly fits the general understanding of what <em>alchemy</em> in particular means.</p></div>		</li>
