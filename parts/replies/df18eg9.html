			<div class="markdown"><p>How long have you tried to get the machine to work? Any idea why it doesn't help? My machine works for me. I think training with a gas mask in the Army got me familiar enough with wearing something on my face for extended periods, so I might have adapted to CPAP a little quicker than normal. It still took a month or two to get used to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have tried 3 different masks for a period over a year. What happens is that the air can't be forced through because of my windpipe gap being so small so the pressure goes full blast all the time and just wakes me up anyway (or I am just waking up regardless and noticing it blowing so hard). I am always waking and moving anyway and having the mask and hose in the way drives me insane. Then there is the multiple bathroom trips a night because I am waking up and having take the thing off and on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am 38 but it went undiagnosed for a long time. I just thought it was my weight but honestly could not remember the last time I slept well even before the weight gain. I knew i snored loud but then someone told me that I stop breathing while I sleep and that I should get it checked out. I still let it go for a long time and didn't take it seriously. Then with the affordable care act I decided to get a sleep study because I was struggling with depression and medication wasn't helping. Lack of sleep is potentially a big reason for the weight gain and depression I was told. After trying the machine and a few different masks unsuccessfully for over a year (still woke up through the night/felt tired) I seen the sleep study Dr again and told him the problem. He sent to another specialist after we discussed options (not many) and I had brought up a surgical procedure I saw information on. The 2nd Dr I saw stuck a scope down my throat and showed me real time on a monitor (too gross and surreal to see the inside of yourself real time , and I like horror movies) after i told him why i was there and about  the surgery that might help. Well, the procedure i had in mind was to remove the flap that closes and vibrates and that unfortunately was only part of the problem. The real problem and the procedure I have scheduled is to move my ENTIRE lower and upper jaw AWAY from the back of my neck to open my windpipe. He had me stick my lower jaw out and breathe and i saw the difference on camera and felt it when taking a breath. He set me up with a Oral surgeon and I am going under the knife in 3 months. I have been told that the recovery is 3/4 weeks and I will feel like I got hit but a truck but it has a good chance to &quot;cure&quot; my apnea. I just wish I planned it better and had some kind of short term disability because now I have to use my tax money to cover my bills while i will be recovering. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the next few months, do you think there's any point to seeing if there's a <a href="https://www.sleepassociation.org/mandibular-advancement-device/" target="_blank">MAD</a> you can try out (with or without the least obnoxious mask)? If it doesn't help, then nothing's changed. But if you could get a good night's sleep now and then with it, maybe that can buy some extra time to research and prepare for the surgery more. Three months can fly by fast.</p></div>		</li>
