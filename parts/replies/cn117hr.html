			<p>&gt;We are an engineering and science society now.<br><br>And definitely not an arts and books society (were we ever?). We're certainly not a culture that values highbrow art, rather &quot;Popular culture.&quot; Kim Kardashian is a whore and not an artist by any stretch of the imagination. Justin Bieber is a no-talent brat. Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga are abject freaks who would be better suited for a circus sideshow act than the Grammy Awards.<br><br>In short, not only are we a society that values numbers and machines over books and art, but that values utter lowest-common-denominator garbage ahead of &quot;art&quot; as well.</p>		</li>
