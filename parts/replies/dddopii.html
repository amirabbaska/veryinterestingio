			<div class="markdown"><p>Great reply, however I think a more important question is &quot;What would it take to get Russia or the USA to unleash their entire nuclear stock pile on each other and basically ensure mutual destruction?&quot;</p>
<p>A lot of the cold war movies typically had a rogue general or bat shit crazy rich person (antagonist of the Bond movies) shown as the aggressor attempting to instigate World War 3. I don't recall having seen a movie where the actual government of either country called for the launch of their nukes. Sure they were ready to retaliate, but not instigate.</p>
<p>So then apart from a rogue general or bat shit crazy person, what would it take to launch that first nuke on enemy soil? Which off course will then open the flood gates for assured mutual destruction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a theory in the 80s that one side could launch a decapitation strike from slbm's before the other could respond - take out the command and control in a very limited strike deliberately avoiding civilian targets  and then step back - the attacked nation now having two options, escalate and end the world or de-escalate and lose the war.
The theory was nobody of sound mind would end the world out of revenge. Launch on warning put a stop to this - any indication of a strike would result in a launch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting distinction between NATO and what was the Warsaw Pact - and, as far as I'm aware, persists in current nuclear planning for both sides - is how they expected a nuclear war to come about.</p>
<p>The West tended to plan for a &quot;conventional&quot; World War 3 (usually initiated by a huge Soviet army crossing into West Germany) gradually escalating from a European war, to worldwide engagement of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces, to the tactical use of nuclear weapons (using small nuclear devices to destroy enemy forces or irradiate their path, but not attack civilian targets), and finally to &quot;countervalue&quot; strikes: a generic term for nuclear strikes targeting cities, and by extension, a country's economy and civilian population).</p>
<p>The Eastern Bloc had no intention of using conventional forces offensively, and assumed any conflict that would involve nuclear weapons would begin with one side immediately launching most or all of their primary arsenal with almost no other military action.</p>
<p>These are both pretty massive oversimplifications, and millions of dollars were spent planning scenarios like these during the Cold War. The exact policy evolved substantially from the early 50s to the late 80s: we know little about the Eastern Bloc's evolving strategy, but the US moved from a naive - and dangerously provocative - &quot;massive retaliation&quot; strategy in the 50s, where <em>any</em> direct military threat to the US would be met with an overwhelming nuclear attack - to the more pragmatic &quot;flexible response&quot;, where a number of nuclear use cases are devised for different levels of threat to the US; close calls like the Cuban Missile Crisis contributed to this transition, as war planners realized that it would be very easy for one of the Cold War's many diplomatic incidents to trigger nuclear strikes. Both sides assumed (and probably still do) that the other side would launch first, and as far as we aware no country with ICBM capability has expressed any immediate desire to initiate nuclear warfare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pretty haunting and unintentional TL;DR.</p></div>		</li>
