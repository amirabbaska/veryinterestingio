<p>Accelerate an electron with just 1 V and it gets a speed of 600 km/s. At that speed, a 50 microtesla magnetic field leads to a force of 5*10^(-18) N. As comparison, the gravitational force is 9*10^(-30) N - weaker by a factor of 500 billions. You would need a ridiculously good shielding against the magnetic field of Earth to have a chance to measure the gravitational force.</p>
<p>And even if you manage to do that: How large is the deflection from gravity? Let your electrons fly through a tunnel 1 km long. They do that in about 2 milliseconds, and fall down by 20 micrometers along that path. That is much less than the width of a human hair. It is also less than the width of your beam.</p>
<p>The numbers get a bit better with protons due to their larger mass, but that is still beyond what experiments can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we suspect it would be interesting by not being interesting correct? </p>
<p>Edit: stupid autocorrect. Being not bring. Was implying we believe it will behave like normal matter with regards to gravity, but it will still be interesting to see it validated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh?</p>
<p>Everyone expects antimatter to fall down - but we don't have a direct experimental validation of that yet. Some experiments hope to test antimatter in free fall in the next 2-3 years, but they have to use neutral antihydrogen for that, which makes the setup quite challenging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that was exactly what I was getting at. We expect it to fall down, but it will still be awesome when we finally see it happen (or even more exciting if it didn't). </p></div>		</li>
