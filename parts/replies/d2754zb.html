			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but the question still seems like it hasn't been answered, when I look at a mirror I see what is being reflected by it, I don't &quot;see&quot; silver. So why can I tell/know that a mirror <em>is</em> silver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isnt mirrors and other reflective surfaces technically a very light grey color? Since the do not reflect 100% of incoming light? Grey isnt a color tho, its just a medium between white and black. I think that is why we percive unsmooth reflective surfaces like plain metal as a light grey. Mirrors are highly reflective tho and if you put up two mirrors against eachother so the reflection bounces you will see a deep green color at the end of the reflective tunnel it creates. I dont know if it is the glass that does that, probably?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, most glass contains iron oxide due to impurities. If you reflect light back and forth between two of them, that greenish hue is amplified each time, looking more and more green at each level of reflection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, one of my all time favorite sites explains it very well: <a href="http://viscorbel.com/vray-materials-part-3-metals/" target="_blank">http://viscorbel.com/vray-materials-part-3-metals/</a></p>
<p>ELI5: Pure metal doesn't have a color - what we see as 'color' on metals is actually dielectrics (long word for rust, essentially). The more reflective a metal is, the lighter we see it. A mirror is extremely reflective, so we see it as a light silver. If a metal, let's use cast iron, is dull and absorbs a lot of light, it's darker. The green tint some are referring to is NOT in the mirror's metal - it's in the glass covering the mirror. Nothing is perfectly transparent with glass, which is why a good camera lens is so damn expensive.</p>
<p>ELI25: Metal's brightness is determined by its reflectance, which is, in turn, determined by its fresnel value. This means a metal becomes more reflective, and therefore brighter, at a small acute angle. The closer you get to 0 degrees (which is technically impossible, so use 1 degree for reference), the &quot;brighter&quot; a metal seems to get. Every metal uses a different fresnel curve, but all of them get brighter at smaller angles. For example, aluminium is more reflective than plastic, until 0 degrees. (NOTE: if you're looking at Viscorbel, their curves have what I call 0 degrees as 90 degrees. Same thing, different mark) According to reflectance theory, all materials are perfectly reflective at 0 degrees. </p>
<p>See the linked site for some photos and example curves.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Pure metals do have color, which can be seen by removing the oxide layer in an oxygen-deprived environment.  We just don't typically see that color.</p></div>		</li>
