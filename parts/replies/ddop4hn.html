<p>I don't agree, most of this source are not based anymore on beta-decay but rely on particle accelerator (better control of the dose, safer since you cannot turn-off a cobalt source, no nuclear waste to handle).
In the MeV range, electrons and gamma ray will interact mainly per compton scattering so weak interaction is far from dominating (but do exists) </p></div>		</li>
