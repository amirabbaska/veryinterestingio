			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in the same way that the United States can threaten Canada and China with exorbitant tariffs on imports which <em>totally</em> isn't backfiring on the US at all.</p>
<p>Northern Europe could react to that threat by leaving the Eurozone, thus leaving the blackmailers to deal with their own economic crises without any support from everyone else - worse, since it would erode any good will so it wouldn't just be that Northern Europe would no longer be a part of the economic system helping them, they would be disinclined to assist in any way.</p>
<p>It's way more beneficial to have everyone working together towards the common goal of having a strong European economy that's being boosted by the free trade enabled by sharing a currency.</p></div>		</li>
