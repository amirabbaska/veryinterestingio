			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when flying into outer space was unproven and considered likely to fail, the astronauts were all military personnel. There is substantial legal precedent for the government to risk the lives of military personnel. The legal situation of a civilian company sending civilians on a mission with a high chance of failure is rather different.</p>
<p>The colonial pioneers, and most other precedent for highly dangerous civilian expeditions, hail from a time when human beings from certain social classes (i.e. sailors) were only slightly less disposable than livestock, whereas the Captain and his Officers were completely free to risk themselves and the crew in any way the ship's financier was willing to back. Focusing on risk and liability, there is almost no parallel between the 18th century legal environment and our modern one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I take your point that life was cheaper back then, and as you say, sailors were pretty low on the pecking order.</p>
<p>But you've then pointed out that educated and competent Captains and Officers were choosing to do it - i.e. weighing the risks and giving <em>informed consent</em> to the risks by participating in the voyage. </p>
<p>And we still see this today when round-the-world sailors engage in global yacht races knowing that in the mid-Atlantic there is no Search-and-Rescue. <em>They weigh the risks and choose to sail</em>. And every year a few of them die.</p>
<p>For what? For sport? That's retarded. How has that sort of dangerous, unneccesary yachting not been banned by every civilised country yet?</p>
<p>Because grown-ups are allowed to weigh the risks and make their own choices. As they will for Mars One (if they raise the finance and it actually happens).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're still going with an activity with a high probability of success, not to mention a long tradition (which we all know trumps logic). Why not pick on me about wingsuits and stuff, right? </p>
<p>That at least points out that Mars One won't risk anything that's insured. Wingsuiters have to pay for their own injuries and it might even be hard to file a claim for damage on aircraft used for wingsuit flights. On the other hand, we all have to wear seatbelts in cars because breaking ourselves affects everybody's insurance premium. </p>
<p>You absolutely <em>can</em> get in legal trouble for sailing recklessly in a wide variety of ways, partially because boats are also insured vehicles. Other liabilities of reckless sailing, such as being fined for even risking the sinking of a hull in a critical passage, raise practical questions about Mars One - are they going to be taking up a premium landing site with a doomed colony? Is there a risk that a failed mission could leave junk floating around mars? What sort of PR outcome can be expected and how will it affect the &quot;official&quot; government mars programs? Get it out of your head that they are only risking themselves.</p>
<p>Back around to sailors and officers. The difference about the classes back then was that the upper crust had the god given right to fuck shit up if they wanted to. When these people got mad at each other, they dueled. Often. It was before the law was all about protecting us from each other. Mostly it was about protecting the rich from the poor and a few protections for the poor to keep society flowing. This business of protecting the rich from the rich is all very new.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Didn't realize Ctrl-Enter = Save. Rest of comment follows:</p>
<p>You're right, but at the same time most of the people on board those pioneering ships were professional crew: trained sailors, men at arms, craftsmen, accountants, etc. Not to mention scores of slaves and/or workers and/or prisoners. There were passengers, sure, not least of all the noblemen and their families, but the colony has at least a fair chance when you've got a literal boatload of people qualified to administrate it.</p>
<p>My main concern about Mars One is that they seem to be sending an amateur crew with just a few experts to keep things running. From what I've gathered about the project so far, the candidate selection process doesn't have enough respect to the need for expert colonists. Instead it looks like we're fixin' to send a ship full of citizens to die as guinea pigs in a hostile new environment. It doesn't seem ethical to me, unless I've misunderstood the project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not if you get the right licence. SpaceX and Orbital Sciences both launch out of Florida. Private companies doing their own private launches.</p>
<p>No problem launching rockets from Florida whatsoever - you just have to tell the authorities that's what you intend to do first.</p>
<p>You do realise the vast majority of satellites and rocket launches are just that - commercial launches conducted by commercial companies. Not governmental launches (NASA/USAF/whoever). People assume spaceflight is the preserve of governments.</p>
<p>That may have been true, but it's not any more. It's dominated by private businesses - commercial rockets carrying privately owned satellites and payloads.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, if governments control licenses, they set the terms. I can't drive a bus would getting a license and I can't get a license without proving that I can drive that bus of people with reasonable safely.</p></div>		</li>
