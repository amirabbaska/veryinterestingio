			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, yeah, absolutely, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to debunk anybody's beliefs, and when the topic comes up I just don't participate in the conversation. I've got no intention of arguing with anybody over it. I view it the same as religion, really; some people really need to believe in something, and they're absolutely welcome to. If they believe that their loved ones are still around in some capacity after they died, and that brings them comfort, then I wouldn't dream of trying to ruin that for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not always innocent though, I worked in Japan and had a Japanese girlfriend, we decided to try and move to Australia for a year or so.  Before leaving, without me knowing, she visited a psychic.  The psychic told her not to go with me, that I was a foreigner and all I wanted was sex and that I would take all her money and leave her destitute in a foreign country.   Her readings gave her massive anxiety, fear and insecurity.  She ended up leaving after a week and we broke up shortly after.  My girlfriend's superstition and vulnerability and the psychic's racism masked as prophecy really screwed my life for a long time, it had a huge effect on both our lives.  These frauds give people life altering advice with zero sense of responsibility.  I'm not saying you should try to debunk their beliefs but it's certainly not an innocent victimless practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having medical professionals believe things that aren't factual is problematic. I have had doctors assistants tell me how my Ulcerative Colitis was from original sin, and that prayer would help as much as medicine. That's a huge problem..... Belief in psychic ability or mediums is just as worry some. What if a medium tells them the next patient doesn't need appropriate care, or that the care the doctor recommends is wrong and they should do some ritual instead? If they believe mediums work, why would they not follow that advice? Same for th overly religious in medical fields. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one of those positions where you need to leave personal beliefs and professional training separate. I don't care if you're a Satanic practitioner who believes in ritualistic sacrifice, as long as you are professional in the workplace and do your job as my doctor. I might feel uneasy about it if I wanted to get closer to you, but as long as you do your job, I could care less if you're also a nudist over the weekend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel the same way as you. These people are charlatans and are taking advantage of people in a very weak state...but at the same time, if it helps a person move on with their life, it's hard for me to knock it. One of my relatives saw a &quot;psychic&quot; and some of the things this woman told her (while obvious bullshit to me), were very special to my relative, and brought her comfort. In a way, it almost seems like a necessary service, and maybe they justify it that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their goal is never to make you &quot;move on&quot;, it's to keep you vulnerable and dependent on their services for as long as financially possible. Talking about your emotions is good, but paying money in order to talk about them is an important line one should never cross. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is a problem with it. Several. </p>
<p>It's manipulative and false. Feeding on those in a time of need. It is just inherently wrong in that aspect. If you're mourning you are more vulnerable and it's cruel to take advantage of that. </p>
<p>Confirmation bias allows us to only remember  when they get it right and doesn't let us see the misses which can be confusing, painful and embarrassing. Say this psychic comes in and everyone is on board with the reading. How accurate and comforting. You have just lost someone so you give it a shot. They give you false information. Maybe it isn't a big deal. They say, &quot;I feel your mother here, she wants you to know she loves you. She says she is here with your father and blah blah blah&quot;. Well, dad is at home. But you have heard of the psychics accuracy. The reading moves on. You are confused and disappointed that all of the other good things said are now tainted by the falsehood given to you. Now what? </p>
<p>So what if, the reading goes well. It's accurate. Now you have faith in their garbage. Ask them other questions. Insight. Maybe bad advice and other garbage follows. But they were correct about X  so Y must be true. </p>
<p>Life is painful and hard fairly often but this money sucking liars don't make it better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Falsity isn't always the end of the world - often, it's useful. Now, with psychics, it is almost always useless garbage. But for some people, they'll spend a little bit of money, get some closure, and move on. I don't think it's right to take that away from someone. Now, if someone is dumping money into psychics, wasting lots of time with it, pushing their beliefs on others or - much worse - allowing their superstitions to negatively affect their work, then that is a problem and needs to be shut down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all falsity is bad, but when its inherent reason is to take advantage of someone for money it is.  Psychics have &quot;comforted&quot; parents of missing children, telling them they are dead and have moved on, only to find out later they were alive.  So, you give closure when closure isn't the answer.  All for $$$.  No, this isn't ALL psychics, but when you give credibility to a completely fraudulent &quot;profession&quot; that is when these types of mistakes and lies begin to have to power to hurt people.</p>
<p>Sure, if someone want to see a psychic I won't stop them, but if I care about them I will certainly discuss the issues of psychics with them.  </p>
<p>If you want to spend money to get closure there are many qualified and talented therapists. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course OP should not try to convert his coworkers, but is his disheartening when medical personal believe non empirical stuff like this. I share OPs frustration that people who have studied science believe bronze age crap simply because they fear death.  My field is comparative religions and even theolgians are skeptical.... </p></div>		</li>
