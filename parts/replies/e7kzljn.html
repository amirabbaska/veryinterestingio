<p>While it's technically <em>possible</em> to us the US military on US soil, it's usually the National Guard or Reserves from other states that assist other states that have declared a state of emergency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to note that those very abilities are where there's the highest risk of abuse.</p>
<p>Dictatorships often declare such emergencies and never revoke them, using them as the excuse for why whatever they're doing is legitimate.</p>
<p>Over in the US, the National Emergencies Act had to be passed in the 70s in order to end at least 4 never-revoked national emergencies still in force, and to reign in some 400+ special powers, some fairly sweeping, delegated to the president and other branches of the government under those conditions. Much of those protections were overridden by PATRIOT.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union dissolved due to abuse of this as well: The hardline coup leaders in '91 declared a state of emergency in order to try and pull it off, using measures and powers set up a year earlier &quot;in case an emergency were to happen&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, the term Dictator comes from a roman officer who would get full military power for a maximum of 6 months to solve a specific emergency. Julius Caesar pretty much gave the term the connotations we think of today by getting declared 'Dictator in Perpetuity'. So yeah, this problem is pretty old.</p></div>		</li>
