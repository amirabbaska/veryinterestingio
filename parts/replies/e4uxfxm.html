<p>Its TTL gets decreased and the IP checksum gets recalculated (&lt;--- major stupid idea in the IP protocol, the TTL should have been left out of the checksum, IPv6 doesn't have one).</p>

<p>I don't think it was stupid back in the 70s when that RFC was written. It's true today that header corruption is rare, but was that true 40 years ago? From a logical standpoint it makes sense to write a protocol with error checking built in.</p>
<p>If you think about it it's more work, isn't it? If a router calculates an ipv4 checksum mismatch it drops the packet. If a corrupt ipv6 packet rolls through it gets forwarded erroneously to another router that then processes it and drops it. I guess it is trivial when you factor in how amazingly fast routing is these days.</p>
<p>If my line of thinking is incorrect please teach me something I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The checksum was a good idea, just calculate it with everything but the TTL and the checksum can stay the same for the entire path, hence no need to recalculate it before sending.</p></div>		</li>
