			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is due to having orange objects in the room. The way color wavelengths work is that the object absorbs all colors but the ones it reflects. So a red apple absorbs all colors but red. So if you shine a blue light on a red apple, you would not be able to see the apple, as there is no red light to reflect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll bet they were sodium vapor lamps or some other sort of monochromatic light source.</p>
<p>Basically if a light source only emits one wavelength, you get no color separation because nothing can reflect two or more different wavelengths in different amounts, which is how you perceive color... something absorbing a lot except in the red where it reflects will appear red. If there is only one wavelength of light, all you can see is level of reflection vs absorption, not color.</p>
<p>The reason it is orange-ish I would guess is because that is the wavelength of light that looks like most like white light while still being monochromatic. </p>
<p>Low pressure sodium vapor lamps <a href="http://www.lamptech.co.uk/Images/Illustrations/SO%20SPD%27s.jpg" target="_blank">are pretty close to truly monochromatic.</a> I'll bet that's what this is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what they were. I saw this exhibit too, it was either at LACMA (Los Angeles) or MOMA (San Francisco), I can't remember which. The rooms were windowless and only illuminated by sodium vapor lamps, so everything was a gradient on an orangish greyscale. It was very interesting to see how everyone's clothing looked in that light versus the natural daylight just outside the room. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it made everything black and white though, everybody's skin and clothing.  the wall were white and ended up gleaming the same color as the light projected on it, but literally everything else was black and white regardless of its original color.  i wish i could go experience that again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain automatically white-balances what it sees based on environmental clues, so that environment lighting doesn't change the colors you perceive. Take <a href="http://www.sibleyguides.com/wp-content/uploads/Color_illusion_cubes2_web.jpg" target="_blank">this color illusion</a>, the marked squares are the same physical mix of wavelength (grey), but completely different perceptual colors (blue and yellow), since the brain has removed the blue and yellow environmental tint.</p>
<p>I assume that there is something similar happening in the exhibit, but they are using monochromatic light with only a single wavelength, so your brain doesn't get enough information to reconstruct the original color. It just white-balances the environment as a whole and then assumes there rest is some shade of grey, since that's a plausible explanation for the sensory data and there is no other color information left that could make you perceive a different color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can still see a  red apple when shining blue light on it. It just absorbs <em>most</em> of the blue light, not all of it. An apple wouldn't suddenly become invisible in a blue light environment. For that, you'd need to invent vantared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are probably Low Pressure Sodium (LPS) lights. They have a very narrow band and anything under this light loses all color. They're very common in Northern CA as street illumination because they are low maintenance. Another upside is that since they have such a narrow band, the local telescope can easily filter it out.</p>
<p>Park under that light with a red car and no matter how close you get to it, you can only see grey. It's an interesting experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those were be sodium vapor lamps.  They used to be used all the time in street lamps because they made objects stand out better than other lights, at the time.  Now, LEDs and halogen bulbs are much brighter and energy efficient</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wear eyeglasses with a very strong prescription (-9), so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration" target="_blank">chromatic aberration</a> is a real problem for me at night while driving. With monochromatic lights such as street lamps, or yellower lights like older headlights, it's not a problem, but something about the focused, single-point nature of LED lights contrasted against the night sky means I see cop cars everywhere, because I see blue lights when they're just bright white LEDs. It drives me nuts.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, chromatic aberration causes me to see fringes of colour around lights, and if I'm looking at a traffic light out of the corner of my eye, the globe of light appears like it's floating <em>beside</em> the light fixture. It's not a problem looking straight on, but looking out of the side of my glasses makes the different colours focus on different spots. And apparently there's nothing I can do about it, short of getting laser-corrective eye surgery.</p>
<p>For that reason, I wish LEDs were never used in streetlights and headlights.</p></div>		</li>
