			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do this. Listen to channel 6 audio on the hi-fi. I tuned the pilot carrier of the stereo decoder to get the TV stereo audio. A bit hissy, but worked fairly well. Since channel 6 aired SNL, I watched plenty of 90s bands in hissy stereo. And liked it.</p></div>		</li>
