<p>Members who've been in the chamber a long time tend to respect the rules of the body, as well as their colleagues who they've come to know on a personal level.  Recall that the worst gridlock under Obama came when a bunch of new Tea Party freshmen entered the Congress and started throwing grenades everywhere.  It's harder to lob over-the-top insults and accusations against your political opponents when you've known them for years, met their kids, remember the time their parents battled cancer, etc. You're more likely to understand your opposition's good faith and work on compromise. </p>
<p>Similarly, the longer you're in the chamber, the more likely you are to respect the norms and institutions that hold the government together. When politics breaks down into tribes with no respect for procedure in rules, it's a recipe for the collapse of civil society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Many of the top positions such as whip or speaker will never be filled by newly elected representatives. These positions come with many years of experience. However, that's not to say that at anytime the constituents are not happy with the results of their representative, they should form a movement to vote them out. As much as term limits sound like a great idea, the reality is the concept is not feasible. </p></div>		</li>
