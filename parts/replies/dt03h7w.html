			<div class="markdown"><p>One key difference is that, at least in the US, you are only allowed a limited number of transfers to/from a savings account per month. Also, you can't use a debit card attached to a savings account. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. You're limited to six transactions per month. </p>
<p>Savings accounts are more or less mid term holding, from a few months to a couple years. Checking is meant for short term holding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except many banks all over the world make no distinction, they just call it a &quot;bank account&quot;. There really is no need to differentiate them anymore due to the low interest rates. Savings accounts don't pay much interest, so merging them with a checking or current account is pretty normal everywhere. </p></div>		</li>
