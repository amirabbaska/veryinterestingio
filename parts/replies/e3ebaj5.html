			<div class="markdown"><p>The National Guard is organized separately from the DoD. National Guard troops do not work for the federal government, they work for the state that they are assigned (generally their home state) and take orders from that state's governor, not the President. Because of the Posse Comitatus Act, no military personnel can apprehend a civilian (except on DoD controlled property) without the government declaring a National Security Zone or Martial Law. National Guard attempts to bridge this gap by not technically being part of the DoD, but their own separate entity within each state. A Governor can activate the Guard without declaring martial law or a national security zone, so troops can be used more freely for &quot;show of force&quot; type positions, and when operating under a police department, they may be given arrest authority. </p></div>		</li>
