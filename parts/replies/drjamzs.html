			<div class="markdown"><p>For those interested in pruning skin, note that one [case study] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2464382/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2464382/</a>) found that a man with nerve damage in his hand did not have pruning occur where the nerve damage was present. </p>
<p>Also consider how your entire body does not become pruney when you sit in water for a long time, suggesting that pruning fingers is a trait that is not unique to skin in general. Now, the skin on your palms and soles looks different from the skin on the rest of your body (exemplified by lighter color and a shine), so perhaps it is something unique to skin on your palms and soles. Or maybe it is some combination. But this is why the comment OP did not want to get into it - and it is also not relevant to his excellent explanation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That layer of skin thickens to form calluses. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly. The living layers of skin on the palms of the hands isn't getting thicker. The rate that old cells die and are replaced is constant, the old cells just die differently. Calluses are skin cells that underwent cornification before they died. They lose their nucleus and begin to build up the matrix that holds itself together and the matrix that holds itself to other cells. When a cornified cell finally dies, it has no organelles and is a rigid mass of cemented fibers that remain attached to living skin.</p></div>		</li>
