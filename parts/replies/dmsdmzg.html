<p>*The paper could be important if encoding specificity plays a role. But the typing notes would be better for tests taken on computers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takersâ€™ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yesbut: interested in if it's speed related -- one of the main reasons that hand-writers rephrase content is because hand-writing is slower than typing. But would typists rephrase if they were equally slow as if they were writing the concept?</p>
<p>In other words, is it the motor skills of moving a pen around, or is it just the information in particular? (I know there's another comment addressing this exact question)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do think it's related to the speed of the recording method. It would be very interesting to see if reduces typing speed would increase learning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the key difference. In handwritten notetaking, the goal is to understand the information as you write so you can make comprehensible notes for review later. This processing step is absent or limited when transcribing notes on a computer by typing since often the goal is to simply copy the words and information for later review. Better notetaking strategies may need to be developed for digital notes to be beneficial in the same way as handwritten notes. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it depends on the situation.  If the lecturer or meeting leader or whatever is going slow enough for me to do that, then great, I will reframe it more concisely whether I write it or type it.</p>
<p>About half the time, though, I find myself just frantically typing everything that's said because everything is moving way too fast for that.  I can't risk missing some key detail because I was pondering how to phrase something.  In theory, I condense the notes after the meeting..... in theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if memorizing is all you're going for, then you're not really learning much. Also, memorizing is more efficient via mnemonics than via writing anyway, so that by itself isn't a sufficient reason to hand write something.  On the other hand, does this apply to processing new concepts and ideas as well?</p></div>		</li>
