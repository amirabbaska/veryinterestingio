<p>However, as many people have pointed out, the shows up clearer if using playing cards instead of your fingers. Pic from /u/graaahh is a better example than my own drawing. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Wmmxv" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/Wmmxv</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been sitting here trying to do this for 15 minutes and now my eyes are all screwed up lol.  Apparently I'm the only one in the thread who doesn't see this.  All I see is a millimeter wide slit of light.  Wonder if it has to do with the fact that I'm wearing my glasses and not contacts right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you tried experimenting with distance of the fingers from each other and from your eyes? </p>
<p>I have 20/20 vision so it might be different, but this effect is the most apparent to me when my fingers are almost touching and are 3 inches away from my eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have bad eye sight. Take off your glasses, close one eye and move your hand to your other eye so that your fingers touch the socket. My fingers are positioned horizontally. I'm looking through the space between my lower index and my lower middle finger because it forms a natural gap. Look at a bright light source like your windows or the sky. Close the gap until it starts to darken. You should see feint and very narrow strings of shadow spanning the gap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow these are excellent drawings that explain it perfectly. I cant see the bands anyway though :(</p>
<p>Am i supposed to have my one open eye focused on the fingers? Or should i focus it on a spot far behind them, making my fingers blurry?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like your skin is connecting to one another, those are the &quot;bands&quot;. The best example would be to take two finger tips and hold them at a distance, hold them next to your eye and slowly close the distance until you see them connect but you did not do so physically.</p>
<p>Edit. hold your fingers 3-6 inches from your eye, at that possibly further</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its funny because i did this but noticed when the skin connects, its because ive actually closed the visual gap without touching my fingers... Just rotate your hand back lol.</p></div>		</li>
