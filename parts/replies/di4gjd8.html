<p>In some regions, they have been made illegal precisely because they reduce manoeuvrability; in my Canadian province of Manitoba, they were outlawed back in the '90s. </p>

<p>This only applies to non-steerable axles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've been pretty much standard in much of the US for years now.  Many States won't even allow non-steerable lift axle trucks to be used on municipal jobs.  I think the last non-steerable we installed on a truck (in New England) was ~2007.  Given the small price difference, there's no real reason I can think of to not go with a steerable in the majority of applications.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You still see them on a few older farm trucks</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't really say; all I know is, I see them driving around in rural areas with the tag axles up. If they were in use, I wouldn't know, as they look much the same when they're dropped. </p>
<p>I know that they're outlawed in Manitoba, but the reason I gave for still seeing them is just an educated guess.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd imagine they'd be turning when they're dropped.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply!</p></div>		</li>
