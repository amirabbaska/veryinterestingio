Thanks to the structure of the Milky Way we cannot directly observe i believe, so for now its only a gigantic gravitational anomaly. Since it's so incredibly massive, it affects our galaxies direction and speed in a way that shouldn't be happening if something enormous weren't there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laymen here, but i'll take a stab at it. IIRC the effect of the distant Gravitational bodies is overridden by our local Gravitational bodies when it comes to having noticeable effects on the movement of Earth/Sun/SolarSystem/Galaxy etc. Gravity effects the system as a whole but not the system on a micro level at such distances. So for example, while our solar system is in orbit of the galaxy Earth doesn't really care or feel any effect of being in orbit around the Galactic center because the Gravitational effects of the Sun are far more significant than the effects of the Galaxy on Earths movement through space. Another example would be the proposed methods of redirecting an asteroid by placing a small object near it for an extended period of time to use the mass of that object to exert a small but noticeable effect on the path of the asteroid by way of having a small gravitational pull over an extended period of time to effect a change, much like the great attractor exerts a small but noticeable effect on the motion of celestial bodies, the force of the gravity while extremely small has still been enough to have a noticeable impact on our local clusters movement in comparison to the rest of the Universe.</p>
<p>The two most important factors affecting the gravitational force between two objects are their mass and the distance between their centers. As mass increases, so does the force of gravity, but an increase in distance reflects an inverse proportionality, which causes that force to decrease exponentially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever been for example on the camping site of a loud, large music festival? You can still hear the mainstage at a certain but not very high loudness. Experience tells you, if your TV had that volume, 30m away you would hardly hear it anymore. However if you walk 30 more meters away from the stage, it still sounds just as loud. </p>
<p>This is of course due to the total distance between you and the stage not significantly growing.</p>
<p>The interesting thing now is of you come across a tent playing their own music. When close to it, you only hear their music as it is much louder at this distance. However, when you continue walking away from the stage, the tents music fades away quickly and you once again hear only the stage. Despite the tent still being much closer.</p>
<p>Gravitational force fades similarly as sound volume. We are close to the earth or the sun. Around here, their gravity dominates. But the gravity of the great attractor is still there. You just do not feel it in our solar system. It works on our sun and on us. And if you go a few light-years, it is still as strong and works on all the other stars in our galaxy just as strong. While the gravity of our sun, being so unfathomably less massive, is neglectable after some light-years.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why the moon orbits the earth while the earth orbits the much more massive sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the speed of light is absolute, couldn't we measure the speed at which it's going across the 3 axis in order to determine an absolute position?</p>
<p>Great success!!! I am confused.
Some of you are saying that the speed is absolute only in relative terms (if I measure it from my frame of reference, it will be moving at c in all directions), but when measured externally it could be measured as being faster than 1c.  Others say it will be 1c regardless of which frame of reference it's measured in, which doesn't quite make sense to me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The results from general relativity only tell us that the laws of physics don't privilege any inertial reference frame, and all of our best experiments confirm this.

<p>There are philosophical arguments for and against absolute space. As you noted, Newton believed in absolute space (despite also believing in Galilean relativity, which similarly didn't privilege various inertial frames of reference), and devised various thought experiments to argue in favour of it, most famously his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_argument" target="_blank">bucket argument</a>. On the other side of the argument, you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach%27s_principle" target="_blank">Mach's principle</a> and the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-holearg/" target="_blank">hole argument</a>. Much of the debate comes down to the nature of rotation: if there is no absolute space, then when something rotates, what is it rotating with respect to?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's rotating with respect to a line drawn through its center of mass, as determined by an observer in some particular reference frame.  A different observer in a different reference frame might observe a different kind of rotation, or perhaps even no rotation at all.</p>

<p>What about the fact that the speed of light has been measured to be the same when the Earth is moving towards the Sun as when it is moving away from it?  These measurements are incompatible with the idea that both space and time are absolute, and once it is shown that either one or the other must be relative, it's easy to show that the other must be as well.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>And that's the issue. Imagine a universe with just two spheres in it. One of the spheres is rotating, and experiences a centrifugal force which tends to make it bulge out. But what is it that makes the one sphere experience a centrifugal force, but not the other, since we could easily just switch reference frames? That's the basis of the argument for absolute space.</p>

<p>This... is not a rigorous statement. I assume you're referring to the Michelson-Morley experiment, which provided strong evidence against the existence of the luminiferous aether. None of that is incompatible with there also being absolute space. It just means that the speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames. So again, we have excellent, empirical evidence for the principle of relativity, but that's not the same as evidence against the existence of absolute space, or time. I imagine you're thinking that because clocks and rulers are affected by Lorentz transformations that space and time are not &quot;absolute&quot;, but that is not what is meant by the term. Rather, what is meant is that space and time are not merely measures between objects and events, but have some independent existence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. That's equivocation on the term &quot;privileged&quot;. Here, all that is said is that the laws of physics don't have any differences between inertial reference frames, and so none of those reference frames are &quot;privileged&quot; in that sense. Absolute space may privilege, for example, an orientation with respect to which we may measure absolute rotations. But even if it didn't, we could still have absolute space, and just have no privileged frames.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that the laws of physics don't privilege any inertial reference frame is, for some, a pretty good reason to not believe in absolute space! But it doesn't entail that fact.</p></div>		</li>
