I don't necessarily deal with knives and so on but when it comes to mallets and hammers these are one of the easiest examples to understand when it comes to how force from certain types of metal can deform other metal or even softer materials. I know this is about cutting stuff but if you're generally interested in how metals are shaped and so on you might find this information useful.</p>
<p>If you hit metals like silver with a mallet you will quickly find that because of the larger surface area it bends the metal more without denting it. This is partly because mallets in Jewellery are made out of hide or some other soft material rather than metal like a blacksmith would use. This allows Jewellers to quite easily shape the silver, depending on the way the metal is mixed with other metals gold can actually take more effort to deal with.</p>
<p>Contrast to that if you hit the same metal with a metal hammer or some such you'll simply make dents in whatever you're trying to shape it into something. Blacksmiths for example will probably be using really strong metal like steel for their mallets because otherwise the mallet would simply bounce off and not do anything no matter how much pressure you apply to the metal you're trying to shape.</p>
<p>For the record though that's just speculation on my part from what I know in Jewellery. I don't know enough about the more large scale stuff that metalworkers deal with but I imagine the physics would be the same. To simplify it, when it comes to metalworking generally it seems that surface area and the types of the material you are striking against each other are what matters the most when shaping something.</p>
<p>Edit: You can of course also blast your metal with heat depending on the situation to soften it if you're having trouble which is what the large scale metalworkers tend to do you don't necessarily need to do that if the material you're working with is fairly soft.</p></div>		</li>
