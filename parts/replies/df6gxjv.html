			<div class="markdown"><p>That has to do with aerodynamics. Something shaped for high speed and low drag would normally look somewhat like a torpedo(atleast at the beginning). With that shape, the air splits into two currents and goes around the item. The nose would have difficulty pulling air in because there would be a void in-front of it, essentially a vacuum. The cone that you are referring to helps direct the air into the nasal passage and eliminates the void.  </p>
<p>You are thinking of the tubercles within the nostrils that are thought to provide support to the lungs of the falcon. It is theorized that high speeds directed at an open nasal passage could damage the lungs of the bird, these tubercles are thought to prevent that. </p></div>		</li>
