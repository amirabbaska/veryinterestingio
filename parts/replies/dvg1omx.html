They are aware of themselves and their surroundings but not aware of their knowledge and their perspective</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes -- if you remove the &quot;just&quot; part. You're referring to the best understood and most provable aspect of consciousness, the one that anesthesiologists care about (and related but less understood aspects related to sleep).</p>
<p>Most (if not anesthesiologists) have reason to think there are other aspects beyond that that are simply less well understood.</p>
<p>For instance, just to pick one piece of a large subject, and although I personally don't think that the infamous &quot;philosophical zombies&quot; can logically exist, nonetheless the famous debates between smart people like Daniel Dennet and David Chalmers on the topic have brought out some interesting nuances in the philosophy of consciousness.</p>

<p>And I'm not sure at all that people would be satisified with AI that was &quot;merely&quot; conscious in the sense of anesthesiologists.</p>
<p>But if you're personally 100% sympathetic to the view of anesthesiologists, that's ok too, so long as you keep in mind that it also hasn't been proven that that's the entirety of the subject.</p></div>		</li>
