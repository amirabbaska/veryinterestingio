			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not just evacuation. When the plane hits the runway (after an incident or just because of rough emergency landing), everything in it continues to move forward maintaining the velocity. You only have the lap belt, so your torso will move forward and then after impact with the front seat whip back. With seat down you are pretty much guaranteed to have a concussion and/or snap your neck on the impact even during short-term 7-8G deceleration (which is considered survivable). Also, you can slip under your lap belt during impact, which means damaging your lower body and spine. The brace position therefore is safer, because helps to avoid whiplash and lets the lap belt work optimally. Technically speaking, if we were sitting in aeroplanes backwards and had 3 or 5 point harnesses, our chances of survival would be a lot higher. If you noticed, the flight attendants are sitting like that during landing and take-off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airtours_Flight_28M" target="_blank">British Airtours Flight 28M</a>, where only one overwing exit was the nearest for 100 passengers. There wasn't enough space here, with the exit row being normal width. A runway fire during an aborted takeoff led to many (55) dying within the plane, while emergency services were just outside, because the access just wasn't easy enough.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP0hElNAe94" target="_blank">Mayday</a> about this accident; it changed the way emergency exits are managed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brain loves to go nostalgically through all the memories of episodes of Air Crash Investigation (as Mayday is called in the UK) it's seen as soon as the plane engines throttle up on the runway, as if on cue, and continue screaming about them as the plane climbs. It then continues to do so if there is any slight bump during flight or if one of the flight attendants looks overstressed.</p>
<p>A guy I was flying with mentioned that his girlfriend liked the show as we were coming in to land in Dublin once and I flew off the handle and grimaced &quot;DON'T TALK ABOUT PLANES CRASHING THANKS&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A study I read once said that your odds of surviving a plane crash go way down if you're seated more than seven rows from am emergency exit. Fires kill incredibly fast in planes (the material they're made of releases extremely toxic smoke), and crowd behavior generally leads to a panicked crush at the exits. If you're further than 7 rows away, you'll never get to the exit in time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exclusively.
It's also so that crew and pax eyes are adjusted to ambient light conditions, and so crew (particularly) can see what is going on outside the aircraft in the event of an emergency evacuation.
They need to know whether it is safe to open their exits, so they need to be able to see what conditions are like around their exit.</p></div>		</li>
