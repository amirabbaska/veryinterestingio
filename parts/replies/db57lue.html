			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question here: you say the risk of a leak is extremely remote, but there was news of a 175k gallon oil leak on the ND pipeline not 24 hrs ago. In September I recall news of a similarly sized oil leak in Alabama. Is it rare for a leak to happen at any given point, but not uncommon due to the sheer length of these pipelines? I've done no research into this, but from a layman's perspective, 2 in 3 months is not &quot;extremely remote&quot;. </p>

<p>Pipeline leaks happen far more often than every 2-3 months.  They happen daily.  But most are pretty small and in remote areas.   And there's shitloads of pipeline miles in this country so yeah, a leak in any one spot is very unlikely. </p>
<p>The other thing is that lots of the pipe in the ground currently is very old and wasn't built with modern construction standards (pre-1970 pipe particularly as there was no code).  There's been major advances in technology and the code since then and newer lines are far safer.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be interested in maintenance records. Unless something catastrophic happened, which couldn't be planned against, there should be signs before failure.</p>
<p>Still plenty of joints, and I'm sure the failure rate per unit delivered is lower than other methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely. I'm not big on energy, but one thing I'm certain of is that the US and Canada in particular are better off with producing their oil domestically. Even if there is a failure, the alternative would be a tanker leaking in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p>My inclination is that because of the sheer scale of operation of these pipelines, failure seems common. If that same scale of production were observed in a much more vulnerable environment, like the ocean, the consequences would make the choice easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, that comparing pipelines to any other method of moving shows that pipelines have a much lower rate of leaks and spills by comparison. So it comes down to the idea of minimizing risk. Not to mention the level of difference in safety concerns with older pipes versus new pipelines. Newer pipelines tend to have a much higher safety and integrity focus so it becomes a fools errand to protest newer pipes because older pipes are failing. Thats like protesting Ford from building new cars because the old model T has a safety concern that wasnt ever addressed.</p>
<p>For example, to bend pipes back in the day out in the field they would actually take a straight piece of pipe, tie a rope around each end, and use either a truck or horses to physically bend the pipe around the tree. Thats what we are talking about in terms of engineering back in the day. </p>
<p>In todays world, that wouldnt even be allowed on non-pressure containing water pipes. Let alone pressurized oil pipes. Todays pipes are built with substantially more concern for safety and integrity. Now the part thats a bit more troublesome comes when looking at the types of regulations that apply to each pipe. Because depending on the state and the nature of the pipe the type of regulations change dramatically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who work on pipelines like yourself often say the risk of a leak/spill is extremely remote but then others commenting here say that like 3,300 incidents have occurred since 2010 and today ~150 miles from the DAPL protest area there was a leak/spill of supposedly upwards of 160,000 gallons...So how remote is &quot;extremely remote&quot; and how much damage do those incidents typically cause?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a pipeline inspector (for the government not the operators).  </p>
<p>There's several things in play here. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lots of pipeline leaks occur on fairly old pipe. There's still lots of pre-1970s pipe in the ground that was built before federal code existed.   Leaks here are far more common for a variety of factors.  While no pipeline is completely risk free, recently built pipe is exponentially safer than old pipe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operators are required to identify high consequence areas (HCAs) along their right of ways.  These include populated areas, spots where oil could reach water, and environmentally sensitive areas.  There's more stringent requirements for assessing the pipe's integrity and repairing them quickly in HCAs than outside them.  Also they're required to take special actions and/or designs to prevent and mitigate releases in these areas.   Operators usually try to avoid these areas when routing the pipe whenever possible.   So the majority of leaks occur outside of HCAs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's a shitload of pipe in the ground.  It's actually astounding to look at the map of it all.  So you get a law of large numbers effect.  The odds of failure at any given point are low, but pipe failing somewhere is all but certain.  When compared with other methods of moving oil, pipelines are far less likely to fail.  </p>
</li>
<li>Also many leaks are very small and often contained on operator property.  Operators are also required to have emergency plans with periodic practice drills, and contract with oil cleanup companies in each area to ensure a quick cleanup.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very semantic, by what I'm reading. </p>
<p>Supporters say the possibility of a leak is remote in that the likelihood of a specific section of pipeline leaking is very rare. If you have a few feet of pipeline going through your property, it's true that the chance of your specific section leaking is very remote. Okay..</p>
<p>Well, the opposition is bringing up totals and specifics about leaks over an entire line. Whereas the likelihood of any one section leaking may be low, the likelihood of even a single leak across an entire pipeline is almost 100% given. They may be minor, they may be in an extremely remote location, but they  seem guaranteed to happen on all pipelines eventually based on the data. </p>
<p>Supporters seem to focus on the low chance of something bad happening in a general sense (and with millions of gallons of oil in the equation, the chance is a low percentage of the total), and the opposers focus on <em>any</em> leak in the line being a serious problem. There's a remote chance of any one specific spot on a line leaking, and there's a given that a leak will occur in a remote spot on a line at some/multiple point(s)  in the lifespan. Semantics semantics semantics. Both statements seem true to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of those leaks are very small relatively. It's sensationalism that keeps them in the media consistently. It's kind of like how in 2013/14, every shooting was in the news. We were seeing one a day some weeks. Now, we're not seeing nearly as many. Did shootings just stop?  No. But,  they aren't as profitable anymore. Another example might be CNN with that airplane that went missing in the Pacific. When it was popular, it was basically all they talked about for months. No longer popular,  but it's still missing and theories are still coming out about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>small to people who arent affected.  </p>
<p>you are talking about why they are in the news, and why people are talking about them.  when someone is against the pipeline in their back yard/neighborhood, they arent against it because of all the hubbub that is going to happen when there is a spill.  they are against it because of the spill that might happen.  small or large.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is from someone with a pipeline going through my property.</p>
<p>For a lot of people having a large part of their property taken from them can be a huge inconvenience, and can greatly reduce the value of their remaining property, and not at all worth the few thousand dollar check that you find in your mailbox. </p>
<p>Also, if you live in a quiet rural area having earth movers and dozens of workers in your back yard can be very disturbing, not to mention the muddy run off from digging the hole for the pipes </p></div>		</li>
