			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about the Amazon rainforest and the jungle in central Africa  Notice the tapering of the landmass of South America and Africa and the fact that there are more developing countries in those parts of the 2 continents. Add all that up and you have far fewer emissions and much more plant mass. </p>
<p>I'm not sure how to think about the oceans, where plankton is doing a ton of photosynthesis also. I assume seasonal difference is significant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's awfully striking, but look at the scales. The big change in summer to winter in the northern hemisphere looks to me to be a change from a high of 386 ppm to a low of 377 ppm, or a difference of 9 ppm (2.4%).  That's not insignificant, but the imagery looks like &quot;there's no CO2 here, wait, oh the HUMANITY&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not designed to make you panic about climate change it's an educational video about the distribution of CO2 and CO in the atmosphere during the year. If the difference is between 377ppm and 395ppm then that's what you base your scale on to make it clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree that the scale is very tight for CO2, but there could be something statistically significant about that range. There's also no reason to think that the ppm doesn't fall well below that when an area is devoid of any color for the scale.</p>
<p>The CO level scale is also much more open, and shows the significance of those fires the narrator mentions.</p>
<p>Good spot though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your impression, not the one given as stated by the scales.  Scales should clearly display the relevant range.</p>
<p>It's no different from a thermometer showing celcius - 0 is actually 273 kelvin (absolute temeperature) but that's not very useful to us humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Low land area. The ocean emits and absorbs carbon at a more constant rate than land that sometimes has plants growing and sometimes has them frozen.</p>
<p>The northern hemisphere has huge forests (Russia, Canada, the biggest countries in the world) that are frozen and not doing anything for half the year, and then for the other half of the year absorbs huge amounts of carbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That plus only 12% of the population lives south of the equator. Plus weather patterns tend to trap the gasses on the side of the equator where they’re generated, so the CO2 generated by the 88% of population in the north during winter can’t get across the equator to the south to spread out and/or be absorbed. Those factors together with what you said definitely do it. </p></div>		</li>
