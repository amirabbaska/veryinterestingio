<p>These work by shooting a beam of infrared light across a surface, typically using LEDs and/or lasers. A camera or set of cameras watches the surface for your finger interrupting the beam of light and interprets that as a touch. </p></div>		</li>

They're still used occasionally in industry because it's the only durable touchscreen technology that can be used with gloved hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, two things. Is that why the screen acts really funky when water is on it? Because the electricity is being messed with?</p>
<p>And two: I remember a few years ago my first touch screen phone had a calibration feature. Is there a reason why this feature is nowhere to be found nowadays?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your screen gets funky when water gets on it because water is conductive. This basically means that when you touch in the wet zone, the phone thinks you're touching everywhere the water is. And then it freaks out because omg so many touches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for positional accuracy though.</p>
<p>the electrodes for capacitive touch sensing are mechanically dense and accurately positioned across the screen. but since the signal being processed is very small, tricky filters have to be calibrated in order to detect finger movements and ideally nothing else.</p>
<p>resistive touch screens work with large distributed analog elements. these elements are not easily manufactured homogenous enough to work without calibration. for mechanical accuracy, you will have to take sample measurements at fixed points. this is exactly what a typical calibration sequence does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Capacitive touch screens have a ton of tiny wires running vertical horizontal along the screen forming a grid which identifies changes in capacitance between the small wires and your finger touches and registers the location as a button press. (interpreting this data is not trivial, as human thumbs are usually fat as fuck, and motor skills are not be precisely accurate)</p>
<p>I believe the sensing mechanism of resistive touchscreens are located at the sides of the screen and math is used to determine the location of the press. As any warping or shifting of the screen plastic will change it's readings, you need to calibrate resistive screens to account for these changes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are even a couple kinds of capacitive screens. The most common is projected capacitive (P-CAP. The capacitance between the electrode layers in the glass change when your finger interrupts the e-field there. There is also surface acoustic wave (saw) where your finger dampens sound waves traveling through the screen and sensors in the outside detect this dropped amplitude of the vibration and can pinpoint the x and y location of the finger. There's also infrared which is the same principal as SAW. Your finger blocks the infrared light beam. Those are simplified explanations but they all have their advantages and disadvantages. P-CAP is most common for phones and computers though </p></div>		</li>
