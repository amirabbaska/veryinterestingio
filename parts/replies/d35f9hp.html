			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely think that much larger creatures than we know now could theoretically exist! I just find it unlikely that they existed in any numbers - both due to lack of indirect evidence, and due to the practical difficulties in sustaining a large number of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've known they were around for ages, there have been sightings since antiquity and Sperm Whale stomachs are full of their beaks but the first photograph of one was in the 1990's and the first video of one was in the early 2000's. </p>
<p>Only about 5% of the ocean has been explored and a new species of animal is described just about every time we visit the bottom. It's not too crazy to think there are other huge animals in the ocean depths that we just do not know about. </p></div>		</li>
