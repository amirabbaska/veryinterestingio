			<div class="markdown"><p>If a cop sets up &quot;bait&quot; for any crime and they mess up even a minor detail then a lawyer can usually get the case thrown out under 'entrapment' rules. Entrapment is when police <em>coerce or trick</em> a non-criminal into committing a crime.</p>
<p>If a cop is driving down the highway behind you, that is legal. If they start ridding your bumper (driving really close to your car), that is unsafe but still legal. If you feel uncomfortable about how close they are to your car and you speed up (past the speed limit), then you have broken the law. If the cop then decides to arrest/ticket you for speeding, that is called entrapment and it is illegal because they coerced you into committing the crime.</p>
<p>If a drug buyer approaches an undercover cop that is 'selling drugs' and starts a conversation, the cop is not allowed to use any &quot;pushy sales tactics&quot; or offer free trials. Likewise, if an undercover cop gives a person money and requests that they go buy drugs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/nyregion/undercover-officers-ask-addicts-to-buy-drugs-snaring-them-but-not-dealers.html?_r=0" target="_blank">the case is likely to be thrown out unless they also arrest the supplier</a>.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that some very common police traps can fall under entrapment. If a cop parks their car so that it can't be seen from the highway, they are not allowed to use their speed-gun or ticket speeders - they have to remain 'clearly visible' from the roadway. Likewise, the cameras that photograph intersections are very frequently thrown out under 'entrapment' or 'privacy' rules if you appeal the ticket in court.</p>
<p>FBI, CIA, and 'sting operations' have a bit more wiggle-room on what is considered acceptable practice, though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, riding a bumper is legal over there? Here any less than 0.5 seconds difference is illegal by default (reckless â€‹driving law), and a minimum of 2 seconds is strongly recommended (although not enforced in heavy traffic).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's not legal, but it's very hard to prove without video evidence, and the losses from the fees or not going to work for a day (or more if it's too packed or something happens at court) can make even contesting it a losing proposition anyways.</p>
<p>That's the leeway they basically abuse for this; a majority of people will not or can not contest for whatever reason, so they get to just collect the funds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Traffic classes, defensive driving courses, etc. state &quot;rule of thumb&quot; distances that should be observed, but I am not aware of any law that specifically states you could get a ticket for driving too close to someone as you follow them. The laws do state that if you hit the car in front of you because they brake-check you, then it is the fault of the car in the back (for insurance purposes), but that falls under &quot;failure to control speed.&quot;</p>
<p>We do have laws on &quot;reckless driving,&quot; but they are only ever enforced if they cause an accident, and are more about blinkers and cutting someone off than following too close.</p>
<p>I'm not a professional on this matter, but I've never seen or heard of anyone being ticketed for tailgating or riding a bumper.</p></div>		</li>
