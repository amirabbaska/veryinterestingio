			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about CDs, but it could be related to how some signals are encoded this way.</p>
<p>Imagine a line, if it is up high, is 1, if it is low, it is 0.</p>
<p>If you have a bunch of 1s or 0s in a row, it can be hard to find where each 1 and 0 ends.</p>
<p>Could be related, not sure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It uses a different process that is reversible. Where on a normal CD you're burning in a permanent pit, a rewritable disc has a layer with a material that is changed by the writing laser to <em>appear</em> as a pit to a CD reader, but which will return to its original &quot;non-pit&quot; state when exposed to lower-intensity heat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Afaik the most reliable storage solution still is magnetic tapes/cartridges, quoted at 30 years.</p></div>		</li>
