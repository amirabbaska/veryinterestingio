			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a gutter cleaner attachment for my leaf blower that is just that: An extension tube with a bend in the end. As expected, it kicks back in the opposite direction of the airflow. You have to fight to keep it aimed in the gutter since it wants to pull away.</p>
<p>But as /u/nomadseifer said it's not a perfect comparison as it maintains the pressure in a different way than an umbrella would.</p>
<p>I wouldn't want to try cleaning my gutters by hitting an umbrella with the airflow, it wouldn't be very effective. But the umbrella makes a much better sail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To quickly explain what the tubing can do that the umbrella can't: it can maintain the blower pressure.  That is to say the tubing you describe is an extension of the blower system. So the pressure inside the blower well get exerted at the end of the tube whatever direction its facing. If you face it behind you, you will move forward.  The umbrella will not contain the pressure of the blower by its nature of being in the open air and at least a foot or so from the nozzle.  </p>
<p>Some of the energy in the air particles can be captured depending on the closeness and geometry of the umbrella, as the top commenter has stated.  But in order for it to act as a tube, it would have to artificially close and in a shape that would no longer make it an umbrella</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a conservation of momentum problem, not a force balance problem.  Think about the only thing leaving the system as a whole, the air that has been redirect from the umbrella.  What is happening in the system is immaterial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did just that with bit of 4 inch PVC and duct tape. Blower would skid on floor normally. It just sits stationary. It did want to rotate a bit but likey due to the intake and exhaust out of alignment. </p></div>		</li>
