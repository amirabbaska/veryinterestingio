			<div class="markdown"><p>Netflix themselves likely don't give a shit, and probably wouldn't block VPNs if they had a choice. They block VPNs because Netflix licenses the shows they carry on their service. The problem is some shows have exclusive license contracts to other services in certain countries. </p>
<p>If you live in Canada and bell has an exclusive license to carry the TV show you want to watch, you can bet it isn't going to be on Netflix. Bell is a TV service provider, and they also have their own streaming service. They don't want you using Netflix at all, so they certainly wont allow them to play shows that Bell holds the license to.</p>
<p>An exclusive license holder doesn't want you to be able to use a VPN to &quot;leave your country&quot; and watch shows they have a license for, so they exert legal pressure on Netflix and content creators to ensure that Netflix blocks VPNs. </p>
<p>That is also why some series have seasons show up on Netflix over a year after they originally air. If a TV network owns the license for a series, and they might not want to give Netflix the new seasons until they have had a chance to play it on their network exclusively. You will also likely never see HBO shows on Netflix, because HBO has their own streaming service, so they are unlikely to license their shows to another streaming service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's part of the deal that Netflix has with the studios that produce the content. The contracts that they sign for content are location-specific, and the studios require that Netflix block viewers from seeing content from outside their own region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's just plain stupid not to charge more money for location-specific content in other countries. </p>
<p>better than losing users who rather stream illegally because it's too hard to get it legally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because Netflix has to obtain the rights to stream every show that it offers. So if I'm in Mexico and I'm streaming a show only available in America, the production company could sue Netflix for violating terms. Popular demand and legal issues tend to determine which shows go to which country. The U.K. Have an amazing selection btw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically you're not seeing the content legally if you need to use a VPN to watch it because it's not licensed for your region. </p>
<p>You're really just paying a monthly fee to access content you're not licensed to anyways, which is the same thing you're doing when you pirate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the company is still getting paid, you aren't paying a third party to watch it. It's definitely not the same as pirating. </p>
<p>Pirating is like writing down a Sudoku puzzle in the corner store but leaving the original and not paying, using a Netflix VPN is more like being 20 in the states (even though in your country age is 18) and giving someone money to buy you booze. The store still gets paid, and isn't doing anything illicit, you're doing what you would be allowed to in another country, nothing is stolen. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I mean... fuck. Here I am, paying for SmartDNS service to use the BBC because <em>they won't let me pay them for it</em> and I don't want to pirate it. The mindlessness of these large organizations is staggering.</p></div>		</li>
