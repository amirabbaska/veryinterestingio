			<div class="markdown"><p>This is false. I've been taught that the immune system is generally more aggressive in adults than children (no surprise, as a child's immune system is less mature), with this being resposible for certain &quot;childhood&quot; diseases being potentially dangerous in adults. This made me a bit suspicious about your reply (as you seem to have a lot of confidence in your knowledge). Looked it up just to be sure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An overzealous response in adults is responsible for causing more extensive cell damage and a more severe manifestation (especially in the lung) in primary infection than that seen in children.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I couldn't make OPs answer fit either. Generally when diseases are more dangerous in healthy adults than in children its because the main pathological damage stems from the immune system's reaction to the intrusion. In some disease like the cold its actually primarily the body's own response to infection that is making you feel sick - not the virus itself. Whereas other infections have the pathogen itself creating the damage rather than the immune system's response to it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My question then is: WHY does the immune system react more aggressively in adults? Is it because it usually has seen all threats there are to see by that time and if something new pops up it must be really bad so it goes all out on defense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i agree that it's far more complicated than my original post (which i've edited to add more information), and i'll add that quote now. </p>
<p>my answer was definitely a bit misleading in that it was an anecdote i read a few years ago in a virology textbook which was meant to <em>supplement</em>, not fully explain. when i responded, there was already a post about the immune system's overzealousness, so i thought i'd cover a different aspect</p>
<p>the double-edged sword of ELI5 is that if you oversimplify, you lose important info, but if you don't simplify enough, you overshoot the target :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to call you out on this but being wrong is fine. Really hate when people try to cover up their mistakes though &quot;I was intentionally oversimplifying&quot; </p>
<p>I feel that you didn't  really understand the reason and offered a plausible explanation with in unnecessarily long prose which made it look reliable. Your edits also make you look like you dont really understand immunology past a couple of introductory college classes </p>
<p>It's easy to ELI5 what the paragraph from Murray says e.g. &quot;Adults fight disease more violently than children do. As a result there's a lot of friendly fire  causing lots of damage to local areas such as the lung&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor by any means, but I educated myself on the &quot;side effects&quot; of a flu shot. </p>
<p>Apparently, people under 65 have a higher incidence of feeling ill/run down after the shot, while older people have (virtually) no such effects. </p>
<p>The reason cited in the literature was that young adults have stronger immune responses than older adults. The system is so strong that it mounts a rather large response to a dead/weakened threat. </p>
<p>The flu shot is not recommended for children under 6 months because their immune systems are not optimized and the vaccine could harm them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OTOH sometimes a disease can be more dangerous in healthy adults compared to kids or the elderly because it provokes the immune system into overreacting. High grade fever, prolonged inflammation in vasculature, etc. </p></div>		</li>
