			<div class="markdown"><p>Aliasing is an effect that happens when you sample too slowly and the frequency is &quot;aliased&quot; to a lower one. A common example is when you see wheels turning on TV. TV runs at 60 FPS and if the wheel is turning at, say, 70 rotations per second, it will actually look like it's turning backwards because each frame the wheel has gone almost all the way around. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon-wheel_effect" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>
<p>In computer graphics it is similar, the transition from black to white is a high frequency transition. If you sample that on a pixel grid it won't really represent the original picture. </p>
<p>Anti-aliasing means filtering out those high-frequency components. For computer graphics, that usually means rendering at a higher resolution and then applying a blur filter of some sort. Blur filters remove high-frequency components, so when you downsample you have gotten rid of high frequency parts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to elaborate on this a bit, the term comes from the weird visual artifacts of sampling tightly repeating patterns from far away - like </p>

<p>but the term aliasing is maybe a little more generalized in graphics to include any pixelated jagged edges</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why I don't like using the term in pixel art. If you placed every pixel on purpose and there there's hard jagged edges it doesn't mean that it's aliased. </p>
<p>A lot of people understand this but still called it 'aliased' anyway, but I think doing so may confuse people as to what the term actually means. I guess the only other option is 'jaggies'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a look through the other responses no one really seemed to explain the origin of the word, so:</p>
<p>When a person has an &quot;alias&quot; it's sort of like a fake identity. Same thing here with aliased and anti-aliased.</p>
<p>Do due to low of a sample rate the real signal developes an Alias, which perfectly fits the the data recorded but is not the original signal. Anti-aliasing takes the fake signal and trust to return to the original signal, ie remove the alias.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly the use of anti-aliasing may go away as monitors increase in resolution. On a 4k monitor the pixel squares are so small that they aren't visible to the human eye, so the computer doesn't need to blend them together to hide the edges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True but still, my 4k tv that's 50 inch requires no anti aliasing. Plus at that resolution AA becomes quite the resource hog to keep pushing a stable framerates. It almost starts to become counter productive by these resolutions. I can imagine 8k ending the need for any anti aliasing like seriously, those things are almost difficult to comprehend. Gotta love high rez!</p></div>		</li>

<p>More specifically, it depends on how much of your field of view the screen takes. You're going to notice the aliasing a lot more on a 5 inch 4k screen that's 2 inches from your eyes (perhaps in a virtual reality headset) then you would on a 50 inch 4k screen 10 feet away, because each pixel covers more of space on the back of your eye.</p></div>		</li>
