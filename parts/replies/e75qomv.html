			<div class="markdown"><p>So potentially habitable planets or planets with potential for life.  I do not mean to be picky but is 'nice' a term used for such planets or was this just your choice of wording? </p>
<p>One more question if you don't mind, is the planet size important when looking for potentially habitable planets?  Or is the size just one of the factors when compared with star size and distance from star, velocity and or arc of orbit path and rotation, etc..... or does the planet size have an integral effect on whether or not liquid water is possible?</p>
<p>Not a problem if your not able (by which I mean this not being your field) or willing to answer.  I just wanted to throw some questions at someone who appears to know much more than I do and is able to give clear understandable answers.</p></div>		</li>
