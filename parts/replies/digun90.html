			<div class="markdown"><p>Very logical and pertinent point I'd never thought of!
(Always assumed it was purely a psychological (fear) issue).</p>
<p>... though I might phrase it as &quot;less visual stimulation&quot; instead of &quot;more&quot;.
With no visual references immediately around and under the beam, your sense of balance itself would indeed be directly affected, just like you can't stand on one leg (or walk) very long with your eyes closed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be less as you say but I put 'more' because I assumed the brain was processing a larger panorama versus being close to the ground. It may be that our brain dismisses all of the out-of-focus background leaving us with no visual ques.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recently I've developed some back problems that cause me to lose feeling in my legs. One of the biggest problems I have now is drying off after a shower when I go to dry my hair and the towel covers my face it becomes incredibly difficult to balance. I think that because I can't visually reference the walls and floor around me and i cant really feel the ground all the way it fucks with my equilibrium. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I doubt it. Otherwise, it'd be hard for a basketball player to play because of the ambient crowd, which just doesn't make sense. Visual stimulation itself is a very rough and undefined term because of how easy it is to tune out irrelevant parts.<br />
Also, the closing your eyes example really only works because of fear as well. You don't know where you're going and I doubt most readers are in flat open expanses in which to walk around. You'd find that walking with a blindfold is pretty easy if you don't have to worry about walls and objects on the floor. It really does only boil down to nerves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree that closing the eyes prompts a fear based response and hold to my hypothesis that closing your eyes removed visual ques to the brain leading to a loss of 3D spatial awareness  (thus leading to a loss of balance). When I meditate with my eyes closed (even stadium tree meditation) I'm not afraid of falling - rather I lose the suble spatial awareness that informs my brain &quot;I'm leaning slightly back so let's engage those quads and pull my self forward then level off&quot;. Blind people learn to balance without sight but it takes persistent practice.</p></div>		</li>
