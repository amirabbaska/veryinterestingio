			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite evolution stories is the relationship between birds and hot peppers. I'll write this out for 0 upvotes so I can tell it better in person next time.</p>
<p>Hot peppers are hot to keep mammals from eating them, bunnies, rats, humans, etc. They don't want mammals eating them, because we crush the seeds and/or digest them. Peppers are not spicy to birds, they hottest pepper in the world and a bell pepper are the same thing to a crow. So, a bird eats the pepper, has to no teeth to grind the seeds up. Bird flies around and poops the seeds out, the seeds even have built in fertilizer. They have formed a symbiotic relationship. Now, we humans like spicy peppers and have altered their evolution to make them hotter, that's just what we like to do these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, what I've read is not that birds don't crush the seeds (gizzards can grind material up too), it's that for evolutionary pressure, birds will travel <em>much</em> farther, so when they poop, the seeds are likely to be much more dispersed vs if a mammal ate the seeds.</p>
<p>But you're right in that birds are immune to the effects of capsaicin. Us humans (and my Jack Russel) are a bit weird in that we not only tolerate it, we will seek it out for the huge endorphin rush that capsaicin pain provides.</p>
<p>I've been eating Blair's Ultra Death sauce mixed with habanero salsa before, and even though I was sober, it felt like I took a hit of something <em>quite</em> illegal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you clarify a bit/educate me - are birds simply lacking the taste receptors, or are they completely immune to the effects of capsaicin? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to do a little research. Looks like birds just can't taste it, or be feel the pain caused by capsaicin. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Capsaicin binds to a pain receptor called TRPV1. This receptor functions differently in avians than it does in mammals; in avian species TRPV1 does not respond to capsaicin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite evolution stories is the relationship between people and peppers.   I read a paper a few years ago (I really wish I could find it) that said that the most likely reason that humans love spicy peppers, and receive a rush of endorphins from them, is that peppers have a preposterously high amount of vitamin c, almost 250 mg per 100 g of fruit, which is four to five times that of oranges!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought that people just like danger, like eating something that tastes like it's going to burn right through you. The rush of eating something almost too spicy, but that you can still manage... like jumping off a plane, almost to your death, but with a parachute on your back that you can open at the last moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do people keep saying that? The origins of Lemons are unknown, the genetic make up is that of a citron and bitter orange, that could have happened naturally, if it happened naturally then it doesn't change the question whatsoever. Seems to me a bunch of people wanted a chance to look smart but they weren't.</p></div>		</li>
