			<div class="markdown"><p>THAT.  That is the thought process I had when people tried explaining that we just had to go to Mars.  I kept asking &quot;<em>Why</em>, if you can make a planet inhabitable, would you not just use the one you're standing on?&quot;</p>
<p>But after this thread, I think it's more than that.  The Earth may be suitable to feel comfortable again, but that wouldn't stop the sun from encroaching or dying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we need to go to Mars for exploratory reasons, not survival. Mars is the best candidate for a second home. Colonizing Mars would be a massive step forward to making us a spacefaring species rather than just a planetary one. Ultimately going to Mars has nothing to do with survival, and it's something we can't even worry about doing until we stabilize our own ecosystem here on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see your point completely, but also I think it has a lot to do with survivability.</p>
<p>We're never going to spread to habitable bodies in the Galaxy without first learning to establish a colony on a planet within spitting distance.</p>
<p>To me, Mars is like training wheels on a bike. Once we're comfortable with our ability to create a self sufficient society on another world, sending those cryogenically frozen people out to a new Star system won't seem so impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's accurate to say NOTHING. I mean, Elon Musk's view is the more planets we inhabit, the safer we are. He isn't wrong. Sure, we can, should, and will make earth inhabitable for as long as we can, but there is a possibility, however small, of an event impacting earth and not mars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, &quot;Ultimately,&quot; it is about survival. Humanity on 2+ planets makes a complete extinction event a lot less probable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in the case of a cataclysmic event to earth (large asteroid, etc.) that we couldn't deter, then I could see mars being a viable option. However, if something is going to happen to the sun then either option is useless, so what we really should be concerned with in the long run is interstellar travel in tandem with terraforming. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the real reason for why we need to colonize other planets. If we're interested in living—as a species—a cosmically-long time, we need to spread beyond the refuge of one planet. All of the wonders of our pale blue dot are currently held perilously in one basket. We certainly need to learn how to take care of our world, and ourselves better than we do right now. However, if something devastating and terrible happened to Earth today—an asteroid/cometary impact, gamma ray burst, super-volcanism, etcetera: humanity and all of the beautiful things that our world has borne out would be instantly and irrevocably cast into oblivion. Given the seemingly inevitable heat death of the universe, some people may not see that as a bad thing, but I am of more a mind to contend in vain anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even after a cataclysm, an extinction event asteroid collides into the earth...or if every nuclear weapon was used..if a supervolcano erupts and plunges earth into a decades long nuclear winter..Mars is still a less habitable place than Earth.
Mars is uninhabitable. Almost zero surface water. Colder than Antarctic winter. Thin atmosphere that is toxic, 95% carbon dioxide. Exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. Almost no natural resources we can use. Even in the worst scenario, Earth is more habitable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars has a much lower gravity than Earth's, it is 10 TIMES cheaper in terms of rocket per payload to launch a rocket from Mars than Earth, which means you have an entire solar systems worth of natural resources you can harvest at much lower cost.</p>
<p>Earth's high gravity and thick atmosphere makes it a really bad home for a space faring technological civilization. Future civilizations will likely see living on Earth as a fancy luxury, but prefer living on large moons,
Mars or in large rotating habitats. It just makes more sense to go in that direction.</p>
<p>If you're constantly launching spaceships it ends up being cheaper to house your whole civilization in domes, because the resources to build those domes are not much greater than those of cities, yet you have hundreds or millions of times more resources that are 10x cheaper to harvest because you can launch rockets cheaply.</p>
<p>In terms of current rocket cost it is cheaper to send something from Mars to Earth, than it is to send it from China to the US via FedEx Air. Think about that for a second.</p>
<p>So from an economics perspective Mars simply offers greater profit than Earth. While it may be less comfortable to live there that's a silly reason to consider colonizing a place, most people don't live on their own Caribbean island with perfect weather. We live our lives based on what is most economically viable.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this, if everything you ever wanted was 3 times cheaper on Mars, would you move into a nice futuristic domed city with a park and skyscrapers there?</p>
<p>So yeah that's why we need to colonize Mars. It's not because we need another pretty place to walk around in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's just unimaginative. </p>
<p>What if we have the technology to terraform but it would kill everyone whilst happening?</p>
<p>What if it took a thousands/million years? It would be smart to terraform Mars even if the Earth is still fine, just in case.</p>
<p>What in case of doomsday scenarios? </p>
<p>There's plenty of reasons to terraform Mars instead of Earth. </p></div>		</li>
