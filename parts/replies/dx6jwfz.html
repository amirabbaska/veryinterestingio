			<div class="markdown"><p>This can change, as well. Anna Nicole Smith declared bankruptcy after her multi-millionaire husband died because a court ruled his new will leaving his fortune to her was invalid. The judge in the bankruptcy case ruled that she was not bankrupt because the will gave her millions of dollars, which reopened the probate case.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, the bankruptcy judge said the probate judge got it wrong and reopened the probate case. There was a big fight over whether the bankruptcy judge had the power to do that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, the will had already been probated and she was told she was getting nothing. Then the bankruptcy judge said &quot;Fuck a whole bunch of that, she is owed millions of dollars.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
