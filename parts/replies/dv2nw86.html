			<div class="markdown"><p>Brain death turns out to be more difficult to prove than we thought, but a lack of activity in the cerebellum is not recoverable. Neurons have a minimum, base level of activity even when they're not being stimulated, so zero activity strongly suggests that they are dead. If activity was <em>missed</em> because it was very faint it might still be possible for the person to partially recover, although actually waking up is deeply unlikely. A full recovery to their previous life only happens in fiction. </p></div>		</li>
