<p>I keep seeing mentioned the concept of reflecting radar signals &quot;from expected directions&quot;. Does this mean there are angles from which a stealth aircraft is much less stealthy? I know there is/was an issue with aircraft carrying internal armaments having their RCS bloom when the bay doors open, but what about in a cruising configuration? If an F-22 were to fly upside down, will it resolve to a much larger signal? Is downward facing radar still troublesome due to background scattering? How crazy is the concept of satellite based radar detection?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, there are angles for which a stealth plane is actually less stealthy. Radar cross section is not a single number, it's a function around the aircraft, which typically features large spikes originating from certain airframe structures such as vertical tail, nacelles, nozzles, etc. RCS for modern stealth planes is, obviously, classified information, but <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Sigma_invader_RCS.png/300px-Sigma_invader_RCS.png" target="_blank">this</a> is what one would look like for a non-stealthy plane. </p>
<p>I can't say for sure, but I would guess that, yes, in general a stealthy plane would be less stealthy flying upside down than right side up. Designers would expect the plane to by flying right side up and so they can &quot;hide&quot; certain problematic structures such as inlet cavities on the upper surface of the plane. The B-2 bomber is an example of this - its inlets are top mounted so they are more seldom &quot;seen&quot; by enemy radar. Additionally, certain structures, such as the cockpit cavity, which need to be on the top, can be big emitters too - radar waves bounce around the instruments inside and back to the enemy radar receivers. Sometimes cockpit canopies are sprayed with a thin coat of conductive metal, such as gold, to reflect the radar waves at a more predictable angle. There is, however, a big difference in the way you would expect to fly a B-2 vs. an F-22 - you probably won't ever fly a B-2 upside down, but you would definitely expect the F-22 to do some active maneuvering. So with that in mind, I would suspect that the F-22 is still quite stealthy on the top side. Not that the B-2 is any slouch either. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have no idea how much a reality satellite-based radar is -- I'm more focused on the planes and information like that isn't very available. However, while I think it's <em>maybe</em> possible, the benefits might not outweigh the cons. The thing about radar is that it is (relatively) <em>much</em> cheaper to make radar to spot planes than it is to make planes that can't be spotted. Radar needs two things - 1) Something sending out radar waves, and 2) something receiving radar waves. You can make the thing sending out the waves also receive them, but you can also build a bunch of <em>passive</em> receivers as well. These are cheap but very difficult to see if you're trying to avoid them because they don't give any indication that they exist. They just receive signals. They also have the added benefit that they will pick up signals that weren't reflected back to the original receiver (which is the whole theory that we used to design the stealthy airframe to begin with). </p>
<p>Additionally, there are better uses for intelligence-gathering satellites than radar. Satellites these days have very good optical properties in the infrared and visual spectra (and probably others, I don't know). One thing that is very hard to hide on a plane is it's infrared heat signature in the exhaust. Heat is a natural byproduct of an engine so you can set your satellite to scan for heat signatures in the infrared spectrum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, those planes do have a wire mesh, which reduces the RCS, but that incurs a performance loss from the engine so it isn't always used.</p></div>		</li>
