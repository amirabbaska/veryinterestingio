			<div class="markdown"><p>I expect this would be the real reason. As a soccer player, using the less dominant leg for passing, shooting, etc is very, very difficult early on. With consistent practice, the two legs become almost evenly matched in capability. I believe this level of motor function is learned rather than biological.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is speculation but it’s possible that when babies learn to do things they watch their parents and mimic them. Since most people are right handed most babies would mimic right handedness. You’d have to examine a culture that had never had a history of the left hand being inferior to check that though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that just circular logic? 'Most people are right handed because they learn it from their parents, who are mostly right handed'. Doesn't explain how the trend of right handedness came to be.</p>
<p>I would imagine the trend of treating left handedness as being weird/inferior stemmed from the fact that most people were right handed, not the other way around. Just a guess on my part though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What dictates what your dominate hand is ? I write and eat left handed, do everything else right handed (bat, throw, kick, ect.) and at work I use my computer mouse with my left hand, and home I use my computer mouse with my right hand. immediate family is all right handed except my dad who does everything right handed except batting, and golfing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can tell you as a parent I try to get my daughter to use her right hand whenever possible. </p>
<p>She's still young, just barely over a year, but when she picks up a spoon or fork she generally does it with her left hand, so that she can use her right to pull the food off the utensil and put it in her mouth.</p>
<p>I switch the utensil from her left hand to her right and help encourage her to put the food in her mouth, rather than using the other hand to pull it off.</p>
<p>I wonder if other parents are like me and actively facilitate situations where their child is using their right hand more dominantly, if for no other reason than this world seems preferential to right handed people and if I can make things even slightly easier for her I will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a lot of countries throughout history writing was impossible left handed due to liquid ink and biomechanics, or other handedness based taboos or systems like right hand for eating and left hand for wiping your bum, or you couldn't serve in a spear and shield formation, can't use scissors etc. Doing the opposite would make life very hard or keep you from employment. edit: Also just general superstition about 'otherness' in a pre scientific era</p></div>		</li>
