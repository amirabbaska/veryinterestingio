			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the main concern when reusing a bottle is bacteria. As long as you wash it with soap and water, or maybe some bleach and then flush it really well with potable water. It's perfectly fine to do this, despite what many people misconceive. Bottles are made of food grade plastic, and any leaching will take years to get into any sort of levels that could possibly cause any kind of harm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The longer the water stays in the plastic the worse you are. In theory if you're refilling it every day, bacteria/structural breakdown of the bottle is the limit. The water is in there for so little time it's practically irrelevant. </p></div>		</li>
