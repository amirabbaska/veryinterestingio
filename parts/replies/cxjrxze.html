			<p>Pretty nice visualization of the derivative of n^2 too. You need 2n to get to each next step. </p>		</li>

			<p>Going from from n^2 to (n+1)^2 requires 2n+1, not 2n. Am I misunderstanding you?</p>		</li>

			<p>That's true, the +1 comes from the discretization. So, it's not a perfect example. But we can see that, as n gets large, the +1 becomes smaller and smaller relative to the size of 2n. Conversely, if we were to add a really thin sliver of thickness dn much smaller than the size of the square, then it would be exactly 2n in the limit as dn gets small.</p>		</li>

			<p>[(n+ε)²-n²]/ε = [(n²+2nε+ε²)-n²]/ε =  (2nε+ε²)/ε = 2n+ε.<br><br>As ε→0, 2n+ε→2n.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thank you! None of my math teachers ever used a method of visualizing the concept that used a bloody square. Why on earth wouldn't they?</p>		</li>

			<p>I really like this one.  Visually proving it works for all numbers.  You get my <a href="https://cdn-shop.threadless.com/products/5979/636x460design_01.jpg" target="_blank">seal of approval</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>For the record he only proved it up to 8. :P<br><br>Sidenote/entertaining distraction: Always be suspicious of proofs by picture: <a href="http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/570/impressive-examples-where-a-proof-by-picture-goes-wrong" target="_blank">http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/570/impressive-examples-where-a-proof-by-picture-goes-wrong</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Correct, he did only prove to up to 8.  However, using the same technique repetitively will result in the rest.  If you add an &quot;8 bar&quot; on top and a &quot;9 bar&quot; on the right, you have now proven it up to 9.  I'm fairly certain this is a visual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction" target="_blank">proof by induction</a>.<br><br>But your examples are interesting, especially the pi=4.</p>		</li>
