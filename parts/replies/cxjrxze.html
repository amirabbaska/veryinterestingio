			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, the +1 comes from the discretization. So, it's not a perfect example. But we can see that, as n gets large, the +1 becomes smaller and smaller relative to the size of 2n. Conversely, if we were to add a really thin sliver of thickness dn much smaller than the size of the square, then it would be exactly 2n in the limit as dn gets small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, he did only prove to up to 8.  However, using the same technique repetitively will result in the rest.  If you add an &quot;8 bar&quot; on top and a &quot;9 bar&quot; on the right, you have now proven it up to 9.  I'm fairly certain this is a visual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction" target="_blank">proof by induction</a>.</p>
<p>But your examples are interesting, especially the pi=4.</p></div>		</li>
