			<div class="markdown"><p>You can build ditches which are even lower to drain these land. The water runs into these ditches to be pumped into the sea. Without pumps it wouldn't work of course. This is the reason why there are so many windmills in the Netherlands, many of them were used to drain the ditches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The crucial thing about a polder is that the sea is kept out by dikes and pumping. So water flows through the soil, into streams within the polder, and then that water (plus any seawater which infiltrates through the ground) is pumped out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are. But salt is not being constantly replenished. Nutrients are from the rivers and other biological activity like bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plant Nutrients usually &quot;stick&quot; to the minerals that constitute the soil. NaCl does not and is also very soluble in water.
Admittedly, so does nitrate (which is also a salt), the most important plant nutrient, but unless humans apply very large amounts of fertilizer or manure, the plants usually take any nitrate before it gets washed out. In most cases nitrate is the limiting factor for plant growth so there's little around. Other nitrogen compounds don't wash out and have to be transformed into nitrate for plants to take it up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there's an aquifer below the land? I only ask because if salts do go lower, wouldn't that &quot;poison&quot; their water source? </p>
<p>This assuming their water comes from an aquifer of course.</p></div>		</li>
