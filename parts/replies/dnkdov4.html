			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, neither or both can, so that's not the right framing, to start with. But it goes beyond that.</p>
<p>When lanzaio said that 'nobody has moved progress a centimeter beyond &quot;it's random&quot;', that's not… quite… true. At all.</p>
<p>The laws of Quantum Mechanics themselves result in a time-propagation operator (basically, how things change and develop over time) that is <em>totally</em> nonrandom. If you take a state and have it go forward in time, there's nothing random about that at all. Randomness kicks in when you stop having the time propagator act, and instead give up on the quantum mechanical treatment and demand a single answer. This is termed 'observation' because it is impractical to give observers (including instruments, among other things) a full quantum mechanical treatment (and partial quantum mechanical treatments of them are of very, very limited use), so anyone trying to model actual experiments has to break down and do that eventually. Whenever you observe/measure a system, or whenever things get too complicated for you to keep track of in a variety of other ways, then you use the Born Rule to get the expected distribution of results from the state that your quantum calculation ended up in. This rule invokes randomness.</p>
<p>Now, it may seem that this is a prime place for hidden variables to come in, but for one fact: quantum mechanics doesn't stop applying when it gets too complicated for you to track. What's going on is that different parts of the state correspond to different outcomes that you could observe. When you measure something, part of YOUR state ends up in one of those outcomes, and another part ends up in another of those outcomes. These outcomes don't interact with each other anymore, so they are basically independent people from that point on.</p>
<p>How can that be random? Well, you are you, right? Why aren't you me? Why aren't you Genghis Khan, or Harriet Tubman? We all exist (or existed), but each of our individual viewpoints is attached to only one of these people. Even if the world were completely uncontroversially clockwork, that would still feel random.</p>
<p>And so it is with these new independent people. We only get to experience one because each of their experiences only corresponds to being one of them. And even though the quantum world is completely clockwork, it will still subjectively feel random as our viewpoint corresponds to only one of the outcomes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's worth pointing out that what you're describing here is one interpretation of many (specifically it's the Many Worlds Interpretation). There are plenty of other interpretations that make the same practical predictions but do not describe the world the way you're doing. The truth is that there's still too much we don't understand about quantum mechanics to say anything other than, &quot;it appears that the results of our experiments are probabilistic, and it is not because of local hidden variables.&quot; </p>
<p>Many Worlds is a deterministic interpretation (one that still feels very random to someone living in reality), but there are others that rely on non-local hidden variables, and others that fully embrace randomness. Anyone who claims that one of these is correct and the others is wrong is deluded, although many physicists do have preferences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one knows.  The current theory just has a big blank spot here that says &quot;just because&quot;. There are good philosophical reasons not to accept that.  Good science should never accept &quot;just because&quot;, as that shuts down further inquiry, and good science is all about further inquiry. However, many have tried coming up with theories that fill in the gap, but they end up being either shown to be false under testing, or are both not testable (or at least not currently testable) and violate some principles that underlay much of the established theory, e.g. locality, or are just ridiculously contrived. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not large enough that it's observable by man. Even the experiments ran at the LHC use energy levels that are multiple orders of magnitude too low to observe anything predicted thus far by quantum gravity theories.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't really say that &quot;this is definitively the rule how physics works.&quot; We say that &quot;this is definitively the rule describing what we observe.&quot; Quantum mechanics perfectly describes what we observe. Nobody considers it complete.</p>

<p>There's also a larger issue at work, and that is this: for some types of observations, given the limits of our ability to observe, there's no practical difference between probability and <em>uncertainty</em>.</p>
<p>In some cases, this is a matter of philosophy. In other cases, it's a matter of real pragmatics. Given two different observers, with two different bits of information, probability and uncertainty can look far different. But if neither observer is able to, as a matter of practical reality, get a hold of the right information, probability and uncertainty are the same.</p>
<p>Consider a simple coin toss. I shield the coin, and look at it, observing that it's a tail. I ask you what the chances are that it's a head? You reply 50:50. This is both accurate and inaccurate at the same time; but from my point of view, it's obviously wrong. The chances it's a head are 0.</p>
<p>Now, given that same flip, if neither observer can possibly observe the coin, what difference does it make? It <em>might</em> make a difference, if we knew how to observe the coin, yes. But that's neither here nor there if neither one of us know how.</p></div>		</li>
