<p>People tend to confuse the two, a computer can't. The only way to make a program work, is to build it purely out of logic. It can't assume anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always tell my students on the first day, &quot;everything is your fault, and that's actually a good thing&quot;.  </p>
<p>Teaching biologists to code is interesting, as a lot of the approach is direct opposite.  Identifying why your pcr didn't go is not always a clear path bc biology is stochastic; but knowing you are at fault, always, in coding makes everything solvable :).  </p>
<p>Also, trial and error in real time is not a good plan in biology projects (expensive, long turn around) and planning in detail to the end and doing a coding project in one run is also a bad idea.  </p>
<p>It's an interesting set of fields to throw together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You already hinted at it with your spark plug analogy, but I think it's worth pointing out that this is commonly seen as the engineering problem solving. So it applies to all forms of engineering, not just software.</p>
<p>Taking a complex problem and breaking it into smaller parts is the essence of this. Adding personal anecdote of my own, I found out once I finished my engineering degree (and sometimes during) I would look at the world differently in terms of seeing things that don't quite work and trying to think of an improvement, all with this deconstructionist method.</p></div>		</li>
