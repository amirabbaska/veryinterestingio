			<div class="markdown"><p>in southern california, when we have rains we run into a similar problem. Most of our mostly dry rivers and washes turn into destructive flood channels when it gets wet for the same reason. Many have a elevation differential of 900-1000 feet (some start at elevations of 8000 feet) so when they get water, they just smash through everything. Some of the washes around me start at 4000 feet after water streams down the mountains from elevations of 6,000-7,000 feet. Which is why we have so many percolation basins and spillways with concrete lined washes replacing the natural ones. We have to slow the flow down considerably.</p></div>		</li>
