			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some teams at MIT IIRC that made high power high freq base stations to the point of putting client devices &quot;passive&quot;. From the few I got, base emits, and devices mostly distort/reflects that wave so barely uses power.</p>
<p>Also, wouldn't a high power base - low power client be useful for consumption mostly usages ? If the client can reach the base even at low bandwidth, enough to send a tiny request, the base can then transmit a hugh payload easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Imqgine going to a concert and trying to have a conversation with the lead singer from the 20th row.</p>
<p>Everybody can hear him just fine because of the giant sound system, but even if everybody else was quiet for a moment, you simply wouldnt have the raw power for him to hear you clearly.</p>
<p>Wifi is designed to work up to 300 feet under ideal conditions, so it might be more apt to imagine you are yelling at the stage from the 350th row. </p>
<p>Depending on what kind of wifi access point you have, you may be able to replace it's antennae with bigger, more sensitive types. This may improve matters in less ideal conditions, but there are limits to what you can do. Ultimately the limiting factors will the antenna in you phone or laptop and its output power.</p>
<p>Cellular however uses low frequencies which can travel which can travel farther. Cellular by design has more power. Cellular base stations are located carefully so as not to have competition on their licensed frequencies. Whereas anybody who has lived in an apartment  building can show you the mess that is unlicensed wifi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's two ways to jack up power. Add energy or focus the existing energy. </p>
<p>If you increase range just by adding power, then, yes, you need to do it on both ends. </p>
<p>If you increase range by using directional antennas, then you increase range of send and receive by just changing one end. (This is what cel towers do.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is the important distinction that I'd imagine OP is interested in. Another option is to add high quality low noise amplifiers(LNA) to the receive signal to complement higher output amps. </p>
<p>Of course better antennae and a pair of amplifiers can be used together which is often done so the design approaches diminishing returns more slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you mean omni-directional antennae, not isotropic.</p>
<p>Isotropic antennae are theoritical only. According to the theory they have no physical properties such as length, width, or height. Thus they cannot exist in physical space.</p>
<p>It would be nice if they did as they would radiate signal equally in all directions. A perfect spherical pattern.</p>
<p>Omni-directional antennae radiate in a circular pattern rather than spherical. The pattern ends up looking a donut from the top view assuming vertical polarization.</p>
<p>Isotropic is still a very important concept to understand as it is is used as a mathematical reference in antenna theory and design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omnidirectional is what I meant.  Good catch since this seems to have blown up.</p>
<p>Ended up with isotropic because I cut a part about the EIRP limit but didn't switch the description back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>You very quickly end up in a situation where you can detect something but not actually send any real information; the received signal is just too weak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To clarify/correct: A signal being &quot;weak&quot; isn't really the issue - you can always amplify a weak signal. In fact I'd argue there's isn't objectively a &quot;weak&quot; signal, if you have that signal in isolation.</p>
<p>The problem with &quot;weak&quot; signals is that they're SUBJECTIVELY weak. That is, the signal is too quiet to be differentiated from environmental noise. It's like trying to talk to a friend in a quiet room versus talking in a crowded event. The important thing is not how loud you're talking, but how loud it is <em>compared to the rest of the noise the crowd is making</em>. A perfectly understandable speech volume in a living room may not even be heard as speech at a concert.</p>
<p>OP asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What keeps wi-fi waves from traveling more than a few hundred feet or so, what stops them from going forever?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is: in terms of distance, nothing, the waves actually do travel forever (until they hit something, anyway). It's just that at some point they're spread so thin that you can't possibly tell them apart from the all the other background noise.</p>
<p>This also leads to another interesting topic: you can make a signal understandable by more things than just making it stronger. For example, a slower-changing signal can be easier to pick out of the noise, or changing at predictable intervals (e.g. a drone than changes pitch at regular intervals could be picked out of a noisy environment where speech, which is many rapid pitch changes, at the same volume could not). This is part of why weaker wifi signals can be slower - they'll drop to lower speed modes to be more resistant to interference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda related yeah. High frequency signal allows for encoding more data into the same timeframe of the signal (i.e. faster data bitrates). It's more limited in range for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster chatter is harder to discern from noise (as per above)</li>
<li>5 GHz waves are worse at penetrating walls than 2.4 GHz</li>
</ul>
<p>Mind you, that's also a selling point: if everyone's wifi is confined to their own house, there's less interference from everyone else's wifi. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't faster. They all move at relatively the same speed. Their cycles per second are faster or slower depending on frequency. The rate of propagation through the air is for all intents and Purposes identical. Sorry to be pedantic there is a ton of well intentioned but misleading information in this thread. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because attenuation is proportional to 1/(frequency^2). Also, 5 GHz doesn't penetrate walls as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The attenuation usually still asymptotically approaches zero. It's basically Zeno's Achilles and the Tortoise Paradox of signal strength. If every metre of air you go through absorbs half the signal, it'll never actually reach zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They won't actually travel forever, just until they are absorbed by something, right?<br />
Also, aren't electromagnetic waves quantised? So they couldn't spread infinitely thin even withouth obstacles? What would happen then though?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've clarified your first question above. Yes they can be absorbed.</p>
<p>Your second question delves into quantum mechanics. Not my strength. I might be wrong here but: yes each photon's energy is quantised but dealing with large numbers of photons over time (i.e. treating it like a wave) the amplitude asymptotically approaches zero at increasing distance from the origin of the signal. The wave signal weakening as the energy spreads is the photons being scattered away from each other. The individual photons don't lose energy, that would equate to a drop in frequency, not amplitude.</p></div>		</li>
