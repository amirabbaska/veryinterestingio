			<div class="markdown"><p>So this, combined with other answers, leads me to believe the following:</p>
<p>The body gains fat the easiest around the waist because it is the optimal place for fat to be stored without causing restrictions to body movement. Fat is lost in the reverse order it is put on so the body will reduce fat in other areas before the waist area because it's the first to go on.</p>
<p>Is that correct or is that just me throwing around words hoping I'm right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember too your body WANTS a reserve of fat, which is typically in your stomach as it's the easiest to distribute where necessary and provides needed heat to your core which is far more important. This is why Abs on men don't come around until a certain body fat % (I think it's 12%?) because otherwise it stores the fat where its easiest to get at. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fat isn’t stored in the same places on everyone.</p>
<p>Some people get more belly fat, some get it in breast tissue, some carry it more evenly in their torso, some carry it on their hips, some on their thighs.</p>
<p>You can’t control where fat will accumulate on you.  You cannot “target” certains areas.</p>
<p>Fat will burn evenly from your body, you will just store it likely unevenly so it will always appear slighlty uneven.</p>
<p>The only way to remove fat from a certain area on you is to burn most of it off your entire body.  And the only real way to burn fat (calories) is to just exist, and watch your calorie intake.</p>
<p>Exercising more burns more calories yes, but also makes you much hungrier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I know how general fat loss works. There is no such thing as spot reduction. I was more so asking why it was the last to go, not how to get rid of it.        </p>
<p>Thanks for your information you provided! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit because I'm an idiot: Ignore this, I'm probably wrong.</p>
<p>Not a biologist or anything, but it's not that the fat is the 'first to go on' around the waist, and fat isn't gained in any order, it's just that when you put on fat it will be distributed unevenly, such that a higher proportion of the fat deposited will be around the waist. It gets put on everywhere at the same time, just at different rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have 1 half of the comments saying it is introduced to the body in a very distinct order and the other half telling me it goes about unevenly.</p>
<p>Can't you see you guys are tearing me in half?</p></div>		</li>
