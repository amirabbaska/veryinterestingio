			<div class="markdown"><p>1-10 are counted in Spanish, but the Filipino version...some words are spelled differently like otso vs. ocho. Another example of a Filipino version of a Spanish word is kutsilyo vs. cuchillo. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I agree. I think we're both correct. They have Filipino and Spanish versions of the numbers 1-10 and they use them differently. I know Spanish and just a little Filipino so, when I hear Filipinos talking the Spanish words really stick out to me.  I also remember being young and my Filipino cousins trying to teach me the Filipino 1-10...it confused me and I stuck with the Spanish numbers I knew and they could understand. Messed up a little I guess...but thankfully we cold also just speak to one another in English. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All numbers are in Filipino except for multiples of 10 but only from 20. For example, 10 is <em>sampu</em> which is Filipino but 20 is <em>bente</em> (or veinte in Spanish). After that all multiples of 10s are in Spanish. (30 = treinta, 40 = cuarenta, etc.) The rest are mixed with Filipino (21 = benteuno, 22 = bentedos).</p>
<p>When you're dealing with money, all numbers after 19 also become Spanish.</p>
<p>We also tell time in Spanish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are &quot;mixed&quot; with Filipino?  In the Philippines 21= Benteuno and in Spanish its veintiuno.  The accent will be different and a Spanish speaker would definitely recognize the strange pronunciation.  I believe the numbering is essentially identical.  </p>
<p>In my time there I don't believe I ever heard</p>
<p>I know Ilonggo and Cebuano well but I'm not as well versed in Tagalog.  Tagalog is a written language with actual rules and literature too.  I bet you are completely correct!  We are talking about different languages, and I apologize because my comments made it sound like I was talking about Tagalog. </p>
<p>In my time in the Visayan islands, I never heard anyone use a Filipino form of 11-19, they used spanish (onse, douse, etc)  But, I was never around very many native Tagalog speakers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Tagalog 11-19 uses the word labing. 11 would be labing-isa, 12, would be labing dalawa, so on.</p>
<p>20 is dalawampu, 30 is tatlumpu, 40 is apatnapu, 50 is limampu, so on. </p>
<p>But Filipos hate long words so rather than saying dalawampu't-isa (21), we'd rather say bente y uno. And I sorta agree, why use apatnapu't-dalawa (42) when we can just say cuarenta y dos? Unless you just want to use porti-tu. </p></div>		</li>
