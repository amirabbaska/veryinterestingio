			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding of his book &quot;Our Mathematical Universe,&quot; a Level II universe is the level at which physical constants may differ, not Level IV. From page 153, &quot;Students in Level I parallel universes learn the same thing in physics class but different things in history class, while students in Level II parallel universes could learn different things in physics class as well.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct that physical constants can vary in Tegmark's Level II multiverse. But variation in the fundamental laws of physics is addressed in his Level IV multiverse. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE INITIAL CONDITIONS and physical constants in the Level I, Level II and Level III multiverses can vary, but the fundamental laws that govern nature remain the same. Why stop there? Why not allow the laws themselves to vary? How about a universe that obeys the laws of classical physics, with no quantum effects? How about time that comes in discrete steps, as for computers, instead of being continuous? How about a universe that is simply an empty dodecahedron? In the Level IV multiverse, all these alternative realities actually exist.  </p>
