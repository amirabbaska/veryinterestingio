			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a Turkish living in Turkey, those who vote for him are braindead dumb people and those people are majority of Turkey. A minister once made a blunder and said when education level rises our votes goes down. Also turkish people really really really not living in 21th century in their mind. they still think ottoman can be raised and will take over the world with swords and shit, while USA and other superpowers could send missiles from thousand kilometers away while we keep closing scientific instutions here to make space for more mosques. And root of all problems there is Islam. People really separated here, muslims and nonmuslims are clashing sometimes and police helping muslims because police force atm are erdogan's dogs. Erdogan is shit talking about non muslims and how they are a threat to Islam. The braindead dumb people i said before listening to him and harassing people, sometimes attacking them hell even killing them and police letting them to do such things. Things are not going well here atm, only thing i can said, you can call me a racist or something: never ever believe that islam is a peaceful religion, and never ever let this 1500 years old curse to invade your country. those people play innocent until they get power, and when they get it, you are fucked.</p></div>		</li>
