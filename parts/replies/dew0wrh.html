			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a phenomenal explanation, I'd put it at the top if I could, best one I've seen. Thank you</p>
<p>Edit: it found its way to the top anyways :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>agreed.  can you take a moment and explain all this business about time crystals?  been trying to understand but just can't seem to visualize or model what is being discussed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Qualifications for answering this: basically none, but I'm pretty sure I understand the concept</p>
<p>So, crystals are the way they are (hard, translucent, shiny/reflective, naturally forming in macroscopically geometric shapes) because they are essentially 3D grids of the same molecule all locking together in a regular pattern.</p>
<p>A regular crystal is &quot;crystalline&quot; in our normal three dimensions. A time crystal is also &quot;crystalline&quot; in the 4th dimension, time: its intermolecular structure changes over time (with exposure to heat or electricity? I can't imagine it doing so at normal conditions), but in a regular, unchanging way - just like the 3D structure changes across space (molecule, empty space, molecule, empty space, etc) but in an organized and repeating way</p></div>		</li>
