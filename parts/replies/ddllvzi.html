			<div class="markdown"><p>So there's a lot of meat cutters in this thread.  How common is it for meat departments, especially in supermarkets, to grab expiring meat and repackage/regrind and relabel it for another week?</p>
<p>I know you all frown on that, but I'm sure theres managers threatening people with their jobs over stuff like this.  One time I bought tri-tip from a small Oklahoma supermarket (Super C Mart) and I found mold between the padding and the styrofoam... I have no idea how bad things had to be for that to happen, and that was the last time I shopped there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother used to work in the meat department at a big chain, he told me when the chicken was about to expire they would cut it up, and either skewer it to sell as kebabs, or add some marinade to to hide any smells it might have. Don't know what they do about steaks, but i would imagine something similar, throw some marinade on it and sell it as carne asada or something. Long story short, never buy pre-seasoned meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's extremely normal. Not sure what's objectionable about it either. So long as the product is still safe, that's just how you stay in business as a meat purveyor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no experience with groceries, but this well illustrates the distinction between USDA processor and local grocery. What you describe is illegal AF and would get us shut down so quickly. Lack of oversight at the local level opens up lots of (crooked) doors....</p></div>		</li>
