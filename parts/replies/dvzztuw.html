			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not exactly the same as the paint example in that you could in theory mate two 50/50 hybrids of southern and northern and get what we would call a northern rhino. This because each parent only passes one allele during meiosis, which means it’s theoretically possible for the hybrids to only pass on the allele they got from their northern parent for every part of their DNA, however the chance of this is so small that it would never happen. But... if you keep breeding with more pure bred northern rhino you have a greater and greater chance for this to happen. Still very unlikely, but with paint the chance is literally 0, in genetics it only approximates 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it’s not what’s done at all. “Beefalo” were bred to create a more docile and faster growing bison for meat production. The result for conservation is that they now have to try to prevent the last few remaining pure bison herds from becoming part cow. The few herds left would be enough to repopulate but the plains are pretty much all fenced in and farmed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're basically correct about hybridization; however, there are scientific methods for generating a [&quot;chimera&quot;](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics</a>) of the two, which would not be a hybrid, but rather each offspring would contain genetic information that you <em>could</em> eventually get another pure offspring from a bit of inbreeding. It's just a whole lot of work, and probably easier to get the ones that are still alive to breed.</p>
<p>I thought I'd just add to this - I noticed after looking it up, apparently it isn't uncommon for Northern rhinos to have chromosome polymorphisms that lead to having 81 chromosomes instead of 82 (like other rhinos). Not sure if that afflicts the compatibility of mating the two specific N. white rhinos in captivity.</p></div>		</li>
