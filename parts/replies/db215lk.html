			<div class="markdown"><p>There exists a really cool program called <a href="http://daugerresearch.com/orbitals/index.shtml" target="_blank">atom in a box</a>. It plots the |psi|^2 of H-like atoms in a clever way and also has an option to make slices so that you can see the prob density eat every radius. It also has a plot of the probability of finding an electron at a certain radius. If you disable time dependence you will see the well known oribitals from chemistry.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it only works on the MacOS. Ive run it in a  virtual machine, which works quite OK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, why not? I downloaded a version of lion (I believe) specifically modified for virtualbox. It was a bit of effort but I did it in one afternoon. Can't say it was very smooth or anything, but I did it just to run this program and that worked well enough.</p></div>		</li>
