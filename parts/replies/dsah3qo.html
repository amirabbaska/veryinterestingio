			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing fun, just slightly different crystalline structures and densities. It's speculated that ice might get some more exotic properties at extremely high pressures, but too high for us to actually test it.</p>
<p>There's also amorphous (non-crystalline) ice, which is a bit more interesting, but you won't get that just by compressing ice. You'd also have to cool it well below -100Â°C. It's common in space but doesn't exist on Earth outside of special labs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is ice, and it is hot. So... yes? You can make nearly everything solid by increasing the pressure enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually can you? If the temperature is higher than the critical temperature i don't think we could even make it liquid with any amount of pressure. So the temperature just needs to be higher than the temperature of triple point for no solid to exist at any pressure. Talking about pure water, that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about transparency of the ice? I suppose the good transparency of ice cubes comes from the fact that it's a monocrystal with a single refraction index. You probably wouldn't get something like that from just squeezing snow, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just Antarctica, but pretty much the bottom of any glacier. The pressure squeezes the air out and consolidates the ice into one block.</p></div>		</li>
