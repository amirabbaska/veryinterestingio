			<div class="markdown"><p>A starter connects the two sides of the tube. When you turn on the light, the starter is closed and electricity goes trough it. After a second it instantly opens. This causes the voltage in the ballast to spike and the tube to ignite.
Every time the tube ignites, the starter went from closed to open a small arc is pulled. This causes it to brake down and turn brown.</p>
<p>Starters and ballast are long overdue. An electronic ballast uses a lot less power to start it and to use then. They don't nearly beak as fast and the same tube will give more light.</p>
<p>Replacement tubes with LEDs also become cheaper each year and are even easier to install (just two lines). On average they do produce less light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of the last few thousand florescent fixtures I've seen, none of them had any starters, and many of those were in old factories. It just seems like they aren't used very much at all anymore.  </p>
<p>The LEDs I install always produce more lumens per watt though. I'm at a job now where 2 tube fixtures are being replaced with the single LED tube and it's still brighter. Most of the jobs I do we end up deleting some lights altogether because converting everything light for light results in <em>too much</em> light even though the watt consumption has gone down tremendously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you first turn on the lamp, the starter is open, not closed. It contains a gas such as neon that conducts electricity and that heats up the bimetallic strips that <em>then</em> close. That shorts out the starter so the gas in it no longer conducts and the strips cool and open again. While closed there is enough current flowing to heat up the filaments at each end of the tube, which heats the gas in the tube and helps it start. The moment the starter opens a high voltage is sent across the tube which should set it going. If that is not enough then the starter closes and opens again. Once the tube ignites, it carries enough current and drops the voltage across the starter that the starter no longer heats up and so stays open. </p>
<p>That's the old traditional starter at least, with some details left out because I'm on my phone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gas in a fluorescent bulb is mostly a noble gas (xenon, argon, etc) and some mercury vapor. The mixture of mercury vapor and the noble gas has an ionization potential to overcome in order for it to conduct electricity sufficiently (<a href="https://www.webelements.com/mercury/atoms.html" target="_blank">~1007 kilojoules per mole for the mercury</a>).</p>
<p>Dielectric breakdown of a gas occurs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_breakdown#Gases" target="_blank">via ionization</a>, and so, it is exactly like dielectric breakdown.</p>
<p>If you're curious, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law" target="_blank">Paschen's law</a> describes the relationship between voltage and pressure of a gas to cause ionization over a fixed distance.</p>
<p>You can see that at higher pressures, the voltage necessary to cause breakdown increases. This is due to more frequent scattering of liberated electrons during ionization. Scattered electrons don't form a cohesive current, and may actually travel in the opposite direction of the electric field for a short distance. This means that less effective ionization occurs and the gas as a whole doesn't completely ionize until you apply a higher voltage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. I would have expected the opposite to be true- that as the amount of gas in a fixed volume is increased and therefore the pressure, the distance between the molecules becomes smaller, and smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The starter (either separate, or part of the ballast) is no longer able to quite create the voltage spike needed to reliably initiate the arc within the tube. Flicking the switch gives it multiple kicks at the can, and also let's the electronics warm up, which sometimes improves things. It also  likely warms up the tube electrodes which helps them better emit electrons, improving the chance of the arc starting. </p></div>		</li>
