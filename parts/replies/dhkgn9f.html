			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yeah, Tuesday night I was driving my usual route home from my girlfriends house. It's backroads but I'm so used to it that it's nothing. I'm doing my thing and a deer runs last second out into the road and my first reaction was look for somewhere to go but I was frozen gripping the steering wheel. I swear it was a dream as its body went across my bumper. I was in shock for a good 3 seconds and then all my emotions flowed. Mainly anger. I drive real slow when I come to that spot now. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Your mind was trying to process so many things at once, that your nervous systems was overwhelmed with input, causing the freeze and subsequent rush of everything. This &quot;freeze&quot; is something that the military, first responders, and other high-stress situation-oriented jobs try to combat through intensive training. When asked how thy were able to do what was needed in that scenario or environment, most of the time the answer is &quot;I didn't think and the training just kicked-in.&quot; We live in such a confusing world, compared to nature, that there are many more scenarios where that can occur, at least in my opinion. </p>
<p>Someone asked awhile back why animals like deer try to cross exactly when we are crossing. I don't remember if there was a good answer, but I do remember that animals have a poor ability to judge speed. It doesn't, though, explain why they hadn't gone before or after when there were no othe vehicles in sight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure animals cross the road all the time. It's just that nobody notices it when nobody is around to see it. </p></div>		</li>
