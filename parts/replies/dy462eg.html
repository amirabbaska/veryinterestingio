			<div class="markdown"><p>The plate containing a hologram is just a flat panel, so that's taken care of. The issue would be (1) color, holograms are typically monochromatic and (2) transmitting the image to be reproduced. Perhaps it would be possible for some type of display to create an arbitrary diffraction pattern that would create the desired holographic image, but it's not as easy as putting a normal image on a screen. For a 2D image you can break it down into pixels, but if you were to simplify the pattern on a holographic plate you would probably not end up with a discernable image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am trying to understand what exactly a 2D system need to do to create 3D content. If flat panel like television or computer monitor is packed with pixels in high density, emitting a direction-specific beam of light in every possible direction towards an observer, would that effectively be same as watching through a window? would that make an image appear to be behind the screen of flat display?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That should actually have said interference pattern, I fixed my original comment. The interference pattern is the result of the reference beam and the beam that illuminated the object interfering with each other at the plate. Because the two beams of light have the same wavelength, the only difference between them is how long it took the light scattered off the object to reach the plate. Small differences in that time change the phase of the light relative to the reference beam, so the two either constructively or destructively interfere at different points on the plate. This causes there to be a pattern of dark and light areas all over the plate which aren't really an image of the object, but an encoding of how the reference beam interacted with the light coming from the object. After the plate is developed, the same reference beam incident on the plate will diffract through the small areas in between the pattern left on the plate, reconstructing the light that came off the object that was imaged.</p></div>		</li>
