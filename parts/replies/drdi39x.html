<p>You can use other diamonds to crush diamonds.</p>
</li>
<li>Diamond has a crystalline lattice structure, you can sheer it along weak points with a less hard material.  </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont know how, but i do know that hardness also implies brittleness. Diamonds can scratch other materials, but if to much pressure is applied, they shatter. Less hardness means the material can deform more before breaking. Glass is also very hard, but if it is stressed to much it shatters, where a material such as steel will bend much further before actually breaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be careful with that. The relationship between ductility (brittleness), toughness and hardness is primarily valid for the same/similar materials.</p>
<p>You can have very brittle, but very tough materials (a number of engineering ceramics fall in this range). It's just that once you leave their linear elastic region, they fail catastrophically. Not a situation most engineers like, since there are basically no warning signs that failure is imminent.</p>
<p>However, they can be very useful materials in certain applications, and provide solutions to problems you just can't get with metals/ductile materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Quenching does indeed change the crystalline structure of the steel, but the quenching oil does not add an appreciable amount of carbon to the steel. </p>
<p>Some heat treatment compounds can increase the carbon of the outer surface, but only the outer layer of the steel will be altered and it will be very thin. The base metal will remain unchanged. </p>
<p>The only way to increase the carbon of the base metal is to either fold and forge weld the steel several times in a carbon rich environment like a blacksmith's coal forge or by re-melting the steel and adding the additional carbon. </p>
<p>In most cases you are better off selecting a steel alloy that already has the hardness, toughness, and ductility characteristics you are looking for.</p>
<p>Steel is a complex group of alloys that requires far more information than a few paragraphs can provide to fully appreciate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's true quenching changes the crystal structure of the steel to hard  martensite, quenching in oil doesn't introduce carbon to the steel.</p>
<p>That process is called carburizing, where carbon atoms are diffused into the surface layer of the steel. This won't happen in oil quenching for two reasons: one, the vast majority of carbon in oil is trapped in organic molecules and is not free to diffuse, and two, quenching happens over a very short period of time (&lt;5 seconds typically), which is not nearly enough time for significant diffusion, which would take many hours at a high sustained temperature.</p>
<p>If you're interested I can pull some numbers to do some example calculations, but that's the jist of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in the short time it takes it to cool.</p>
<p>Low-carbon steel can be case-hardened, which means putting it inside a metal case containing carbon and keeping it red-hot <strong>for several hours</strong>. Traditionally, that carbon material was leather, today you get special powders specifically made for case-hardening.</p>
<p>Case hardening has the advantage that only the surface of the steel is hardened, the interior stays ductile and, therefore, less susceptible to cracking. It bends, instead of cracking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I've read it both ways: annealing is slow cooling which will remove internal stresses and therefore strengthen the metal, and your way, which is rapidly cooling and claiming that it also strengthens the metal. I can imagine that heating alone is the main factor in the strengthening, but which cooling speed is better, assuming I'm using a pure metal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cooling it rapidly makes it very hard but brittle. Cooling it slowly makes it less hard but more resilient. It will bend but will not crack. Which is the kind of strength you want?</p>
<p>And, BTW, this is for carbon steel only, meaning steel that has about 0.5% of carbon in its composition. Different metals will behave in different ways.</p></div>		</li>
