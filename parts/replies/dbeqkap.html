			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean why do languages use different words for things?</p>
<p>Because they're different languages.</p>
<p>In Spanish the word &quot;pues&quot; or &quot;o sea&quot; serves this function a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What?! Different languages are different???? </p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding. Obviously you were not the right person to ask. I was curious if there were known trends towards why different languages use different filler words. Is it because we have a higher frequency of words that contain &quot;uh&quot; sounds so we're comfortable defaulting to it? Is it a hybrid of the words &quot;Yeah&quot; and &quot;Nah&quot; so we hestitate on a non-commital sound before deciding? Do any trends hold true across languages? If given keys words from multiple languages would it be possible to derive what their filler words most likely are? </p></div>		</li>
