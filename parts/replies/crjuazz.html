			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a medical laboratory scientist and its still a regular practise to smell clinical isolates. Some bacteria like Alcaligenes, Pseudomonas, and Eikenella have very distinct smells, (Apple, tortillas, and bleach for these examples.) but after a while you can distinguish a lot of other bacteria by smell alone.</p>
<p>That said, obviously sight and most especially biochemical tests are more important and reliable in diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you can smell are the by-products of the bacteria, since they won't get airborne by themselves.</p>
<p>It also won't harm you to inhale a few bacteria if you can easily fend against them; we are full of bacteria, getting in touch with lots more on a daily basis, and nothing bad happens.</p></div>		</li>
