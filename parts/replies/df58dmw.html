<p>Most computer scientists would say yes. The brain occupies a finite amount of space and since the universe is discrete, there is a finite amount of information in there. Personally, I'm not too comfortable with the number of assumptions being made with that logic, but my position on that matter is controversial.</p>

<p>There is an actual limit to the amount of information that can be stored in a volume of space, and it is defined by physics, not computer science. The limit is closely related to black holes. It's safe to say the &quot;amount of information&quot; a human brain can hold is something less than that limit.</p></div>		</li>
