			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, because the mirror is always half way in between your eye and your image in the mirror. So the part of the mirror where you reflect is always exactly half your size.</p>
<p>PS: if you are 2m away from the mirror, your image is 2m &quot;behind&quot; the mirror. So the mirror is at 2m and your image at 4m.<br />
Your image is as tall as you, so if you are 1m80 so is your image.
If you put a ruler on the mirror, your image will &quot;look&quot; as high as 90cm on the ruler.<br />
Same as if you stand 4m away from someone and put a ruler 2m from you (assuming he's also 1m80..)<br />
Try it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Linear is right. You can play with this idea in scripted things like Unity or Garry's Mod to toy with perspective. For example, moving an object around the world and changing its size while maintaining the same amount of screen space covered. From your perspective, it's just nearby moving in your screen. From another player's, it's rapidly growing and shrinking about the map.</p>
<p>But it's just linear. Super easy. Just maintaining a ratio.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But in order to know how big it is, they need to know the distance...but in order to know the distance, they need to know how big it is (?). </p></div>		</li>
