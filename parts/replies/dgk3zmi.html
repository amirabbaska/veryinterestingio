			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this. I was smoking a lot every night for a while, but not at all during the day. I think it was messing with me because I would either be REALLY stoned, or not at all. Plus I would drink a whole pot of coffee in the morning. Now I just take a puff here and there throughout the day and now I'm feeling good all the time. Just smoke enough to feel it and enjoy. I feel more evened out. I have even quit drinking coffee!</p></div>		</li>
