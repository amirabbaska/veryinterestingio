			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, if you did this enough, yes. But to answer your second question, also yes.</p>
<p>Not just the rain though, also the ocean and the coast line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tsar Bomba released 50 MT of energy, which is 210 petajoules.  The ocean is at about 20 degrees Celsius, so to boil 1 mol or 18 grams requires (0.075 kJ/K <em> 80 K + 40.65 kJ) or 46,650 J.  Tsar Bomba would then produce 4.5 </em> 10^12 moles of water vapour, or 8.1 * 10^10 kg.</p>
<p>Los Angeles has an area of 12,561 km^(2).</p>
<p>The Tsar Bomba would produce 8.1 * 10^10 kg/12,561 km^(2) = 6.4 mm of rain.</p>
<p>That's more than I would have thought.  Of course, you would only be able to direct a tiny proportion of that to LA.</p>
<p>Edit: the takeaway from this rough calculation shouldn't be &quot;6.4 mm of rain&quot;, it should be &quot;substantial-but-not-overwhelming rain&quot;, 0.1~100 mm type thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was one of the determinations learned from the Baker shot. The Baker shot was an underwater blast that caused a radioactive rain for days. Life magazine ran a pictorial a year later that described how the area was still &quot;too hot&quot; to clean up. There's a documentary &quot;Radio Bikini&quot; that has a man named John Smitherman telling about what happened and the experience of having radioactive water rain on you for a week. Castle Bravo is another response all by itself. The radioactive cloud caused a salt snow on a Japanese fishing boat that eventually killed their radioman. </p>
<p>tldr; they weren't sure what it would do at first but found out really quick after the second test of CROSSROADS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably due to the amount of CCN (Cloud Condensation Nuclei). CCN is basically small particles in the air that the moisture sticks to when it creates rain. Think of almost like a snowball, where all of the snow gathers around once central &quot;sticking point&quot;.  It then becomes too heavy for the cloud to support and  falls out of the cloud. If you google cloud seeding you can also get some interesting test results. Or if you believe in the HAARP program, how there was an olympics that over 200 missiles were detonated to make sure there were clear skies that day. </p>
<p>Edit#1: as u/The_White_Light pointed out it was for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. I had forgotten the place/year.</p>
<p>Edit#2: I found the article <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/how-beijing-used-rockets-to-keep-opening-ceremony-dry-890294.html%3Famp" target="_blank">Here</a> and realized that I was way off with my number of rockets. They actually launched over 1,000 of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People truly believe that HAARP is a mind and weather control program and that they have the power to control weather throughout the world. I always have some fun mentioning it, it's also an interesting thought to have a conversation around. I didn't know about the coal industry shutdowns but that could help with the amount of CCN in the atmosphere. Which in-case anyone is wondering, that's why big city's and places near factories tend to see dense fog that sticks around for a few hours longer that other places around it, more clouds/precip, just due to the fact there's more crap in the air. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer, along with the towns being laced with rivers.
Where was that olympics held? Seems like more than a neighborly knock to pump out 200 missiles on the day right? </p></div>		</li>
