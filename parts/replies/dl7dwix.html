			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely agree with this comment. As a musician I would consider this to be the primary thing I do night after night. I don't think most people realize the influence music has on them, but it is often a dramatic effect that feels like a low grade mind control super power. Certain styles of music will make certain groups of people feel a certain kind of way. Proven fact that banjos make hipsters feel in their element, which leads to ordering another PBR and more instigramming. Play 80's hits in Target and watch soccer moms stop scowling at their kids long enough to let them get one more toy because, hey, that's my jam... Play death core for anyone and I'm sure they'll be either rev'd up, angry, annoyed or hyper. </p>
<p>Or speaking more from personal experience: I can attest to watching large groups of people have a sudden urge to drink, dance, cry, pray or leave, all within seconds of starting a song they are completely unfamiliar with. To me, music is a vivid memory of a feeling and the language to give that feeling to other people. </p>
<p>So yes i also agree that background noise helps but if that was the only reason for it, establishments would be playing recorded street noise instead of music that may or may not sit well with customers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the greatest respect, who do you believe has their emotions moved by background music at a social gathering?</p>
<p>Of course, a DJ can play a set and create a certain feel or a sombre piece of music played before a speech can add gravitas, but the OP was talking about social situations and background music - e.g. low, quite likely indistinct music.</p>
<p>I only chimed in because you stated other answers aren't answering well. I'm all for music soothing the heart of savage beasts, but it's entirely irrelevant in OP's context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he means that background music not only fills the awkward silence but kind of connects people in a subconscious way, the rhythm of our walking or our moods. Think of how differently the soundtrack at the movies, music at a sports game, or even music in an elevator or church connects strangers in different ways. It kind of has a way of binding a group together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but the music you hear playing quietly in the background in a social space is often not particularly emotional or provocative. It's just &quot;there.&quot; Maybe at a party where the music is loud, and a feature of the event. Not so much in a restaurant or a cafe, where you often can't even make out what music is being played.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but different places have different styles of music. Book stores have the upbeat jazzy stuff or classical, restaurants have a more fun poppy sound to appeal to groups wanting a casual atmosphere. Background music isn't meant to get in the way but to evoke a mood and atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>
