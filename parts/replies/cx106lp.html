			<div class="markdown"><p>If most of these are physical changes like your pupils dilating or increased blood flow, is there any particular reason why it's not &quot;default on&quot; for people? If our bodies have the potential to enter this 'faster reaction time' state, what's stopping us from just permanently being in this state? Surely our chances of survival in the wild would be higher if our bodies were used to their fullest potential.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sort of occurs for people with stress or anxiety. It puts the body in an almost constant fight or flight mode. It has a lot of side effects, like stomach aches, twitching, headaches, constant fear and worrying. The persons fear could be paying bills but their brain translates it as &quot;Tiger! Run!&quot; But there's no tiger to run from. It just causes exhaustion along with a hundred other side effects because your body is priotising certain processes over others, like your legs need more oxygen so it'll divert bloodflow from other places to ensure your legs are prepared for a sprint. However, this is what I've read myself online in an attempt to understand my own anxiety. Apologies if this isn't accurate and if not, could someone correct me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically how it feels. Just laying there becomes exhausting and anything will make your heart rate spike. Then you fall asleep because it's so exhausting and you fall asleep.  Rinse and repeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have pretty bad social anxiety and your description is spot on. After a whole day of interacting with people, I am so exhausted that I just lay on the couch watching TV mindlessly for hours on end. I have helpful coping mechanisms so that I appear confident and am able to function socially, but on the inside it is constant turmoil: tense muscles, tachycardia, over-sweating, shaking, breathing difficulties, light-headedness. Add to that, poor memory and problem solving abilities and the inability to think on my feet unless I am completely alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, you're right. I remember doing a lot of reading about this in college (psych major). This can kind of be explained by the difference between anxiety and stress. Stress is just your body getting worked up for a good reason like something dangerous; it's totally normal. Anxiety, on the other hand, is being stressed for no good reason. Which is basically what the previous guy was asking about. Being stressed (pupils dilated, adrenaline high, etc.) all the time is called an anxiety disorder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side question: Certain video games need a high reaction time to play at a high level. They have to react to something they see on their screen by clicking their mouse. Is the finger the fastest way? Is there any other way to react faster than by using your finger? Blinking for example? Curious if a device could be made to increase reaction times for gamers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with blinking is that there would be so many random blinks that people do just to keep there eyes from being dry and its hard to play a game when you're eyes are closed half the time i am assuming? if you could get a direct feed from the brain to the device that'd be the fastest but we aren't really able to do something on that level yet. I'd just stick with your hands, they are plenty fast</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blinking may be faster but it would also disrupt the flow of information. A badly timed blink in a teamfight in League of Legends could be the difference between life and death if your mechanics are good enough to make use of the information. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blinking would be a disadvantage even if it was faster.  In the time your eyes are closed much more could have happened therefore losing sensory input to further process.  That's why pro cs players actually never blink when in a situation. I personally play on a high level, so when i challenge friends to a staring contest i can usually  beat them twice or thrice over. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about it causes memory loss, though? Seems like every fight (like a real all-out fist fight) I've been in results in me having a really fuzzy memory of what happened for a few seconds, usually when things kick off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3swb3s/does_adrenaline_really_reduce_reaction_time/cx100jn" target="_blank">this other comment</a> out, it's the answer to your question. In short, noradrenaline (same as norepinephrine in the US) in high doses will affect many parts of cognition, such as perception of time, and recollection of the details of what has transpired.</p></div>		</li>
