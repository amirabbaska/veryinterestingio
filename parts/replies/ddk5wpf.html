			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're making the mistake of assuming that an individual's intuitive understanding can never go beyond their culture's assumptions. I honestly don't know much about Archimedes, but the fact that Greek culture more broadly hadn't developed the ideas does not at all mean that he as an individual couldn't have at least had contextual understanding of concepts like infinity, limits, or even zero. If he did have an intuitive sense, it probably wouldn't have perfectly matched our modern ways of thinking about them and he most likely would have had a lot of trouble expressing the ideas, but that doesn't mean they couldn't have been helpful and even critical to the way he thought about problems like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is true, it was surprisingly popular amongst great philosophers/mathematicians at the time to specifically deny the existence of infinity, including Aristotle, Plato, and the Pythagorean Brotherhood. There's no reason assume that Archimedes did not agree, and if Archimedes did accept the idea that infinity existed within our reality, he would've been an outcast in even the most intellectual circles of the time.</p>
<p>The Greeks <em>really</em> hated infinity. Their word for it was &quot;apeiron,&quot; which can be translated as &quot;infinite&quot; or &quot;indefinite,&quot; but was more often used as &quot;chaos.&quot; The thinkers of the time took it to be a direct contradiction of the Platonic ideals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think very many Greek thinkers denied the existence of <em>apeiron</em> (certainly not the Pythagoreans anyway). Instead it signified indeterminacy to them and so was contrasted to order (<em>peiron</em>), which they liked a lot more.</p>
<p>In any case, <em>apeiron</em> is not the same as our modern understanding of infinite. It means boundless in the sense of indefinite. I doubt Archimedes would have conceptually associated that with the type of infinity that's important here, though, which is an infinite subdivision. It's part of our modern understanding of infinity that these two concepts are related, but it doesn't have to be that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but he hated infinity, and his ideas of infinity existed solely to deny the existence of infinity within our reality and therefore within mathematics.</p>
<p>Seemingly, the only Greek that liked infinity was Zeno, and he was only accepted by the other philosophers because #1 they liked to come up with explanations as to why he was wrong, and #2 he died young.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Euclid's elements contained algebra - letters representing abstract lengths of shapes. Just look at <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Euclid-proof.svg/445px-Euclid-proof.svg.png" target="_blank">this</a>. That looks pretty abstract to me. </p></div>		</li>
