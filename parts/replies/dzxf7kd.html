			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps to know that Nero was a famously unpopular emperor. There are stories (of uncertain historical accuracy) that he was a terrible lyre player, but would have concerts where he performed and would force townspeople to show up; if people were not sufficiently impressed by his music, he would have them killed. He also delayed the Olympics one year so that he could compete in it and added many artistic events that were to his liking that he then competed in, he sang and acted in tragedies, and proceeded to win every event he competed in. Including a chariot race where he was thrown from his horse and did not complete the race (apparently the judges &quot;decided&quot; that he would have won if he had finished the race, and that was good enough to crown him.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;The current interpretation of Scripture is the correct one.   Believers who came before us didn't have all the information that we do, and believers who come after us are heretics for changing the current interpretation.&quot;</p>

<p>There's another example of this - Juvenal is a satirist who lived under Domitian, and wrote satires talking about how terrible things were back in the old days under Nero. It's thought that he was really writing about Domitian, and that this was just a way of producing plausible deniability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting you mentioned this, because a lot of historians seem to believe nowadays that Nero actually wasn't all that terrible and historians afterward made him seem terrible.</p>
<p>What you just said may add more credence to that theory! Think about it: later people find satire and they think wow Nero was a horrible guy. I don't know if this case is talked about at all. Although I'm no historian so maybe someone more learned can tell us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic write-up.  This is almost exactly what I remember being taught in my &quot;Religious Foundations and the Bible&quot; class when I was in college (at a Lutheran University).  As someone who had been raised Baptist, it absolutely blew my mind that so many people:</p>
<p>a) assumed that the book of Revelation was a unique prophecy, rather than one of many, many similar writings, and </p>
<p>b) something more akin to historical fan-fiction posted on the Internet that was written for political purposes.</p>
<p>So many religious people in America have no idea and are constantly trying to identify modern people as characters from this story.</p></div>		</li>

<p>this is distressing, because it's THE chapter that has spawned countless apocalypse cults and doomsday predictors. just the other day on TIL there was a thing about a guy who started his own sect of christianity and tried to prove his divinity by jumping off of a cliff. and today in a different thread there was a discussion about some dude from ontario that basically started a torture cult and claimed the end was coming in Feb. 1969 or something, and when it didn't, he started literally chopping his followers up.</p>
<p>if you've ever heard religious people freaking out about credit cards and ID chips, it's a reference to the apocalypse and a passage about a one-world currency and the mark of the beast.</p>
<p>ironically, you'd think jared kushner's building on 666 whatever avenue would raise some eyebrows in the evangelical community, but apparently that one's just a coincidence. credit cards are a sign of the end times, but the son of the president who owns a building literally with the mark of the beast is just a fluke.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm closely connected with someone that is very fundamentalist evangelical and I can say that in that section of the community they're going apeshit over that one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not surprising.  In most churches the minister is the only one who has spent serious time studying the bible, and in their case it tends to focus more on &quot;what it means&quot; (according to their particular denomination) as opposed to &quot;how it came to be and putting it into context&quot;.  For the congregation they basically take the minister at their word.</p>
<p>But my wife's family is Catholic, and I've heard various family members (even the most devout) say &quot;we Catholics aren't very big on the bible&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there’s a caution around deeper study that worries that they could be misled unless they put lots of time into learning from the right people. I think people have this idea that the history is complicated and that humans can come up with lots of different takes on things. So, they worry if they just dip a toe in they could get off track or learn something that isn’t true. Where I grew up, people were very selective of who they even trusted outside of the pastor of just our church. There were also only one or two seminaries that were trusted for where they got pastors from. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also don't understand that the way the books are ordered in our bible today wasn't the way they were actually written chronologically. People thought the book of revelations fits best at the end so that's where they put it. It wasn't the last book to be written that we have in our bibles today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. They're organized by category, not chronology, but the categories are somewhat chronological.</p>
<p>First, you have the four gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) and the Acts. The first four cover roughly the same time period and include different events, some potentially contradictory. The Acts is mostly intended to be a historical account of the acts of the apostles.</p>
<p>Second, you have the letters of Paul, which covers the Epistle to the Romans all the way through the Book of Philemon.</p>
<p>Third, you have the other letters, which covers Hebrews through Jude.</p>
<p>Last, we have Revelation.</p>
<p>So, chronologically speaking, the gospels &quot;happened&quot; first (though they were probably written after many of the other books), followed by the Acts, and then the letters (groups two and three), and Revelation happened somewhere near the end. I think the letters are sorted by length, not time or content, so there's that as well.</p></div>		</li>
