			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as my understanding goes, it doesn't, relatively, because of the grand scale it works on.  Unless you mean how is time actually making both planets humans grow differently, in which case I am not sure about. I'm not an astrophysicist, just an amateur history/science/philosophy lover so someone who is more knowledgeable on the subject may be able to offer a better answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No observable effect. There probably would not be an effect until you start reaching high fractions of the speed of light, and even then, since the person traveling at the high speed experiences time at their own normal rate, they would likely have no difference except being a different age than people who are elsewhere.</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafele%E2%80%93Keating_experiment" target="_blank">several experiments over the years</a> showing that a simple airplane flight is enough to trigger the effects. There is one set of changes due to gravity at altitude, another set of changes due to velocity, both making a traveler age slightly slower.  Astronauts on the ISS age just a tiny bit slower than people on earth, several milliseconds each year.   People on higher mountains age several nanoseconds per year slower than sea-level people.</p>
<p>Although it doesn't address human aging, the drift also affects satellites including those that coordinate GPS, and the GPS protocols and other satellite communications must account for it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you would be even more correct if you were to replace 'in presence of gravity' with 'in presence of mass'. Bear in mind that gravity is simply a phenomenon which is the physical manifestation of the spacetime fabric warping.</p>
<p>I am in no way an expert so am looking forward eagerly towards being shown I'm wrong somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a few things you say that I think are worth clarifying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In presence of gravity the space dimension is stretched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm being a pedant, but spacetime is not stretched, it's curved. The extent of the curve is then analogous with the strength of gravitational force felt. Specifically the curvature is described using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_curvature" target="_blank">Ricci curvature</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar is the case with time (because they [space and time] are the same dimension)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Space and time are not the same dimension. They are separate distinct dimensions. However, general relativity does describe space and time as different dimensions of the same thing. This is why you'll hear people refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" target="_blank">spacetime</a>. Spacetime is the three dimensions of space combined with a time to create a 4 dimensional object. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time is an illusion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not accurate to call time an illusion. Our freedom to move through time is as real as our freedom to move through space (while both equally real obviously our freedom to move through time is greatly encumbered compared to our ability to move through space). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[time] is relative to where the observer is in the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is technically not accurate although I believe I can see why you might say this as practically it appears this way. It is a statement counter to the quite generally accepted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity" target="_blank">principle of relativity</a>. (The name-sake of Einstein's theory of General relativity)</p>
<p>It is not a person's absolute location in the universe that matters but instead their velocity and relative proximity to other objects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree those things could have been added/changed. This was just a quick write up for the average person to understand. Had it not been an ELI5 post, I would have gone into the accuracy of the pedantics. Hopefully those seeking clarification will see your post. :) (I am adding a couple of those points to the main post.)</p></div>		</li>
