			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read it was not. Slow burn, mostly black cast, tons of characters, no real main protagonist, huge amount of both street and police slang terms, complex plot and tons of detail with not much of it spelt out for the audience, Baltimore as a setting, less than ideal time slot... All of that goes against making a popular show.</p>
<p>Many people who started watching it just got lost or bored after a couple episodes and anyone who decided to try it half way through a season couldn't catch up because of what they'd missed. The only reason it blew up was due to the few hardcore who stuck with it from beginning to end and the critics who, by the 5th season, lauded it as probably the best TV show ever made.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why I love the BBC; because of the way they're funded they pretty much run the other way around. Plus no adverts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The BBC is Boss.</p>
<p>However, they also have to make efforts to appeal to the broadest possible base (especially due to the way they are funded), which leads to a lot of trash as well as gems.</p>
<p>You know which BBC show I love the most, though? Question Time. I don't know of any other country which has anything like it, but most of them could really do with it. It's nice to see sitting politicians have to explain themselves directly to the public, with minimal moderation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those who don't know (and don't care for spoilers):</p>
<p>After years of struggle the main character has finally, FINALLY pacified his enemies and found a way to live without being hunted. In the final scene he proposes to the love interest who he's sometimes struggled to even stay in contact with, and she's finally able to avoid getting hunted too.</p>
<p>Then some guy we've never seen or heard of before flies his ship over, shoots them dead, and flies off. Roll credits.</p></div>		</li>
