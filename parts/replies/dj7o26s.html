			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea is to pass it through budget reconciliation. It's a special process that can only be used if the bill doesn't increase the amount of money spent by the federal government. Because it likely includes large cuts to Medicare and Medicaid to offset tax breaks for the wealthy, the Senate version of AHCA will be a candidate for the reconciliation. A bill passed under reconciliation only needs 50 votes plus the vice-president and (I might be wrong here) isn't subject to traditional filibusters.</p>
<p>One tactic might be to &quot;filibuster by amendment&quot; where the Democrats introduce so many amendments to the bill that nothing can move forward in the Senate. The hope would be that as their constituents find out more, three Republicans will be pressured into voting against the bill, dropping it below the 50 vote threshold.  There is a recess for the 4th of July during which they would return home and have to face the people without the insulation of Washington.  The Democrats would hope to stall until this recess and then, hopefully, the vulnerable Republicans would drop support for the bill.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a little ironic that the Republicans said the ACA was rammed through when their repeal is written in secret by a special committee, voted on in a dubious way, and took less than a quarter of the time that the ACA did.</p></div>		</li>

<p>FWIW, from what i've read, this won't work as hoped. Senate aides have said McConnell can cut this after 10hours. Apparently there's a rule to prevent delaying amendments</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the fillibuster: it is only allowed in the Senate, as the House has a limited amount of time to debate bills. Simplified, it still generally requires 60 votes to overrule a filibuster, and despite several bills aimed at abolishing it, it still remains in place.</p>
<p>In terms of why this type of privacy is happening, it is likely due to a public that is under educated in aspects of politics, and focuses more on specific laws and minor issues rather than face fixing or adjusting government processes.</p>
<p>But that's just my two cents</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reconciliation requires it be budget neutral (over some time period, 10 years?). That's the other constraint and the reason why the included tax cuts necessitate spending cuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the strategy behind it is that the Republicans who want to vote for this know that the backlash will be great when they basically sentence a portion of the population to die.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I didn't know that's what I was voting for&quot; is a slightly better excuse to have than &quot;Yeah, I knew and did it anyway.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is what Quist and Ossoff should have focused on. Force the national discussion on to specific provisions of the AHCA. The GOP doesn't want to discuss specifics on <em>anything</em> its passing. Making voters understand that Republicans either don't know what they're passing or forcing them to assume ownership of children killing policies will change elections. </p></div>		</li>
