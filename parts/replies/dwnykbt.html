<p>I would think the efficacy of multivitamins would be so well researched by now.  Scientifically, how is there not a generally accepted view of their effectiveness?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The FDA doesn't mandate that pharmacokinetic data (i.e the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) must be obtained on over the counter multivitamins. This is because they are classified as a &quot;supplement&quot; rather than a therapeutic drug. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what is scientifically clear is, that a vitamin is a substance that is needed by the body in a certain quantity, and that it cannot be formed by the body itself in quantities that are sufficient for the organism (i.e. supplementation by nutrition is needed). It is quite clear what happens with a Vitamin C deprivation (Scurvee for example). Point is however, that if you are living in an industrial nation, it is quite hard to be malnoutrished to this extent, in general if you eat a normal variety of a diet, you will get a large variety of vitamins. The problem with multivitamins is, that you would normally want to supplement vitamins in the sense that you want to compensate for any deficienies you might have. For that you would actually need (1) a target dosage (2) your current dosage of vitamins you consume. Multi vitamins are too general in that respect.</p>
<p>What is also not 100% clear is if it is safe to &quot;overdose&quot; on vitamins. So there is an inherent danger in that respect.</p>
<p>A homeless person, an alcoholic, or a person with a very limited dietary range might profit directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or someone dieting or on an extreme exercise program.  If you are in the gym training every day (i.e. I was going to attempt trying for state strongman last year) taking a multi-vit, while they may not be effective at all, can help to prevent any issues that may arise. And I talked this over with my gp before starting an intense training, diet, life makeover.</p>
<p>BUT (this isnt directed at you kniebuiging) as with any changes that impact your health, talk to your healthcare provider first.  Not enough people do this.  Just an office visit to discuss stuff.  Maintaining a friendly and open relationship with your primary healthcare provider is the most valuable thing you can do for your health, period.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There have been several non-biased studies on their effectiveness, but not enough to really explore the topic in much depth. Some of what we do know: those who are more likely to take MVMs are also the least likely to need them (they already get what they need from food); smokers shouldn't take them (Vit A and beta-carotene have been linked to lung cancer in smokers); and that there is insufficient evidence that they have any effect on chronic disease prevention.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest reason for the debate, though, is the fact that everyone's needs are so variable and individual, depending on factors such as diet, activities, and even genetics, that no one MVM can fit everyone. The best advice is before starting a supplement regimen, consult your doctor.</p></div>		</li>

&quot; 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide. It can cause reduced work capacity in adults1 and impact motor and mental development in children and adolescents.2 There is some evidence that iron deficiency without anemia affects cognition in adolescent girls3 and causes fatigue in adult women.4 IDA may affect visual and auditory functioning3 and is weakly associated with poor cognitive development in children.&quot;  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once again, people in the developed world have little need for multivitamins because they're generally not vitamin deficient. </p>
<p>However, if we assumed that vitamins were critical for humans, you could still take either. Neither is harmful to the other gender. If the claims of the bottles could be trusted, then it would be advisable to take the bottle associated with the <del>assigned</del> chosen gender, since men's multi vitamins have ingredients that claim to boost male vitality i.e. increase sperm and testosterone production. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're not bleeding once a month then you don't need much more iron. If you don't produce sperm then you don't need as much zinc and selenium.</p>
<p>So it has more to do with the sexual organs than the gender.</p>
<p>However, I doubt there are many studies of e.g. males' metabolism of iron following estrogen supplementation.</p></div>		</li>
