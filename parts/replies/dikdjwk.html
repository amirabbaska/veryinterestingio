<p>As long as you're not dealing with a serious pothole or a speed-bump, the car's suspension is going to face-tank most of the shock so that you don't have to. Larger tires can also take some of the shock out of the road, but it's not as effective. Bikes generally don't have awesome suspension, and tires of comparable size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd disagree with the order of importance suggested here. Generally, you start to notice speed when things start to buzz and rattle. These sorts of bumps happen at rates around 10 times a second. The spring and damper part of a car's suspension tends to handle bumps that act more in the range of 1 cycle per second. The higher frequency buzz and rattle sort of bumps that give the sensation of speed tend to mostly get absorbed by the sidewall of the tire. On a car the sidewalls tend to be substantially thicker and tire pressures are usually lower, giving it a better ability to absorb these high frequency bumps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like people are getting bogged down with the environment variable. If you were on a completely even surface, it would still feel faster on a bike than a car. The main answer I believe would be what your eyes are seeing i.e. parallax effect being stronger and the skin feeling wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a great quote by Hemmingway that perfectly sums this up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up the hills and coast down them. Thus you remember them as they actually are, while in a motor car only a high hill impresses you, and you have no such accurate remembrance of country you have driven through as you gain by riding a bicycle.”  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's pretty scary stuff. I'm always afraid of the tire popping off and me flipping over and skidding twenty feet across the asphalt whenever I'm going that fast. </p>
<p>Is that an irrational fear? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no, not at all. Do down hills but check <em>every thing</em> at the top:  tires, tire pressure, rims, spokes, brakes, brake cables. You know what a well seated tire and a rigid rim should look like. Ok.  Helmet, gloves. Know the route; where to go slow, lean into a turn, where the road curves are, where to go all out on the big ring and where to slow down for the S curve ahead.</p>

<p>She'd be dead if not for the helmet, even if there had been no stick that managed to penetrate through about 85% of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention very high quality rails and very gentle bends. The forces on your body from movement are minimised.</p>
<p>In essence, you feel like you're going fast when you can sense a lot going around you. In an enclosed vehicle, the noise and wind and bumps are dampened.</p></div>		</li>
