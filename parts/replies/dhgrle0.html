<p>For a national government that controls its own currency, increasing the debt is the most efficient way to increase its monetary base. A US Treasury Note/Bond is fully exchangeable for a $100 bill, and from an economic/finance perspective they are identical (eg 'print' a $100 bill or create a bond - it doesn't matter). The only real argument comes in the practical application (good luck paying for your mocha frappachino with a 30yr US treasury bond).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is NOT correct for the US economy. NOT AT ALL.</p>
<p>The US offers debt that gets bought by banks, companies, people, and foreign countries (which are forign governments, companies, AND people).</p>
<p>This money would have been lent to someone at, but because the US Treasury is a really safe bet, it goes to them. This debt is pretty close to identical to any other debt in its effect on the monetary base.</p>
<p>The reason why u/Laminar_flo (and many others) say that it is the same as printing money is because the US Federal Reserve BUYS US treasuries to increase the money supply. But they buy them from banks that have already purchased them from the US Treasury. </p>
<p>They are simplifying it and saying &quot;Its basically the same thing&quot; but it is not the same thing. The Federal Reserve cares about inflation and their purchasing/selling of treasuries* is based on the observable inflation. That means the US treasury does NOT get a say on whether or not the Fed will buy their bonds.</p>
<p>*The Federal Reserve only sells treasuries that they had previously bought, they do not sell new treasuries.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>From the highest level, you <em>have</em> to be wrong b/c there needs to be a control on monetary creation; under the scenario you've described, creation is decentralized and completely uncontrolled, and therefore would (nearly) instantaneously fail in a gigantic inflationary mushroom cloud.  B/c we have a functioning economy, you de facto <em>have</em> to be wrong.</p>
<p>Digging in:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the start of the problem - you're missing the 'lifecycle of cash' component.  If you look at the full lifecycle, there is no 'ex nihlo' creation - that loan/bond is carried on someones balance sheet as either a debit/credit....<em>all the way back to the UST</em>. This is the first massive difference between UST &amp; corp debt.  Corps <em>do not</em> and <em>cannot</em> create money - this is why debt for corps and people is time/risk shifting and nothing more.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is wildy wrong.  I think you're confusing 'extraordinary open market activities' from the post-crash era with monetary creation.  You can <strong>never</strong> buy USTs to increase the money supply - that's like saying 2+2= -3; it just violates basic math.  The Fed bought USTs to push institutionals out the risk curve, increase velocity (which had completely died), spur lending/risk acceptance, and prevent deflation.  That was a velocity/inflation response, not a 'monetary base' question in the least. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is in part true, but you're only looking at a small part - the Fed and UST <em>deeply</em> coordinate their actions and have done so for the last 100 years.  The Fed can't work without the UST and the UST can't issue into a vacuum w/o fucking up the markets.  I mean, if they weren't in constant contact, how would UST auctions be even close to orderly every single time - you think that's a coincidence? They work so closely together that they often operate/look like a single entity.  Otherwise the fed would be (basically) incapable of hitting a target rate - this lockstep is a huge part of why the USD is so stable.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

<p>You are right that &quot;you&quot; can never buy UST's to increase the money supply, but the FED can. They are buying UST's with money that was NOT in the market before that moment. That means they are adding money to the supply by sending more money out into the world. This is generally short term (The money leaves the money supply as the Treasury pays back the bonds). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need a stable currency.  A constant monetary base in a growing economy triggers deflation, which is far, far worse than inflation.  Inflation can easily be managed; deflation causes depressions.</p>
<p>And before you say &quot;Inflation can be managed?? Weinmar Republic!! Zimbabwe!! Brazil in the 90s!!&quot; - Hyper-inflation happens not due to 'money printing!' or '[insert something about fiat currency]!' - it happens because the economic asset base (a nations ability to produce stuff of value) gets damaged/destroyed.  Then suddenly the currency is worth a lot less.</p></div>		</li>

<p>deflation </p>

<p>why is deflation perceived so damaging ? in the end it is just a correction mechanism. for example italy needs deflation in order to be more competitive or so they say, but they want to trick that by devaluating their own currency and getting inflation instead, although mathematically it's the same, just the perception is different.</p></div>		</li>
