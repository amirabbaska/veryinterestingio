			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very!
I have two follow up questions based on your reply:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You say it takes a high concentration to kill brain cells. Is it actually impossible to drink that much (e.g. when k.o. drunk?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It takes people who drink regularly build resistances so it takes more alcohol for them to get drunk than before. Does this mean the cells get used to the contact with alcohol?</p>
</li>
<li>You said, if alcohol actually killed brain cells that would be a permanent damage. However, I read recently about a special type of brain cells which are able to produce/build more brain cells. So are you sure about your statement? I mean no offense it's just I have different information:) (I can't search for the article right now because I don't know where I exactly I read it and I am quite in a hurry) </li>

<p>You would almost certainly be dead long before you had enough alcohol in your system to kill brain cells directly.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, under the right circumstances, booze CAN kill brain cells.  This only happens if you go a long time (like a day or more) drinking alcohol but eating very little food.  This produces a deficiency of vitamin B1 in the brain, which can kill brain cells, sometimes resulting in seizure and/or Korsakoff's syndrome, a form of dementia in which the ability to form new long term memories is lost.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is called tolerance.  It is essentially the same process that occurs when someone regularly takes a wide variety of other drugs, such as benzodiazepines or opioids.  Ethanol (the specific type of alcohol that we drink), like the other drugs I mentioned, affects us by binding to neurotransmitter receptors in the brain.  When a brain cell's receptors are getting stimulated more than normal, the cell often responds by decreasing its sensitivity in some way.  This means that as time goes by, if the brain cells are repeatedly exposed to ethanol, they will make themselves less and less sensitive to it.</p>
<p>This is actually a really bad thing, because it means that when ethanol is NOT present, those receptors are getting stimulated way less than normal (because they are so much less sensitive).  Because the receptors that ethanol activates are inhibitory receptors, this means that when someone who drinks a lot suddenly stops drinking, neurons in their brain are getting WAY LESS inhibition than they should.  This can produce a seizure, and even death.  For this reason, withdrawal from severe alcohol abuse is dangerous and should be done under medical supervision.</p>

<p>Just because certain specific brain cells in a few specific brain regions are capable of producing new neurons does <em>not</em> mean that the brain can heal itself.  In most areas of the brain, new neurons cannot be produced.  And the new neurons that ARE produced do not have the ability to just take the place of an existing neuron.  Replacing a neuron in your primary motor cortex with a new, fresh neuron would be like trying to replace an experienced engineer with some guy with an elementary school education.  Neurons are specialized, and in addition, they acquire and store information over time, and when important neurons die, whatever information those neurons &quot;knew&quot; is lost forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know of any non-neroscientist level yet still college level reading on this? I have a family member with severe alcoholism that my family and I are trying to convince to stop or at least limit their drinking and I think some in depth info on the daging effects to the brain could help me convince them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be safe to say that alcohol could cause indirect neuronal death by increasing stress or decreasing ability to repair?    Also, is there any evidence which implicate a decrease of REM sleep with alcohol, and the subsequent increase of death in rats(?) when they can't get REM sleep?  I'm not too familiar with the details tho.    </p></div>		</li>

<p>What if that neuron I'm replacing with the elementary school guy is the equivalent of a deadbeat drunk or simply a dumbass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1, a person would probably die of alcohol poisoning before they got enough alcohol soaking into their brain. 2, I don't know the physiological mechanics of alcohol resistance, so I couldn't tell you that either. 3, unless those cells can regrow entire sections of the brain within, say, a week, it still wouldn't do much good, and that's just assuming with a person that only goes drinking once a week, and that the cells would be able to recover as much brain tissue as would be destroyed in a single night. Only tissues I can think of that can recover within days is tongue, the inside of the mouth and maybe esophagus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For point number three, that's like saying someone is wrong for saying a broken leg is a severe impairment because the body can heal it.  The brain does create new neurons through a process called neurogenesis, but if alcohol killed brain cells the damage would be catastrophic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Each neuron's tasks are many and what is affected by high alcohol concentrations varies. Things slow down and start working ineffectively but resume normal function when the solvent conditions improve. It just happens that forming memories is very reliant on good conditions.</p></div>		</li>
