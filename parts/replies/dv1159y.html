			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;R-process only occurs in core-collapse supernova&quot; is a bit outdated. The <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101" target="_blank">recent double neutron star merger</a> showed evidence of r-process elements being formed in large enough amounts to explain <em>all</em> r-process production, while simulations of core-collapse supernovae have had difficulties in making r-process elements (which could still be due to limitations of the simulations). It's likely some combination of NS-NS mergers and core-collapse supernovae, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the interesting thing is in the past ten years ago as simulations have gotten bigger, it's become clear that neutron star mergers likely produce more gold than supernovae.  I attended a colloquium and the expert said it would be akin to if a galaxy was a cookie, neutron stars produce chocolate chip sized dollops of gold, and supernovae contribute the equivalent of some powdered sugar on top of the cookie.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is it was only one event, but the LIGO NS-NS merger does support these relative abundances.  Obviously, no one wants to infer too much from just one data point though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's a little early to say that with the rate of NS-NS mergers poorly constrained. Until we get a proper rate for how common they are,  it's hard to say. they are probably not all that common because the ringdown time is really long for a separation at which two neutron stars are able to form without blowing the other up.</p>
<p>so these likely contribute but it's more likely to be a combination of various phenomena.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that both of these processes require more energy than they release. Stars are an equilibrium between gravity compressing matter, and fusion explosion pushing it apart. This equilibrium requires surplus energy. All elements after iron require more energy to fuse than they give up, so no surplus (endothermic). Without the surplus the star begins to collapse.</p>
<p>The collapse releases truly huge amounts of gravitational potential energy, Some of this energy ends up feeding the endothermic fusion reactions of heavier nuclei, such as uranium.</p>
<p>I think it is kind of cool that the energy from our nuclear weapons comes directly from the thing that killed a stars. Cthulhu would approve.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Couldn't you say the same for iron or even carbon or oxygen? I'm admittedly not well studied in, well, anything. But my understanding is that regular stars during their normal day to day lives don't fuse anything beyond helium until they begin their death process which takes millions of years but that's nothing compared to the life of a star.</p></div>		</li>

<p>yah we are made of star stuff. But I find the idea that we are using energy from a dying star to kill people, poetic. The last time that energy was free it was killing a star. Thats some dark magic fuckery.</p>

<p>99% true, there will always be some small amount of heavier side reactions. But for the most part it is just hydrogen </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a silly question, but how do elements before iron form? If they fuse in the star one cycle after another until iron is reached, isn't there supposed to be only iron in the end?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a good question. Stars start out almost %100 hydrogen. At that point they have ample energy from fusion to resist the pull of gravity. As the ratio of hydrogen to heavy elements decreases, so does the energy from fusion. The star starts to compress, heating up allowing the heavier elements to start fusing. But they are still mostly hydrogen. Even very old stars that are producing iron, are mostly hydrogen. But that iron eats up energy triggering the star to go nova.</p>
<p>when a star burns heavy elements they still have the lighter ones around, They don't wait for lighter ones to run out.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an addendum to this, the belief that heavier elements do not form during the life of a star is essentially correct. While in the s-process fusion of heavier elements does occur (very slowly and very infrequently), the r-process (that which creates the majority of heavier elements we see today) is accompanied by the “death” of the star, i.e. the collapse of a star into a supernova.</p>
<p>In essence, we are made not only of star-stuff, but of the corpses of stars. Neato! You’re a star zombie!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iron or nickel does not liberate energy.  You can't fuse the heavier elements for very long and maintain stellar cohesion.  Once a star stats fusing iron or nickel, it has hours to weeks left before collapse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even diminishing returns, energy INPUT is required for fusion beyond 56Fe.  They can fuse in theory but will sap energy from the star.  Rather s-process targets just sit around in the star, accumulating in the core.  There are a lot of free neutrons in the fusion layers above, the core can just randomly absorb one.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just diminishing returns, it's negative returns.  Fusing protons up until Iron results in very slightly lower resultant mass, the difference being free energy, but fusing Iron actually requires an input of energy (it does release some, but the energy required to fuse them is greater).  That's why the collapse happens so quickly and the star has only a few moments to live after it starts producing Iron.  The release of energy that has been preventing the collapse of the star is not only slowed, it's to some degree halted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is thought that the stellar nebula nursery from which the Earth and its sister stars were born included material from several other dead stars.  </p>
<p>Fir example, the Orion nebula contains gas and dust from supernovae and other sources, and that gas and dust has (in places) formed more dense pockets within the nebula that may someday become other solar systems, like this article and image:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the difference between s and r-process capture is basically whether or not the nuclei has time to decay before it captures another neutron. With that in mind, it's a matter of statistics and probabilities (which is basically true of all reactions, but that's besides the point I'm trying to make). If the conditions are ripe for r-process to occur (lots of free neutrons going very fast in high concentrations with these nuclei), those conditions mean the s-process is extremely unlikely to occur: </p>
<p>If the average time for capture is greater than the average time for decay, we expect r-process. If the opposite is true, s-process. It's a little more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it. Bear in mind the numbers associated with this are typically somewhere around 100 captures per second for r-process, and a 1 capture every few decades for s-process, so for the two to occur &quot;simultaneously&quot; (if it even could) would require basically perfect conditions for a very specific element chain, which wouldn't exist for very long.</p></div>		</li>
