			<div class="markdown"><p>Where to get your best return on marketing dollars changes over time. At the beginning, mass advertising and promotion to build brand awareness are key, but as you develop a brand image, targeted sampling can be more effective. If you are in a niche market, it's different again. </p>
<p>I was data analyst for a promotional products firm. We mailed 1,000's of samples each day of pens, key chains, and pocket calendars, and followed up with telemarketers. If they closed 2% of their accounts each day, they were a star.  So we'd easily spend $200 for each new customer in samples cost alone, but our data showed our customer retention rates were great, and that our referral rate was too, so that each new customer represented multiple sales. The model is still working, AFAIK. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer and should be the top post, companies spend billions on advertising, giving away products is a cheap way to advertise, think game shows, the show doesn't buy the car then give it away, it's product placement, the game show is basically a commercial. Or the Oprah effect, you get a car and you get a car! She didn't buy those cars but it's cheaper for gm or whoever to give her the cars than to run a bunch of commercials. The average production of a commercial and all the agency costs is only 10-12% of the total cost of promotion, so if you spend 120k making a car ad you'll spend 880 paying for ad space. That's a low number, just to make my point. But You could get more views giving the cars away and getting coverage of that giveaway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is the return on investment of advertising so high? </p>
<p>I cannot remember the last time I saw a commercial and was convinced to buy a product. Commercials never tell you actual details about products, they just seem to associate the product with being happy and surrounded by friends.</p>
<p>So I guess I'm asking: who the fuck are these commercials convincing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is convincing you. You're just not consciously aware of it. You're constantly bombarded by advertisements each day that you kind of tune out, but subconsciously, having heard the name of a product before or thinking you can recall it or it seeming familiar makes it much more likely that you'll purchase it when you need something similar. And the more that you purchase something, the more likely you are to keep purchasing it. Especially if you picked up the habit around a major life change, which is when shopping preferences and habits tend to change. You can think ads are corny and you're too smart for them all you want, but they're working on you deep in your subconscious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a legitimate question about the why are the commercials the way they are. America (assuming that's where you are) is very saturated in most markets, everyone already buys shampoo and knows what it does, for example. So the commercials try to associate the product with a feeling, a lifestyle &quot;freshness&quot;. Cars and beverages are very mature in that sense, selling a feeling. If you go to an emerging market like India where conditioner penetration is only a few %, most Indians don't even know the product (nobody yell at me please, I'm just making a point), so the commercial there is slightly different and it does give you details and instructions. </p>
<p>here is a shampoo from US - with J.Lo!

<p>Same shampoo from India -
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbH0hg-d6Oo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbH0hg-d6Oo</a></p>
<p>Can you see the difference, in India she explains, you condition after shampooing and they even have a tag promotion at the end to bundle with shampoo (an already saturated product, with conditioner - a product with low market saturation). </p>
<p>That said, a lot of advertising i s pure branding and awareness. </p>
<p>Do consumers know the product?
Think about insurance, you might not need it now, but someday you buy a home and what will come to the top of your mind? Will it be some insurance company you know because of their advertising? It's likely that you will and to them, it's worth it (check out the spend on google search to get your company at the top of &quot;insurance&quot;) Our parents didn't teach us &quot;what is coke&quot; we know because it's in our face all the time. </p>
<p>In terms of return on ad spend, just to get a number out there. CPG (consumer packaged goods) spend nearly 25% (check out this report) - <a href="http://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/2017/01/24/who-has-the-biggest-marketing-budgets/" target="_blank">http://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/2017/01/24/who-has-the-biggest-marketing-budgets/</a> - it's billions of dollars. Imagine you are the brand manager for the chevy volt and every year you make $100 revenue while your spending is constant, then you put in a 1$ of ad spend and you make 102$, you spend another 1$ giving away a car on Oprah and you make 104$ etc. There's a huge (really big) industry out there, just measuring the effectiveness of this spend and trying to optimize it. That said, there are still shitty commercials that have no effect, but the industry is so big, you can safely assume they are getting returns on that spend. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes to all of this, but I'd like to piggyback one extra point. Companies will also be using a loss-leader pricing strategy, where they take losses on one product to promote sales of another. It's like when Old Navy has their $1 shirt sale. They'll heavily discount products to the point of giving stuff away so that customers come into their store and get their almost free shirt and maybe browse the store. If they can get about a third of customers who buy the $1 shirt to also add a couple pricier shirts to their cart ON is all of a sudden experiencing a jump in sales, and maybe even a spike in profits. </p></div>		</li>
