			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. Not to say the science-based top answer is wrong, but because it directly addresses the active vs. inactive ingredient question.</p>
<p>Because I've often heard that the &quot;active&quot; ingredients do things like supposedly reinforce your tooth enamel and provide the minty flavors, where the alcohol actually kills most of the bacteria despite being &quot;inactive.&quot; </p>
<p>It's an antiseptic, much like how a nurse may use rubbing alcohol to sterilize your skin prior to an injection, and it's what makes the mouthwash sting in your mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coming back to a long past thread, but to throw this out there:</p>
<p>Regardless of the active/inactive ingredient distinction, the alcohol in mouthwash is not effective at killing germs.  Below 50% concentration, ethanol is not effective at killing bacteria.  It may kill some (reduce the bacterial load) but is not the primary killing mechanism in mouthwash.  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/disinfection_sterilization/6_0disinfection.html" target="_blank">This source</a>, although primarily dealing with sterilization (which is not what mouthwash is designed to do), covers the topic nicely.</p>
<p>Rubbing alcohol (which is, of course, typically isopropyl alcohol) has concentrations far in excess of 50%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this might be a correct answer to the question, it does little to help a 5YO do anything other than pose ten more questions. This reads like something off of a chemistry or other technical subreddit, complete with unexplained abbreviations and lots of technical jargon I'm not sure I understand (as an engineer), much less a 5YO. </p></div>		</li>
