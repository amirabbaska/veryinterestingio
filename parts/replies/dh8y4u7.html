			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a second true fact, actually.  During one scene while they're recalculating the explosives required or somesuch, a character says &quot;torque is r cross f&quot;.  This is probably wildly irrelevant to the situation at hand, but the vector formula for torque is, indeed, the cross product of the r and f vectors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, they are trying to create a torque and get the core spinning...  I'd believe that there's somewhere in the calculations that you could actually use it (taking their distance from the center of the Earth as r, and knowing the force of the bomb, figure out how much more torque they'd need).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, they almost managed to reference a real thing there actually. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Draper" target="_blank">John Draper</a> and the Captain Crunch whistles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The phreakers informed Draper that a toy whistle that was, at the time, packaged in boxes of Cap'n Crunch cereal could emit a tone at precisely 2600 hertzâ€”the same frequency that was used by AT&amp;T long lines to indicate that a trunk line was ready and available to route a new call. This would effectively disconnect one end of the trunk, allowing the still connected side to enter an operator mode. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately the parts they got wrong were the type of whistle, the effect of the whistle, they way to use the whistle, the type of phone needed, the type of phone system needed, and the era of the film. Pretty close to accurate by <em>The Core</em> standards though.</p></div>		</li>

Only difference is what evolutionary state is it in?  Have there been mass extinctions like on Earth, or was the moon protected by its planets Gravity?   Could we find advanced fish? Rays? Megaladon Sharks?   I wish I could live long enough to see it explored, but future generations, go out there, and don't stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, extinction events aren't always caused by asteroid/meteor strikes. Actually, many of the extinction events that occurred in earth's history were primarily driven by volcanic activity and changes in climate (which can, of course, be triggered and/or exacerbated by impact events).</p>
<p>With respect to the second part of your question: the short answer is no, we wouldn't find those things. I'm answering that from the perspective of an evolutionary biologist, not a layman. We define those groups according to their evolutionary relationships with other organisms. So even if we did find something that very closely resembled fish, sharks, rays, etc., they wouldn't properly be considered to belong to the same group(s) we find on earth. We'd likely have to call them something else.</p>
<p>However, if you're defining &quot;fish&quot; based purely on form and function (functional morphology) - in other words, it has fins, gills, scales, etc. - then perhaps you could be justified in calling it a &quot;fish.&quot; But that would be a taxonomic can of worms. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a good write up explaining the dynamo effect.  I never really considered that the sun's magnetic field could have triggerred ours to form from 93 million miles away but I cant figure out from reading that article is that if this theory were accurate, how did we end up with only 2 magnetic fields instead of several.</p>
<p>for example, if the molten iron is flowing from the inner core up to the mantle and then cooling and sinking thus creating the circular process needed, then why then doesn't it make several small loops that each create their own magnetic field and the magnetic print of the earth would look more like the petals of a flower instead of two giant semi round orbs.</p>
<p>Sorry if its a dumb question.  I have absolutely zero education outside of my own curiosity and and I am definitely in over my head with this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you're absolutely right, this is what the Earth's field looks like in the core <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Geodynamo_Between_Reversals.gif" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Geodynamo_Between_Reversals.gif</a></p>
<p>The reason we see a roughly dipolar field is that the messier higher multipole fields decay faster with distance, so by the time you reach the Earth's surface most of the non dipole field is gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are thinking in 2D. When you see pictures of magnetic fields it's a cross section of the field. Think of an apple shape, it has an indent at the top and bottom, if you cut it in half it would look (roughly) like what you see in pictures but in 3D space it would be like the whole apple.</p>
<p>EDIT <em> I'm not sure why we don't have the localized &quot;petal&quot; shaped magnetic fields, I would guess that it's because there isn't a solid core in the center of them, it's just all fluid. Or possibly it does create a magnetic field but it's just far weaker than the central one and gets overpowered.</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really sure what you mean by that. Care to explain?</p>
<p>Anyways, I would like to point out (to /u/callmecraycray as well), that the Earth's magnetic field can be <em>approximated</em> as a dipole. To fully describe it, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipole_expansion" target="_blank">multipole expansion</a> is used to develop the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Geomagnetic_Reference_Field" target="_blank">International Geomagnetic Reference Field</a>. Over <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html" target="_blank">here</a>, you can see that the coefficients for the quadrupole moment (g and h with n=2) are roughly one order of magnitude lower than that of the dipole moments (n=1). Because this might throw off compasses or navigational systems based on the magnetic field, this reference field is build into how a compass in your smartphone shows you were north is (for this it has to roughly know where you actually are).</p>
<p>Also @callmecraycray, the outer core of the Earth does not consist of plasma, but rather liquid metal (and, Nickel is also magnetic, but much weaker than Iron). Since this metal is conductive, it upholds the Earth's magnetic dynamo.</p>
