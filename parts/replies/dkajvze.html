			<div class="markdown"><p>u/toddlikesbikes covered it, but I wanted to add a visual for the water side.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qcTJeGc1SA" target="_blank">Here is an example</a> of what hot tapping a water pipeline is like.  These guys are admittedly doing this for speed as it is a competition.  You can see that there is some water loss and it is a messy job, but crews work quickly in the field to minimize the loss and mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great video! Those guys are full-on manual tapping, which is done for these competitions but most of the tapping machines used in construction are electric, so it's a little less labor intensive. Also if you're not fighting the clock, the machines are made so you can complete a tap with no leakage, some of those got pretty messy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The obvious solution to that is you pay for 2 hours minimum. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the price of labor goes way up.\</p>
<p>I'm reminded of the joke about the factory who had a multimillion dollar machine stop working and none of the current engineers could fix it. So they call in a retired engineer who had never failed to identify any problems with their machines. The engineer walked around the machine for a while, made a chalk mark on a small gear and told them to replace that part. A few days later, after the part was replaced and the multimillion dollar machine worked perfectly again, they received a bill for $500,000. They demanded he explain the charges, and he sent them an itemized bill that said &quot;1 chalk mark: $1. Knowing where to put it: $499,999&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use a Mueller B-101 for cast or ductile iron pipe. Here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lavbuBGOQY" target="_blank">instructional</a> that gets a little more in depth on whats happening and how to use it. On asbestos cement pipe we use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4tg4rUuvAU" target="_blank">Mueller D5</a>. The B101 is used for 3/4 and 1 inch service lines and the D5 from 3/4 to 2 inch. For anything over 2 inch we have a machine that's similar to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1mFVQE__-U" target="_blank">Mueller CL12</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the oil industry we also do hot taps on live pipelines and tanks. The procedures are very regulated due to the high risk, and you only do it if no reasonable alternatives are possible (i.e. draining and purging the lines/tanks). The new nozzle is welded while there is flow in the line to manage the product temperature, and the hot tap machine drills through the pipe wall. It's similar to sewers, except if things go wrong you have a huge spill at best, a huge fire at worst.</p></div>		</li>
