<p>It's not just that it was scifi, it's also that the early consumer electronics had extremely long battery life. An old school digital watch will last five years on a single coin cell. A modern Apple watch doesn't last a day. TRS-80 Model 100 could last 20 hours and even a PalmPilot would last for 30 hours, much more than most modern devices.</p>
<p>Switching from reflective b&amp;w LCDs to much bigger color LCDs with a backlight drastically increased the need for energy (GameGear was an early victim of this trend). Increasing the computing power by thousands of times also did it job to reduce battery life drastically. A device like the Kindle can still last for weeks on a tiny battery, but that kind of display technology never quite went mainstream.</p></div>		</li>
