			<div class="markdown"><p>FDR used 3000 and was not a tyrant yet Andrew Jackson used 12 which got him considered a tyrant. Why do you think that is? I think it has to do with Jackson and later presidents normalizing it but that is from biographies of Jackson that I have read and general history rather than in depth study. </p></div>		</li>

<p>FDR was actually pretty tyrannical in his time but that's a topic for another thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trump did his homework before the election and his promises have been very well-founded in Law.  The ban on some Muslim immigration I found particularly sophisticated.  I thought the 1st Amendment would prevent Trump from following through on banning some immigration, but instead, his team went over the relevant documents and his very quick action is indeed quite legal and actionable by the President.  Now, that legal sophistication I did expect, as would anyone who has ever even considered a career in RE, including a Rental Property.   </p>
<p>So Trump says &quot;I'll build a wall&quot;.  Border control is actionable by the President, in fact he's obligated to.  &quot;A ban on Muslim immigration.&quot;  Yep, legal power for that.  </p>
<p>So it's clear the Trump Admin knows how to operate the Executive Branch.  </p>
<p>And our government is <em>very</em> dependent on the Executive branch, which has only grown from the very considerable expansion during the Depression and WWII.  </p>
<p>Trump has vast power under HUD, Education, the EPA, Treasury, State, and Defense.  Those departments directly impact the lives of pretty much every American or anyone who deals with Americans, which is the entire planet.  And they are now under his control.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, Trump can stall plans, reduce enforcement, set priorities, and mandate new ones with everything from simple phone calls and memos to EOs.  </p>
<p>Congress can force him to act, lawsuits can force/reduce action, but the President's power is so vast, and particularly Trump is so hard-working and active, he could just flood even a double 2/3 majority Congress and clear-docket SCOTUS with decisions to the point of irrelevance, imo.  And I think he will do that at some point.  He is a very much more confident and active Administration than Obama's.  </p>
<p>This is the most dramatic first 5 days I can remember from 7 Presidents that I paid attention to.  </p>
<p>I think the proper Scholarly response at this point is:  Wow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Just to clarify because of all the downvotes, I'm European, I have no horse in this race.</p></div>		</li>
