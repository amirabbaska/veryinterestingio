<p><em>&quot;&quot;The C3 pathway has an advantage over the C4 pathway, however, under cooler and wetter condition since then the stomata remain open and there is always sufficient carbon dioxide to combine directly with RuBP and drive the Calvin-Benson cycle. About half as much energy is needed to pump carbon dioxide directly into the Benson-Calvin cycle as is needed to pump it in the roundabout way used in the C4 pathway. Since less energy is expended, each day a C3 plant can use more ATP to synthesize glucose than a C4 plant can under these conditions.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Although C4 photosynthesis is clearly advantageous in hot and dry climates, this is not true in cool and moist ones. This is because C4 photosynthesis is more complex: it has more steps and requires a specialized anatomy. For this reason, unless photorespiration or water loss are significant issues, C3 photosynthesis is more effective. This is why the majority of plants perform C3 photosynthesis.&quot;</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but if the solution is through the C4 route, they &quot;only&quot; have to convince countries with Mediterranean or Desert areas to cooperate, this kind of solution can't be developed exclusively in Northern Hemisphere or in any climate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And C4 thrives in hot environments. If you are from above the transition zone in the US, your grass and plants are generally C3, but not all. For example crabgrass is a C4. The majority of C4 plants cannot survive a winter freeze, thus your crabgrass dies every year and leaves seeds that start to grow in hot weather (the next summmer). If you live south of the transition zone , many C3 plants cannot survive the hot and dry environments. The northern states and southern states have different plants that have adapted to the climate in each zone, and most cannot survive the conditions of the other climate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Those are the main two used by the vast majority of plants. C3 is the most common, and the one that works most like how you were taught in school. C4 is more complicated, and works by trying to prevent oxygen messing up the reaction (about Â¼ of the time in C3 plants, the photosynthesis process accidentally tries to fix O2 rather than C02, which doesn't work and wastes energy).  </p>
<p>The third type is called CAM and is found in desert plants. It uses about 1% of the water used by other types, but grows much slower. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Could CAM photosynthesis be used in crops that are already expected to grow slow, such as some sort of trees? I'm thinking like, an apple tree, engineered to use CAM photosynthesis could grow in the desert, and be used to provide food. The fact that it would take longer to grow up would be mitigated by the fact that apple trees already take years to become productive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of these types of photosynthesis, it's worth noting that plants generally take up more CO2 when there is more in the air. So as the ppm of CO2 has been increasing, the plants have been uptaking more CO2 per plant.</p>
<p>There was a really nice article written in Nature in 2010 about this and one of the conclusions they came to was while the plant uptakes more carbon from CO2 and stored it as sugars, there is generally less nitrogen fixed, which is stored as proteins. So one side effect is that starchy plants like wheat that we rely on do contribute protein to our diets, will contribute less protein in the future.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those FACE experiments are awesome. Finzi et al. 2007 is another good one. They also found that CO2 enrichment increased N productivity despite differences in N uptake response based on whether the site was historically N enriched or not. </p>
<p>That said, the FACE studies do not incorporate effects of climate warming (which goes hand in hand with elevated CO2) Melillo et al. 2011 found that soil warming increased fluxes of N from the soil to plant biomass sufficiently to maintain stoichiometric homeostasis despite increased C storage. </p>
<p>My fucking oral comprehensive exam is a week from today...  I guess I can count this as studying.</p>
<p>EDIT: saw this was ELI5 and not AskScience. Sorry. ELI5: Scientists did some experiments where they built towers around a piece of forest and used them to pump extra CO2 into the forest. These scientists found that plants grown with extra CO2 had more carbon atoms per nitrogen atom in their bodies. </p>
<p>Those scientists didn't simulate the warmer temperatures that extra CO2 in the atmosphere causes though. When other scientists did that by warming the soil with special coils, they found that more nitrogen atoms went from the soil to the trees. So, when you have both extra CO2 and warmer temperatures it should even out and the trees have the same chemical formula. I know that wasn't ELI5, but I did the best I could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As CO2 goes down, and O2 goes up, C3 becomes less efficient and C4 becomes more efficient.  </p>
<p>In truth, historically speaking the earth is currently at one of the lowest levels of CO2 in earth's history- we live in an icehouse world with ice at the poles which is (over the history of the planet) quite rare. However, we're increasing the rate of CO2 increase at a disastrous rate, and humans aren't well suited to a greenhouse world. Climate science is very complicated and not my forte. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's true.  We're also, it is fairly certain, between two Ice Ages.  We've just come out of one.  It is not entirely certain whether the Earth is naturally becoming warmer, or already on the way to becoming Colder.  Therefore, no 'base line' condition, which the Earth 'would be' in the absence of Industrialization, can definitively be made.  We literally don't know whether the Earth should be warming or cooling right now.  We know what the preceding conditions have been with good accuracy, given ice core sampling.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, we're increasing the rate of CO2 increase at a disastrous rate  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not known.  We are increasing the amount of CO2 at a rate higher than what we've observed in the past.  <em>All consequences of this are specualtive</em>.  We <em>do</em> know the Earth has warmed <em>without</em> permanent equilibrium changes as 'promised' by Climate Change alarmists.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>humans aren't well suited to a greenhouse world.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Total speculation, most likely not true.  The amount of fresh water, arable land, and total biome productivity is likely to remain the same.  It <em>may</em> change rapidly and dramatically.  That is also not known.  </p>
<p>Humans are suited to environments from perma-frost to Kalahari desert without any modern technology, at all.  </p>
<hr />
<p>It's strange.  You literally stated the overall, bedrock fact, then immediately leaped to Catastrophe in one sentence, with zero scientific basis for doing so.  And your disclaimer &quot;Not my forte&quot; is bogus: you are exactly as well-versed as the communicators at the IPCC.  They de-emphasize the information you've given, the rational staring-point of understanding Climate, but they <em>do</em> state it.  </p>
<p>You just made a leap of faith, though, for no scientific reason.  </p>
<p>That's why us 'hateful deniers' call the Climate movement a 'Religious Movement'.  It's a leap of faith you made, sir/madam.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It sounds like your saying that if the world found a way to reduce the CO2 output we'd be better than just finding a way to reduce the amount currently present</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course the real issue is sequestering the carbon for an extended period of time. If we use the plants for food, paper, consumables or whatever then the carbon will be released immediately or relatively soon at least.</p>
<p>When we release carbon that has been sequestered for a long period of time (coal, oil, peat and things like that) then the only real solution to the imbalance is the trap carbon for a long period of time (grow and bury trees and such) at a rate offsetting our continued emissions. We'll see how that works out but rate of extraction is likely less important than that we are re-emitting most of it quite quickly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There could be a carbon saving, however, if the plant can displace a more polluting source. The carbon values of NW-European wood or wheat burnt for heat shows a high carbon saving compared to coal or gas for instance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, coal and gas are horrible not just because of the energy to carbon emission rate though but because the carbon they emit would otherwise be sitting in the ground. It's the same reason that volcanic activity is particularly bad^* while forest fires are less so. The trees will grow back at least.</p></div>		</li>
