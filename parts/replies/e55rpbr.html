			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best overview of the algorithm of raytracing. It's worth mentioning that for step 1, the direction that you &quot;shoot&quot; the ray is computed by multiplying the pixel coordinate vector (x, y) with a camera matrix to achieve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Perspective_projection" target="_blank">perspective projection</a>. You're projecting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustum" target="_blank">frustum</a> of 3D space onto a 2D rectangle (the screen). But because your screen is discretized, you know you can just send out one ray per pixel, which is the key optimization of ray tracing (as opposed to other techniques like path tracing or photon mapping that compute in the normal direction of light from source -&gt; sensor).</p></div>		</li>
