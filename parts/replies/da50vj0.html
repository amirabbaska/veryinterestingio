			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting train of thought. I've oft pondered the idea of the multiverse existing within black holes, and white holes functioning as a directional big bang.</p>
<p>I like it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of this: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulrodgers/2014/08/08/what-if-the-big-bang-was-a-4d-black-hole-instead/#41c9295a7636" target="_blank">http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulrodgers/2014/08/08/what-if-the-big-bang-was-a-4d-black-hole-instead/#41c9295a7636</a></p>
<p>It basically says that our entire universe exists in the event horizon of a 4D black hole.  (Having trouble envisioning it? Imagine a koosh ball of a black hole.)</p>
<p>The part that stuck out to me was the forced perspective from inside/outside a black hole.  For instance, in a 3D model, an object falling into a black hole would flatten, and appear to freeze in time if viewed from outside.  (Poor layman description, sorry. More on the phenomena <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/amp.livescience.com/19683-happen-fall-black-hole.html?client=safari" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>
<p>Obviously we will never know, but it could possibly explain the presence of mega-structures in the early universe, and the discrepancy of a big bang singularity event horizon.  Sort of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did the math myself, but it was a while ago.  Let's see.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe" target="_blank">source</a>, we have ~10^56 g and ~10^27 m.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius" target="_blank">Schwarzchild Radius</a> is calculated as 2GM/c^2... which actually comes out to 2x10^40 m, much larger than the 10^27.  Hurm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. Yeah those where my findings as well. The rs would be vastly bigger.     </p>
<p>Anyhow I think this isn't really that good of an approach either as we are playing around with estimated numbers for the observable universe. I would guess the universe as a whole would need to be considered when applying this theory. So we would have more mass to work with but also something that is for all we know infinite.</p></div>		</li>
