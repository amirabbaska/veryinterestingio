			<div class="markdown"><p>They're <em>nearly</em> massless, and they <em>usually</em> pass right by other matter.  But sometimes, every once in a while, one hits a regular atom head-on.  It's a teeny tiny little event, but it does happen.</p>
<p>So we've got huge detector arrays that we build way underground to buffer it from other interference, and we wait and observe those rare, little events.  We've also seen reactions caused by them in bubble chambers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also &quot;know&quot; they exist because we make predictions, mathematical models of nuclear reactions, and we see that the mass and energy is conserved. So we can tell a piece of the energy was emitted as a gamma ray, and a piece of the mass is missing, so that must mean that mass is from the emitted neutrino.</p>
<p>Basically, if the math works out, we can assume that our model is probably correct, that is, until somebody else comes around with a different model explaining the missing mass or energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We guessed that they exist from both theoretical particle physics models.
We confirmed they exist by creating detection experiments and comparing actual detection rates to those directly inferred from the models mentioned previously. If they match, we pretty much know we're right.</p>
<p>One detevtion experiment involves giant chambers deep underground (to avoud interference), which are filled with heavy water (D2O instead of H2O, where D is deuterium, a Hydrogen isotope with a neutron alongside the usual proton) to increase the density of material the neutrinos are passing through. The chamber walls are covered with photomultiplier tubes and very sensitive light sensors.
The idea is that when a neutrino does eventually interact with a nucleus, a photon will be emitted. Detecting a single photon isn't always easy, which is why we use photomultiplier tubes, which essentially require 1 photon striking them to trigger the release of a cascade of photons, which is much more detectable.
Anyway, we've created these experiments, and the observations agree with the theory. That's how we know neutrinos exist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think others have answered this sort of thing already, but they are a part of many nuclear reactions in the universe.  The ones that primarily shower us constantly are generated by the reactions that power the Sun.  Supernovae give off more energy in neutrinos than photons: when we observe one, we're only seeing a minority of its power.  In some conditions, neutrinos change their type spontaneously (&quot;neutrino oscillation&quot;).  They're cah-razy.</p></div>		</li>
