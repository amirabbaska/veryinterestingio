			<div class="markdown"><p>As a sidenote, this is exactly why we typically refer to Egyptian words by their triconsonant root where possible, because written Semitic languages give us very little information by way of vowels. Hence, the ancient Egyptian autonym is typically rendered as &quot;km.t&quot; instead of trying to approximate what the vowels were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't remember whom, but one Egyptologist was asked if what we think is the Egyptian language would have been understood by one of the ancients, and he said &quot;Yes, but they would tell me that they have never heard such a strange accent before.&quot; Wish I remembered the refrence, google is no help.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it's as modern English is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language" target="_blank">Proto-Indo-European.</a> The length of the gap between Coptic and Ancient Egyptian is more than an order of magnitude larger than that between modern English and Old English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The length of the gap in time doesn't tell you how much a language has changed. Some languages change rapidly, some more slowly.  Egypt was a pretty geographically isolated place compared to the Caspian steppes.</p>
<p>Coptic is similar enough to ancient Egyptian that it was used to decode the Rosetta stone.  It was necessary to decode the stone actually.</p>
<p>Ancient Egyptian wad spoken past the tolemaic period, so you're only looking at 1700 years.  I think the last written herioglyphs we have are 4th century AD. </p>
<p>It never went away. It changed into Coptic.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>English is actually an abberation in how fast it has changed. Latin has done so much less.</p>
<p>Ancient/demotic Egyptian and coptic were similar enough to be deciphered with only a little (several years) effort using the rosetta stone, which allowed the pretty much immediate translation of most scripts from the late middle kingdom on (though with substantial errors)</p>
<p>We have other languages with similar conservation. A Myceanean, a Classical Athenian, and a modern Greek could probably manage to get ideas across at the same rate you might with Chaucer or a Frenchman and an Italian might today. (Fun fact, &quot;Plinth&quot; is one of the few minoan words we can translate, and its still here.)</p></div>		</li>
