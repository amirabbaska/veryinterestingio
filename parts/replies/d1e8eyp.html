			<div class="markdown"><p>The main reason people say the golden ratio is the &quot;most irrational&quot; number is because it's the hardest irrational to approximate with rationals. </p>
<p>But rationals are harder to approximate with (other) rationals than irrationals are, and transcendental numbers, which are intuitively &quot;more irrational&quot; than algebraic numbers, and easier to approximate with rationals. So it makes a lot more sense to say that the golden ratio is the <em>least</em> irrational irrational number. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suppose we approximate a number r by a rational with denominator n. Obviously we can within 1/n of r. So we consider whether we can get within 1/n^2 of r, i.e. |r-m/n|&lt;1/n^(2).</p>
<p>It turns out this is possible; you can find infinitely many fractions m/n such that |r-m/n|&lt;1/n^(2). These fractions are the convergents of the continued fraction expansion for r. </p>
<p>If r is irrational, we can do better, and there are infinitely many m/n such that |r-m/n|&lt;1/sqrt(5)n^(2). The golden ratio is why we need that sqrt(5). If we exclude the golden ratio (and any rational multiple, etc. of it) we can replace sqrt(5) with sqrt(8). This is the sense in which the golden ratio is the hardest irrational to approximate with rationals. The next hardest number to approximate is the &quot;silver mean,&quot; 1+sqrt(2), and if you ignore it you can replace the sqrt(8) with sqrt(221)/5. </p>
<p>In general, the nth hardest number to approximate has continued fraction expansion [n;n,n,n,...]. What about the 0th hardest? The most sensible interpretation of [0;0,0,0,...] is 1, and indeed rational numbers are harder to approximate with other rationals than the golden ratio is (I think the coefficient of 1/n^(2) is 1). </p>
<p>This stuff is pretty interesting, and I don't know that much about it. Here are some helpful links:</p>
