			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the nickel rejects heat, so more heat goes into your cutting tool instead of the workpiece and chips. That means you have to run lower sfm to keep the heat down or you fry your tools. It also contributes to built up edge, which again shortens tool life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because nickel aids in corrosion resistance it just isn't the passive protective kind. If you want corosion resistance, generally,  you start with a chromium alloy steel (stainless) not a nickel steel. Think of it like this. If you paint something it prevents rusting. The passive protective coating caused by chromium is like paint. Adding nickel makes the underlying material resistant as well so its less succeptable to anything that gets through the paint. </p>
<p>Nickel increases strength with less effect on ductility than other elements which allows for a tougher steel. If you're forming silverware for example this is desirable. Also, nickel is what gives it that high shine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s not what we were taught in my education in a hardware store. Not what this article says either: <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/stainless-steel-flatware-quality-1908248" target="_blank">https://www.thespruce.com/stainless-steel-flatware-quality-1908248</a></p>
<p>Nickel prevents corrosion.</p>
<p>You are right the chromium has a high resistance in its own, but the nickel adds more to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied metallurgy in school. Aproximately 20 class hours a week for two years. Nickel aids in corrosion resistance but it is not the primary purpose of adding nickel. Even in flatware. </p></div>		</li>
