			<div class="markdown"><p>All of your calculations assume that the proportions of elements are in the amount of atoms, when actually they are in the amount of mass.</p>
<p>75% of sun mass is hydrogen. Which means about 92% of the atoms are hydrogen.</p>
<p>Similary the proportions of silicon and uranium are also wayy less than what your post suggest.</p>
<p>Tou should have just multiplied solar mass with the 0.07ppb to get total mass of uranium</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an interesting question:  Does the majority of those fission reactions take place in the early life of the star?   </p>
<p>I ask simply guessing that when a molecular cloud starts to condense into something big enough to become a star, the heaviest elements at least start near its center; as they basically define the densest point where the rest of the gases start to collect. </p></div>		</li>
