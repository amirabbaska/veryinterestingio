<p>Are mutations that alter chromosome count thought to be an important source of speciation events?</p>
<p>Also, how do those even happen reproducibly?  Do two individuals have to exhibit the mutation and then wind up finding each other as mates?  Or are there occasional examples of individuals breeding without matching chromosome counts?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Of course some animals with different numbers of chromosomes can cross-breed.</p>
<p>Donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64 chromosomes, and some mules (with donkey fathers) are fertile.</p>
<p>And of course male honebees have a different number of chromosomes as female honeybees.</p>
<p>Even weirder is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_muntjac" target="_blank">this deer, where the male has 7 chromosomes and the female 6</a> </p></div>		</li>
