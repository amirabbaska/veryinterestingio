			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be a red dwarf much like Proxima Centauri.  Its brightness would be magnitude -12, or about the same as the full Moon, but concentrated into a point.  It wouldn't affect the global temperature.</p>
<p>However, seen from its satellites (Io/Europa/Ganymede/Callisto), it would be about as bright as the Sun is from Mercury/Venus/Earth/Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However if it were to become a star, would it start streaming high energy particles like the solar wind? Given the way our magnetic field is distorted by the interplanetary magnetic field created by the sun, Jupiter's wind could send a lot of particles into our atmosphere. We could be seeing some crazy space weather.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, the sun is just a particularly big star from our vantage point ;)</p>
<p>But to actually answer the question: Jupiter is 6 times as far away from us as the sun, which is about 42000 times closer than the nearest star. If we make jupiter a hundred times more massive it will still be ten times smaller than the sun (and being six times as far away means a 36 times smaller amount of light reaches us) so it won't be like having a second sun in the sky.</p>
<p>Still, a quick google search suggests the sun is 400.000 times as bright as the moon, so the jupiter-star will be over a thousand times as bright as the moon (naively assuming 10 times as heavy == 10 times as bright) and clearly visible during the day.</p>
<p>Probably not enough to dramatically influence the earths temperature, but having the night be a thousand times less dark for half the year is pretty much guaranteed to mess up ecosystems all over the planet.</p>
<p>Edit for using wolfram alpha without thinking: Jupiter is of course not a fixed distance from earth, it varies between 4.5 Au and 6.5 Au, so part of the year it will be substantially brighter than I assumed above and part of the year it will be slightly less bright. Also, for the parts that it is further away it will behind the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're assuming Jupiter would have the same absolute brightness as the sun.  At one tenth the mass it will be much dimmer both due to have less material to fuse and lower temperatures and pressures in the core.  </p>

<p>Looks like it would have 1/100 the luminosity as the sun.  I guess ten times brighter than the moon.   Not that big a deal really and most of the light wouldn't be in the visible range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Jupiter is more massive than those three planets combined. Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune together have about 39.8% the mass of Jupiter. </p>
<p>Jupiter would need to be somewhere between 12-65 times as massive to collapse into even the most basic brown dwarf star. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. So first of all to turn it into a star you'd need to add 75-80 more Jupiter masses. If you gather all the other planets in the solar system they're only adding a little more than a <strong>third</strong> of the mass of Jupiter. <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(mercury+mass+%2B+venus+mass+%2B+earth+mass+%2B+mars+mass+%2B+saturn+mass+%2B+neptune+mass\)%2Fjupiter+mass" target="_blank">Ref.</a></p>
<p>In fact take the <strong>entire</strong> solar system (minus the Sun and Jupiter itself) and it's still just one half. <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(solar+system+mass+-+sun+mass+-+jupiter+mass\)%2Fjupiter+mass" target="_blank">Ref.</a></p></div>		</li>
