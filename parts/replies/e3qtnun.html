			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't been officially diagnosed with that specific syndrome, but was told I have hyperelastic joints...or like the ortho said &quot;rubber joints.&quot; Unfortunately, that means I get sprained ankles very easily because if is step on something uneven and my foot starts to roll, these stupid rubber ankles just let the whole thing roll all the way under. There's no tension in those ligaments to provide any resistance.  </p></div>		</li>
