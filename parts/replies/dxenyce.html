			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice answer. To add, your brain has a central 'unit' in the hypothalamus that processes all of the signals that might be required to influence appetite - this approach allows it to balance competing signals (eg, maybe you saw something disgusting but your stomach is empty) and quickly output the appropriate appetite sensation to your consciousness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible for your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems to get out of balance and have one over produce compared to the other. My parasympathetic nervous system is in overdrive, so I am essentially stuck in &quot;rest mode&quot; which makes the muscles in my stomach rarely move, so I do not experience hunger.</p></div>		</li>
