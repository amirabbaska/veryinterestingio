<p>(I assume a state of hibernation lowers the body's food a water needs?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea how long, but I'm pretty certain that the water needs are lower hibernating because the water isn't going away as fast. Less activity means less sweat, no saliva for eating, and less urine (no activity, no metabolic byproducts).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two main reasons.</p>
<p>The first is that <a href="http://www.biochem.arizona.edu/miesfeld/Miesfeld-Fall2008Lecs/Lec34-Fall08/Lec34-F08-Handout.pdf" target="_blank">oxidization of fatty acids</a> (which is where the bear is getting all of its energy), also produces quite a bit of water, in fact you end up with about the same mass of water as the mass of the fat that was metabolised (<a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-81105-0_8" target="_blank">source</a>).  </p>
<p>The second is that they reabsorb water through the walls of their bladder at a rate that matches the excretion of water by their kidneys (no source, sorry I'm lazy).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the bear, but caves are actually not that common.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/denning.htm" target="_blank">Black bears tend to excavate dens, den under windfalls, in hollow trees or caves, and in previously occupied dens (Jonkel 1980). Grizzly bears tend to excavate dens at the base of large trees often on densely vegetated north-facing slopes.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do people study any basic science? We want to understand the mechanisms behind a really interesting physiological phenomenon. That being said, there <em>are</em> some applications for humans... if we can figure out what controls metabolic suppression in hibernators, it's possible we can induce it in non-hibernators. Suppressing tissue metabolic rate could extend the life of organs for transport. And eventually, if we can induce whole-animal metabolic suppression in animals, it's possible we could use it in humans for space travel.  </p>
<p>We're pretty far from these things though, considering we're still not sure what's controlling metabolic suppression at a cellular level. But it's fun to talk about, though I only really bring up space travel when I get the inevitable questions about how my research applies to humans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like every advanced study in any field always comes back to &quot;space travel&quot; and that is awesome. It is one of the few things that the reinforce the quote &quot;a society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in&quot; and how the planet isn't just a bag of greedy dicks</p></div>		</li>
