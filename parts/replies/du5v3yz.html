			<div class="markdown"><p>The water is chemically part of the mineral, not dissolved in the mineral - this is an important difference as you have to do real funky stuff, like partially melt the mineral, to get the water out.</p>
<p>A similar (but different) thing would be to say carbon dioxide is present in calcium hydroxide. In this case the CO2 reacts with CaOH to form CaCO3, from which you can release the CO2 by heating it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2119475-planet-earth-makes-its-own-water-from-scratch-deep-in-the-mantle/" target="_blank">I found this link</a> about one way it is thought water comes from the mantel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simple reaction takes place at about 1400 °C and pressures 20,000 times higher than atmospheric pressure as silica, or silicon dioxide, reacts with liquid hydrogen to form liquid water and silicon hydride.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have nothing against GP's open minded attitude.  But like you, I think it is sensible to, in Carl Sagan's words, not be so open minded that your brain falls out of your ears.  I stand by what I'd mentioned earlier.  And I'd draw a line before silicon-based life and other hypothetical cryptoids with no basis in reality are taken seriously.</p></div>		</li>
