			<div class="markdown"><p>See, I don’t consider movies with blatant gore and jump scares to be true horror. Cause it is silly. I think horror gets that title because it is trying to...I guess shock the viewer? I personally prefer psychological thrillers(even though I call them horror movies, they’re what I feel horror should be)
It’s all about that slow burn creeping atmosphere, the yearning call of the void, the existence of things beyond our comprehension that we are of little consequence to, that feeling like there’s something peeking through your windows, something there but you juuuuust can’t put your finger on it
That’s the kind of movie that I think is really scary. I’m so tired of jumpscares and loud noises that are nothing in film</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel the same way, Freddy Kruger was frightening as a kid....I’m not into any of these newer “horror” films.  Jump scares, gores and ghost.</p>
<p>Only thing that I can think of off the top of my head that made me feel uneasy recently is “coherence”.  Well done beautiful film that made me think.</p>
<p>Same type of film your speaking of, what’s some other titles I need to check out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you haven’t already seen it, I’d recommend Hereditary. It’s very polarizing, lot of people don’t like it, I personally was petrified by the whole thing. </p>
<p>Let’s see, Session 9 is a pretty creepy one, Jacobs Ladder was one I liked too, 1408..Mothman prophesies(a guilty pleasure)
Plus a couple that branch off into thriller/drama territory, like Gone Girl or Seven, those movies are terrifying, scarier than most horror movies lol. Possession is another one. There’s one that came out in the 2000s, it’s not that one. Rather, it’s from the early 80s, has young Sam Neill in it. God, what a strange, disturbing film.
It’s hard to give you a definitive list lol, my tastes vary quite a bit.</p></div>		</li>
