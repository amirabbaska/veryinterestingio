			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how YouTube or ads work. You can monetize videos from the very beginning of your channel if you want. </p>
<p>When you monetize a video, it plays the ads before the video plays. You get money from the ad per video minute that airs on your channel before the viewer either hits skip or finishes the ad. It's something like a fifth of a cent per ten ad views, with an additional tenth of a cent per ad minute watched. No one except YouTube emps know for sure because it's a proprietary system. </p>
<p>Didn't mean to highjack your comment, just figured I would clear that up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since that content was from a copyrighted tv show, the thief who originally posted it to YouTube likely didn’t get paid. Dr Phil and other talk shows are usually quick to have their content removed from unauthorized channels. </p>
<p>It seems to have been relicensed by several content mills now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it baffles me that you think clicking on them is the only way they work.</p>
<p>Advertising is an art form, of creating positive associations in your psyche.   No one thinks &quot;hey that commercial for tide was funny, I'm going to buy tide&quot;   What happens is, is when looking at tide and gain, your mind remembers a positive emotion with the tide, and so the tide &quot;feels&quot; like the right purchase of the two brands.  Careful analysis of products can overcome this positive response mechanism, but literaly no one has time to do a thorough analysis of every product, though many do for the big ones (the corollary is that many go with that initial positive response even on big purchases).</p>
<p>Even FLAVOR has been shown to be influenced by this positive association.   Several cracker, soda, and cereal companies have shown that positive association can make you enjoy a flavor more.</p>
<p>Ads also serve to inform you of a new or obscure product.  </p>
<p>So while many only pay for clickthroughs (which is something no web page creator should accept, pay for impressions or get the fuck out), they don't need clicks to get the effect.   </p>
<p>An example of informing -</p>
<p>Need an email to fax service?  </p>
<p>&quot;Well only one I have ever heard of was that one ad I saw yesterday so let me go check their prices... ah that seems reasonable. I'll pay that and just be done with this annoying task of sending a fax while not at work&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This exactly. Advertisers don’t bombard you with ads all day because they think you’ll actually go to the store 6 times to buy their product every day. They do it so the product will be so ingrained in you that you can’t forget it the next time you <em>do</em> go shopping. </p>
<p>Try this sometime: keep track of all the items your SO buys one month. Now track all the advertising they view in the next month. Finally, track their purchases for another month. You can’t effectively do this to yourself because you’ll make biased decisions, so you need an unsuspecting subject. </p>
<p>Advertising affects our purchase decisions (and political choices) whether we like it or not. Some of us are more aware of ads and can consciously mitigate their effects, but we are <em>all</em> affected subconsciously. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least 30% of the support tickets I respond to aren't even aware of what web browser they are using (which is always Edge).  You may be surprised at how many people do not recognize that Bing =/= Google.  </p>
<p>I am a certified google adwords partner and the typical Click Through Rate on text based search ads is roughly 1%, give or take.  99 out of 100 people ignore them.  You only pay when people click, so ad blockers and the 99% cost nothing.  It's just the 1% of people that click on search results in order starting at the top with the ads that you are trying to capture. </p></div>		</li>
