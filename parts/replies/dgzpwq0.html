			<div class="markdown"><p>One related question I've had for a while. As the cost of fission reactors is largely capital cost driven by security (and paranoia?) and not so much fuel cost, I can imagine the situation being somewhat similar for fusion reactors, as they are undoubtedly going to be fairly complicated and not radiation free. Any thoughts on this? The fact that the fuel is &quot;free&quot; doesn't mean that harvesting the energy is going to be cheap, as has been the case for solar and wind though that seems to be changing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi karith, below is a breakdown by the Nuclear Energy Institute of the various inputs to the overall energy cost of Nuclear Fission reactors. Operating expenses appear to be by far the largest factor in the cost of safely delivering nuclear energy today. Some fundamental differences to consider between Nuclear Fission and Nuclear Fusion operation: </p>
<ul>
<li>In a failure scenario nuclear fusion reactors will not result in a man made disaster but rather will shutdown and stop producing energy.</li>
<li>Fusion Energy fuel and byproducts would not be a national security concern.</li>
<li>Operating expenses for a fusion reactor are currently difficult to predict but overall energy cost will need to be comparable to currently available energy sources to be commercially viable.</li>
</ul>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well certainly one of the main problems with fusion reactors right now is economics. The cost of ITER is blowing up far beyond whats economical for a power plant. Admittedly, ITER was never meant to be a commercial power plant it's more of a scientific exploration device so that's a whole different topic entirely. I don't think I fully understand your question though. Are you saying that fusion reactors will have their own security problems? In that case I disagree. One of the main points about fusion is that it won't create fissile materials and the possibility of catastrophic meltdown (think Chernobyl) is nearly zero . So I think in that regard they won't be nearly as much of an issue. If you're saying the cost of building the reactor will be astronomical and possibly never economical well then you share the woes of my whole field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I was perhaps unclear, but yes, my question was basically whether generating energy through fusion reaction will be economical. On the topic of fusion power, I've often found people discussing it as if one day fusion power will just &quot;show up&quot; and solve all of our energy problems, which I believed (and this thread is confirming) is a misconception. Even though the fuel itself is abundant, harvesting it will always come at a cost, as the reactor will most likely be fairly expensive, right? Thank you for your answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been asking this for a while, and I don't see any good answers to it here.</p>
<p>&quot;Big&quot; fusion will be similar to today's fission plants, as far as I can tell, minus the fuel costs.  Still a big complicated reactor, tons of electronics and high-power electrical and electromagnets and maybe superconductors to control and confine and heat a plasma, or drive lasers to ignite pellets.  You get a thermal flux (neutrons, I think) to drive a big steam plant that drives a generator.  So lots of high pressures and temperatures to control, lots of pumps and turbines and other moving parts.  Still some radiation, not nearly as much as for a fission plant.</p>
<p>Fuel cost is about 30% of operating today's fission reactors.  Subtract that, so I estimate cost of energy from fusion will be 70% of today's fission cost.  Renewables are going to pass below that level soon, maybe in the next 5 years.</p>
<p>Now, if we get a breakthrough and someone invents &quot;small&quot; fusion, somehow generating electricity directly from some simple device, no huge control infrastructure, no tokamak or lasers, no steam plant and spinning generator, etc, that would be a different story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold fusion?</p>
<p>All jokes aside, even though it is not clear what a commercial fusion reactor would look like, isn't a significant portion of the cost of a fission plant today related to severe over-dimensioning/engineering to shrink the probability of a disaster to some tiny number? I imagine that would be different for a fusion plant as it's much less &quot;volatile&quot; in that sense, there is no chance of a chernobyl style of event with those plants? Not to say that the cost of a fusion reactor isn't simply much larger per unit of energy, thus offsetting these savings.. </p>
<p>Renewables though aren't directly comparable as they are stochastic, while a fusion reactor would be more easily controllable and not affected by weather. As the portion of uncontrollable renewable generation increases in power systems, a lot of indirectly related costs go up (reserve power, storage requirements..). In the forseeable future there will always be a need for controllable &quot;base-load&quot; power plants, if fusion can replace coal/gas/fission at a reasonable price point, that would be great?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you mean more abundant than most people who haven't thought about it can imagine.</p>
<p>If you think about it, though, you get a lot more than we have today, but if we use it to fuel growth, the growth doesn't last forever.</p>
<p>I recommend reading the Do The Math blog, especially <a href="https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/07/galactic-scale-energy" target="_blank">this post</a>.</p>
<p>If we don't use it to fuel growth, then we level off, in which case we end up like we are now, with more people, relying on man-made fusion instead of solar power (also fusion).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly not ACTUALLY infinite. Just like the sun's energy isn't actually infinite. It's all a matter of timescale. Ideally we could do some sort of hydrogen farming in space in the far future. But hey man I'm solving one problem at a time here. </p>
<p>I agree that we need to continue to use the energy to have more growth of our energy production capability. I think that with fusion and renewables we could power humanity for the foreseeable future as long as we continue to invest in science and technology to make these technologies better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is the growth that comes with the energy. As the post I linked to points out, all the growth leads to the earth heating up out of thermodynamic considerations.</p>
<p>The solution is to stop growing, which, if we have to do anyway, we might as well do now and not need the fusion.</p>
<p>The time scale you're thinking of is still thousands of years -- less time forward than ancient Egypt was behind us. It's surprisingly short, although not so surprising the more one understands exponentials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the oceans contain enough fuel, to last hundreds of thousands of years, if we advance the tech to fuse heavier elements it's possible we'll have chains of breeder reactors up to iron, pulling more and more off the starting energy out of the fuel, adding every more time. Comets, asteroids, the moon... Even more fuel... Especially if we move past duter-trit fusion.</p>
<p>End game is still solar kugelblitz generators, but then you're talking consuming all of mercury, and producing more energy than we consume now in a decade every minute.</p>
<p>But yes, infinite it isn't, but odds are it'll last us longer than our species will.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right, but energy consumption goes up, and fast. We probably consume more energy in a month then we did in a year, twenty years ago. Everyone's got personal computers, laptops, cell phones, tablets, increasing numbers of electronic gadgets, and then there's the huge server farms built by companies like Amazon, Google and the CIA.</p>
<p>If we have more energy, we will consume it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My back of the jiffy bag calculation gives a limit of 13,000 years for DT fusion, constrained by the attainable lithium in the Earth's crust (which is used to breed tritium). Also this accounts for a population of 11.2 billion (UN estimate by 2100) using the current average western energy consumption per capita. </p>
<p>Then if we add up the tritium in seawater and the fact that we will certainly have mastered DD fusion by then, that probably gives us billions of years. I get the point you are making, our energy use will increase substantially, but fusion has got dis here</p></div>		</li>
