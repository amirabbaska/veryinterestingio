			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/public/0145/P170814/010/GW170814.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> linked above says, in the &quot;Detectors&quot; section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uncertainties in the time stamping
of the data are 10 µs for LIGO and 20 µs for Virgo,
which does not limit the sky localization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this sentence mean that the uncertainties are accounted for in the gained reduction in search area, or that they are irrelevant in that gain? If it is the latter, how come?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure. </p>
<p>Some back of the envelope math would suggest that a 10 µs delay uncertainty amounts to a 3 km light travel distance uncertainty, which should be considered relative to the separation of approximately 3000 km between detectors. I'd consider any error that introduces to be small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the delays between detectors are on the order of 10 ms, so this is really small in the total noise given the errors on all of the parameters. They might take it into account but given the fractional errors, it would be way below the significant digits they report.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned polarization; is there an equivalent of a &quot;redshift&quot; with gravitational waves that could be used to calculate information about the objects involved? Or is that more limited to electromagnetic radiation?</p>
<p>If yes would more detections improve calculation of these parameters?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If LIGO observes a neutron star merger, and then can localize it well, it becomes possible to do electromagnetic followup observations quickly</p>

<p>Very interesting choice for a hypothetical. What do you think the odds are of LIGO detecting a neutron star merger? :)</p>
<p>It should also be noted that within a couple years when LSST and ZTF are online, we can followup the <a href="https://twitter.com/mjuric/status/913101606672932864" target="_blank">entire region</a> of the sky in a few minutes. And they'll have very deep &quot;before&quot; photos of the entire sky to help look for the optical counterparts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the expectation but did not turn out to be true - possible the rumors started because earlier they were looking for optical corroboration, but not finding any in the expected location they ruled out neutron star merger.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is askscience, and in <strong>order</strong> to maintain a degree of <strong>unity</strong> and professionalism we should refrain from speculating.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, <strong>one</strong> could see why this is important.</p>
<p>If <strong>100%</strong> of comments are guessing then no real science gets communicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From one of the PBS YouTube videos, the neutron stars have to be 10 times closer to be detected, because they are fainter, which means you get 1000 times volume than for black hole mergers - assuming everything else is the same ie their distribution in space.  So far all 4 events have been black hole mergers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's in the range of the mass of a typical large star (giants). The largest know star is about 100 solar mass. Of course all those are much less than the mass of a super massive black hole (millions of solar mass). </p></div>		</li>
