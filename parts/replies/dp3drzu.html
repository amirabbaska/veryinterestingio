In the case of CCK, secretion occurs in direct response to fatty acid/amino acid consumption, and CCK has itself been shown to induce satiety by acting on CCK receptors throughout the CNS.</p>
<p>You've hinted at stuff like this, but I just want to make it explicit. I feel like many comments here are focusing way too much on mechanical stretch.</p></div>		</li>
