			<div class="markdown"><p>No! I should rectify my mistake, a black hole the size of a grain of sand would be about the mass of the moon. </p>
<p>This black hole would have a temperature of 1,7 kelvin. So depending on the background radiation, the black hole would shrink/evaporate slow my, very slowly. </p>
<p>Less than say 1/100 or 1/1000th the mass of the moon would give a smaller black hole, those would be 10.000+ kelvin.
A black hole with a radius of a grain of sand would take energy at a rate larger than it would give energy, in the current orbit of the earth. </p>
<p>Maybe in a distant future such a black hole might be hotter than the surrounding space, but that would take a long while </p></div>		</li>
