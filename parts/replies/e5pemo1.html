			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add that the coating also reflects some of the light coming back out</p>
<p>So some of the balls that made it through the holey wall and bounced off the color wall will bounce off the holey wall on the way back and get stuck  on the color wall.</p>
<p>So of the 100 sticky balls thrown at the glossy 10% grey wall:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 (10%) bounce off the holey wall and 90 (90%) go through.</li>
<li>Of the 90 that made it through, 81 (90%) get stuck on the grey wall and 9 (10%) bounce off.</li>
<li>Of the 9 that bounced off, 1 (≈10%) bounces off the inside of the holey wall back to the grey wall, and only the other 8 (≈90%) make it back out to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>This  also works to describe double reflections on windows too. Let’s say you put one holey wall in front of another holey wall (each wall representing one side of the window). If each of these is 10% reflective then we can use the same math as the 10% grey wall with a 10% reflective coating. When you throw 100 sticky balls:</p>
<ul>
<li>81 make it through both holey walls. This is what someone on the other side of the window sees.</li>
<li>10 bounce off the first wall back to you: that is your first reflection. </li>
<li>8  of them bounce off the second wall and pass back through the first. This is your second reflection. </li>
<li>the last ball bounces around between the wall and and either tumbles out one of the sides or gets stuck between the walls, but you don’t really notice because it is only one ball.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t usually notice the double reflection Because they mostly overlap with one another. But if you look at an sideways angle to the window you’ll see them start to separate <a href="https://i.imgur.com/z08faQd.jpg" target="_blank">like this double reflection of square lights on my safety glasses</a></p></div>		</li>
