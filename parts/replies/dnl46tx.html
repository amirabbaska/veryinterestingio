			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked two LIGO people here. The answer is almost certainly no. GEO600 was running in parallel with Advanced LIGO but obviously with some different off times. They're not positive if it was running but it would be too embedded in the noise. Which also makes sense with even how &quot;low&quot; of a significance that VIRGO had.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geo600.org/1240621/standard_sans_both-1397139995.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a sensitivity curve which is a bit old but you can see that it's not sensitive at the frequencies of this merger (peak was &lt;~ 200 Hz) and strain amplitudes of 5e-22. Will be useful for lower-mass mergers with higher frequencies though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes the most sense. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P170814/public/main" target="_blank">Fig. 1,</a> VIRGO barely just resolves the chirp, and it's not the most crisp inspiral either. Going off your sensitivity curve, it looks like this signal is very close to the GEO600's threshold.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also pretty sure it didn't detect anything, because I haven't talked to a single GEO600 person who has talked about it at all, and I see them regularly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as part of the LIGO Collaboration they were not supposed to talk.</p>
<p>But indeed, for this event GEOâ€‰600 was clearly not sensitive enough in the relevant frequency regime to measure anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if they took the data from the seconds surrounding each of the four known GW events, and averaged them all together appropriately, if they'd get a little blip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but given that there are only four events, that's a ~2 improvement in the S/N, which I'd doubt is sufficient enough yet, especially since most were these shorter-duration bursts.</p></div>		</li>
