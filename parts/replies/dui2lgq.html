			<div class="markdown"><p>Among other things, soap operas are shot at 60fps, so they have that &quot;stage&quot; feeling to them.  I think they also use flatter lighting and usually static camera placement.  All so it feels more like a play.</p>
<p>Edit:read the replies, apparently they are not shot at 60fps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, I work for two separate shows. One airs every weekday so we shoot two episodes a day about 3 weeks in advance and then the other airs once a week and is shot throughout the week to air the following week as it's a Canadian current affairs comedy show.</p>
<p>The show that runs daily is a much more rushed set, although it's a lifestyle talk show so the set itself doesn't change too much. But changes are rarely made between shots or segments.</p>
<p>The current affairs show, has full days worth of film production for a 5 min skit. Most of the day is actually adjusting lighting. It can seem like the slightest, most insignificant change but there's people in charge of watching for that and they know what they're doing.</p>
<p>I'm sure you meant more of the type of single camera production shows like dramas and regular scripted tv shows, but I do have some experience to share so I'll just tag along to your comment because I 100% agree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soap operas are shot in 60i. But 60i is just a different way to say 30 in this case.</p>
<p>59.94fps (60i) is equivalent to 29.97fps. When involving the i in framerates they can get confusing when compared to their simple p counterparts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks closer to a real life life experience or theatre/live performance if the frame rate is higher. What I think is weirder is movies and everything else not moving to 60 fps too, it feels so much better, at least to someone like me who has grown up watching novelas (&quot;soap operas&quot;).</p></div>		</li>
