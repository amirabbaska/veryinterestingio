<p>NURBS is used in 3D programs to create almost infinite complexity circles and rounded objects. NURBS is really more of a math formula and has uses in manufacturing. NURBS however, cannot &quot;yet&quot; be rendered by modern day video cards. So in some applications people will model in NURBS (Rarely, mostly if you really need to and used more in 3D animation), and convert it to Polygons.</p>
<p>So it's not that we can't make almost infinitely precise circle (PI to the whatever power). It's really that video cards aren't really made for that. Indeed on the face of it, think about the math involved in calculating something to that degree (Kind of pointless if people can hardly if at all notice).</p></div>		</li>
