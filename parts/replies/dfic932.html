<p>programming is used to express behavior. Programmers are forced to produce lines that express instructions that cannot be interpreted any other way. </p>

<p>When I first started programming, I read a description of the programming mindset that has stuck with me for 20 years.</p>
<p>Most people say go to the store and buy some milk.</p>
<p>A programmer says:</p>
<p>1) Get your keys</p>
<p>2) Open the front door</p>
<p>3) Leave the house</p>
<p>4) Close the door</p>
<p>5) Walk to the car</p>
<p>6) Open the car door</p>
<p>7) Get in the car....</p>
<p>...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The description that stuck with me was &quot;The computer can only do what you tell it to do.&quot;</p>
<p>This is especially tricky when you told it what you <em>thought</em> you wanted it to do...until you realized some important step.  Like, close the door...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here essential to say what you said about unambiguous clarity.  I'm not a professional developer, I'm just a researcher that uses software to do my research, but I do write a lot of code and refine other people's code.  I can usually explain to a human in English in about 30 minutes or so all the relevant details of my algorithm, even though it takes many weeks of trial and error and many thousands of lines of code to explain to a computer how to do it correctly under any condition.  &quot;Good programmers&quot; know how to explain to the computer all the details that my colleagues' brains do naturally without me having to explain it.</p></div>		</li>
