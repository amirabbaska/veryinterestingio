			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, we can even <em>kind of</em> see these orbitals experimentally. Using techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscopy" target="_blank">scanning tunneling microscopy</a> (STM) we can directly trace out certain orbitals. For a very nice example, look at <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KVVaj50.jpg" target="_blank">these STM mappings of the orbitals in penacene</a>. In that diagram HOMO and LUMO stand for the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way STM works is that you <a href="http://i.imgur.com/o0wYFZV.gif" target="_blank">put a tip close to a surface and you apply a voltage causing electrons to flow across the gap</a>. However, the direction of the tunneling current you get will depend on the applied voltage, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lX9qFP5.jpg" target="_blank">as shown here</a>. In other words in one mode you are sucking electrons out of the material (which allows you to probe the HOMO) while in the other mode you are injecting electrons into the sample, which allows you to get the LUMO. </p></div>		</li>

<p>you're not &quot;looking at snapshots&quot; but time-averaged and maybe molecule-averaged views. You're not seeing some instantaneous snapshot at some infinitesimal interval of time, in other words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd argue that your distinction is relatively meaningless, since delta-t * delta-x = Planck's constant divided by pi/2 (or some constant like that). </p>
<p>IOW, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in the electron's position (where in the picture it's blurry image is) and the uncertainty in the electron's measurement time (how long the &quot;shutter&quot; is open) is a constant.</p>
<p>If you take a longer shot, you get a very accurate picture... of an electron that has made several million orbits of the neucleus.</p>
<p>If you take a superduperfast shot, you get a very fuzzy picture of the electron, spread out all over all its possible locations.</p>
<p>So, either way: the picture is fuzzy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less, if you prepare identical atoms and measure them, but if you try to measure the same atom over and over you're going to be kicking it around so much that you're missing almost everything that's happening.</p>
<p>If you design your experiment to test whether the electron is in a state with the same position <em>distribution</em> as that cloud, instead of testing its position, then you will always get the 'yes, it's in one of those states' answer and there won't be substantial quiver in that result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you measure the position, sure. But then you completely change the state of the electron; it's no longer in an orbital (energy eigenstate). So you can't make successive measurements, you'll have to prepare a bunch of atoms all in the same energy eigenstate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For all the complaints about our current educational system, back in my high school days ('90s), orbitals was mid-high level college material. Quantum Mechanics wasn't even whispered in high school. If that's actually what current high school science texts look like now, then bravo on our current educational standards!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. Teach that something is our current best guess and may very well be overturned. Also emphasize that the teacher's understanding is limited and thus the information might not be explained as well as could be possible. Emphasize openness to new information. Don't hide information from learners because the teacher might not be able to do something absolutely perfectly--but don't state that your view is the whole truth, only one interpretation of the truth, and that the most important aspect of learning something is to be open to accepting new information that counters one's current view. Teach students to strive to be proven wrong, and you will never get a person who is hindered by too much information.</p></div>		</li>
