			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to hijack the topic but are those ethical considerations and respect for chimps' minds you mentioned the norm or are you personally a proponent? I'm a complete ingoramus on this topic so your casual mention of this sounded very interesting to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Primate cognition was actually something of my focus. </p>
<p>Absolutely. I think chimps are able to self-identify, express their wants and desires (and act on them with autonomy), can share and distribute cultural behavior, and solve complex problems. Some can even be taught sign language (this was actually the purpose of the aforementioned Nim Chimpsky's involvement in Project Nim - the working theory was that 'humanizing' of non-human primates could eventually lead to the ability to develop human language - it had mixed results).</p>
<p>I absolutely see primates as mindful creatures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>although taught sign language they were never found to offer conversation, or do anything other than ask for things, correct? More so showing manipulation</p>
<p>Nim didn't have as much mixed results as it had disastrous results and he had to be relegated to a sanctuary because like virtually all chimps, once he became stronger and realized he could overpower his owners he did and became unmanageable. He attacked multiple people becoming dangerous. Frequently attacking several of the people that cared for him and they became afraid.</p>
<p>the main things that 'experiment' achieved other than the founder young girlfriends, was he was wrong, and admitted it later. </p>
<p>Nim was the result of a narcissist man that caused immeasurable grief and when he ended the 'experiment' he sent this poor chimp to a medical testing facility, thankfully being rescued later but not before destroying Nim's life</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1977, Nim attacked one of the people taking care of him, and the experiment ended. At that point, researchers said he knew more than 125 ASL signs â€” but no one knew quite what to do with Nim. He was sent to a medical research facility, where he lived in a cage with other chimps for the first time in his life, before being rescued and sent to an animal sanctuary. He died in 2000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He died miserable, depressed and alone</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say they are pretty common amongst primate researchers. Maybe not the world community or even the scientific community, but definitely amongst those that would have the expertise to run such a study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking that too. How is it less ethical to give an infant, orphaned chimp to an adult bonobo than it is to give it to another adult chimp. Surely that adult chimp is just as likely to kill it.</p>
<p>Also I was really thrown off by Nim Chimpsky and thought the OP was making stuff up. Looked it up and it's a chimp studied in extensive language acquisition, heh who knew?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just some clarification for anyone else who wasn't familiar with &quot;Moe and the Davis family&quot;:</p>
<p>The vagueness of the comment here and even my initial googling had me under the impression that this was an instance in which a family tried to raise a chimp and ended up getting attacked by him.</p>
<p>In fact, the couple raised a chimp from infancy as if he was a person (as much as they could), and for the most part they were actually pretty successful at that. These seem to be the main instances in which Moe ever actually harmed anyone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moe was about thirty then, with broad shoulders, thick arms, and long fangs. A welder who was repairing Moe's cage accidentally left a piece of equipment turned on and gave the chimp an electrical shock, spooking him so intensely that he bolted out of the house. Moe didn't return immediately. The police were called, and they closed the street. By the time the standoff ended, Moe had dented a police car, injured an officer's hand, and scratched an animal-control agent.</p>
<p>A year later, on September 2, 1999, a visitor came to meet Moe. The woman was told not to put her hand in his cage, but she did anyway. Moe bit the tip of her finger. Afterward, the Davises argued that Moe mistook her long red-painted fingernails for his favorite candy, licorice. To the city, why Moe bit the woman didn't matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, this prompted the government to take Moe away, and ultimately led to a chain of events that resulted in Mr. Davis being <em>brutally</em> attacked (think Revenant) by 2 <em>unrelated</em> male chimps at a wildlife facility where Moe was being kept. Moe himself went missing a few years later. But it doesn't seem that he ever attacked anyone with any meaningful ferocity.</p>

<p>Chimps and bonobos do have some pretty major cultural differences that likely wouldn't translate well with one-another</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who doesn't know much about either, could you elaborate on the major high level differences?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The classic example of the difference between the two is that chimps solve their problems with violence, but Bonobos solve them with lovemaking, gay, straight, whatever, got a problem? Have a root. </p>
<p>Obviously it's more complicated than that though due to their advanced social structures.</p></div>		</li>
