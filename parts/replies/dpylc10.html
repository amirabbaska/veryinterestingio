			<div class="markdown"><p>That's cool as far as it goes, but... it's edited for public consumption and misses the parts most interesting to pilots, the joins.  Starting with five large and heavy aircraft separated in the sky and joining them in formation is by far the most technically challenging part, and it wasn't shown at all.  The breaks probably look better but are less interesting to a pilot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are much smaller and have less momentum than a Jumbo Jet, which is the #1 reason why.  </p>
<p>Landing/takeoff interference is also about loading one wing, something much more likely on a jet with a 200' wingspan.</p>
<p>An F16, the entire jet goes through the vortex.  A 747, one wing does and that's disaster even for military jets which have landed with with one wing almost totally gone.</p>
<p>Jumbo Jets are designed to be 'foolproof', and easy to fly.  So in addition to large size, that also makes them 'sluggish' compared to a fighter in the same way a Rolls is sluggish compared to a Corvette.  Anyone that's lost traction in a large vehicle knows that once you get them going in a direction... you're basically along for the ride.  The same is true for the famous Mustang at Cars and Coffee, but a trained fighter pilot can get a Mustang through a skid easier than he can recover a Rolls.  </p>
<p>The vortex created by a fighter jet is also much smaller than one created by a 777.</p>

<p>Helicopters flying at NOE (close to the ground) altitudes fully armed have little to no power to spare. Flying through vortices could result easily in overtorquing or simply planting the aircraft in the ground. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I always thought this was impossible, since helicopters are so ugly that the ground actively repels them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true. </p>
<p>The original question was about military aircraft. Not every military plane is a fighter. For example, I was an Air Traffic Controller for several years at a base where KC-10s, C-5s, and C-17s could/would operate in formation under MAARSA. All of the planes I mentioned are much larger than the 737 you mentioned. </p></div>		</li>
