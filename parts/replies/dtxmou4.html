			<div class="markdown"><p>The TRPA1 receptor for CO2, mustard oil and wasabi also is sensitive to noxious cold temperatures. So I would think it would add to the intensity of the ‘cold burn’ sensation.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am shocked and disgusted by the apparent pH of soda. That is disturbingly low. Also gasses dissolve better into liquids at cold temperatures and under pressure so the fresh cold one you cracked open would definitely have more carbonic acid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A while ago a woman claimed to have found a mouse in her Mountain Dew can. Pepsi made her a settlement offer, but I guess she was greedy.</p>
<p>When it got to trial, Pepsi’s lawyers shared the results of an experiment that showed a mouse will totally dissolve in Mountain Dew in less than a month. Her can had been several months old when she claimed to have found this mouse in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The complexity comes in because CO2 doesn't just dissolve into carbonic acid. Carbonic acid can become bicarbonate or carbonate, complicating this system so the intuitive answer isn't always right.</p>
<p>(Tangentially related: the partitioning of dissolved CO2 between H2CO3, HCO3^- , and CO3^(2-) is what allows the oceans to store so much more carbon than the atmosphere.)</p></div>		</li>
