			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy is doing a medical residency though. A lot of doctors in the hospital work 24 hour shifts. This is not uncommon and they often take breaks to rest, shower, etc., but just stay in the vicinity. </p>
<p>Let's not act like he's out there roofing 28 hrs straight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After the army, I took a swing at military contractor work (easy peasy static security). My schedule: company bus ride from 0330-0600, briefing and post swapping from 0600-0700, on duty 0700-1900 (rolling chow relief, usually a 20 minute break), debrief and post swap from 1900-2000, bus ride back to living area from 2000-2230. I hade one uniform so I had to stay up long enough to at least get it in the dryer. In bed at around 2315, back up at 0300. 6 days a week. But I was only paid for 0700-1900, and overtime was +25% after 60 hours. </p>
<p>I didn't hang around long. </p></div>		</li>
