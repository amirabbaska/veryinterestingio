			<p>I would expect to see two &quot;serious&quot; users of this data: Physicists outside of the CMS/ATLAS collaborations, and combined / &quot;old data&quot; studies. For the last one, say if some future Chinese supercollider find a dark matter candidate, they may then want to go back in the LHC data to see if they can find the same thing there.</p>		</li>
