			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked one of my colleges if they had anything because I don't work with Hubble data. So he said he'll send me on some unprocessed images. </p>
<p>I'll post them whenever I get my hands on them but it might be a day or two. Remind me in a pm if I don't get back to you. </p>
<p>For reference I work in gamma-ray astronomy so I don't use Hubble data myself, although I have worked with it in the past. As far as I'm aware its all freely available to download off their website (not sure of the exact address). Although you'll need a program that can read .fits files such as IRAF (or maybe photoshop with certain plugins?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Radiation Therapist myself and haven't really seen cameras replaced so frequently (some vaults have cameras that are at least a decade old but are obviously degraded). I do, however, notice the pixels flash randomly (like a low-level static) when we beam on. Where I currently work we have a camera that monitors the HDR afterloader QA scale and when we run the live source through the screen goes nuts with static.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I turn off the defective pixel mask</p>

<p>Are defective pixels detected and added automatically? Or does some poor soul have to do this by hand? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are detected and added automatically each time an automatic black balance is done. The problem is that the circuit sometimes picks the wrong pixel to mask. It usually picks one to the right of the bad one, but it can be any of the eight adjacent pixels.  Once marked as bad, it will not unmask and pick the correct one. I'm the poor soul who gets to find the incorrectly masked bad ones and mask the real bad guys. There are 3 CCDs in each camera. It takes me a couple of hours if I haven't seen the camera in a year. A 55 inch monitor helps a lot. </p></div>		</li>
