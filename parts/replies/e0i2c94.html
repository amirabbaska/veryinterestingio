			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t because it really doesn’t make sense. Your brain and body communicate with each other and form a single system. Your mind is a manifestation of that system. Your body can’t survive without your brain and your brain can’t survive without your body. It is not the only center of computation in the human being. Mind, brain, and body should not be considered separately but as aspects of a singular system that makes you, you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LSD is weird. It had the opposite effect on me. I never was diagnosed but I definitely had some form of depression/anxiety. A few trips and those feeling were pretty much gone. It’s been ~2 years since I last tripped and I’m still much the same and doing much better in life than back then.</p>
<p>I’ve heard of many with your experience though. I wonder what causes such large variations in its after effects.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I usually tend to complain/whine/have anger management issues, but LSD somehow took that all away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same experience. My depression and anxiety was more based on my situation though, and my own bad habits and mindset. When I did lsd it became really obvious to me what I was doing that caused me to have those issues, and it was easy to just stop doing those things. I was really OCD, and I was just kind of like, I can just stop caring about that stuff because it doesnt matter. It might be different for someone who truly has a healthy lifestyle and mindset, but has issues regardless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Psychedelics can have a real worse-before-it-gets-better effect with mental illness. I had it happen with my depression - they opened all these closed doors in my brain, so I stopped all these toxic subconscious behaviors - but suddenly I could hear ALL the negative thoughts that had led to those behaviors. It’s what finally drove me to get antidepressants. </p>
<p>It’s a bit like how sometimes starting an acne medication can give you a sudden acne flare-up before it all clears. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This &quot;explanation&quot; is just common sense speculation, and even at a coarse-grained level, &quot;it throws a wrench in there and some people can recover&quot; is not an accurate way of describing how a powerful psychoactive like say, lsd, effects people. You're implying that it has the potential to cause a mental disorder in just about everyone, but most people are of sound mind and able to &quot;recover&quot;. I would challenge you to provide some credible sources that back up this perspective.</p>
<p>The reality is that there's tragically little understanding of how some of these substances effect the mind, due to a 40 year moratorium on most academic research. Once that work is done though, we will likely have a better understanding not just of these drugs themselves, but of the pathology behind things like schizophrenia as well.</p>
<p>Right now, the answer is &quot;nobody knows&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know very little about the brain.  However, the top explanation is not only &quot;common sense speculation.&quot;<br />
It was relatively recently that we learned that brains, in laymen's terms, do &quot;trim&quot; themselves.  Why would that be common sense?  Call me a neuro nerd, but that's absolutely spectacular.</p>
<p>It appears some disorders are caused by too much of this, or doing it wrong.  That's also incredible.  Until very recently, we thought new brain cells couldn't be formed in adulthood.  Now we know they can! </p>
<p>What the top poster is saying is a very ELI5 explanation of what we do understand, even though that is very limited.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve only recently understood effect/affect better, but wouldn’t both ‘affect’ people? That is, if you’re referring to intercourse and not gender. Rule of thumb I heard was that people are usually affected by things (emotional/abstract), whereas non living things are effected (physical/observable). </p></div>		</li>
