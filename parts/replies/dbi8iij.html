			<div class="markdown"><p>I went through this recently with a friend. It is kind of crazy how dismissive the doctors and nurses can be. I'm like, this guy's dosed on fentanyl. Even if he weren't in a coma it would be really difficult for him to communicate and respond to stimuli. So if he is going to come out of the coma, his reactions are going to be really subtle. I get that they don't want to raise false hopes, but I feel like there's no need to be actively discouraging either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was briefly in a coma, only a week, but it's definitely not like the movies. I had Onset Cardiomyopathy, basically a heart attack. I remember coming to in the hospital, but it was like a awful dream sequence, that lasted 3-4 days. I could hear some things, and see some things, but I wasn't totally coherent. And the hallucinations, fuck, I wouldn't wish that shit on anyone, when your brain lacks oxygen for a prolonged amount of time it is not fun. I remember I thought my IV/BP/HR monitor was a robot, like as real as you can get robot. I remember when I was first able to actually speak, after two days of just &quot;uh&quot; noises, I told the night shift nurse thank you for brushing my teeth. That was so surreal, laying there, being semi conscious, not really able to communicate, having nurses brush my teeth and check my catheter, roll me around looking for bed sores. But you can't communicate. I feel awfully bad for people who've had it worse. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was put into a coma as well. I believe this was after i woke up as opposed to before I was out under, but I was having hallucinations/dreams that I was always part of some sort of machine. I had tubes coming from me and my &quot;job&quot; was to play music. In reality they had put the TV on a music station for simulation and well, I was hooked up to a lot of things. I think it took me two weeks to have normal thought patterns (I thought my parents were imposters for at least a week), I thought I was kidnapped. That I couldn't sit up well because someone messed with the gravity. I think it took three weeks after coming out of it to be able to even get my arms to move to use my call button. It was like there was a disconnect between my brain and body. Speaking happened not long after waking up but it wasn't really anything deep. Just like &quot;water.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They definitely should not be discouraging, but realistic. Sometimes realism can come off as very dismissive, and I'm sorru that they didnt take the time to be clear and empathetic. </p>
<p>People who require ventilators are purposely kept somewhat &quot;comatose&quot; as it is pretty uncomfortable to have a tube shoved down your trachea and a machine inflating and deflating your lungs. Often they will drop the sedatives for a brief period to check for alertness and responses, which as you said will still be pretty subtle and sluggish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My boyfriend had a minor sinus surgery last year (turbinate reduction, to increase airflow through the nose). It was supposed to be a fairly straightforward operation, with a short period of being under anesthesia and ventilation for maybe half an hour. Unfortunately, he was found to have a rare lack of a certain enzyme (I forget the name at the moment) that is key to breaking down the medication they use for muscle paralysis. As a result, he came out of unconciousness at the doctor's prompting, but was unable to move at all, at first. They were able to discern that he was concious, but still paralyzed, and were at a loss as to what was going on, until the anesthesiologist recalled one other patient he'd run across years ago who'd had a similar reaction. It was pretty scary for my boyfriend, who described the ventilator as seemingly never giving him enough air. They had to wait for his body to work through the paralytic on its own, which took several hours. They kept putting him under sedation, to lessen the psychological stress while we waited. Scary chit. In reading up on his enzyme deficiency, it's lucky he's a straight-edge type of guy; apparently if he'd ever done coke, he could have immediately overdosed, as the enzyme in question is one that processes the toxins through the body. Without it, it's like having 10x+ the amount you took in your body, not going anywhere. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I doubt it's dismissive, more just habituation. For every time someone said a patient is responding to stimuli and it's true, there are probably tons of times it was just wishful thinking. For you, your entire world was shaken up, for them it was Tuesday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my resident/patients passed away a few months back. 8 of her 13 children were in the room. The nurse came in, listened for breathing, checked pulse, listened for heart beat, nothing. Told the family she was gone. They didn't believe her. Doctor comes in, does all of the above, told the family she was gone, they didn't believe her. Half an hour after the doctor left, one of the adult children comes pelting down the corridor ... &quot;She's breathing!&quot; . Um, no. Your sister is lying on the bed next to your mother ... SHE is breathing. Your mother is not. It took over 4 hours to convince them that the funeral director needed to come and collect their mother's body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother is type 1 and it definitely freaked my mom out as well.  </p>
<p>A couple of years ago I met an elderly professor who was one of the first people to receive insulin.  He was telling me about having to titrate his urine when he was a child to figure out what his blood sugars were.  He must have been in his 70s and still had his eyesight and was in good overall health. </p>
<p>Hope your daughter has the same good fortune and good health! It's pretty amazing what insulin can do :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was indeed very very hard for him. Before he became insulin dependent it was a constant battle to get him to eat right. But he'd go and stash tens of bottles of soda in his car or at his office at the school and consume multiple litres of soda per day.  It's the #1 thing I attribute to his ultimate decline in health and even now I almost manically avoid the stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too, but there are a lot of unknowns here. Like I could totally see this happening if you were on a U500 insulin and have a high carb to unit ratio. (My mom is type 2 and her ratio is something like 1:1.) So for like an average sandwich, about 36 carbs. For me that's only 2 units of U100 insulin, so it wouldn't have that severe an impact, just a low blood sugar down the line, in an hour or so. But with the variables that are possible, if that guy had a ratio similar to mom's the pump would deliver 36 units of insulin,  which would put me in a coma for sure.  Make it a U200 or higher, and it gets even crazier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, I have a bad habit that I don't check my blood sugar at night when I wake up and think it's high. I just give myself a little bit of insulin and go back to sleep. Definitely going to at least check my CGM before doing that from now on. I am really good at waking up when my BS drops but I'm afraid someday that might not happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insulin pump helps a lot on this. I check my blood sugar before going to bed and I tell the answer to the pump which then injects me with just the right amount to lower my sugar without going too low. No guess work and a lot less risk</p></div>		</li>
