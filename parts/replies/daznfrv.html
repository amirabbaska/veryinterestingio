			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy is wrong. When he says &quot;take it out of your estate&quot; he is usually talking about ways to get it out of your probate estate (aka it does not pass under your will) but not your taxable estate. TOD accounts, 401ks, IRAs, and even FLPs are in your taxable estate if you own them.</p>
<p>To answer your questions, there are lots of ways to do this in small amounts. Having life insurance policies owned by irrevocable trusts is a common one for anyone who will pay an estate tax. Putting assets into into an FLP, an LLC, or a Corporation and then transferring small amounts of it is another one. Also, people can choose to make taxable gifts during their life. <del>Gifts are taxed at 15%, estates are taxed at 40%.</del> I can go into this a lot more (I'm an estate planning attorney), but there are many ways to do it in bits and pieces.</p>
<p>Edit: Hawkward, I was wrong too about the gift tax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your information on the gift tax is incorrect. Gifts are non taxable to the recipient and non taxable to the giver as long as it is less than $14,000 to a person per year. If you give more than the $14,000 it goes against your lifetime exclusion which is 5.43 million in 2016. The 5.43 million is what is excluded from your estate before calculating the estate tax. The gift tax is calculated on the current estate tax. There is far more detail to this but this is an ELI5</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/sjets3 Can you source that gifts are taxed at 15%? My understanding was that gift tax rates were the same as estate tax rates. Studying for my CFP and I just want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>POD accounts are not outside your estate. </p>
<p>FLPs (family limited partnerships) main purpose is to allow for discounting of assets which I addressed in a different post in this thread although I was using an LLC as the entity. </p>
<p>Irrevocable trusts MAY be outside your estate (you can fuck this up with bad planning) but revocable trusts are definitely still inside your estate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Number 1-- You are right. I was wrong. </p>
<p>Number 2-- Agreed (especially as to using an LLC in its place), but will add that reducing the value of assets is reducing the value of the estate.  And it can be used more aggressively to transfer ownership of the assets but maintain control of the assets. See here-- <a href="http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1104&context=elders" target="_blank">http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1104&context=elders</a></p>
<p>Number 3-- Same as number 1, I mistakenly included probate simplification strategies within estate tax reduction strategies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first method you outline is entirely incorrect.  A Transfer on Death account only bypasses probate, it does not remove the assets from a person's estate.  Neither does establishing beneficiaries on retirement accounts.  Estate taxes would potentially be due on both if an estate reaches the threshold.</p></div>		</li>
