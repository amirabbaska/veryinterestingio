<p>I grew up with a group that played tribal music and they experienced joy from songs that were in minor keys.</p>
<p>Major keys to them sounded hypnotic and eerie because of the frequency sympathies and harmonics overlapping better.</p>
<p>The dissonance of minor chords was energizing.</p>
<p>A lot of this has to do with expectation: If the audience is aware and attuned to major scales then minor scales will sound &quot;sad&quot; to them. Convert any western nursery rhyme and the note shifts are saddening.</p>
<p>Do the same thing with a culture attuned to minor scales, take one of their happy tunes. The only way to make it sound sad is by tempo and cadence. </p>
<p>Creating a major version of it sounds droning and hypnotic to them, not &quot;happier.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this! Elsewhere in this thread I was just in the middle of arguing the physical basis for overlapping frequencies resulting in harmony, but I hadn't considered the role of expectation.</p>
<p>If you're not accustomed to listening to harmonies then I can see how you might go &quot;where's the conflict?! this story is boring!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Listen to the samples in the study (or read their titles). They're not comparing major and minor. They're comparing consonant and dissonant.</p>
<p>One criticism that I have is that they're also comparing original and modified, and that too has an effect on the affect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the conversation, minor, mathematically speaking, is more dissonant than major. I'm not qualified to speak any further without misspeaking, but the overtone series has a lot to do with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trouble is the math doesn't actually work out that way. The western major scale doesn't actually use intervals with simple ratios. The system that uses the simple ratios is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning" target="_blank">Pythagorean tuning</a>. It works fine for purely diatonic music, but modern western music has an assumption that one key is (roughly, depending on who you ask) as good as another. That doesn't work with Pythagorean tuning. In reality, for there to be 12 keys, you don't get nice ratios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not convinced minor chords are more dissonant than major ones.  Reduced to a sequence of frequency ratios, a major chord is 4:5:6 and a minor chord is 10:12:15.  Both chords use frequency ratios built on prime numbers no greater than 5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Other instances tell of non-westerners who enjoyed the tuning of the orchestra, but felt the actual piece was meaningless noise.</p></div>		</li>
