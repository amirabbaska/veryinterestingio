			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what /u/tethalamin means is that. You are not necessarily making the conscious decisions to do things. Your unconscious mind is. Simple example. Your unconscious mind says you need to breathe, you should breathe in. You don't make that decision consciously, otherwise a lot of the day would be spent consciously breathing. But your conscious brain has veto power. I don't have to breathe right now (and you hold your breath). Eventually, in a normal brain, your unconscious mind, overpowers your conscious mind and makes you breath, but you had that power at the time to say no.</p>
<p>Same for food cravings, thirst, bathroom urges, sexual urges, etc.</p>
<p>You can veto decisions made by your unconscious mind, but you don't necessarily make them in the first place.  </p>
<p>edit: This isn't to say you have no power over your thoughts and actions. The unconscious mind loves habit and repetition and good things. It protects itself as best it can but you can change the way it thinks consciously, through repetition. It's trainable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get your example but how would this translate to day to day emotions like anger and sadness ?
Also how can one train himself to &quot;think consciously&quot; as you describe ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how does one train their unconscious mind to react differently? Say I don't want to feel sad or afraid at certain circumstances.</p>
<p>I suppose that I'm interested in what method has strongest influence over our unconscious and why. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're CEO of a huge company. You're not personally responsible for any actions plumbers you employ take when they're maintaining stuff or whatnot, you're coordinating the entire thing from higher level of abstraction.</p>
<p>It's imo misleading to say you're not on drivers seat. It's not really that different from literal drivers seat: Your car actually does lots of things like regulate amount of gasoline that goes to engine according to your pedal pressing, using many complex systems that you probably don't quite understand, but you're still using the phrase &quot;driver's seat&quot; to refer to being in control of what happens, because ultimately we're the ones deciding where to go and how fast.</p></div>		</li>
