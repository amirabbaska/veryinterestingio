			<div class="markdown"><p>Obligatory &quot;I heard this once&quot; anecdote: A physical therapist I saw last year told me a crazy story about this guy who got bitten by a rattlesnake. About a year after the bite, he was out hiking again and scratched his leg on a stick. He thought he'd been bitten again, and his body reacted as if he had been. He swelled up and everything.     </p>
<p>Summary: brains are weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do as well. Even if I dream about tripping on a crack in the sidewalk, I will get that same stomach-dropping felling. I notice it the most right as I'm about to fall asleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've gotten this in dreams. Often times it's a very long drop, like in a car going very fast down a long, steep hill. It goes on so long that it is too much to cope with and feels like torture. Even though in real life I love roller coasters and fast cars. It's just that in the dream it goes on for far too long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember going to an amusement park, they had a theatre inside a tent. When you went in it was pitch black and a projector screen panoramic in front of you. Everyone was standing up and looking up. They showed a film, first person like your going down a roller coaster. It really felt like you were actually on the roller coaster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe this is correct, this is the same feeling of intense nervousness that comes with forgetting if your door was locked or stove was on or some intense revelation of regret or fear.  It feels like your stomach has dropped.  </p>
<p>I seriously doubt it has to do with organ shifting. Instead its more likely has to do with your stomach lining having a lining of nerons, there is a level of communication between the two not in a nerual way but in a reflex way, similar to how your body makes you throw up or convulse or dryheave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, I definitely don't think it's the physical movement of organs. I'd wager that it's either smooth muscle relaxation due to SNS firing/adrenaline, or the sudden vasoconstriction of the blood vessels to your gut, causing a backup and redirecting it to other places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>entirely anecdotal, but for me those are two very different feelings. the anxiety is a feeling of dropping/just a tightness in the stomach, while 'free fall' is a definite feeling of lifting and then dropping. I can see how one might mix them up, especially if they have anxiety about the rollercoaster or something (might be having the two at once), but they are two different feelings.</p></div>		</li>
