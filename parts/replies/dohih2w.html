			<div class="markdown"><p>An actual eli5 response. It feels like a lot of the time in this sub the OP is asking is asking about complex quantum mechanics and there is no simple way to explain it, or OP asks a really broad/obvious question and  then everyone starts to chime in and you get a slew of unclear/over complicated answers.</p>
<p>Edit: forgot the obvious Wikipedia copy pastes. Wikipedia is not known for being easy to interpret for the average layman never mind a five year old when it comes to complex subjects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I stabbed him for the watch. We literally all said it as we stabbed him in turn. </p>
<p>He didnâ€™t know it was coming though, so I guess that counts. </p></div>		</li>
