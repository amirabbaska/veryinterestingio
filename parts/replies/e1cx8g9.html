			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, NSAIDS can slow healing.</p>
<p>For example, the initial mechanism for repairing a fractured bone is for a hematoma to form at the site of fracture. At it's simplest, this just means a lot of blood and coagulants gather there. After about a week the hematoma transforms into a spongy tissue that is the basis for the repaired bone.</p>
<p>Simply put, taking NSAIDS to reduce swelling or pain results in less blood/swelling/coagulants and so healing can indeed be slower. This can apply to lesser types of trauma as well, but the slowing effect isn't as much there.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, when I broke my humerus, my doctor told me specifically not to take ibuprofen for the pain. (Apparently the narcotic painkillers he then proceeded to prescribe were an acceptable alternative though).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no evidence (that I'm aware of) that this (NSAIDS and wound healing) is actually true (if you know something I don't please post a source). I work in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine and we prescribe them all the time post operatively (as long as there is nothing specific that means we can't). </p>
<p>Furthermore even if there are reasons we might want to think twice we often still at least consider NSAIDS.    </p>
<p>If you have mmobility (due to pain) of both the joint/bone/wound that's affected or you as a whole then:<br />
A) your bone may not heal as it is not allowed to weight bear (which my orthopaedic colleagues tell me is a thing).<br />
B) the likelihood of the muscles that support the limb becoming weak and your overall  recovery slowing is increased.<br />
C) you are at increased risk of DVTs/Chest infections etc. which can be anything to inconvenient to fatal.    </p>
<p>Now not every pain killer will be good for every person and they're none of them without risks; but it has to be stressed that leaving pain untreated also carries risks.</p>
<p>As to NSAIDS specifically they can be an excellent adjunct to a multimodal approach to analgesia and they can be very useful if used properly. I'm surprised your doctor didn't include a <em>short course</em> of them.  At least. </p></div>		</li>

<p>See the last bit of section 1.2. </p>
<p>Section 1.3 appears to describe the process in more detail, but it’s over my head to be honest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all risk versus benefit. If its slight swelling to an injury, then the inflammation may be tolerated for quicker healing time.</p>
<p>But if the swelling is dangerous where is cutting off rhe blood supply to nearby cells, then using an NSAID would be very benefitial despite slower healing time. It also can depend on the level of pain for the patient too, a lot of decisions are made based on risk vs benefits when it comes to medicine. There's no single perfect answer to every problem :( </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep that's why I (dentist) tell my patients after an extraction to avoid ibuprofen and take paracetamol for pain, as the NSAID can delay the healing process</p></div>		</li>
