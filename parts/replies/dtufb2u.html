			<div class="markdown"><p>are you then implying the inner core does not spin around..
because if it does.. then how do you generate..
and if it does not spin around why not?
if it spins slower, why should it??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit of a tough question, honestly, but we know the inner core does rotate... In the opposite direction, because Lenz's Law. But the inner core isn't as important to the whole process as the outer core...well, the cooling off the inner core matters anyway, but it's not about the motion of metal in the core itself, just the motion of metal <em>fueled</em> by the core. It's tough, because it actually relies on extremely complicated and chaotic fluid dynamics, which are hard to model and calculate much less simplify and explain to someone who probably hasn't got a degree in a fluids-heavy field (aerospace here, so molten metal's honestly still a little out of my realm) But that's part of why it works--a symple kinematic dynamo like I think you're picturing would indeed stop itself eventually--the chaotic, flowing one, however, is able to maintain and amplify the starting magnetic field once it's started, even if the initial field is removed. Provided it gets a source of energy to maintain itself, that is.</p>
<p>Part of the way it works is similar to an inductor though, where the magnetic field it generates is capable of influencing the very current that's generating the field... Which is odd in and of itself in a solid linear inductor. In our non-linear fluid inductor, the way the field alters the current feeds back and actually amplifies the field. Inductors resist changes in current by creating a back-emf voltage that resists the change. In a non-linear, fluid dynamo, there's a lot of different &quot;inductors&quot; making up a bigger inductor, and their own resistance to their own changing current can actually create effects that increase the currents around them, which then increase their own currents and so on. This is only possible because there's a constant source of energy coming from the core's cooling.</p>
<p>The individual circulations aren't around the inner core itself per-se, but more rolling &quot;whirlpools&quot; of sorts that are sustained by thermal effects, and then oriented north/south due to the Coriolis effect caused by Earth's rotation. The initial magnetic field is needed to start the feedback loop: once a field exists, the field exerts a force on the current, the current loop generates a changing magnetic and electrical field, and then those fields effect the flow of metal, distorting the fluid's flow and amplifying the initial magnetic field, which further distorts the current and so on. This doesn't continue to grow out of control, however, since it's dictated by the thermal power supply and how much heat is available for an energy source. If the core's makeup were not constantly changing, the field wouldn't be able to sustain itself, but the core is cooling and convecting, allowing iron from the liquid portion to attach and solidify to the inner core, leaving lighter impurities behind because of convection, which ultimately reduces the mass and the density of the outer molten core, making it even easier for the magnetic field to alter its flow. This change involves releasing heat and changing the properties of the fluid, which continues to drive the motion of the fluid, which sustains the generation of the magnetic field, which is why it's not creating energy for free.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this also means if you were to &quot;shut off&quot; the dynamo, the fact that the whole thing is self-inducting means that it will naturally resist any change to the current inside it, returning the energy of the magnetic field into fluid motion to try and keep the current moving. Eventually it would stop without a source of new energy, but it could potentially still generate a magnetic field for thousands of years even if you somehow slowed the whole thing to a stop, just because inductors resist changes in current.</p>
<p>Like I said, electromagnetism is weird. It's definitely possible to understand, but not really intuitive.</p>
<p>Edit: trying to simplify it as much as I can because I know I didn't make it super clear. Most basic level, inductors try to keep current constant by storing the excess energy in a magnetic field. The current of the outer core is constantly trying to increase due to convection, so the &quot;inductor&quot; stores the excess energy in a constant magnetic field. The fluid inductor itself limits the maximum value of the field, and needed a smaller field to start acting like an inductor, but once started, the convection fuels it and keeps the field going.</p></div>		</li>
