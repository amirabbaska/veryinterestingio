			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Having young kids really helps your circadian rhythm. My daughter has woken up between 6-6:30am for the past 3 years and my 9 month old wakes up at 6 as well. I go to bed at 10pm every night because I have no way to ever make up lost asleep so no point in staying up late I'll just pay for it later. So my circadian rhythm is super regular and I'm fully awake and alert in the morning. I used to think I &quot;wasn't a morning person&quot; but now I know it was just bad sleeping habits. </p>
<p>Also, one of the hardest time in my life was the newborn stage for both kids. I get really mentally unstable when I'm severely sleep deprived. Then when they finally do start sleeping longer your brain is still programmed to wake up every 2 hours and it takes weeks to adjust. It's hell. (Worth it!)</p></div>		</li>
