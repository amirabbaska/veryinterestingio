			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're going to make that claim, you really ought to cite meta-analyses as opposed to a single study. Fortunately, what analyses I did find did support this notion, though the effects are small (sleep onset reduced by a few minutes, sleep length increased by a few minutes). Additionally, these results, though interesting, do nothing to explain the mechanisms by which melatonin has these effects, so bear that in mind.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A study also showed that people who live in countries where there is more sunlight sleep better because sunlight helps regulate melatonin. This study was to see the effect on peoples concentration from sleep. People in countries with more sunlight would have less adhd on avarage.</p></div>		</li>
