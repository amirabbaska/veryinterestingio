Also it is still in beta so VERY few publishers have access and I can assure you that the low quality meme publishers that use the moving triangles over still images do not have it.</p>
<p>However you are right, the algorithm pushes video to a ridiculous degree. It also favors instant articles, but video is still favored more than three times as much as IA on my pages. </p></div>		</li>
