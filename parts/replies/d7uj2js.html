<p>When computer hard disk drives were invented, they weren't electronic structures built on powers of two, so the marketing people used the &quot;correct&quot; multiples of 1000 when talking about storage capacity (decimal).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minor nitpick here: Hard drive capacities were advertised in the powers-of-two definition (i.e., 1 MB = 1024 KB = 1,048,576 bytes) until they hit 1 GB, which is when the powers-of-ten definition took over for marketing purposes. The new kibi/mebi/gibi were created after this happened.</p>
<p>In truth, it's always kind of muddy. Memory and storage were in powers of two, but clock speed and data transmission were in powers of ten. There were lawsuits because the operating system said that your brand-new &quot;5 GB&quot; hard drive was actually 4.7 GB. HD manufacturers wound up putting disclaimers on the packaging that 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes and reflected the unformatted capacity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The 1000-vs.-1024 dispute goes back to the 1950s at least.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also SSDs have to account for physical factory defects when the circuit is printed. A defect map might take a peice of silicon made for a 500GB drive and repurpose it to a 240GB drive if a certain percentage of the NAND is rendered inoperable by factory defects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good business practice, really. Instead of setting up two high-standards production lines (expensive), allowing defects to be sold for lower price saves the company money. The same is done with multicore processors, iirc (quad core with two defective cores -&gt; dual core)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was great back when cpu manufacturers only disabled the extra cores via software. You could buy a dual core and have it turn out that you could unlock others and it would run just fine.  Same on gpus. </p>
<p>Then everyone started physically screwing up the disabled cores and whatnot.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this doesn't really happen in SSD manufacturing.</p>
<p>NAND chips are tested pre solder and scrapped if they don't meet spec.</p>
<p>Post solder, of course, testing occurs but unlike the hard disk world, it is very rare to sell &quot;reduced&quot; capacity drives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Manufacturers also have to account for &quot;Cell Death&quot; that results from each cell supporting only a limited number of writes.  Hit the limit, cell dies.  A drive that advertises 128GB likely has a good bit more than that available, but it uses rotation to minimize the number of times a cell is rewritten.</p>
<p>Basically,it spreads the writes across ALL of the cells to prevent premature death of a given cell.  Rewrite a file, and the file is written to different cells.</p></div>		</li>
