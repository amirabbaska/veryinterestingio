			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it more like misidentification.</p>
<p>If you've never seen a real sword, but generally know what it's supposed to look like, you might freak out on a person holding a sword-ish stick.</p>
<p>That's what's happening here.  Antibodies have a general knowledge of what they're supposed to attack to protect the body, so when they see something that looks kinda similar, it goes full force instead of being like, &quot;wait, this doesn't <em>exactly</em> line up with what we're on lookout for... maybe we shouldn't attack.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes beyond antibodies. Some roundworms (parasites) that frequently infect humans (but are no longer found in developed countries) produce interleukins and other peptides that interact directly with the immune system. The &quot;Old Friends Hypothesis&quot; argues that our immune system evolved and developed with the constant &quot;cross-talk&quot; with roundworm immune signaling molecules. When we removed these parasites, it threw the system somewhat out of balance which produces a variety of undesirable immune responses, which manifest as autoimmune diseases in additional to allergies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the fact that today we know about it. Back then there would be contamination somewhere that no body noticed because it was unknown. This ended up in the baby's diet and simply died of unknown cause.</p></div>		</li>
