<p>Do you use blankets? It takes time for your both warmth to heat up the blankets and bed. </p>

<p>This was my initial thought.  But I've noticed it happens even when I'm wearing normal clothing and just fall asleep on a couch.</p>
<p>In fact, that's when it tends to happen most - during spontaneous daytime naps.  I'll wake up and be hot and sweaty.  I was perfectly comfortable in that exact same clothing for hours; I didn't become hot and sweaty until I fell asleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body is relaxing and allowing your vascular system (blood vessels) to open up. This allows more blood flow at the skin level. It's important to note that your perceptions are not the same as reality. Since the vast majority of your temperature sensing nerves are on the surface of your skin, what you normally feel is the surrounding air temperature, not your body temperature. As your circulation increases, the warm blood flowing near your skin floods the nerves with warmth. Think about blushing, and how it makes your face feel hot. Anyway, even though the temperature outside your body hasn't changed, your nerves are <em>perceiving</em> a sensation that is equivalent to the air being hotter. </p></div>		</li>
