<p>A lot of heavy use contemporary batteries (see, e.g., Tesla's) start with the 100% line intentionally set to something like 80% true capacity. This lengthens useful life and allows the cell capacity to shrink much more gradually as you raise that 80% up a bit as 100% gets smaller. </p></div>		</li>
