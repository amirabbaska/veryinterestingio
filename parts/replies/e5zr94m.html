			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been really weird reading this thread because I have all these symptoms without having any spinal cord injury. I do have dysautonomia and small fiber neuropathy but I never realized how similar my problems are to spinal cord injuries! Only difference is I can still feel my painfully hot feet that can't sweat or my icicle feet numb with cold</p></div>		</li>

<p>I <em>wish</em> I had dry feet. It's hard to get used to peeling away your warm damp socks every night or leaving wet foot prints on the floor wherever I go</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Car accident at 16 up in the mountains. Walked away from it but after I laid down in a field I couldnt get back up again. The cord didnt sever but apparently just was destroyed by bleeding throughout (ie bruising/swelling). I never had any reflexes whatsoever, ostensibly from the entire spinal cord being affected. </p></div>		</li>
