			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we have you, would you mind giving a little more general overview of the crystal growth process? For those of us far removed from this field, I'm curious about things like:
What is the typical method of growing quartz and why is that more likely to produce the desired crystalline structure than epitaxially?
Per your comment, could you grow quartz epitaxially if you start with a quartz-like substrate and have good success growing it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quartz can be grown relatively cheaply via hydrothermal synthesis, significantly cheaper than through epitaxy; have some long, pressurized chamber with a bunch of silica sand on one end and place a seed crystal in the other, heat the sand side and because quartz is less soluble at the unheated side, the seed crystal will grow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually have a couple of <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/90uegKN_tvk/hqdefault.jpg" target="_blank">lab grown quartz crystals</a>. If you look carefully you can see the outline of the original seed they used. </p>
