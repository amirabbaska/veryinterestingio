It is more focused on currently documented galaxies, not ones yet to be seen. As for the second part of your question, we can 'see' much more than just light. Energy comes in many different forms many of which we can see with special equipment. For these collisions, gamma rays are emitted. This wavelength of energy certainly can't be seen with our human eyes, but we can detect it with many of our satellites. As for the last bit, again, anything is possible, but that's highly unlikely. There are MANY things in the universe that emit energy on scales much larger than these collisions. As I said before, when there is a collision of two opposite real particles, the energy released is always constant. Sure you could have a whole bunch, but it's not likely to restart the Universe. </p></div>		</li>
