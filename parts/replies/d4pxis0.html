<p>We have data on pre-industrial ozone levels? How did we get that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speculating here, but we can get all kinds of data from the past through observing things that existed through it. For instance we have data on the changes to the magnetic poles based on the alignment of ferrous metals in rocks on the sea floor. The scientist that discovered the dangers of leaded gasoline was able to use data from antarctic ice cores to show that lead was not naturally occurring in the atmosphere. And we can infer a surprising amount of localized climate data going back several centuries, based on growth rings in trees that lived through it. So, probably something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We generally use ice cores to determine historical levels of atmospheric gases using <a href="http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/ice-cores/ice-core-basics/" target="_blank">Ice Cores</a>. Since the ozone layer is well into the atmosphere, trapped gases in ground level ice can be used to extrapolate ozone levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ozone didn't actually decline significantly until almost the 1970s (about 20 years after CFC use was widespread, since it takes that long for them to diffuse into the stratosphere). There's been direct ozone data from ground UV spectrometers since the 1920s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what aspects of the Montreal Protocol you focus on. If you look at it from the perspective that the entire world came together to solve a scientific problem with a scientific solution, it is a good sign. If you focus on that the the scientists that worked on the issue were laughed at for over a decade until DuPont came up with a CFC replacement that did not affect ozone that allowed governments to move forward with minimal economic risk, it is not a good sign. </p></div>		</li>
