			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a medical student. Could you please explain to me the mechanism (if one has been proposed or perhaps supported enough to be called a theory) by which renin might cause blood vessel proliferation? Does that apply to other angioproliferative disorders, or just to strawberry hemangiomas? Thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter was born with a subdermal hemangioma at the base of her skull and this was very informative read as a once, very freaked out parent. Hers was gone by the time she turned two, but it was very large and scared the crap out of me when we discovered it. If it had been the classic red strawberry mark it'd have not been an issue, but being just a lump under the skin was scary.</p></div>		</li>
