			<div class="markdown"><p>Often when I remember or think back on something, my brain adds in something horrible... if I'm remembering sitting at the kitchen table talking to family, and explosion happens. If I'm thinking about date night with my boyfriend, a monster comes and attacks us... thinking about a car memory? Boom, I'm hit my a semi. It's totally uncontrollable, and happens often. Is this just my anxiety peeking in, or something else? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is why Im so good at just closing my eyes, thinking about a fantasy, and just playing it to myself like a movie however I desire?</p>
<p>Most times I feel like I have this weird clear day dreams I can control at will. When I fall into sleep, it goes away until I can establish lucidity (not usually). However, in day dreaming, or lucid sleeping, I have this weird super HD vision and perception of it all.</p></div>		</li>
