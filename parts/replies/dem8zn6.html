<p>Basically the President has the power to create a Court Jester cabinet position, and with the approval of the Senate, it would become a real thing.</p>

<p>Ummm, no. Congress creates the government departments and agencies (and, importantly, appropriates the money to run them). The President can only appoint someone to fill a position that has been established by Congress, not one he just made up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See above &quot;With the approval of the Senate.&quot;</p>
<p>All of the original cabinet positions were made up by the Executive, and approved by Congress.</p>
<p>The process and positions have been formalized over the years, but did not originate through declaration of law, or the Constitution.</p>
<p>This is simply a matter of fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alternative fact.</p>
<p>Or would you care to cite your sources? I will cite mine. The office of Secretary of State (originally Secretary of Foreign Affairs) was established by Congress in the Act of July 27, 1789, 1 Stat. 28. The office of Secretary of War was established by Congress in the Act of August 7, 1789, 1 Stat. 49. The President only appointed people to fill these offices <em>after</em> they had been established by law. Shall I go on? </p>
<p>[EDIT] This is not exactly ELI5, but there is one exception to the rule. At various times between 1932 and 1984, Congress delegated authority to the President to &quot;reorganize&quot; agencies by Executive Order. Under that authority, the President actually could create a new office and then appoint someone to fill it without prior Congressional approval. But that authority no longer exists.</p></div>		</li>
