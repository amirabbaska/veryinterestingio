If so then the heat won't be transferred through conduction or convection and mainly through radiation.  Similar to how a vacuum thermos can keep the temperature constant for a longer period of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well temperature is scientifically defined as particle motion, so they’re not being heated in the manner you’re thinking of.</p>
<p>Also, it doesn’t really matter how the heat is transferred, the amount of particles moving at a certain speed that create “temperature” is not sufficient to heat up anything around it. </p>
<p>For instance, the layer of our atmosphere known as the thermosphere can get up to 2,700 degrees Celsius, but because the air is so thin up there, you’d actually freeze, you wouldn’t burn up, even though the temperature is hot enough that it would melt steel at standard atmospheric pressures. Temperature is really not what most people think it is, it’s effects are largely dependent upon air pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your use of 'heat' makes me think you haven't taken thermodynamics. The word you're looking for is 'temperature.' Heat is a transfer of energy due to a difference in temperature.</p>
<p>Temperature is the thing that's a measure of a particle's average kinetic energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It was the result of smashing particles together at ludicrous speed. The collision was of <em>unfathomable</em> power, but it also occurred at such a small scale that it is close to not even existing at all.</p>
<p>They literally make black holes out there, but everything is so miniscule that it exists for a fraction of a fraction of time.</p>
<p>EDIT: Correction: they've yet to succeed at making black holes. But it's still a wonderful possibility. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a beast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a researcher at the Institute for High Energy Physics in Protvino, Bugorski worked with the largest Soviet particle accelerator, the U-70 synchrotron. [2] On 13 July 1978, Bugorski was checking a malfunctioning piece of equipment when the safety mechanisms failed. Bugorski was leaning over the equipment when he stuck his head in the path of the 76 GeV proton beam. Reportedly, he saw a flash &quot;brighter than a thousand suns&quot; but did not feel any pain.[1]</p>
<p>The left half of Bugorski's face swelled up beyond recognition and, over the next several days, started peeling off, revealing the path that the proton beam (moving near the speed of light) had burned through parts of his face, his bone and the brain tissue underneath.[3] As it was believed that he had received far in excess of a fatal dose of radiation, Bugorski was taken to a clinic in Moscow where the doctors could observe his expected demise. <strong>However, Bugorski survived and even completed his Ph.D.</strong> </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. From the CERN website, they have accelerated particles up to energies as high as 6.5 TeV (teraelectron volts), or ~1e-6 J. </p>
<p>For comparison an average tennis ball flying across a court has a kinetic energy on the order of 100 J (or 100 million times that of the particles in the LHC).</p>
<p>The particles are going very fast, but their masses are very low compared to everyday objects.</p>
<p>edit: Looks like more recent data has shown energy values &quot;greater than&quot; 1 PeV (1e15 eV) for lead ion collisions. Regardless that is still only  ~1.6e-5 Joules, again much less than every day objects moving at relatively slow speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're correct that individual particles have relatively low energies compared to normal-scale items, he was speaking of the beam as a whole.</p>
<p>[According to an outdated CERN source] (<a href="https://lhc-machine-outreach.web.cern.ch/lhc-machine-outreach/beam.htm" target="_blank">https://lhc-machine-outreach.web.cern.ch/lhc-machine-outreach/beam.htm</a>) , the entire beam contains 2808 'bunches' per beam and  1.15×10^11 protons per bunch.</p>
<p>This would give us an energy of 336.29 MJ, but this source states '362 MJ per beam' .</p></div>		</li>

Which part of the CERN collisions reach freight train levels? That's crazy.</p>
