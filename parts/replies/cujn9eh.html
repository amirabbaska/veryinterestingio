			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a kind of utilitarian motive. The Yakuza controls a huge slice of all illegal activities in japan, and they know they are only tolerated because they act reasonably.</p>
<p>If they were removed from the equation, that niche would fill with a multitude of low level groups - many of which which would likely act erratically, dangerously, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Kind of a 'better the enemy you know' scenario. Japan basically considers the yakuza to be an acceptable loss. The group/s that would replace them? Well, it could be much worse</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd rather equate it to 20th century mafia in USA.</p>
<p>There was Italian mafia. They refused to fill a niche (hard drugs) and stuck to gambling and racketeering. Then cartels came and filled the missing niche, and smaller organizations (gangs) / Russian mafia squeezed out Italians.</p>
<p>Add to all that the fact that Italian mafia was under tremendous pressure by USA government.</p>
<p>...Okay, the parallel isn't the greatest, but it works. Kinda.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: Okay, I stand corrected. I'm only superficially familiar with American history... And most of 20th century history in general.

You can probably look up your local Hells Angels, or or other such &quot;motorcycle club&quot; and find a listed headquarters. Depending on where you live. They just like to insist that they are not criminal orginizations and thus attempt to operate openly and legally. And they are often pretty charitable orginizations as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It pisses me off about some of the well known 1% clubs doing this PR stuff. It causes people to look down on legit clubs who are actually out here doing good. I get a lot of sideways looks due to a club I belong to which is known for its outrageous parties. Yes, we party hard during our events (which are member only held away from civilized areas). What people don't see is our private donations and aid given to the community. The club is actively raising A LOT of money for local non-profits and families in need. It's all legit and on the books. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the Yakuza quite often protects from external threats as well. And they rarely do all too much damage to businesses. This varies by Gumi of course, but there is a concept called Ninjo that the yakuza love to talk up. Basically, Ninjo means something along the lines of protecting the people. It's why the Yakuza don't tend to allow thieves in their territory - it directly preys on innocent people. Many Yaks don't do a great job of actually keeping to Ninjo, but they like to brag about it a lot, and that keeps them from going too crazy. Even a street level thug who takes a hammer to a guy who won't pay protection is going to reflect badly on his superiors, and in the Yakuza that means you are losing another knuckle. Even if it's mostly for show, it's a show that brings loyalty and money in, so they put some degree of effort to not screwing with the illusion directly. </p>
<p>So yeah, you are paying to be protected from the Yakuza, but if some other punk starts screwing with a store that is protected by the Yakuza, the Yakuza are pretty well obligated to act. Ninjo says that they must protect their people, and if they don't act they look like they are too weak or incompetent to do what they said they would do. Neither is going to make the guys upstairs happy, so somebody is going to end up falling down a few flights of kicks and punches to the face. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A concept I've always found quite interesting is... let's call it &quot;the level of aggression needed to create fear and create the desired transgressive effect&quot;.</p>
<p>Like, in a society where everyone is polite, you might intimidate by swearing and veiled allusions to violence. </p>
<p>In a society where everyone curse at each other, you might intimidate by physical threats.</p>
<p>In a society where physical threats are everyday, you might intimidate by physical blows.</p>
<p>In a society where people fight each other all the time, you might intimidate by murder. </p>
<p>The Yakuza in this framework even seems fairly civilized. Punishing failure by cutting off a single joint of a single little-used finger is one hell of a lot better than punishing failure by just a bullet through the head. Intimidating people by beating them up or destroying the goods of a store is a lot more civilized than intimidation by mass rape and murder of busloads of students.</p>
<p>Basically, my probably poorly founded impression is that if you're going to have a mafia in the first place, the Yakuza aren't amongst the worst. Not sure if that's wildly inaccurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ninjo does not mean anything like that. You might be thinking of giri which is the sense of social obligation to the benefit of Japanese society in which protecting your fellow business owners would fall under. It also explains why Yakuza are generally respected as a necessary part of society. Ninjo is the complete opposite of giri which is self interest above the interests of society. An example is falling in love with someone outside of your social class in feudal Japanese times and going for it even though it would be taboo. Hikkikomori are a good modern example as following their ninjo above their giri.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The yakuza is similar to the Italian mafia.   The yakuza and the mafia do not kill or threaten the general public.   In fact they usually get support from the lowest classes.  In Tijuana, when the Italian mafia ran it in the sixties, it was generally safe as the mafia didn't tolerate American tourists being harmed .... Bad for business.  When they left, the Mexicans took over and it became dangerous.  </p>
<p>Mexican and Russian organized gangs are unusual in that their gangs get no support from the people and they kill police officers and government officials.     This is generally not true of the yakuza and the Italian mafia.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not true, at least for the Mexican cartels.  Several of them produce t-shirts, backpacks, and tote bags legitimately with their logos and slogans to sell to civilians.  People that live in their territory buy them to show where they're from.  The cartels also hire popular bands to write and perform songs about their exploits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, it's been awhile since I studied the mafia (I minored in Italian studies in college) but I think it turned out, and has especially been revealed in recent years, that the mafia was definitely involved in political assassinations.</p>
<p>I think the difference is that in Italy, they were oftentimes working with others in the government to these sorts of ends. There were actual in person meetings between mafia and Italian politicians that the government tried to cover up.</p>
<p>It's not that bad anymore, but it's always been a problem in Italy that people felt like they couldn't rely on the police/govt, so they relied on the mafia instead (like you said, mafia is popular with the lowest classes and when you look at what the system was like, you can see why). Then the mafia got big enough that they made deals with the government, all the while fucking the whole country over. OP said yakuza ask homeless people to help clean up toxic waste around Fukushima ... I just hope they're better at it than the ndrangheta... :/</p></div>		</li>
