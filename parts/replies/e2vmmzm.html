<p>It's also kinda funny to think that if the sun randomly blew up we would have no way of knowing for 9 minutes.</p>

<p>All those pretty time lapses of the Milky Way in r/pics might be 'ghost photos' of solar systems that were destroyed in a galactic cataclysm 50 thousand years ago and we won't know anything about it for another 50 thousand years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know what you mean, but technically astronomers can tell how long a star has to live based on data they collect on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for actually answering the OP's question.  I had to scroll past way too many &quot;A telescope that good would be impossible because light [...]&quot; comments to find a real answer.   They weren't asking if they could have a telescope strong enough to see dinosaurs, they were asking if they could see them given that they did already have such a hypothetical telescope. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But /u/justingolden21 is wrong? Even if the hypothetical telescope did exist, it wouldn't work because light dissipates from the source , so the light that reached 66 million miles light years away would be tiny and the rest of it is who knows how many light years apart. You'd need another hypothetical that could gather those specific photons of light all across the universe and piece it together lol, and I'm sure I'm not even done there, there's probably 1000 more things we missed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're getting too hung up on the telescope entirely, the telescope isn't actually an important part of the question.  The spirit of OP's question is about the speed of light, and time.  The hypothetical telescope probably just seemed like the best way to ask it.<br />
It may be been better phrased &quot;If I could hypothetically see details on the surface of the Earth from 66 million light years away, then would I be able to see dinosaurs?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>8 minutes. And I’m really glad you’re not talking about the lack of ability to see clearly from that distance. Yeah I get that the light spreads out, but OP is clearly talking about the relativistic time difference. </p></div>		</li>
