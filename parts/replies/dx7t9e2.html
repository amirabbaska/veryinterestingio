			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only is it possible, it's relatively common.  You already know an example of this--you just didn't know you did:</p>
<p>Pluto, and its moon Charon.</p>
<p>Pluto and Charon orbit a common barycentre, which is over 800 km ABOVE the surface of Pluto.  There are some nice animations here:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta. In one sense, things always mutually orbit one another. Both objects  orbit a point between them where the point is weighted toward the more massive object. Usually this point is actually inside the larger object, but the closer they are in mass the closer this point is to the point exactly between the  two. Pluto and its moon Charon are an example of such a system- both orbit a point in space between the two, with the point being closer to Pluto but still well above its surface.</p></div>		</li>
