			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this microorganisms are on red meat yes, but the reason we can't eat those and other animals can is just evolution.</p>
<p>As we evolved eating cooked meats the parts of our stomach that were needed to process raw meat weren't being used and simply weren't worth it anymore so we lost it. Animals like Lions, dogs and bears have developed their own mechanisms to digest raw meat and the Microorganisms in it and kept them through the millenia as they have never learnt to cook.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I wanted to say this, but I didn't know if man had harnessed fire long enough ago to have influenced evolution or not. I knew that being omnivores, our digestive systems are sort of a compromise between that of a herbivore and a carnivore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That time scale is definitely enough to affect evolution. For example, the rise of agriculture and farming animals has also had a noticeable effect on our evolution (populations that historically farmed cattle for dairy have very different levels of lactose tolerance into adulthood than populations that did not have a history of cattle farming), and that happened much later than us learning to cook things over fires. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had access to fire I think over 70,000 years ago (I may be wrong in that figure) which is a good amount of time. Bacteria in our bodies is passed down from our mothers I  their womb and from breast milk, once we started eating cooked meats the bacteria we had to process it gradually died off as it had nothing to be used for and so was no longer present in breast milk to populate children with. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Timing is huge too. If you eat it right after it is killed, many less organisms.</p>
<p>It was so gross the first time I saw someone
eat raw hamburger right after it had been ground. But they said it was so good fresh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer is that lions and wild animals eat the meat right after killing it whereas we buy it from the store and its been dead for days or even weeks by the time we eat it.</p></div>		</li>
