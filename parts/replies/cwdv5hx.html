			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclosure: this is where it starts to go conspiracy theory.  I'm less confident but worth mentioning.  Who is funding ISIL?   The self funding argument is too convenient.   Also does not explain ISILs start. ISIL are Wahhabi, SA leaders are Wahhabi.   A Wahhabi state blocks Iran from taking over Syria.  Friendly to SA.   I dunno.  Awful convenient. </p></div>		</li>
