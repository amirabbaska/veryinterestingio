			<div class="markdown"><p>Your stomach is actually a separate biological entity on its own. A stomach is chosen for it's owner at childbirth and carefully placed inside and bonded with it's owner for life. It provides it's owner with the means to destroy anything it consumes, but if the owner decides to not destroy for a long period of time, then the stomach will begin to cry out in a bloodlust, growing ever louder until it received it's next victim from the owner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a lot of energy lost when a sound is generated in a solid medium like bone/connective tissue and then transmitted to the air? If you could accurately measure the decibels at the point the sound is generated in the knuckle, would it be several orders of magnitide louder than the sound we hear after it has passed through a meter of air?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The efficiency of transfer of vibration between different materials varies widely by the properties of the specific two materials in any given case.  Generally speaking, if two materials have similar properties, the transfer is more efficient.  So yes, a lot of energy doesn't ever leave the solid material when the other material is air (which is clearly much different in properties than solids and liquids).  We can (and do) measure source levels and quantify the magnitude of vibrations in all kinds of materials.  This is hugely important for everything from medical devices (ultrasound imagers) to oil and gas exploration (offshore seismic surveys).  It doesn't really make sense to think of &quot;loudness&quot; of sound in a solid material, because we can't really stick our ear into those materials to hear anything.  We use slightly different reference points and units to measure them, but source levels and transmission across material interfaces are both very important and widely studied for many applications.</p></div>		</li>
