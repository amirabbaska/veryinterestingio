			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, that depends. If you've already carved III into the stone, then you can't just go make it be V (very easily), and wind up with IIIII.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One way to translate it is the way of counting we usually use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Norman wildberger does this. He has improved the fundamental theorem of algebra such that it works using only the reals. According to him, you do not need anything other than the real numbers to do all of mathematics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm extremely skeptical of this claim. Could you provide a source? From what you say, it sounds like he might just be treating complex numbers as a vector space over reals (which is essentially what we do most of the time anyway).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the roots of x^2 + 1 in the reals?</p>
<p>EDIT: And no set of axioms can do &quot;all of math&quot;, even if those axioms allow for complex numbers. Or at least, that's a common interpretation of GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems. </p></div>		</li>
