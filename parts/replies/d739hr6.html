			<div class="markdown"><p>In the same category, but way lesser importance, is its use in Airsoft, where the projectiles are given (as consistent as can be) backspin to give them lift as they fly through the air.</p>
<p>This increases the working range from a gentle arc downwards impacting the ground at ~100 feet or so to fairly level flight path out to 200-250 feet depending on how well the backspin has been tuned. </p>
<p>If I recall, it's essentially the rotated 90Â° version of a sniper needing to counteract their round inching sideways at range due to the spin on it.</p></div>		</li>
