			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a fine line between how much rigor should be used on a first introduction to algebra/analysis.  It's tough to say how much should be used, since clearly going full analysis your first time through will take too long and probably leave one with less intuition then if they just went through the quick way first.</p></div>		</li>
