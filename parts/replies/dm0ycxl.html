			<div class="markdown"><p>The tongue is actually composed of different muscles, in sections. Different sections have different directions and can pull the tongue in different ways. You also use the muscles to harden the tissue, which can help to stick it out. Moving the tongue forward is basically done by the muscles under the tongue though, not sure if those are part of the tongue or rather a jaw muscle. You can feel it under your chin!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually another thing I wondered as well. There are a few things in the body that even though muscles contract, they seem to be able to push certain things </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be precise:</p>
<p>All jaws are &quot;pulled&quot; open, unless there is no active measure by which a muscle opens the jaw. This happens in some fish, where the &quot;open&quot; state is the base condition, and muscle action must keep the jaw closed.</p>
<p>The muscles of typical tetrapod jaws (amphibians, reptiles [including crocs, turtles, and birds], mammals) have a set of muscles that open the jaw (abduction) and those that close it (adduction), that opperate as two points of force &quot;pulling&quot; the jaw towards the skull on either side of a hinge. That hinge is the jaw joint. This muscle is different group to group, because not all muscles stayed where they are during the course of evolution: The reptile muscles used to open and close the jaw are now inside the ear in mammals.</p>
<p>Using the lever-based model, pushing down on the outlever (in this case, typically behind the jaw joint) opens the jaw, and because of these, it's called &quot;depressing&quot; the jaw. Pushing down on the inlever, which is towards the front of the jaw, on the other side of the jaw joint, typically opens the jaw, but there are some curious cases where the lever arms are in odd places because of where the muscles lie around the jaw joint.</p>
<p>In humans, there's a small muscle behind the jaw that opens the mouth, and it is much, musch smaller than those muscles which close the jaw, which include but aren't limited to, the large temporalis muscles you can feel bulging on the side of your head while chewing. In most mammals, the masseter muscle also plays a role in closing the jaw, and this forms the main bulk of the cheek.</p>
<p>In reptiles and some birds, the abduction muscles are significantly behind the jaw, and this creates leverage, allowing less force to open the jaw rapidly. The adduction muscles, in contrast are typically close to the joint and provide powerful bite force. But other muscles contribute to jaw opening and closing in both groups, including the hyolingual apparatus in mammals and some amphibians, and in reptiles and other amphibians, the palatal complexes of muscles. Because the jaw can move forward or aft (called palinal), and sideways (called translation). some of these muscles call, by their attachment sites on the skull or jaw, also be oriented such that when they contract, they pull the jaw forward or back and by so doing, also open or close the jaw. Some animals, seen especially in turtles and birds, often close their jaws through contraction of jaw retracting muscles, and conversely, use different means to open the jaws. Some birds don't even use these muscles at all, and instead involve some smaller palatal muscles that open only the snout (via rhynchokinetic hinges) rather than these typical jaw-hinge-moving muscles.</p>
<p>So the issue is very complex, but pretty basic at it's root: [Most] muscles operate on levers of one sort or another, and operate these levers by pulling on one arm of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lastly, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_pterygoid_muscle" target="_blank">lateral pterygoid </a> connects the base of the skull (temple area) to the top of the mandible, which, among other functions, pulls the jaw forward and open given the geometry of its attachment. </p></div>		</li>
