			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdote but I remember camping with my father and uncle in the coastal range between Carmel and the Big Sur area in the 80s. The area was beautiful, mostly steep oak and tall grass covered hills mixed with chaparral but lots and lots of brushy undergrowth. So much so you couldn't really go much off the trail in many places. </p>
<p>I remember they talked about how these areas were routinely cleared out by fire when they camped there as young men and it would increase game and make it easier to hunt and how different it had become in the last few decades due to officials not letting things burn. </p>
<p>So while I don't disagree with you at all, I suspect fires in many places are long, long overdue. Unfortunately, they'll burn hotter and cause more destruction.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the biggest problems as far as destruction goes has more to do with the urban-wildland interface and the fact that many people don't create defensible space around their homes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a pretty big deal where my parents still live.  (IIRC) 150 - 200 feet of grassland has to be cleared around each house.  </p>
<p>I don't even know if that's enough come right down to it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We share property in Southern Colorado with lots of family members. The FireWise initiative promotes keeping defensible space around buildings. We've cut down dead/dying trees and trees that are too close to others. </p>
<p>This also involves raking leaf litter and other flammable materials away from homes, and keeping firewood at a safe distance, or in an enclosed area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally! Yes sir well said.
Having a 2-5 meter (or yard) space around your house of non combustibles like aggregate is the first step.</p>
<p>No combustible trees for 30 m (100feet)  on your property </p>
<p>Keep grass between those areas cut short </p>
<p>This would stop 99% of these types of fires from damaging homes if it's feasible.</p>
<p>I don't know why places wouldn't just pay to bulldoze and scrape down to the dirt, giant swaths around these types of vulnerable communities instead of paying firefighters when its FAR too late. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia we &quot;burn off&quot; our forests during autumn/spring to avoid these exact conditions. </p>
<p>Eucalyptus trees are extremely susceptible to fire due to the dry nature of them and the oil in their leaves - and our forests are obviously full of them dropping their dead, dry, oily leaves everywhere! </p>
<p>Our CFA (country volunteer fire fighters) do slow burns to clear out underbrush and create &quot;barriers&quot; between the bush (forest) and any settlements. It's a huge job, and they are amazing. </p>
<p>Unfortunately conditions sometimes are too much for a burn off to make a difference. We've had a number of fires where entire states have been on fire and many people have died. Bushfires are no joke. Get out early or have a solid plan on how you are going to survive. Do not think that a garden hose and and wet rag around your face will be enough!</p>
<p>Sorry, rant over!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of SoCal is full of eucalyptus too (which was clearly a terrible idea), along with a lot of natural scrub plants that are also full of flammable oils. Basically half our plants are asking to catch fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the conundrum. You want to save the ecosystems from human encroachment by preventing burns, but in the same time the burns are a normal part of the ecosystems lifespan, its just more devastating now because we have obliterated so much of the environment that these fires now have much more significant repercussions. I have a hippy mentor of sorts who goes through the forests in Southern Oregon and sets small controlled burns every year to kill the undergrowth and nourish the soil. The fire department lets him do his thing and what has resulted is a much stronger set of alpha plants that can withstand and ultimately prevent firestorms. Climate change definitely has its role, but humanities interaction with forests needs to change a bit, full scale prevention is not the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think non-Californians underestimate how little it really rains here most of the year. I was talking to my cousin (who is from Oregon) this past December and she was flabbergasted that the last time it had rained at all in our area was a brief ten-minute sprinkle in early April.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s ridiculous.  Most kids don’t need rain boots.  When my kid was younger there were 3 years he didn’t even SEE rain because the only rain/sprinkles we got were at night.</p>
<p>I’ve had windshield wipers that rotted before they were used for any rain (spraying windshield use only).</p>
<p>We don’t even have fountains at the malls/public areas anymore from the drought... they turned them into planters.</p></div>		</li>
