			<div class="markdown"><p>A decent example of that is the old Jaguar 5.0 litre V12. I've only driven the 4 litre straight 6 and that definitely had plenty of power and smoothness to the ride but I've heard you can get to really high speeds in the V12 and it feels like you're still doing 60, despite its age. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome, I would love to get a ride in one some day. I still find those ones from the 70's look really classy. Beautiful cars. I heard they had independent rear ends!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a weird way of phrasing that.</p>
<p>The E Type had been around since 1961, and that's when the independent rear suspension was a big deal.</p>
<p>When it debuted, the E Type was basically the most advanced road legal sports car on the market with it's complex suspension and 150mph top speed. However as it aged, they gradually changed it first by boring out the 3.8L engine to 4.2L to keep up with the competition. Then in the late 60s safety and emissions standards came into place which meant the car was considerably detuned to meet those standards. </p>
<p>In order to keep making what many consider to be the most beautiful car of all time, they started using the 5.0L V12 to get around power/emission per cylinder requirements but by this point the car itself was too old to remain competitive from a performance standpoint so it was turned into a luxury cruiser where comfort and style were king.
They started making more automatic transmissions, added power steering, made it roomier, softened the ride, and raised the ride height which gave it another few years of life as a totally different kind of car.</p>
<p>So while yes the 70s Jags had independent rear suspension that was definitely not a major selling point like it had been in the prior decade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As /u/MooseNosePie pointed out, this isn't true for an I6 vs V8 configuration. An inline six is as close to perfectly balanced as you can get, with 120Ëš between the start of each power stroke. A V12 will be similar, as it's two I6s mated at the crank.</p>
<p>If you ever get the opportunity, drive a vehicle with an I6. Datsuns, some Jaguars, older BMWs, and AMC-era Jeeps are great sources. They rev so smoothly, it's unreal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a manual E90 with an N52. It's been stripped out and has some nice light rims and a decent set of coil overs. It's light as hell and is an absolute dream to drive. I have a friend who would always say &quot;inline 6 is best 6&quot;, and he's absolutely right. God, I fucking love my N52.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think no, off of the top of my head, because the absurdly long crankshaft would exaggerate any differences and introduce vibration. At the very least, it would cause more bearing wear, I'd think. </p>
<p>If a mechanical engineer wants to correct me, that'd be great, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A V8 configuration still isn't as smooth and balanced as an inline 6 though. The V8 is more efficient regarding lengthwise space though compared to the I6 when comparing equivalent displacement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember I saw a comment on here a while back describing engine balances and how some engines like a V6 try to shake themselves apart while a V8 won't. Any truth to that?</p>
