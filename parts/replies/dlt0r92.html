			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to say that there is no requirement that you cash in your chips before you leave the casino, or even that you cash them in at the same casino for the most part. Many other casinos honor other casinos chips even if they are not in the same brand. But because of theft and counterfitting it's can be a hassle if the chips are large denominations. Denominations $500 and above definitely get a lot of attention, and I am sure have the RFID, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get away with cashing in a few $20's or under without any real problem, but any real amount of money would be very suspicious.  And creating the counterfeits would be very difficult these days.</p>
<p>It's like counterfeiting real currency. The problems and cost associated with the process, along with the low value of counterfeitable currency just makes the whole process undesirable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same reason, cameras. People used to do this with fake checks, eventually a pattern will develop and you would get caught.</p>
<p>Like why piss off another party when you're counterfeiting if you don't have to? One that is highly motivated to catch you, where the only place you can redeem your fake chips is under heavy surveillance, and now there's not even a guaranteed return. So you would taking a huge risk in order to take another risk to maybe win something that can't be too large because it will just attract attention. The effort on return just isn't there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make sure you do a really good job.   When you deal with these cheques (chips have no value cheques do) on a daily basis, you get feel for everything about them.   A dealer that is aware of slightly different colors or a off set marking can make all the difference when the players are better counterfeits.  Ive caught a couple counterfeits before and we just casually mention to  our floor supervisors Nd you don't  remain at the table much longer.  Source: am dealer for 6 years.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the old days, people caught producing counterfeit chips tended to end up in a hole in the desert. Of course it's no longer like that these days, but I think that would have been a pretty strong deterrent at least up until the 1980s before RFID and microprint became common.</p></div>		</li>
