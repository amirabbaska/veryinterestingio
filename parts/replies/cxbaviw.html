			<div class="markdown"><p>I read this in his voice. All you're missing is some weird southern sounding phrase that isn't actually a southern phrase. Maybe try it like this:</p>
<p>WELL IF YOU BUY MY NEW BOOK &quot;LIFE COACH,&quot; THERE'S A CHAPTER THERE ALL ABOUT HOW NOT TO GET ABUSED. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY. IF THE SHUTTERS ON THE BARN ARE OPEN, DON'T BE SURPRISED WHEN A BADGER STEALS A COW TAIL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in the case of Dr. Phil, he's no longer a practicing psychologist. A lot of his early seasons were built on decent advice and he didn't actually have a psychology license anymore so there was always the small print disclaimer that any advice is for entertainment purposes.</p>
<p>The scary thing about Dr. Oz is that he's still a fucking practicing doctor. Dr. Phil has his PhD in clinical psychology so you can assume his advice has at least some basis in fact but you don't assume everything he says is the gold standard because he's not a practicing psychologist. Dr Oz is a practicing surgeon and professor.</p></div>		</li>
