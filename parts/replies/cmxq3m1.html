			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly its kind of annoying that clickbait has replaced actual information. &quot;Organic molecules found on mars! Is there life on the planet?&quot; Headlines are all over the place and when you read the article it just says they found methane. Ive given up on even trying to explain this to people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To some extent, isn't that what we need to keep space exploration going though?  The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2pl25b/curiosity_found_methane_and_water_on_mars_how_are/cmxppk2" target="_blank">third highest comment in this thread</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought it was pretty well established that Mars was devoid of life</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that's a common misconception, then publicizing the possibility of life is exactly what we need!  That said, I agree there is a fine line between exciting the public and setting them up to be disappointed.  If we ever prove conclusively that Mars is sterile, many will foolishly see it as a reason to give up the search.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there is plenty of water currently on Mars in the icecaps for instance, and water vapor moves around with the seasons. No reason to believe the mantle and crust is bone dry, there's bound to be enough water to get this reaction going. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would have to be liquid though too I believe.  And yah, it wouldn't surprise me if there was a layer of liquid water and some depth in the interior.  That's still a promising environment to look for life in if we can identify specific depths and locations.</p></div>		</li>
