			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but if we need to cover 20% of the ocean with CO2 consuming algea, I'm not sure if its a legit option. So understanding scale seems quite relevant here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, that algae has to be buried somewhere (the sea floor) as organic matter if we want to remove CO2 from the system. Most algae falling to the seafloor today gets consumed on its descent by other organisms and converted back into CO2.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shouldn't we try both things, reduce the carbon and come up with strategies to scrub existing carbon. Just reducing carbon will prevent the situation from getting worse, but to reverse or at least mitigate the damage we've done, we'll have to scrub the CO2 as well.</p></div>		</li>
