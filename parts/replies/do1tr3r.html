<p>What do you mean here? That Frankish tactics didn't last long - or that the Franks themselves didn't last long? For the former, I'm sure that they developed according to the resources at hand, and as to the latter - didn't they last long enough to become absorbed into the 'generic' Western medieval societies?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only exceptions would be weapons like throwing stars, which are designed to be sharp from every angle. Even then, they were hardly ever used as a primary killing weapon. They would instead be thrown as a distraction, or stuck in the ground in the hopes an enemy would step on them. </p>

<p>Oh no, that's even worse than Legos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think throwing axes were used a bit, but I can't really see throwing knives. Axes have a lot of mechanics that makes them a bit better even being hard to hit with the blade. They have a good weight to them, so even if you hit with a blunt side you are still going to cause some harm, they are heavy, so if it sticks in a shield it is hurting an opponents ability to defend, and they bounce, so even if you throw short or miss, it still is going to do some damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the bounce is important. </p>
<p>above it's mentioned ranks of axes were thrown on the way in to weaken shields. but do you think it entirely likely?</p>
<p>when throwing an axe or a knife, and i derp the throw into the ground, what has the highest probability of happening? with a knife it's just as likely to stick in the ground hilt as point (strengthening the suggestion of throwing stars as nonstabilized caltrops). with an axe the higher probability is that it will bounce, solidly up. take a moment to cup your nads, i'll wait.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To weaken shields? It would depend on context. That it would make the shield harder to use effectively? Definitely, an axe weights a good chunk, though likely not an enormous amount compared to a shield. The thing is though, shields (especially at the time this was taking place) relied a lot I believe on being rather balanced. Your hand would be in the center of it, and you wanted the weight distributed evenly. If someone throws an axe at you, and it solidly wedges itself into the top/bottom or the side of your shield, then it is causing your shield to pull forward, or twist to the side, and it makes it harder to use right because of it. Was it the primary purpose? Probably not, but it was likely part of the advantage. </p>
<p>Some people believe that the bounce was the primary purpose though as you wanted the axe to hit the ground and bounce back up under the shield, where it is hard to defend against. I can't really say, and I would guess that most people would be hard pressed to say. I think as far as weapons go though, you took what you could get, and the axe had a few nice things it offered. Which one was the primary one is likely something for the historians to debate about.</p></div>		</li>
