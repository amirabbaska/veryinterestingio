<p>Then there is losing memory due to physical trauma (bonked on the head) and then there is losing memory due to disease (alzheimers).  These later two are legit lost and never to be retrieved b/c the part of the brain required for that type of memory is gone b/c of surgery or other means. </p>

<p>Alzheimer's researcher here. Not necessarily... There's actually a debate about whether AD impairs semantic stores (representations) as opposed to executive functioning, or both. Though most evidence imo points to the former being the largest culprit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a decent response, but I have some suggestions to help refine and focus your answer (an answer I don't know myself). From a cognitive science perspective the fundamental question is straightforward: Is the memory representation itself lost, or just the encoding/retrieval processes?</p>
<p>Can you speak to the general process of age-based memory loss, and whether this is due to memory-representation degradation, or to encoding/retrieval process degradation?</p>
<p>Obviously, this varies by type of memory (which you break out well), but I think your answer could be improved by pointing to research that shows one or the other, or both. Like I said, I don't know the answer, but my recall of the literature I'm familiar with is that it is complex (as you note) and that it generally involves degradation of both representation and retrieval processes (which would mean some memories are still retrievable in principle, while others are not, depending on the specific mechanism).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/retrieve-missing-memories-early-alzheimers-symptoms-0316" target="_blank">Here</a> is some relevant research. They conditioned mice with Alzheimer's symptoms to be afraid of a situation and tagged what they determined to be those engram (memory) cells with channelrhodopsin, a protein that can activate the cells when exposed to light. The control mice experienced fear when they were placed back in that situation and the mice who had Alzheimer's symptoms did not, but the fear returned when the memory cells were activated, suggesting the memory was inaccessible and not gone completely.</p>
<p>I think it's a reasonable guess to say that both situations are possible depending on the cause of degeneration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;mechanically different&quot;, and I'm not sure if this is relevant or answers your question, but you might be interested in the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Molaison" target="_blank">HM</a>. After removing part of his brain to help treat his seizures, he was unable to form new memories, as well as unable to recall memories from certain timepoints (declarative). However, he was still able to learn/form new motor skills (non-declarative).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are some clear differences. The textbook answers is that long-term memories (think, specific events) get consolidated in the hippocampus. Other associations and memories (words, concepts), or procedural memories (how to write) are stored in neocortex and are more distributed throughout the brain.</p></div>		</li>
