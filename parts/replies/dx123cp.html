			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a study done that found 75% of patients hospitalized for heart attacks had LDL cholesterol levels that met current guidelines and about half of those had optimal levels. The conclusion by the principal investigator was that maybe the recommended levels need to be lowered. To me this would be evidence that using cholesterol as a marker for heart disease should be entirely reconsidered rather than lowering the number yet again as they have already done numerous times in the past. Is seems they are doing science backwards here, as a biomedical student what are your thoughts?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because LDLs are normal at the time of admission does not mean they have been normal for long periods of time in the patient's history.</p>
<p>Also, whether the patient is fasting or not will play a factor in determining LDL levels. Non fasting patients will present with a falsely low level of LDL, since most labs opt for a calculated LDL instead of the more expensive and less practical direct LDL measurement. The calculated LDL is directly affected by triglyceride levels which can sharply increase if not fasting (fasting = 6-8 hours without any food or beverages excluding water)</p>
<p>Let's also be clear that LDL cholesterol is simply a risk factor for a coronary incident and never an indicator. It is one of about a dozen criteria that a doctor must look at to get the entire picture of the patients health and should not be looked at in a vacuum. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>makes perfect sense, thank you. </p>
<p>once you have a picture where a statin is recommended, given their known and unknown side effects, would it be reasonable to expect an exam to actually see if there's any atherosclerosis before starting the statin therapy? essentially are we treating a problem that exist or trying to prevent one that might not happen, just by lowering one of the risk factors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for the rate response, needed to find time to read the article first (second link).</p>
<p>Upon going through it I see it as very interesting, my thoughts (this is simply my opinion on the article and some of the implications, so please take what I say here with a grain of salt and do your own research) :</p>
<p>In their discussion of the results this struck my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of these patients presenting with CAD had HDL levels, which are associated with excess risk. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol is inversely related to the risk of CAD. Even modest increases are associated with lower risk for nonfatal MI or death from CHD. There were 54.6% of patients hospitalized with CAD with admission HDL &lt;40 mg/dL. In addition, fewer than 10% of patients had HDL ≥60 mg/dL. Ideal levels (defined as LDL &lt;70 mg/dL and HDL ≥60 mg/dL) were present in only 1.4% of patients hospitalized with CAD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason this is an important point to look at is that while many of the patients had normal LDL but sub HDL levels (less than 10% had optimal HDL levels) so remember it's important that we look at LDL but we also need HDL and i think of it as more of a ratio that's key, you want a higher proportion of HDL/LDL to reduce your risk (obviously up to a point) </p>
<p>Another key thing I saw was in their limitations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is the potential for selection bias in this study because admission lipid levels were not measured in 41% of patients, and there were modest baseline differences between those with and without admission lipid levels, which may influence the generalizability of these findings</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in 41% of patients they didn't have their lipid levels (LDL and HDL) at admission and they just looked at other factors for them which can skew the results by reducing the sample size dramatically </p>
<p>Finally the last point I think is the most important from this study was also in their results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities were frequently present with 54.2% having hypertension, 26.2% having diabetes, and 30.4% being smokers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVD is often a result of many factors and you can't just boil the entire family of diseases that can lead to a heart attack to one variable. An individual can have hypertension but still have good LDL and HDL levels, but this person is still at an elevated risk for CVD because of their hypertension (same for smoking and diabetes). I think it's important to look at LDL and HDL levels together as a potential marker/predictor for disease but we need to look at other factors in conjunction because LDL on its own generally won't give you the same risk for CVD than elevated LDL combined with hypertension would give you.</p>
<p>So I don't think that study really breaks the importance of looking at LDL and HDL levels, but rather actually suggests the importance of looking at the two together, and looking at it in conjunction with other risk factors.</p>
<p>Those are my thoughts feel free to let me know what you think (once again I'm just studying for my 4yr bachelor's and am not a doctor or PhD in the field so take what I'm saying and my thoughts with a grain of salt) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your thoughts on that. I have no education or expertise in the matter, I'm just curious about how valid cholesterol levels are to determine CHD/CVD risk. I can see as you've highlighted that there are many other things to consider and most studies leave many questions unanswered. With all that in mind it still seems like there is an issue with the current mainstream understanding of heart disease risk. I can't help but question why the main take away from the study was that the recommended LDL levels might not be set low enough. To me the take away is that we don't understand enough to warrant any assumptions and that it's a complex matter that has many cofactors which are crucial in evaluation. I guess my main issue is it seems like the scientific method was kinda thrown out the window as far as the conclusion goes. These are just my layman thoughts though, maybe I don't understand it enough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as someone with familial hypercholesterolemia I'm also very interested into this and why the medical community seems to cling to it so much, </p>
<p>here's another study which casts doubt on the whole cholesterol and statins approach </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to remember that, because you have FH, you are not part of the &quot;healthy&quot; population, and studies on healthy populations may not be as relevant to you. I would suggest that you are very cautious about dismissing the role of cholesterol in CHD, given your abnormal physiology.</p></div>		</li>
