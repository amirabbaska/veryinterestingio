			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my word, THIS is why I didn't particularly enjoy Steven Universe. I mean, it was okay and like the animation style was cute and all but I think I felt too pressured into it by my friend, and she set up a day where she rewatched it with me watching for the first time. I strongly prefer discovering things on my own because that way it doesn't feel like I'm being forced into liking something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair on that how long did you watch into it? MY sister for years tried to get me to watch one piece and most the time I would watch two or three episodes and get discouraged but then one day my sister sat me down and honestly asked me to give it a shot and watch the first 40 episodes, so I did and I thank her for it all the time because after those 40 I went on to watch another 460 in the span of a month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched a really decent chunk, I was there most of the day after all. Wish I could recall exactly how many but this was last year so that detail is a bit too fuzzy. It's not a bad show really, there were some parts that made me laugh. I think the reason I couldn't get into it was because it's a kid's show and I've never been able to get into kid's shows as an adult (couldn't get into adventure time for the same reason). I do think I would have given it a bigger chance if I had decided to watch it of my own accord rather than being pressured into it, but honestly I don't think I'd watch it of my own accord. </p></div>		</li>

<p>i really hate it when you're watching something with someone and they keep looking at you for a reaction, so something funny happens and they laugh and look at you so you have to let out a delayed &quot;heh&quot;, fuck that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I hate watching things with a particular friend, if he's seen it before. He loves re-watching things and showing me things, and the whole time he's watching me to see how I react. </p>
<p>It just makes you feel so pressured to enjoy it! And we don't always even share the same sort of humour. I also react to humour differently, I might think something is hilarious but not outwardly laugh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is hate it when someone says something is amazing hilarious... it's all about those expectations. It is why I don't watch trailers anymore, I would prefer going knowing nothing than have a hint and expectations. </p></div>		</li>
