			<div class="markdown"><p>The change is still really tiny. Even if you jumped out of the ISS, you wouldn't suddenly &quot;fall&quot; out of orbit, you'd just go into a slightly different orbit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think that's a pretty horrifying reality that people don't often consider -- if you moved away from your spacecraft even slightly, and didn't have the ability to generate thrust &amp; move back toward it, you wouldn't necessarily spin off into space... you'd just slowly, slowly drift away, at even as little as a few meters a day, in relatively the same orbit. You'd <del>die of dehydration</del> suffocate (good point /u/ZeroSchool) before you even lost sight of the surface from which you'd pushed off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's clear, but isn't the temporary small momentum change enough to take it a little off trajectory during the short time, before the astronaut touches the other side? Or does it not matter how much time elapses before the momentum is equalised again? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Put another way, if an astronaut was outside the ISS and pushed off it, then the station's trajectory would permanently change. The momentum of the combined &quot;screwed astronaut&quot;-&quot;undermanned space station&quot; system is still the same but now if we look only at the &quot;undermanned space station&quot; then its momentum is different than it was before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I understand that as well. But my question was more about the closed system. If the astronaut pushes against the wall on one side, then floats and floats (I'm imagining a spacey spacecraft), then, in the mean time, the spacecraft has changed momentum. Couldn't it be that the amount of time with the changed momentum could have been enough to change the trajectory in such a way that the astronaut arriving at the other side of the spacey spacecraft isn't enough of a correction to make up for it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the <em>whole</em> of the station (i.e. the station body with the things and people in it) there can be no momentum change at all, the trajectory of the centre of mass remains unchanged.</p>
<p>The temporary changes caused by movement of the astronauts inside it affect the offset of the station walls compared to that center of mass - an astronaut moving 1 meter to some direction would offset the rest of the station by ~0.2 millimeters (1 yard vs less than hundredth of an inch in imperial units) to the opposite direction, without changing the trajectory of the whole system (station+astronauts+stuff). And, more importantly, the offset is limited - if that astronaut ever moves back, this will corrects the change, it can't accumulate over time (well, unless you stack all the movable stuff at one end of the station - but there's a limit to how much you can move).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the resolution to this is to realise that the occupant pushing off one wall and the subsequent impacting of the opposite wall are <em>not</em> necessarily equal and opposite impulses, because they're not simultaneous.</p>
<p>Suppose I push off prograde. I slow the station down a bit, lowering its orbit, and speed myself up raising my orbit. But this means that as we move together I won't just be going forward through the station but also upwards. I then won't hit the opposite wall square-on but rather at a bit of an angle, and that will bring us back together and essentially undo the &quot;a little off trajectory&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The station is spinning since it is tidally fixed to the earth(same side always facing towards earth) so a treadmill or other rotating mass could act as a gyro and mess with this rotation.</p></div>		</li>
