			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not taken physics since high school. Can someone explain how the mosquitos' low mass protects them from the rain? How is this scenario different from me being hit by a train? Hitting me would cause almost no change in momentum to the train, yet even with the world's strongest armor on, I would immediately explode into tiny pieces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAB, but mosquitoes and other insects are much more sturdy than mammals <em>at scale</em>.  <strong>But</strong> due to the square-cube rule, that physiology can only really work up to certain sizes before it can't function.  For example, IIRC the insectoid and arachnid don't have a central respiratory/circulatory system.  If a spider were to get too large, it would become unable to breathe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Invertebrates of that type have an open circulatory system in which a heart pumps hemolymph, a combined blood and interstitial fluid, throughout the body directly bathing organs in oxygen. So yes, at a larger scale that system would not work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>F=ma. As the mosquito has small mass it takes very little force to accelerate to the speed of the raindrop, as which point the force stops acting. The exoskeleton is more than strong enough to stop damage from such a small force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those words do not actually exist in the quote, but are added by the poster to help explain the meaning. This is a good middle ground between total paraphrasing and very lengthy exact quotes. It helps extract only the important quote parts while making it easy to check that the meaning was represented in good faith.  </p>
<p>And the ellipses ... mean there is some quote words skipped at that spot, which may be a single word or entire pages.</p></div>		</li>
