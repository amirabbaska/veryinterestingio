			<div class="markdown"><p>Volcanic plumbing systems are complex beasts; there can be a multitude of interconnected magma reservoirs. As you depressurise one system there is potential to destabilise other parts of the system, which can trigger new pulses of activity We know of 3 or 4 eruptions from Agung in the last 200 years or so; 2 of them were large Plinian-type eruptions. The general consensus is that there has certainly been enough time for sufficient magma to accumulate for another large eruption. What we don't know is whether that magma is still mobile enough to erupt (e.g. has it cooled down or not?), or where any such magma sits in relation to the currently tapped magma reservoir system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I can add on to HugodeGroot's question and your great response - Is this continual eruption over the days/weeks its been going increase, decrease, or make no difference for the risks of an eventual &quot;large&quot; Plinian type eruption. As in, does the longer this relatively mild eruption continues for decrease the pressure/load on the volcano, making it safer as time goes on? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Impossible to say unfortunately. It will depend on <em>if</em> there is a large eruptable batch down there (which we don't know) and how it might or might not be connected.</p></div>		</li>
