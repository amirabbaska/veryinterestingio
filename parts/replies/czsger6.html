			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you 100% sure about this? In our lab we have been phasing out of 40% ethanol as a sterilization method, because all the recent research suggests you need 40% ethanol in contact with bacteria for 15 minutes to kill it, so I would think that listerine with a much lower concentration could only kill bacteria through the alcohol alone with 30 minute or more contact...</p>
<p>Okay guys it's on the freaking listerine website, the mechanism of bactericidal action is the essential oils: <a href="http://www.listerineprofessional.co.uk/why-recommend-listerine/science-listerine/mode-of-action" target="_blank">http://www.listerineprofessional.co.uk/why-recommend-listerine/science-listerine/mode-of-action</a></p>

<p>antibiotics are like killing someone with poison. Allow time and given with the large base population, there would be eventually a rise in population in those who are naturally(genetic mutation) immune to it. </p>
<p>Alcohol on the other hand is like killing someone with a baseball bat. You can't be immune to physical trauma.</p>

<p>Edit: Christ you guys are nitpicky. The baseball bat is just a placeholder for a physical object. That's why I followed it with 'you can't be immune to physical trauma'. Yes a resistance towards baseball bats would probably eventually be developed.</p>

<p>Cooler still, we already know a way to metabolize oxygen that cyanide can't interrupt (the way it usually kills you).  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_oxidase" target="_blank">Alternative oxidase</a> is a pathway that's totally cyanide resistant.  I don't know of any living organism that's solidly 'fireproof'.</p>
<p>Of course, if you already tried the experiment I doubt you'll be reading this...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The above, and other answers are good.  Just going to add that the &quot;99%&quot; or whatever percentage they state that will be killed is due to the coverage of the alcohol.  That is, it kills 100% of the bacteria it touches, and it touches about 99% of what you are trying to kill, NOT that 1% is touched but somehow impervious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not for liability, it's a microbiology thing. Bacteria grow exponentially when they are in a good environment. When you say &quot;it killed 99%&quot; or &quot;it killed 99,99%&quot;, it's actually a huge difference.</p>
<p>Say you have 10 million stinky bacteria attacking your molar. </p>
<p>You quickly brush your teeth in the morning, it kills 99% of them. It means you now have 100,000 bacteria on your tooth. Let's say they divide once every hour. So every hour, you'll have twice as much bacteria as the hour before. How quickly does the bacterial population reaches the same level as when you had morning breath ?</p>

<p>The same reasoning is applied to antibiotics, which is why an antibiotic who kills 99% of bacteria is shitty compared to one who kills 99,99%. Those decimal nines are really, really important when you're talking about bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about liability, it's the scientific method how to measure the disinfecting properties of a chemical. This is measured in reduction of bacteria. 99.9% sounds like much, but imagine just how freaking many bacteria there are. Out of 1000 bacteria, one survives. really not that impressive when there can easily be 10^8 bacteria before you can even see them with the naked eye. IIRC good disinfectants, like the one used in hospitals have 99.99% kill rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well damn, I've apparently been doing it wrong my whole life.  I only use Listerine once a day, even though I brush 2-3 times a day (the alcohol irritates my mouth if used too frequently).  </p>
<p>When using Listerine, I floss first, then rinse with mouthwash, and then brush, and then follow up with a fluoride rinse.  I always reasoned that Listerine after flossing would help kill any bacteria that could get into any micro-tears or micro-abrasions made from flossing.</p>
