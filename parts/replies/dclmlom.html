			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think their is a satisfying answer of what space is other than the mathematical structures used to describe it. Space is actually space-time and is behaviour is intimately tied to the energy-density present at any particular point. Space is where everything happens. It's a set of points whose values determine the behaviour of entities embedded in it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, is space discrete? Can it be measured? Does it have mass? Is it a &quot;thing&quot; ? I don't really understand HOW space is expanding when it's nothing. It makes no sense. I mean, from my frame of reference, everyone seems to be saying that everything is made of nothing. </p>
<p>Tying the notion of &quot;space&quot; to the arrow of time seems to be an arbitrary construct so that we can have a framework in which we can measure what we observe. But it doesn't seem to be an actual &quot;thing&quot;.  I just don't understand it. I want to. But I just can't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can tell you that space-time is not an arbitrary thing and is integral to the theory of relativity. Space and time change together when in the presence of mass-energy. Mass-energy makes straight lines different to different observers and makes the rate of time flow different to different observers.</p>
<p>I just don't have a satisfying explanation of what space-time actually is other than saying read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> article for how it is formulated in relativity.</p>
<p>We have very good models of how space-time behaves but I can't give you a good conceptual idea of it. String theory tries with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane" target="_blank"><em>branes</em></a> and the like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Maybe it's just because I'm a dumb human, but how could there be &quot;Infinite&quot; of anything?! The top thread says how there could possibly be an infinite number of galaxies. I'm sure there's so many I couldn't even begin to comprehend, I can't possibly see how it could just go on forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of hard to explain without getting deep into some serious maths. Our belief that the universe <em>could</em> be infinite is based on the fact that the math we use to model and describe spacetime allows for the possibility of infinite space if certain criteria are met; e.g. the energy density of the universe is such that it is either flat or open in geometry, isn't folded back in on or connected to itself in strange ways, etc.</p>
<p>Personally, I find an infinite universe to make more intuitive sense than a universe with a definite edge, or that isn't simply connected. Of course, it's entirely possible the universe is finite and spherical, or even torus-shaped, but much of modern cosmology operates under the assumption that the universe is flat and infinite.</p>
<p>(Note: Just to avoid confusion, &quot;flat&quot; in this context means that 3D space at any given moment has the same geometric properties as a flat 2D Euclidean plane, not that it is literally flat like Flatland.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can something be infinite and have no end, but is expanding?  That completely blows my mind.  It's like a stick that is infinite in length.  You can't make that longer can you?  Or is it more like there is extra stuff being created in space and it's pushing the space that's already there apart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, isn't it one of the laws of thermodynamics that things tend to go from a state of order to disorder within a closed system? If space is infinite and constantly expanding between points -- the universe wouldn't be a closed system which would go against thermodynamic law with respect to entropy. At least, that's how my refrigeration Jedi mind sees it. I just turn wrenches man and eliminate heat from within closed systems </p></div>		</li>
