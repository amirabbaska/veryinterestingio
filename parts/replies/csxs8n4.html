			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true. Washington state resident ... during the fall, we buy a large box of apples. We keep them in the garage. They last about 3 months in pretty dang near close to pristine condition. Apples are from the tree and not treated with anything. The ones that start to get soft we turn into apple sauce and apple butter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A small quibble - a 'cellar' would be referred to as 'common storage' (in the trade) - 'cold storage' would refer to a refrigerated room - and then there are 'CA storages', a refrigerated room where the atmosphere is modified to lower respiration resulting in fruit being held in near 'suspended animation' - the latest advancement is the use of 1-MCP, it binds to ethylene receptor sites and prevents ethylene (a naturally occurring growth hormone produced within the apple) from precipitation certain chemical reactions, resulting in apples that age very slowly - </p></div>		</li>
