			<div class="markdown"><p>Amtrak was a consolidation resulting from declining rail usage and increase in car and air traffic. However, it's not clear that Amtrak was intended to &quot;make rail great again&quot;. It has been argued that Amtrak was created to put a final close to passenger rail. If not for the success in the Northeast it's hard to say what Amtrak would be today.</p>
<p>The 2015 crash is probably a better example of what's wrong with rail today. Large capital investments are needed for improvements that are very well understood, but action by Congress is required. It's kind of disgusting how this seems to be largely ignored. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/how-congress-caused-the-amtrak-crash" target="_blank">http://www.thedailybeast.com/how-congress-caused-the-amtrak-crash</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a lot of respect for Elon, but as a scientist explains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVJvpNyjdc" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNFesa01llk" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDwe2M-LDZQ" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXF2qcu-tFw" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z48pSwiDLIM" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQXqeWKY2Fc" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wCooveugEw" target="_blank">here</a>, there are problems intrinsic to the hyperloop that make it a really bad idea that won't make it 'the next big thing'. The most obvious issue of which is that one failure in part of the system can destroy the entire hyperloop system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the issue that the hyperloop really doesn't solve any of the problems high speed rail in America has, while costing a fuck ton more.  It literally costs more, does less, all for one upside of &quot;more speed&quot; when high speed rail is already in the awkward &quot;fast but not fast enough for the cost&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not how it works with a vacuum tube unless its a very, very tiny leak that happens gradually. A single bullet hole can be enough to <em>rapidly</em> destroy the entire system. Unless you can quickly seal off parts of the system with seals that can remain vacuum tight when hit with a powerful shock wave traveling at about the speed of sound, the damage probably can't be contained to one part of the system.</p>
<p>The fact that <strong>one failure can destroy the entire hyperloop system</strong> is a critical flaw in the idea. If the same thing happens on an airplane, most people will probably survive (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha_Airlines_Flight_243" target="_blank">Aloha Airlines Flight 243</a>), and the damage will be limited to that particular plane, and will often be repairable. And that will only happen if the relatively little skin on an aircraft fails.</p>
<p>On the other hand the, huge skin of the hyperloop system has to span all the way from the source to destination for every city it goes to. If any of it fails, which could happen from gunshots, a car crash that hits the hyperloop, and many other causes that are less likely to happen to planes tens of thousands of feet in the air, it will likely kill everyone on that system and destroy the entire system. If you make a hyperloop line from LA to San Francisco, a failure in one part will likely total that entire line and kill everyone on it. That's like if the skin on one airplane fails, everyone on every flight dies, and all airplanes are destroyed.</p>
<p>I have a lot of respect for Elon Musk, but this this particular idea is a really bad one that isn't even new. It's been rejected in the past for good reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say &quot;Amtrak is fairly new&quot;, and I suspect you mean in relation to other train companies, but it's worth pointing out that Amtrak has been around since 1971(46 years ago), and, even then, was created as a union of twenty existing passenger rail lines, many of which had existed for decades before that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes you're right. &quot;fairly new&quot; compared to Union Pacific which was founded in 1862. Even then, the &quot;new&quot; argument is a bit hollow since BNSF is only from 1995. More accurately, it should read that Freight companies own 95 % of the tracks. </p></div>		</li>
