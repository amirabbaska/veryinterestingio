<p>So are there predators out there whose prey died off, and they're just naturally immune to neurotoxins and nobody will ever know?</p>
<p>We've gotta start testing random animals' resistances to neurotoxin.</p>
<p>Wait no don't do that WAIT NO STOP BAD STOP</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never thought of it like that, but yeah, I'm sure there are species out there with natural toxic resistances from a long dead food supply, and vice versa. All we'll need is veritable Noah's arc and a scientist with no morals, and maybe we'll find some useful antidotes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was gonna say this could be a factor in play. I think there are a few cases in nature where there is a pair of predator/prey that have a stupidly toxic poison and a stupidly high tolerance to that poison respectively. It's an evolutionary arms race and they stick out like sore thumbs compared to everything else in their environment.</p></div>		</li>
