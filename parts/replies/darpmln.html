			<div class="markdown"><p>Please please please ensure your DNS is not leaking when you are using a VPN provider. You can test it at <a href="https://dnsleaktest.com/" target="_blank">dnsleaktest.com</a>. If it's leaking, then your history will still exist at the ISP for the sites you visit(no content). Also a fair amount of VPN providers do a poor job at configuring it securely and often publish end points on their website. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I have no advice as to which providers are best because I set up my own servers. Be advised that even if you don't care about privacy, I would strongly recommend using one regardless to secure yourself in shared/open wireless networks.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with a VPN, if the government is requiring the VPN to give them all your info, then the government will see all of your activity through the VPN. Using a VPN service to access websites <em>only</em> encrypts your outgoing traffic from your computer to the VPN server, then the traffic goes out <em>un</em>encrypted from the VPN server to whatever website you're visiting. It's the same thing in reverse for traffic coming to you from the website.</p>
<p>Someone snooping from the VPN server will see your unencrypted traffic, know where it's going, and know where it came from (unless you do something else to hide those details, like use Tor in addition to a VPN).</p></div>		</li>
