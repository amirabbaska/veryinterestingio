			<div class="markdown"><p>Pseudopad is right that it doesn't work with the middle finger either. I think this has something to do with the ligaments between the hand and the fingers. They're fan shaped and relaxed when your fingers are straight out, but curling your fingers under tightens them and restricts other movements. The index finger, little finger, and thumb all have additional extensor muscles (the ones that let you lift your fingers up), so they're stronger. The middle &amp; ring finger only have one muscle that lifts the finger up.</p></div>		</li>
