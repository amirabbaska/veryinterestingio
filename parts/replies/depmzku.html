			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the bacteria and algae are not always removed from the water depending upon the process used to treat it. Drinking water is not kept under sterile conditions, that would be too expensive. The algae is still there in low numbers until you give it an energy source, light, which promotes growth. The bacteria present in the water are slow-growing, non-pathogenic and do not pose any problems.  These water-loving bacteria are different from the fecal bacteria that often contaminate water supplies or other waterborne pathogens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not really accurate. Even the phrase 100% clean water is a little bit non sense. There's always going to be impurities in water such as minerals and nutrients. And even if it was 100% pure, algae wouldn't grow in it, because they need those nutrients to grow. Ground water and water from mountain springs is often perfectly drinkable, and does not need any treatment before bottling. In holland we get our tap water from ground water or a specific nature area, and this water has higher quality standards than we have for bottled water. Maybe it's necessary to purify water in other areas, but I find it a little bit hard to believe that these companies would go through the hassle. Water treatment is quite expensive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a chemistry professor that went on at length about the trouble he had getting pure H2O for an experiment. Even exposure to any gas will basically cause the gas to diffuse in to the water so apparently it was a giant pain in the ass. First question asked by the class? Well how did it taste. Not very good apparently. You want <em>some</em> stuff dissolved in your water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>contradicting yourself. &quot;often&quot; &quot;does not need any treatment&quot;...so it does?</p>

<p>bottled water market is huge, I assure you if you let people choose between tap water and bottled water, they will choose bottled water.</p>

<p>The bottle costs more than the water itself, so its a good market. But yes, the initial cost for the machines is high.</p></div>		</li>
