			<div class="markdown"><p>Warming up does not necessarily mean stretching. Studies have shown a correlation between pre-cardio static stretching and increased injury risk during cardio, so most fitness experts now recommend dynamic stretching (like walking or other low-intensity cardio) as a warm up for high-intensity cardio. This, combined with static stretching after cardio, has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of injury during exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just for stretching, not warming up in general. I haven't stretched in ages cause it is akin to loosening your serpentine belt in your car, but warming up can be many different things. I climb, and my warm-up for a climbing workout is just running easy routes, for running, I just jog slowly for the first bit,  etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>12 year old me didn't understand that at the time. I just looked at a warm-up as something that just made you more tired before you start playing. So I didn't see the point of it.</p></div>		</li>
