			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth is a little bit unique in its atmospheric layers, largely because of its ozone layer.</p>
<p>What makes a troposphere a troposphere is that temperature decreases with height, largely because it's being heated from below as heat escapes the planet. Similarly, what makes a stratosphere a stratosphere is that temperature <em>increases</em> with height, largely because it's being heated from top down as solar radiation and high-energy solar particles impact the top of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The result is that if you look at a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pVjfOlf.jpg" target="_blank">graph of temperature vs. height</a> for other planets, you see a really similar &quot;C&quot;-shaped pattern emerge across them; the troposphere is below the coldest height, the stratosphere is above the coldest height.</p>
<p>For Earth, though, there's another source of heating: the ozone layer. This produces a third source of heating right in the middle atmosphere as ozone molecules absorb ultraviolet light, and ends up producing a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8DZmUsc.png" target="_blank">different shaped temperature vs. height profile</a> that's more of a &quot;âˆ‘&quot;-shaped profile than a &quot;C&quot;-shaped profile that reflects that middle source of heating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really true - there's good evidence to suggest that Jupiter does have a solid core of rock and exotic ice that's around 20 Earth-masses.</p>
<p>Also, so far as we can tell from our best equations of state, there also <em>is</em> a pretty clear boundary between the liquid metallic hydrogen mantle and the overlying supercritical molecular hydrogen layer just above it.</p></div>		</li>
