<p>I believe skin pigments absorb UV light and protect your skin from UV related damage. I have NO SOURCE but infer that dark skinned people need more sunlight than lighter skinned people to produce enough vitamin D. This is an adaptation for populations who developed closer to the equator (lots of sun, dark skin) and those who developed at high latitudes (much less sunlight, light skin).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really liked your explanation, but as a history buff, I'd like to point out a few things. Northern Europeans were not the first people to have cheese, nor were they the originators of western civilization. Agriculture and domestication began in the Near East (Ancient Iraq, Syria etc) and they utilized their sheep for milk and cheese, (Sheep being the first domesticated herd animal) while creating massive cities and infrastructure while the Europeans were sitting in tents or mud huts hunting deer. Sure, groups like the Scythians who were a nuisance to the Assyrians existed, but they never had infrastructure and true &quot;Civilization&quot;. Civilization (and cheese) originated in the Ancient Near East. Greeks then borrowed civilization from them, (And Greeks loved their cheese, and had plenty of fish and in their diet and ample sunlight) And then later the Romans borrowed civilization from the Greeks and spread it to Northern Europe.</p>
<p>Edit: Hey guys, big qualifiers I need to add. When I talk about &quot;Civilization&quot; I'm only referring to western civilization. There are many plausible theories that chinese and other eastern Asian civilizations formed without much outside influence.</p>
<p>I'm also not saying that cheese started in the Ancient Near East and spread from there, just that it came up there first, and none of the reasons pertaining to Vitamin D really apply to the Ancient Near East. It seems like the answer to why cheese came about anywhere is just that it was sustainable (and tasty). We know that sheep were domesticated around 11000-9000 BCE, because of the influx of young male skeletons, and no similar increase in young female skeletons. This is because females can give you milk, something that the hunter/gatherers probably already knew. And making cheese is just a logical step to take once you have milk.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not trying to claim that the earliest buildings or civilizations are in Europe, however, I feel that your flippant statement suggests later structure building in Europe than is actually the case. Many of the oldest structures in the world are in Europe and do not look like they were exported from the near east. There are quite a few structures in Europe which predate the Assyrian Empire by thousands of years. On a tangential note, it will be very interesting to see what is discovered in &quot;Doggerland.&quot;</p>

<p>You also suggest that Europe got cheese making from the Near East when the oldest evidence of cheese making in the archaeological record is from what is now Poland in 5500 BCE. It is totally possible that the first cheese was made in the Near East from sheep, the first recorded domesticated animals, but you state conjecture as fact.</p>

<p>You start out establishing some sort of authority and then spit out a paragraph that I imagine a lot of historians would be ashamed of. I'm not trying to debunk you point-by-point or suggest that you are wrong about stuff; your simplifications and assumptions are not very scholarly and imply a &quot;backwardness&quot; to ancient Europe that is no more accurate than what Europeans often wrote about Native Americans because of the different shape and texture of their civilization. </p>
<p>I'm not history buff like yourself, I just went to wikipedia, but I take issue with your comment because you imply that your &quot;history buff&quot; status confers authority as you  &quot;point out a few things&quot; in a manner that is not consistent with the nature of authority you claim.</p>
<p>Civilization, like mutations and farming, arose more than once and in more than one place taking more than one form.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course there are structures that predate the Assyrians, as they were 9th century. But I don't think that's entirely relevant... Structures do not imply civilization. Apart from some tombs in France, there doesn't seem to be anything that rivals the scale of civilization in the Near East.</p>
<p>You're right though, I was very reductionist and used simplistic stayements. As I would do that in casual conversation, and then we could dive into any simplistic statement with a much more thorough analysis.</p>
<p>I never said cheese couldn't have come up on its own in Northern Europe just that the place where it most likely came up first was in the near east. Where the first domestication of herd animals took place. I didn't actually know about the 5500 BCE Poland mark. I study the near east in much more detail than Northern Europe.</p>
<p>My issues really revolved around your claims that vitamin D and the lack of sunlight played a much bigger role than it did. Sure, that helped, and the people who consumed the cheese figured out that it might have something to do with them being healthier... But cheese eating can really be explained in a &quot;Occam's Razer&quot; type statement. You get more food out of a sheep if you harvest it's milk and not just kill it. The reason we actually knew that sheep were domesticated is the skeletons found. When an animal gets domesticated, you get a much higher rate of young male skeletons than female. Specifically because the females could produce milk, and cheese. Creating cheese is simply the next logical thing that happens when you have a herd animal whose milk you harvest.</p>
<p>What you have to remember now though is, they had no idea about specific sugars And lactose and lactase. They drank animal milk because they didn't want to be hungry.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He didn't really even suggest N Europeans were the first or only cheese-producing culture, he just used them as the exemplar of a cheese-producing culture in order to contrast with E Asians as an exemplar of a non-cheese-producing culture. </p>
<p>You've got a point that N Europeans aren't really the originators of Western Civilization, but the dividing line line between Ancient Near-Eastern Civilization and early Western Civilization is incredibly fuzzy. I'd argue that, because Western Civilization today is primarily populated by people of N European decent, his characterization can be justified in this instance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an East Asian person that can drink milk and out-drink many Irish, I am a legendary anomaly of the Gods. Either that or my mom cheated on my dad or something.</p>
<p>But my mom can drink milk is the thing. But being closely related to Mongolians (most Koreans would have lineage traced back to modern Mongolia than mainland China now) this makes sense too.</p>
<p>From what I've read, Mongolia does have some cheese but it's a really bitter, awful tasting hard cheese. So when people described cheese when it came to Asia from westerners, people probably thought it'd resemble that and understandably run far, far away. Because why bother with crappy food when you have so many rich flavors to sample from within your own cuisine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting.  I've avoided addressing any comments regarding specific Asian cultures because i don't know enough about them.  I do know that the Mongolians were historically very dairy heavy due to their northern latitude, distance from coastal fishing populations, and heavy use of labor animals - I had no idea Koreans traced lineage to them, very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese can probably link back to Mongolia as well genetically since Korean and Japanese are unique among languages as Altaic languages that include Turkish and Mongolian. Mongolians have a lot of features that some say would distinguish them from the Japanese, but Japanese are ethnically basically Mongolians as well plus aboriginal groups to those islands, so that'd make the differences whatever the aboriginal groups contributed I'd  think. It's doubtful that group ever domesticated animals given there weren't much to domesticate besides.... monkeys.</p>
<p>But lactose intolerance isn't particularly prevalent anymore among Japanese after decades of adding milk to their diets at the decree of an imperialist West-worshipping Emperor obsessed with trying to copy Western conquests for the Japanese in Asia. The guy literally thought that Westerners could fight better because they ate cheese. Butter was adopted pretty readily by Koreans since they could actually eat it due to lower lactose content, but nobody really uses butter for cooking anything in Korean cuisine - there just wasn't a need or obsession with it. America around that time, in contrast, had an ice cream obsession for years that led to overproduction of dairy practically. Younger Koreans tend to be able to drink milk partly from so much dang yakult everywhere you'd think it was government-mandated or something like Soma.</p>
<p>I never thought that Mongolians were major users of labor animals aside from the obvious horses. The one cheese I'm aware of is some hard, salty, sour block of nasty from goat or horse milk. To my understanding, they lived closer to North American plains aboriginals than traditional farmers and fishermen of medieval Japan and Korea and I don't recall cheese having been consumed anywhere in the Americas either. I never got the impression that they'd done much raising of animals for farming given so much of Mongolia is not the most fertile soil, which is really similar to the soil in the Southwest US. In contrast, Japan and Korea have tons of rich soil and farming has been insanely important historically with major diversity of crops.</p>
<p>There was an empire associated with Korea called Koguryo that extended much further west into Mongolia and China. This at least linguistically links Mongolia with Korea with a time period of communication stronger than China's because China literally didn't exist (this was about 50 AD, Qin Shi Huangti was like 250 AD). Add in records of old Korean that had F and Z phonemes as recently as the 14th century that have disappeared but still exist in Japanese and you can probably pull a Prometheus and get an old Mongolian dialect or two out of it.</p></div>		</li>
