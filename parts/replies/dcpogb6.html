<p>For me the key is to find people who are interested in helping you with your goals. And that only happens when you provide value to them. I am always willing to pick up little side projects to help others. It helps folks who are in a jam and it gives an opportunity to show your talents.  </p>
<p>My current role is due to helping someone out with a couple side projects a few years ago. He got promoted to VP/GM level, remembered me and offered me to help me a in new career working for him. This is now my 5th career change in the company. </p></div>		</li>
