			<div class="markdown"><p>I had mine corrected 10+ years ago. At the time it cost about $2200. before the surgery I could not read the E on the eye chart. That big letter at the top of the chart. I haven't looked at a chart in a while, but last I recall I was able to hit 20/20 with my left eye and a little worse with my right in good light. In low light my precision suffers a bit and I can get halos and such around street lights.</p>
<p>That said, I haven't used any corrective lens of any sort since then and I was able to take classes in university lecture halls without any issue. </p>
<p>If you have the money, I highly suggest the surgery. ...assuming you are at least 20 and your body/eyes are done growing.</p>
<p>The actual procedure is quick. I think the consultation took longer. The most uncomfortable part of the laser is the smell of burning flesh. Afterwards, you have to rest your eyes for about a day (they tape patches on your eyes) and give you painkillers. Before they put the patches on I could see perfectly, so I knew the surgery worked. Also, for me there wasn't much pain, but my eyes itched like crazy!! Opioids made it more than tolerable.</p>
<p>That is the extent of the unpleasantness. Just takes money, a day or two to recover, and some discomfort. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the informative reply! I'm in my early 20s but have deteriorating vision - every eye exam requires a new prescription. So I might do what my brother is looking into, a $3500 surgery that comes with a lifetime guarantee. If your need the procedure again, you pay nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BTW option two for anyone that couldn't face this surgery: There are now soft contact lenses available that you put in at the start of the month and leave in for the month. There are no issues sleeping in them.</p>
<p>They're not the cheapest, but they are super comfortable and hugely convenient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth. Every. Penny. </p>
<p>I've commented this before but the best things I've electively spent money on body wise are lasik and my iuds. The only thing I regret with my eye surgery was not doing it sooner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with you on that - had it done in my early 30's (almost 50 now) and should have done it in my 20's - all those years of struggling with contacts and glassess, what a waste :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another eye surgery person here. It's been amazing and had totally improved my life. </p>
<p>For those worrying Lasik, especially if you have high prescriptions (before correction I was at around -7, literally as blind as a rat), there is an alternative - implanted collimar lens. It's basically a permanent &quot;contact&quot; lens that they implanted behind my cornea. Recovery is much much much faster than Lasik, and I have fewer issues with night vision than I would have with Lasik. It can be more expensive however, but ask your eye doc about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wear those. They work upside down, but the problem with them is that they tend to misalign if I get tired, dry eyes, or I get sick or dehydrated and my eyeballs shrink or swell too much. I imagine they might not work very well for that reason. They're way better than anything else I've ever tried, though. I have reliable 20/18 vision with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found a good brand. I've got astigmatism in both eyes. Every time I'd shift quickly from horizontal to vertical they wouldn't adjust fast enough so I spent a lot of time adjusting them with my fingers( yes gross). In addition as a woman , I noticed being on birth control changed my blood pressure a bit and also changed the focus during different times of the month. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will still suck most likely. Astronauts have lots of issues because of the lack of gravity (stuffy sinuses for instance), I can easily imagine that dry eyes would also be an issue with air being scrubbed and probably pretty low humidity to prevent condensation. Better off wearing glasses IMO.</p></div>		</li>
