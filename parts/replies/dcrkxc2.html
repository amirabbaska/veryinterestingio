			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so please correct me if I'm wrong. I'm a little confused. So, the shittiness we're feeling isn't directly from the flu but rather the body fighting the flu off? If our bodies didn't do these things to fight it off would we even notice the flu? Or would it kill us? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's mostly a result of our body reacting to the flu infecting our cells. It's not perfect by any means, it's just the body's best way of dealing with a virus it hasn't encountered before. When a foreign infection (bacterial or viral) enters your body, it's first response is a very general &quot;purge and destroy&quot; reaction; it generates mucus, raises your temperature, and tries to expel the invader by any means necessary. Unfortunately there's a lot of collateral damage because the body doesn't quite know what it's up against yet, so the immune response is very widespread. Once the body is familiar with a particular strain of virus, it can adapt to combat it by producing antibodies specific to that virus and attacking it very precisely. Think of carpet bombing a town of suspected terrorists vs carrying out targeted assassinations. Anyways this is why a second infection from the same virus is rare, or even impossible to get, and why vaccines are effective at protecting us from diseases we've never encountered.</p>
<p>To more specifically answer your question, if our body didn't take these measures the virus would slowly hijack our cells bit by bit until our bodily functions eventually stopped working and we died. It has to start strong with a very broad and powerful immune response because it doesn't know what it's dealing with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's really interesting!!
Another question: you say foreign object when talking about the flu. I understand there are many different types of influenza. So does that mean each time we get the flu and react to it it's a new kind? Also, does that mean sometimes we come in contact with the flu virus but because we have antibodies our bodies don't react to it like it would have if it were brand new? Sorry if that's a dumb question this is just really fascinating and I'm curious! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how resilient the virus is. Most viruses have a fairly limited temperature tolerance, beyond which their proteins and nucleic acids begin to degenerate. Your own body's cells are a little more resilient but still sensitive to increased temperature, so the hope when you get a fever is that the heat will kill off all or most of the viral cells before it damages your own cells too badly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That I'm not sure of. Could be though? In general, it's beneficial for a virus to go nearly unnoticed by the human body; if it irritates your tissues or begins to harm you, the body springs into action to get rid of it. If it's mild enough to just give you a runny nose and sneezing/coughing symptoms, your body's attempt to expel it could be helping it find a new host.</p></div>		</li>
