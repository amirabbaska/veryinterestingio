			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's how it works. A lot of it has to do with our own knowledge of what should be called or what would be called, but when in doubt we always award points in favour of the player.</p>
<p>Example: if I'm not sure if a guard or draw was called and the rock is in the house, then I mark it as a draw and full points are awarded. </p></div>		</li>
