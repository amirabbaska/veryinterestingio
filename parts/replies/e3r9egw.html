			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think what would happen is an existing chromosome breaks into two during the first replication cycle in the fertilized egg and this gets passed on.  This would not introduce any problems with over expression of genes from duplicated DNA and new genes could then get added to the new chromosome.  The existing genes are just on a different chromosome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it kind of copies itself twice and then is used as a placeholder for new genes as the old ones aren't expressed due to being duplicates?</p>
<p>What causes Down syndrome then? Isn't that an extra duplicate of 21?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Almost always.  Nearly all mutations <em>which are expressed</em> (ARE YOU HAPPY NOW, u/MOZEETOBY?  ARE YOU!?), which this would be, are deleterious - they inhibit the organism's ability to survive.  The vast majority of mutations, at least in mammals, result in spontaneous abortion.  The mother's body realizes very quickly that things ain't right, so fetus goes bye-bye.</p>
<p>However, in an extremely small portion of mutations (which, once again, chromosomal disruption would be), the results don't immediately kill the organism.  In a subset of the mutations which don't result in near-immediate non-life, a small portion result in alterations which don't disadvantage the organism.  In a subset of <em>those</em> mutations, a small portion of alterations are *actually* beneficial (Something like a gene that codes for the production of a very specific protein gets replicated onto multiple chromosomes, resulting in that organism producing that protein in adverse circumstances, causing a competitive advantage).</p>
<p>So yes, a mutation which alters the number of chromosomes in an organism is almost always, like, 99.99999999999% of the time,  deleterious.  But just sometimes, very rarely, that mutation actually helps.</p>
<p>> How does this affect bone marrow and blood / T-Cell production?</p>
<p>If the genes that are replicated aren't related to any of the various functions that go into those things, then they aren't affected at all.  That's a little bit reductionist to say because there is a lot of interaction among genes, and some genes don't actually code for any proteins themselves, they just cause other genes to be more active and things like that.  But the basis holds true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is an overstatement. Most mutations do little or nothing and aren't expressed enough to be easily noted in a living organism. Everyone has dozens to hundreds of mutations unique or nearly unique to them which have little to no impact on health or development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like ripping a textbook in two. If you rip it apart in the middle of a chapter, down the middle, lose some pages, or otherwise obscure the flow of text, it won't make sense. But if you tear it cleanly apart between chapters, so that no text is lost, both parts will still be useful and make sense on their own.</p>
<p>The gene disorders caused by trisomy/monosomy (having too many or too few chromosomes) or other chromosomal faults generally cause issues because they mean that proteins are overexpressed, underexpressed, or may not be able to be produced at all if both copies of a gene are split/damaged/nonsensical. It's not the fact that there is an extra/missing chromosome, it's the knock on effect of something not reading correctly so something useful is not produced in the right amount. As another stupid analogy, imagine doubling the amount of flour you use to bake a cake, or halving the cooking time- your cake may or may not be edible, but it won't come out right either way.</p>
<p>Like other people said I'm not quite sure what you mean about the marrow/blood/T cell production, but unless key genes involved in those pathways were damaged, perhaps nothing would happen. If genes important to the process did incur damage, those cells may be produced at a low rate, may be anomalous in shape or behaviour, or may be completely unable to form. Depending on specifics that may mean a foetus is not viable, or it may mean the foetus develops into an ill baby.</p></div>		</li>
