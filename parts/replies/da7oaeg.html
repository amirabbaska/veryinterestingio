			<div class="markdown"><p>Also not the person you asked, but I got my A&amp;P license with an 18 month course at East Coast Aero Tech in Massachusetts in 1991.  Interestingly, I am now a software developer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the replies above, you could also join the Air Force (country dependent, of course).  This is the route I went, particularly avionics systems on the F-16, and it has lead to an amazing career even on the civilian side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the guy you're replying to, I go to an AMT school. Four year program with a Bachelor's. Look up Part 147 maintenance schools. Alternatively, some aviation shops help you get an A&amp;P (Airframe and Powerplant) license after working a certain number of years. Check around your local airport for those.</p></div>		</li>
