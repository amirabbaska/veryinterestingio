<p>Not in California, but wildfires <em>are</em> capable of altering the weather to an even greater degree.  When a fire is large enough and the conditions are right, they can create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_flammagenitus_(cloud\)" target="_blank">pyrocumulonimbus cloud formation</a> in the sky over the flames which in a lot of cases rains on the fire and helps put it out, but it in even more rare circumstances it can in turn spawn an actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Canberra_bushfires#Canberra_Fire_Tornado" target="_blank">Fire Tornado</a>, which is exactly as terrifying as it sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool! I hadn't learned about the larger scale affects of ash clouds. I was always curious, but just thought it was never touched upon because the effect was negligible. </p></div>		</li>
