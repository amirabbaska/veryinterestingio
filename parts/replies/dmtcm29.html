			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been going through benzo withdrawal for the past 6 weeks now, and the past two weeks I have only noticed symptoms between 3AM-11AM. I noticed a similar pattern during opiate withdrawal in the past as well (of course at night when all you want is sleep, and everyone else is sleeping, so you feel more lonely and the insomnia both just make the symptoms feel worse). It seems around 3 or 4AM-11AM, new symptoms emerge and everything is hitting much harder. Any clue why this is?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Answers on the Internet are unreliable even if they are from experts. It could lead to false diagnosis from lack of info and prove more dangerous </p></div>		</li>
