			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow I did not know that this wasn't something everybody can do.</p>
<p>I can literally do this continuously and make different noises.  I get these different crackling sounds too and can move the muscle so that I hear only that or only the rushing sound or both.</p>
<p>I also contract that muscle to pop my ears or 'valsalva'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I don't know about the 'rushing wind sound' but I can pop both my ears individually or at the same time, as many times as I want. Always wondered what this was.</p></div>		</li>
