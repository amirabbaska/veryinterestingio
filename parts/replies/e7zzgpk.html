			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive fork lift trucks with solid rubber tires inside a warehouse with smooth, good-condition concrete floors ... you can <em>really</em> feel every crack and piece of debris you drive over.  God help you if you drive over something the size of a marble.  I drove over a 2x4&quot; board once and I thought I had broken my teeth, the impact was so hard (I didn't, but it was violent).</p>
<p>Now imagine that driving out on roads with a bunch of potholes and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a customer buy a new pickup truck and want the tires rubber filled, like we did with his forklifts. Told him it was a bad idea. Told us to do it anyway. Almost $1000 in rubber fill later, we sent him down the road. He made it two blocks before he came back begging us to remove the stuff.</p>
<p>We had to cut off the tires and sell him new ones. That rubber fill is serious shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to drive our forklift with smooth rubber tires outside.  I hit a crack like a 2x4 and I thought I was paralyzed.  The bounce was so hard it through the direction stalk into reverse, so I also came to a dead stop.  It was jarring to say the least lol.</p></div>		</li>
