			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm left eye dominant but right handed.  I was never encouraged or discouraged from using a particular hand.  I also grew up playing baseball though, and when you're batting righty, it makes more sense to be left eye dominant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Played ball for 12 years. Left eye dominant right handed. That being said though dominance can switch. I now shoot archery and my right eye is becoming more dominant as I refuse to shoot left handed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a buddy who surfs regular foot (right foot in back) but skateboards goody foot (left foot back) and can't switch between the two. He's a sponsored surfer and no schlep at skating. This one always blew my mind</p></div>		</li>
