			<div class="markdown"><p>What really amazes me is how I'll have a question, think to write an AskReddit or ELI5 post, realize it's much quicker to Google the answer, and then wonder why people ask reddit (other than for fake internet points). I understand certain things are better answered by a person but most questions can be answered with a quick google search. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get discussion on it sometimes or have it explained in different ways. Also, you can interact with the source and learn more by asking specific questions.</p>
<p>I get what you mean though, there are quite a few things asked that have a simple answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of a couple of TILs for me today. More than the OP, I think these discussions benefit the lurkers (like me), since we get to read about things that we never really thought to Google.</p>
<p>I have a lot of OPs to thank for choosing to voice their questions out here instead of doing a search.</p></div>		</li>
