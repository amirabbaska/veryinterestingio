			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely right that as a technical achievement in itself, it's very exciting. However, I would say that it also helps us develop models of how solar systems form and evolve. This has certainly been the case with exoplanets, where for instance we have discovered many gas giant planets much closer to their stars than any of the gas giants in our solar system (although selection bias of those being easier to detect has to be taken into account). Similarly, the candidate exomoon is itself around the size of Neptune, orbiting a Jupiter-sized planet - totally different from anything we see in our own solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And because it is different, it allows us to perfect, create or invalidate models of how planetary systems form.
Which in turn is great for predicting where to find what. Like life. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Astronomer or astrophysicist: &quot;Well, [technical answer of why it is actually interesting], so [drastic generalisation to the importance of half of the whole field like &quot;all of planetary/star formation&quot;], which could [hypothetical use], including possibly <em>discovering alien life</em>.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Binary planets only care about the ratio of the two objects.</p>
<p>Specifically, the smaller object has to be big enough that it raises the barycenter above the surface of the larger planet; that is, they most orbit around a common point that is not contained within the mass of the larger object. Then it is a binary planets, but until then it's just a really big moon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the more bodies in a system the less stable the system tends to be unless there are large distances inbetween (planet orbits at 10AU, moon orbits at .05AU and the last body orbits very closely to the 'proper moon'). This last body would also have to likely be very small.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Pluto system is hilarious in this respect. So many of our planet-moon systems are models of the solar system. Large central body, small orbiting bodies with &quot;circular&quot; orbits, debris at LaGrange points and such. Pluto is like a model of &quot;everything else&quot;, just so grade school kids know they exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I found this on the interwebs. &quot;Yes, in theory, moons can have moons. The region of space around a satellite where a sub-satellite can exist is called the Hill sphere. Outside the Hill sphere, a sub-satellite would be lost from its orbit about the satellite.&quot;

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe having a satellite orbiting a body is one of the conditions for that body being defined a planet. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: This was most certainly incorrect. As others have pointed out, venus and mercury lack moons and are considered planets. I guess what I <em>meant</em> to say was that if a body is orbiting a planet, then the orbiting body would not be considered a planet.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Either way, ignore what I said and what I meant to say, /u/MaximumNameDensity does a much better job at detailing the actual definition of it below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be classified as a planet, a giant floating rock in space must, essentially, meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>It orbits the sun</li>
<li>It has sufficient mass to be round, or nearly round</li>
<li>It is not a satellite (moon) of another object</li>
<li>It has removed debris and small objects from the area around its orbit. (this last one is what demotes Pluto to Dwarf planet status, as it doesn't do this, also the constantly mining of plutonium by its foolish inhabitants)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this regard a moon doesn't become a planet if it gets its own moon, as there are still other criteria to meet, in particular that it doesn't directly orbit the star of its solar system. In response to /u/atreestump1's question, a moon can indeed have a moon of its own orbiting it. This would be considered a sub-satellite of the planet and a satellite of the moon (in the same vein of definitions, our moon is considered a sub-satellite of the sun).</p>
<p>A sub-satellite can exist if it stays within the range of the moon's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere" target="_blank">Hill sphere</a>. A hill sphere is basically the body's region in which it dominates the attraction of satellites, and is basically how we have a moon.  In the case of our moon's hill sphere, that's a diameter of 60,000km around the moon. If the satellite is within this range and maintains a constant orbit, it's a moon of the moon. Outside this range then it will possibly end up as another moon to the planet rather than the moon if within the planet's own hill sphere. Outside of that, it'll be a satellite to the star itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The International Astronomical Union defined a planet as an object that:</p>
<p>orbits the sun</p>
<p>has sufficient mass to be round, or nearly round</p>
<p>is not a satellite (moon) of another object</p>
<p>has removed debris and small objects from the area around its orbit</p>
<p>While I suppose it's possible that a planet could have a moon massive enough to trap something large enough that we would want to call it something like a sub-moon, my money would be on the gravity well of the planet either capturing the object first, or stripping it away from the moon before too long. So probably pretty rare.</p></div>		</li>
