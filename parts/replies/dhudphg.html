			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the world is land and all the rivers flow into different endorheic basins near the equators. The sun is intense enough and the basin is formed right to maximize the evaporation of the salty water, leaving no salty water standing on the planet for more than a day or so.</p>
<p>All the now evaporated water forms great fresh water lakes that are above the height of the endorheic basins.</p>
<p>Or maybe there is a massive rift cut under what was once an ocean. Its so massive that the rate at which the water cools the rock is slower that the rate at which the magma from below heats the rock. This creates a very thin solid crust that essentially boils the salty water and causes it to vaporize.</p></div>		</li>
