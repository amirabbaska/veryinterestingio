			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested in other variables like light or sound, you might be surprised at how much the signal are affected.  Stars can twinkle at night due turbulence, or random winds.  Wind will also &quot;push&quot; sound.  The temperature and humidity will also change the speed of sound.  Based on these principles, there are sonic instruments that emit sound and measure wind speeds and temperatures.  </p>
<p>There are other instruments that can use microwaves, sound waves, or both to measure temperatures, humidites, and wind speeds based upon how the pulses are returned to the sensors.  (Look up wind profilers).</p>
<p>Other atmospheric constituents like aerosols (smoke, dust, etc) can also have strong effects on visible and infrared signals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I've been wondering about smoke. With all the fires going on out west. I live a good state away but it got incredibly smoky here for a bit and I felt my verizon coverage sucked those few days. And obviously no one you can call at Verizon has any idea. They all said it didn't effect it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to note that in practice, this &quot;affecting&quot; of WiFi signals <em>can</em> be positive for your use case.</p>
<p>I was involved in a reasonably big urban WANET project, and we noticed that sometimes for specific links a little rain or fog improved our signals, because it assisted in dampening interference.</p>
<p>The &quot;tree fade&quot; effect described elsethread is also very noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am studying telecommunications and I find this very interesting. Could you provide me with more info about the interference dampening? Like, what is the reason behind it,is it the fog/rain blocking the noise from the altitudes above it or maybe limiting the ground noise to isolated patches closely packed near eachother (dampening the noise between buildings)? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have never studied it in detail (it was a hobbyist project focusing more on the network side of things than the physical part), but yes, the leading theory was/is that as the 2.4GHz band is so polluted in urban areas that fog and rain improved the noise floor by dampening reflections, possibly soaking walls etc. The fact that Omni antennas showed this phenomenon more than narrower panels and dishes seems to support that theory.</p>
<p>I can not answer where the interference comes from, as the only measuring devices we had were the wifi network scans and SNR gauges of the router devices themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In West Texas we have what we call &quot;dust-fade&quot;. Since that part of Texas regularly sees haboobs (sand/dust storms) it'll actually affect signal as well. Also, you loose equipment occasionally due to static discharge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be due to tropospheric ducting. If the weather conditions are right, the signal can be reflected off of a temperature inversion in the atmosphere. That can allow some of the signal that leaves at a high takeoff angle which is normally lost to space be received. It also bypasses obstacles in between the transmitter and receiver</p>
<p>I don't know how far you were transmitting signals but what I said would pretty much only apply if it is a decent distance between the sites (say &gt;25KM)</p></div>		</li>
