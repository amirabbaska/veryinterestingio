			<div class="markdown"><p>Butter rationing has only been a thing around Christmas time as Christmas baking (Christmas cakes) took off.  As soon as the New Years holiday ended, butter was back on the shelves.  I think the biggest problem was a false panic and people buying and hording it.  And a good bit of the shortfall was due to ag. policies and centralized subsidies.</p>
<p>But it's terrible for most Japanese farmers, as the staple market foods all have heavy import restrictions and tarrifs.  <a href="http://www.tokyofoundation.org/en/articles/2011/farming-survive-liberalization" target="_blank">Here's a good article explaining JA's (Japan Agriculture Cooperatives) opposition to TPP.</a>  However, that's offset by the weak yen.  At 120 yen to 1 USD, it's cheaper for Americans to buy Japanese goods than it is for Japanese people to buy American goods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Kobe, Japan. I've never even seen this butter-rationing thing people are talking about, and I use butter often. I've only ever seen Western reporters blabbing about it, nothing on the Japanese news at all. In the last 10 years, that is. If it exists, it must be a local thing.
One idiotic story even says there was a shortage at Christmas, so people could not bake Christmas cakes! (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/12/21/japan-butter-shortage/20526999/" target="_blank">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/12/21/japan-butter-shortage/20526999/</a>)
Very few Japanese homes even have an oven. Fewer people know how to use one for baking anything!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this mean the car can only be imported if 45% of it by value was made in a TPP region?  If so, that would remove almost all of the current restrictions.</p></div>		</li>
