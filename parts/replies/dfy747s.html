			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that these things were made legal it's that they have not yet to be deemed illegal. As far as video games go, the United States Supreme Court considers video games to be an extension of freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution. These rights are afforded the utmost protections and the state must prove, based upon a strict scrutiny standard, reasons to regulate this type of speech.
Obscenity is not afforded the same protections to the First Amendment. Obscenity is unprotected in its speech argument for protections. To understand why as far as reasoning the best place to look is the U.S. Supreme Court itself. For Obscenity, the standard used is the Miller Test, established in Miller v California 1973. Numerous other court cases have arisen regarding child pornography and the court details reasoning why there are absolutely no protections for such content; see NY v Ferber 1982 and further U.S v Williams 2008.
One of the first landmark cases concerning video games originated in California. It was deemed full First Amendment freedom of speech protections, see Brown v Entertainment Merchants Association 2011.
For a general understanding of free speech rights in themselves. A few things have to be looked at including time place an manner. If the U.S. Is in a war, historically free speech is restricted more. Here I recommend the cases Dennis v U.S 1951; or for the landmark cases establishing freedom of speech and the standards used today in continuance of the issue; U.S v O'Brien 1968, and Texas v Johnson 1989.
Freedom of speech is not considered an absolute right and the government is allowed to regulate if following a strict scrutiny standard if the type of speech is fully protected as established in these cases.
Brief summaries of the opinions and cases themselves can be found at oyez.org if you want to know more.
Hope this helps! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The case law on the record -- including written opinions of judges -- is that the industry that creates pornographic images of children encourages the victimization of children <em>per se</em>.  That is, allowing <em>any</em> economy of pedophilia to exist will be sufficient to cause children to be victimized, therefore it must be illegal.</p>
<p>In the case of virtual/fictional depictions, it's ruled that this still feeds into the same industry that causes victimization.</p>
<p>That's the case law.  Whether it is true or not is very hard to know, but that's the legal reasoning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For photographic images the reasoning is obvious, because it involves putting a child into that situation ( you'll notice that tv shows dealing with pedophilia will often cut away from the act and have computers either use old bad quality case images or keep them angled from the camera.).</p>
<p>However the primary reason for created images is more along the lines of social standards, there's possibly limits to how much an animated scene could show without being illegal but fear of prosecution and the desire to sell to the general public keep them from risking it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But a drawing does not even imply the abuse of a child though. There are no actual children involved, no abuse occurred, why is it illegal?</p>
<p>I'm all for actual CP being illegal, child abuse is no joke (I was abused as a child, I know exactly what it's like), I don't want that for anyone, but banning drawings just takes a harmless outlet away from people with pedophilic urges, possibly causing more actual child abuse to occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't the entire point in that based on real images because it means some child was involved in it and consuming the material means you are contributing to whoever created it? In that case drawings or the like doesn't contribute, so is that on purpose or an oversight?</p></div>		</li>
