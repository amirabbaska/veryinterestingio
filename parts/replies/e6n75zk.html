			<div class="markdown"><p>to piggy back on Crudboy's comment.
radar's have two main modes of operation - search &amp; track.  Imagine you're in a pitch black area, you can see that someone has a flashlight and they're sweeping it side to side - that's search mode.<br />
now imagine they're pointing the flashlight in your eyes and keeping it there as you move - that's track mode and what is called radar lock.   </p>
<p>the RWR system can tell the difference and will warn the pilot when the mode changes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>easy - if the radar signal power level fades in and out - it's sweeping (looking for a target).  if the signal is strong &amp; continuous it's locked on targeting you.</p>
<p>Edit - clarification on fades in and out...when the enemy's radar is pointed at you, the radar signal will be clear and distinct, when it points away from away from you the signal will be weaker and somewhat fuzzy since what you are sensing are jumbled reflections.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also doesn't work if the attacking aircraft is capable of firing radar-guided missiles like the AIM-120 which can fly toward a predicted position without the attacking aircraft ever needing to switch it's radar to single target track mode. In that case, the target only gets a radar lock warning in the last few seconds as the missile turns on it's own radar for terminal guidance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The probability of a hit in that mode is very low. The target would need to be maintaining the same height and speed as the view the amraam seeker has is quite small. The money maker is AWACS led targeting.  Radar off aircraft fires on the target having been data linked it's location by an AWACS hundreds of miles away. AWACS continues to data link the missile until the seeker sees the target. Target can't act against the AWACS as it is too far away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps you're envisioning a situation like a dog fight or near range shot where the attacker and target both are aware of each other. Future combat might not be like that. </p>
<p>A stealth fighter might not turn on their radar at all because doing so also gives away their location. They might rely on passive data or data from other aircraft. Firing from &gt;50 miles away. The missile turns on radar last mile or so. But yes according to public data, bvr shots have a ~60% kill rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will. Depending on the RWR. it's like you point a single beam of a flashlight back and forth at a tree line and there's someone standing in the middle. Every few seconds that beam of light will pass over him and he'll see it quickly pass. He won't think you've found him until you're pointing it straight at him. But there's also different forms of guidance for a missile, from command guidance to semi active to active that require illuminating a target or not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can pick them up but the point is that it can detect the change in mode from scanning to tracking, and alert the pilot of the immediate danger. Just receiving radio waves intermittently is not such a cause for concern - it doesn't even mean you have been detected necessarily.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Doubtful. It's not like the plane can choose when the pilot wakes up. He might be out for seconds or minutes. Long enough that the maneuver will result in him being shot down. Plus going unconscious is not good. There's no &quot;it's okay he's just knocked out&quot; in real life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a big difference between blacking out and getting knocked out.  You are correct, there isn't a, 'he's just knocked out, it's ok' in real life, but there really isn't any danger when it comes to passing out due to gravitational forces.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the problem with AA missile is that they can turn harder and accelerate faster then a fighter.</p>
<p>However, missiles are limited in size and hence in fuel and every mile and every maneuver wastes precious energy.</p>
<p>So an aircraft has two ways to defeat a missile. </p>
<ul>
<li>Miss-guide</li>
<li>
<p>Waste energy</p>
<p>By wrong radar targets(caff, decoy), wrong infared targets(IR Flares) or Jamming. On the other hand there are evasive maneuvers that try to waste as much energy as possible(sharp turns) or in some cases even outrun the missile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This however all depends on energy the missile has left. A 60mile missile may intercept a target after 40 miles and only have enough energy to turn sharply once. The same missile might be almost unavoidable at 20 miles.</p>
<p>Even though getting closer means the attacking fighter is more exposed to incoming fire.</p>
<p>It all depends on the situation.</p>
