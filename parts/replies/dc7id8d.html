			<div class="markdown"><p>Happens to me too (nausea and cramps in waves), but only if I continue to ignore the normal growls for a long time. To fix it I can eat a single chip or cracker and it's instant relief.</p>
<p>Doesn't happen every time I'm hungry though, just when I'm too lazy to eat something. And by lazy I mean if my stomach starts normal painless growling at 12 I won't be bothered to get up and eat until 4-5 when it starts to get nauseating. It's the worst on mornings I wake up and forget to eat and then leave for hours.</p>
<p>It's like the painless growls eventually stop because I ignore them, and then come back full force with their friends.</p>
<p>I'm probably just starving myself because I'm an idiot that forgets to eat. Evolution hates me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also to add I am extremely underweight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, wow, that's interesting you even wretch. Look, I can't make any diagosis over the internet with absolutely no medical history or hands-on assessment. It sounds like you have a bit going on here and should at very least be under the care of a physician. If you aren't already, then I urge you to go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your weight and that might be related. You should really go to the doctor. If you're heaving and you don't know why, it's not a good thing</p>
<p>Also being that underweight is extremely unhealthy.</p></div>		</li>
