<p>populations have adapted by maintaining lactose tolerance beyond childhood (vitamin D is present in high concentrations in dairy products). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is completely incorrect.  </p>
<p>Dairy contains little to no vitamin D.  The high calcium could theoretically compensate, but that can be obtained without digesting lactose (cheese, yogurt, etc are common in lactose intolerant regions like south Europe and the northern Mideast).  </p>
<p>Lactose tolerance is a fundamentally &quot;desert&quot; adapted trait, not a cold one.  The only cold climate that displays lactose digestion is northern Europe.  Every other instance of it (Arabia, western Sahel, east Africa, northern and central India) is a hot arid place.  </p>
<p>Lactose digestion most probably evolved as a carbohydrate source.  The one thing these places have in common is that they were always short on food, and specifically carbohydrates.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would not debate if lactose tolerance is cold or hot adaptation, as this does not take into account historical development.</p>
<p>Lactose tolerance (an ability to digest larger amount of milk or <strong>unfermented</strong> milk products without serious stomach issues, as you can see, a lot of people can digest smaller amount and in fermented products, this -- digestion of lactose -- was done by lactobacilus and other milk bacterias) developed probably randomly and spread into areas where cows were present (I may remember it incorrectly, but horse and goat/sheep milk might be a better for digestion without an active lactase, so this might be the way how lactose tolerance first developed and then due to cows, it spread). However, after some time, fermented products were developed. Those enabled digestion of milk products even without required changes in genetic composition of population, you had to just adopt this new technology. This means that current spread of lactose tolerance is given purely by those two historical events: spread of pastoralism associated with cows and later spread of (milk) fermentation, which removed evolutionary pressure for development of lactose tolerance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>milk fermentation is not some type of advanced technology.  It's relatively easy to process milk in a way that removes most of the lactose.  </p>
<p>In hot areas, if you just leave it outside for a while, it'll automatically turn into yogurt.  And yet, there are entire ethnic groups across Africa  with incidences of 80, 90, 95% lactose tolerance.  </p>
<p>The common factor is carbohydrate, and lactose tolerance allows you to digest carbohydrates.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fascinating! You must love your work. What do you mean by using bacteria to make DNA? Does this have anything to do with gene therapy? And on that topic if you don't mind me asking gene therapy has always been interesting to me, but could you explain to me how far we can take it? From what I understand as we have it now gene therapy is mainly used to treat genetic disorders, but could we one day use it to make a human body more efficient, or what potential improvements could it be used for?</p></div>		</li>
