			<div class="markdown"><p>Free will to the point we believe in and exercise our free will, yes. If you can only carry 50 lbs, you can carry as many things as you want, up to 50 lbs, ans then your body physically can't/won't let you carry more (because you risk physical harm). But over time you can get stronger. Same with willpower.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your belief system is more deep-rooted than your lizard-brain responses, you also have the freedom to do things that harm your body. This can be something as small as eating ice cream when you know you're lactose intolerant, to something as dangerous as autoerotic asphyxiation.</p>
<p>The thing about free will is that it's not really used all that often. 'Hormones and stuff' like you said, lead to things like conditioned responses. Humans tend to take the path of least resistance. If you live in a suburb, you probably could walk to the grocery store. But if you can drive or take the bus... why would you? </p>
<p>Similarly, once you're an adult, why try radically new things when you already have a good idea what you like and don't like? Why take that risk when you already have a solid history behind you that tells you what does and doesn't work? </p>
<p>We have free will, but we're designed to crave comfort and positive feedback. We only seek novelty when it's in an environment that's safe/pleasurable for us. Free will isn't just choosing what we do, but how we <em>think</em>. And that's hard, and there's rarely a real, pressing need to do so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a physics perspective where we understand that Space-Time is relative, the issue of past/present/future are blurred indicating that time in front of us is not fluid but fixed.  </p>
<p>That implies that everything is predetermined and free will, much like time itself, is an illusion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a direct answer to your quesiton, but there's a neat <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88031220" target="_blank">NPR article</a> on it. It shows that moths retain some form of memories from their caterpillar days.</p>
<p>TL;DR: A team at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. exposed caterpillars to a type of gas that smells and zapped them at the same time once an hour for 8 hours. The caterpillars learned to avoid the smell. After they transformed into moths, the moths also avoided the smell.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's kind of refreshing to know that catapillers aren't utterly obliterated in order to create butterflies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an exact answer to your question but related. It seems there was a popular belief that the entire insect was rewired during metamorphosis, but a study in 2008 seems to find otherwise. Turns out that parts of the brain are kept in tact including memory which are transferred to the new form (moth or butterfly).</p>
<p>So there’s a chance that they know or learn what has happened to them.</p>
<p>Here’s an article from new scientist which summarises the findings: <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13412-butterflies-remember-caterpillar-experiences/" target="_blank">https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13412-butterflies-remember-caterpillar-experiences/</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is evidence that they remember things from before their transformation.  So at least part of their brain seems to remain during the transformation in some way.</p>
