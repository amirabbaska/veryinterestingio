			<div class="markdown"><p>When you do the calculations of how much energy it takes to change temperature do you use heat of evaporation or; heat of evaporation and heat of melting together? ( Not sure if I used the right terms. I know when you look at how much every it takes for a substance to change temperature you need to stop at when it changes phase and use another term for the energy required for the phase change.) So which one do you use? Or does it have its own number?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing you are approaching this problem by saying &quot;if I need H joules of heat to evaporate 1 mol of substance, then I need H*x joules of heat to evaporate x moles of substance.&quot; H here is your heat of evaporation (it could be melting also, its the same principle but in the other temperature direction). This is the correct intuition and solution for this type of problem.</p>
<p>Now an important property of phase changes is that if your boiling a liquid/gas biphasic mixture in a closed container, as long as you see two phases present, then the temperature of both phases is the same, i.e. the boiling point. So if you want to create 120ºC steam and you start with a 100ºC water and steam mix, you will not be able to heat any of the steam hotter than 100ºC until all of the water phase has evaporated. You can prove this with chemical potentials, because if any gas molecules are present in the biphasic mixture at above 100ºC, then they will have enough chemical potential to move back into the liquid phase and will do so spontaneously, thus cooling them back down to the boiling point.</p>
<p>What this means is that <em>you cannot change the temperature of a pure, biphasic mixture that is undergoing a phase change.</em> You can heat a liquid up and increase its temperature or cool it down and decrease its temperature. The same is true of a gas, but if you have both liquid and gas present, then any heat you add will push the equilibrium toward one of the two phases, but <em>will not change the temperature of either phase</em>. Basically the heat is being used to perform the work of the phase change rather than increasing or decreasing the random thermal energy of the system. Fortunately, there's some nifty jargon to differentiate these two methods of heating. Latent heat is heat that is added but does not change the temperature of the system, which is the heat of evaporation or of any phase change. Sensible heat is when you add heat and the temperature changes. </p>
<p>Now since you asked about a change in temperature, then we're definitely talking about sensible heat, and so heat of evaporation and heat of fusion do not play a role in solving this problem. The only thing that matters is the heat capacity of the phase. This problem would go like &quot;If I add x joules of heat to a liquid, then the liquid's temperature will change by x/(c*m) degrees C.&quot; Where c is heat capacity of the liquid phase and m is the mass. </p>
<p>Notice that this second problem has a totally different solution than the first one. I think the reason why you're getting confused is that you think either H of fusion or H of evaporation should play a role in changing the temperature of a single phase, but it does not. They only factor in when there are two phases present. </p>
<p>It is confusing, but the mathematical definition of a substance's response to heat actually changes depending on whether there are one or two phases. This happens because of the constant temperature of biphasic mixes that I mentioned earlier. For one phase, you use E = m<em>c</em>T, where E is the <em>sensible</em> heat added, T is the change in temp, c is heat capacity, and m is mass. For two phases, you use E = H<em>m</em>n, but here, E is <em>latent</em> heat added, H is the heat of evaporation, n is the molar mass, and m is the change in mass that leaves the liquid phase and enters the gas phase. Note how with sensible heat, the temperature changes, but with latent heat, mass actually moves from one place to another. In both cases energy is conserved, just in the first the heat goes to random thermal energy, while in the second it performs the work needed for the phase change. </p>
<p>edit: think I went into too much depth here, but /u/FireteamAccount is correct that you would need a different, experimentally-measured H for sublimation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just wondering plug the latent heat of sublimation is related to the two other latent heats in any way. If you could find the heat of sublimation non experimentaly if you knew the other two. Is this relation is true across all substances.</p></div>		</li>
