			<div class="markdown"><p>But if vegetarians, vegans and those who reduce their consumption weren't there, wouldn't there be even more demand? Sure, a lot of countries are increasing their meat consumption. But others are reducing it. At the moment the meat consumption is rising, but it would be rising even more if no one was on a meat free diet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no skin in the game, but that's not really a fair assessment. From an outside perspective, it's clear that if Z = X + Y, just because X is going up while Y is going down doesn't at all mean that the overall value of Z is the same as if Y hadn't gone down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's still had an impact on meat production because if they hadn't stopped, there would be even more consumption.</p>
<p>Though /u/aliceiggles question is kind of self-evident unless he's really asking whether the net has gone down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all based on the assumption that the percent of population eating meat is growing. By these stats it would seem that the number of people eating meat is also growing, so the % of people not eating meat is either stagnant or decreasing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effect is less than you'd think, though, as one person's nonconsumption only moves the demand curve for meat, possibly lowering the price to the point a poorer person who was not eating meat but wanted to could then afford it. The net effect is still negative on production, but the relationship is not direct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The important question is whether lowering meat consumption has had an outcome in terms of production compared to what the production would look like if there had been no reduction in meat consumption by anyone. So there may still have been an increase overall, but a smaller one than if meat reduction etc wasn't a growing movement</p></div>		</li>
