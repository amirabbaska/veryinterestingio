<p>I inherently understand that saying something like that is ridiculous, but I just don't know why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main reason I believe would be thermal limiting. Consider that even the smallest IC's that control the simplest things like MOSFET switching for power tools require a nice chunk of aluminum or copper to dissipate heat. And those IC's have only a couple pins and maybe a few thousand transistors - and they still get hot to the point the devices need overtemp protection.</p>
<p>Now think about having a few billion transistors crammed onto a die the size of a CPU. Running even the simplest single core CPU's without a large heatsink and fan will result in failure of the chip within minutes of running, upgrade that to a quad-core or 8 core CPU as you see commonly now days and you'd probably get a few seconds before you let the smoke out.</p>
<p>The problem with making the chips thicker is that you now have a &quot;deeper&quot; area to get heat out of, meaning more heat generation with less surface area contacting the heat sink. I imagine that there has been a tradeoff between making the transistors smaller and the dies thicker, but it's definitely more favorable for companies to invest the money in making smaller transistors to fit more within the same volume instead of thinking of more obstructive and complicated heat dissipation. </p>
<p>Also the tech seems to scale with the need quite well as it stands, every year we have a new generation of processors more than capable of handling the current computing needs of anyone out there, not just consumer grade but government work, military work, and laboratory applications. Also keep in mind that if you really need more processing power it's much easier to create a motherboard that is capable of housing 4 chips rather than 1 - like on server boards. It's easier to cool 4 chips on a single board, all with their own heat sink or liquid cooling, again because the surface area to volume of transistors ratio is lower. You can blow air over the entire board and have essentially 4 times the cooling efficiency for a given number of transistors because they are split into 4 groups - if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Heat is the ultimate enemy of computing power and electricity in computers. The hotter your CPU gets, the slower it runs. In a few years time we may see a huge shift in CPU design though, as it's getting to the point where the distance between the transistors is so small, that we will run into issues where the electrons will be able to &quot;quantum tunnel&quot; between them, resulting in 1's where there should be 0's and so forth. It's a very interesting concept - &quot;The end of Moore's Law&quot; as it's called. Worth some further research. It enters into the realm of Quantum computing - which is a promising thought. However for consumer grade computing, gaming, browsing youtube videos and reddit, we will probably see within 5 years, computer chips becoming larger in terms of area, and it's also a possibility home PC's will start shipping with a standard of 2 processors or more on the mother board.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From your post, and admittedly the very little reading I've done on quantum computing, it would seem to me like that is basically going to be required to be figured out 'soon enough'. But, at that point, where does one go once you've hit the quantum level? Can you actually go smaller?! lol</p>
<p>Or would they just focus on efficiency and surface area? Or am I over estimating how small the quantum level truly is? Is it likely not to be an issue in my lifetime?</p>
<p>All so fascinating. Thank you for sharing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The very short answer is: heat. As chips are made today, there's still a significant issue with removing heat from the chip. Honestly, the only reason it's as <em>big</em> as it is (that 2-inch by 2-inch processor in your computer) is to get the heat out. Without concern for heat, we could certainly do what you say, increase the layers in the z-direction to significantly increase processing power. But the chip would melt, probably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhh. Fascinating. </p>
<p>Would this be an issue even if it were kept at crazy cold temperatures? Like ... Umm ... Absolute zero or some such?</p></div>		</li>
