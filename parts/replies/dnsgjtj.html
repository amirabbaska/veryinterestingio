			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who used to work at an optometrists this doesn’t surprise me at all. Adults even have trouble sitting still for an autorefractor. I used to cringe when I had to do pretesting on kids, they just can’t sit still! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite way to get kids to sit for the auto refractor is to tell them if they sit really still they might get to see the bunnies in the picture.  For eye drops, ask the kid if they want chocolate or vanilla eye drops and 99% of the time they will willingly let you put the cyclo in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see why the autorefractor can't be modified to have some kind of image stabilization and tracking so that it takes a bunch of snapshots when your eye happens to be oriented in roughly the same direction.  This way even if you can't sit still, the measurement would just take longer, but it would eventually have a good enough measurement.  This might even provide better data since measuring eye orientation allows correction of the data for tiny saccades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as somebody who has spent the last 5 years attempting to design eye-tests for infants and children, I think people underestimate what infants and children are able/willing to do.</p>
<p>A lot of the issue is that existing tests (for infants, children, and adults) are simply not appropriate for the participants (e.g., in terms of comfort, difficulty, duration, task-instructions, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be able to answer my question then. My kids go to a pediatric opthalmologist. One of the tests he does is have the kids put on some kind of special glasses (I'm assuming 3D, but could be wrong), then shows them a picture of a butterfly and asks them to press down on the part that looks like it's popping up. Do you know what this is testing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pediatric autorefractors are notoriously bad at determining prescriptions. Even adult ones can get close sometimes, but are never perfect. That's why we ask you so many questions to make sure everything is right. </p>
<p>In children, retinoscopy is preferred. If they are old enough, I ask a few questions afterwards to double check everything. I never rely solely on questions because kids overthink things and also lie because they want glasses</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was so embarrassed about not being able to see any of the eye chart when I was younger that I used to memorise it as I walked in the room and reel off the first 4 or 5 lines when my eyes were being tested. Needless to say, I didn't have the correct prescription for years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently had an Optometrist appointment that got me to 20/20 vision for the first time in my life. I have Myopia, an astigmatism, and one of my eyes didn't form properly in utero. Is there a reason it took until my 30's for this to happen? Has the technology gotten better? Or is it somewhat of a ball park kind of thing no matter what they use?</p></div>		</li>
