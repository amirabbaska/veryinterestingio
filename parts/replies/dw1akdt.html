<p>A tropism explains why a pine tree on a mountainside will grow straight up on a 45 degree hillside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always wondered how that happened, but now I’m curious: what happens if you have tropisms competing for dominance or control?</p>
<p>For instance, if you planted the seed on a hill, it would seem that the sunlight/warmth would likely be strongest perpendicular to the slope of the hill, as any other (non-perpendicular) path would be longer, effectively being the hypotenuse of a right triangle. (For purposes of my questions, let’s assume the difference between the two distances is not negligible.)</p>
<p>Because trees grow vertical on hills as you mentioned, I assume that the gravitational pull (geotropism) is exerting more force upon the seed than the sunlight/warmth (phototropism).</p>
<p>Is there a way to counterbalance this to grow plants or trees that grow perpendicular to the hillside? For instance, placing the seed closer to the surface in high altitudes (such that the Earth’s gravity exerts less force on the seed)?</p>
<p>Or, since other tropisms also have an effect on seed growth, is there away to manipulate multiple tropisms to get the same effect (plant/tree growing perpendicular to hill)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that a seed must germinate or it will lie dormant until conditions are right for germination; seasonality, sunlight etc.  So I would say a phototropism is necessary for germination but once sprouted and a leaf or two for photosynthesis to take place it must take root concurrently or it will just fall out of the soil (45 deg angle) and cease to exist.  Once germination and photosynthesis have taken place the plants must compete for sunlight evidenced in rainforests where they struggle to get enough sunlight to survive by getting to the top of the canopy so they can compete for sunlight to survive in a jungle with other competitors.  Some trees do not make it and succumb to become compost for the next generation.  Fires provide a rebirth of trees and plants generally who will spring up after a fire and often act as a stimulus for trees to drop their seed (pods) for reproduction.</p>
<p>If a tree grew perpendicular to the hillside, gravity would probably not permit it to survive; it would eventually fall over before maturity.  </p>
<p>The best example of a phototropism is the sunflower which will follow the sun as it tracks across the sky everyday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="http://plantsinmotion.bio.indiana.edu/plantmotion/movements/tropism/phototropism/corn/cornworship.html" target="_blank">link</a> has a video and an explanation of competition between phototropism and gravitropism. While it does not explain the exact circumstances in which gravitropism becomes dominant, you can infer from the video that it is dominant when the light is principally ambient, and not when it's not.</p></div>		</li>
