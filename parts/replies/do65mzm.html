			<div class="markdown"><p>Spin gravity straight up eliminates <em>many</em> problems associated with long duration spaceflight, notably the muscular and skeletal degradation caused by prolonged weightlessness. Similarly, problems among plants caused by lack of apparent gravity would be solved in much the same way.</p>
<p>The difficulties mostly come from the fact that many of the historical reasons why we send things to space are to study how they behave in the absence of gravity. So most concepts for a rotating space station prefer to leave at least a portion of the structure <em>not</em> rotate.</p>
<p>Sealing a constantly rotating section like that to prevent air from escaping is tricky. And depending on the mass of the rotating portion, objects moving around inside of it can throw off the center of rotation, making the rotating and stationary segments shake as it spins. You can solve <em>that</em> problem by building movable counterweights into the structure of the spinning section, and the larger you build the segment the less small movements matter anyways.</p>
<p>Spinning produces some interesting effects for people moving about in such a section, however. If the diameter is too small, there would be a significant difference in acceleration from your head to your toes. Additionally, the spin rate must be much higher to generate the same amount of force as a with a longer centrifuge.</p>
<p>Turning your head while standing in such an environment can also cause some disorientation. One side of your head will be turning into the spin, increasing its speed and thus sensation of gravity, while the other would feel <em>less</em> gravity as its motion decreased the combined speed. As your inner-ear controls your sense of &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; the effect is something that needs to be considered. Higher tangential velocity reduces this effect, meaning for comfort you would want a high RPM or a large radius/diameter.</p>
<p>Higher spin rates create bigger problems with Coriolis effects, however, so in general, larger centrifuges are better. If you want to properly simulate 1G while keeping to a rotation of under 2RPM to reduce Coriolis effects below what people would generally have problems with, then you're looking at a diameter of around 450m, 4 times the length of the ISS.</p>
<p>If you don't need a full 1g, or are willing to accept more disorientation, then you can build it smaller or spin it slower. Which direction you face can also greatly reduce these effects, so if its just being used as a sleeping compartment to reduce the harmful effects of microgravity or for growing plants, then it can be <em>much</em> smaller. That 450m figure is really just what you'd want for comfortable earth-like habitation in space.</p>
<p>This doesn't need to be a continuous ring, either. You could tether two objects together with cables at that distance and spin them against each other just fine. Indeed, if you've been following along with SpaceX's BFR announcements, tethering two such spacecraft together and spinning them could produce a comfortable gravity for the passengers during a trip to mars. I'm sure someone at SpaceX is looking into it, and I'd expect them to give it a try eventually.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, if you've read this far you should check out Isaac Arthur's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86JAU3w9mB8" target="_blank">video on the subject</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars has gravity, so gravity shouldn’t be too much of a problem. The real issue is nutrients since the whole planet is a devoid dust bowl. The lack of CO2 and extreme temperatures on Mars is another huge problem, as we can’t just grow plants outside a greenhouse. </p>
<p>Sand/dust doesn’t preserve heat, so Mars should be extremely hot during the day and extremely cold over night. Most plants can’t handle such a hostile atmosphere.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, The Martian did a nearly flawless job portraying what it would take to survive on Mars (survive, not thrive). The only major lie about Mars’ climate is that, due to a lack of gravity, winds on the red planet never reach anything above a light breeze. Certainly not enough to tear apart a rocket or a makeshift space station.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A water heat bank would be a good means of surviving the Martian night.</p>
<p>A lot of colder climate greenhouses use this on Earth. The daylight period warms the greenhouse as well as the internal water storage barrels. Then, as night comes and the outside temperature drops, the greenhouse maintains a higher temperature as the water barrels slowly radiate their heat. </p>
<p>Of course, we don't get &quot;Mars cold&quot; here, but it's a thought. </p></div>		</li>
