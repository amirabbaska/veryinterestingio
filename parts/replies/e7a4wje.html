			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the above comment, you can also turn on a light and have the bulb be very dim. (Physical drive damage, classical hard drives are moving parts made of metal.)</p>
<p>You can also have the guy flipping the switches (HDD controller) be a little too old to be flipping switches and flip the wrong one. (write error based on a defect in the chip on the drive)</p>
<p>You can also have the CEO tell the guy to flip the wrong switch. (inherent CPU flaws resulting in mathematical errors)</p>
<p>You can also have <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_error" target="_blank">THE GRACE OF GOD</a></strong> flip a light switch all by itself. (literal cosmic rays flipping bits in your machine)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good thing to understand is these switches, while we say they are binary, are not in teal life, it's more like a knob. One side is labeled ON and the other side is labeled labeled OFF. It is supposed to have two states, but it can be in the middle, in fact it's rarely ever exactly in the right spot. We look at it and just judge what side it's closer to. But like really switches you can turn it to ON, but it doesn't necessarily go to ON, sometimes it's springy or jammed up, sometimes you set it to ON over 20 minutes it changes to OFF. In fact this is common, to improve storage density we never use the knob that always works, we use the tiniest knob we can build, right at the end of our ability to use it. They are so bad that we design the system with maybe 10% extra knobs, and then write algorithms to deal with a few broken knobs and identify areas of bad knobs that just shouldn't be used.</p>
<p>The other major source of error is honestly crashes. You're writing data out and maybe you are going through a file and changing all the 5s to 2s. In this format you can never had 5s and 2s, it's just not allowed and it is considered corrupted. But all 5s and all 2s are ok. To change between states you must temporarily create a corrupted file. What happens when the power goes out half way through? What happens when the program has bugs and crashes while making the update? We are pretty good at dealing with this, and most filesystem and databases write data such that you never crash in the middle state. But not all programs do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something has always made happy that we so frequently design electronics and other devices that can be effected by cosmic rays with some regularity.</p>
<p>And when it does happen, you're correct if you say, &quot;fuck off big bang.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two more to add.</p>
<p>The light switch forgets if it was on. If the electron  representing the switch is on escapes from its confines, the switch would turn off.</p>
<p>Last one is the light switch gets so old and worn that it can tell if it is on or off. The circuits holding the info if the light is on or off might get pretty worn that it can't store that info. Or the hard disk has been overwritten in the same spot so much that the controller can't read the data at that location. Pretty much to much writing can that spot to not work or become unreadable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very common, an OS crash or “blue screen of death” is a common cause of corruption too.  Operating systems hold temporary caches of data which hasn’t made it to disk yet.  When a BSOD occurs the cache and the disk can be left out of sync corrupting multiple files.  I got a whole folder of zero byte files once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this same process occur when my PS4 saves information to the cloud? Seems like a more straightforward process to save directly, and upload to the cloud. There has been data corrupted when uploaded, but these days it seems much more rare than it used to be in the like PS2 days which saved from the game to the memory card that had to be accessed. </p></div>		</li>
