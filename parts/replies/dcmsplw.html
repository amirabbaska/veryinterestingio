			<div class="markdown"><p>More like they have access to different parts of the brain. Going back to the language thing, the knowledge of the Serbian language (speaking/writing) is in Billy's brain. It's just that only Regan has access to it. It's also not as optional as it sounds. It's probably the only language Regan has access to, which is why he was described as speaking with a heavy accent. </p>
<p>Basically he's a completely separate person who just knows how to speak Serbian and English. All that information just happens to be in the same brain and body  with native English speaking Billy, instead of in a separate brain and body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you say that Billy's brain was a bookshelf with all his knowledge, and that Regan and Billy both had different books they could pull out, depending on if their brain allowed them to?</p>
<p>How could the brain lock Billy out of something Regan knew? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I read this I made a quick analogy in my head. It's like having one computer with 1 hard drive. Body and brain. X number of people use the computer and they only have access to their files.... This has been so enlightening thank you.</p></div>		</li>
