			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course they're describing frost damage. They're also describing how the presence of salt contributes to that damage by lowering the freezing temperature of water and allowing it to infiltrate into pores and cracks. You don't put salt on roads that don't have water on them, so there is little question that salt plays a role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt doesn't work by melting the ice, it just lowers the point at which water will freeze into ice by forming a salty solution. Eventually the ice-water solution will dilute to the point where it's no longer effective and the water will re-freeze. Some products other than salt lower the freezing point more than salt does and need to dilute more than salt to become no longer effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're only partially correct here.  Salt used for de-icing roads is Calcium Chloride, not Sodium Chloride.  It does lower the freezing point of water, which is its primary purpose, but it is also deliquescent and has an exothermic reaction when dissolving in water.  So it is both lowering the freezing point and also melting the ice as it draws in water on the road.

			<div class="markdown"><p>But where does the salt go? If the water is seeping in deeper because it doesn't freeze as easily, why doesn't it just stay that way? Unless the salt vanishes, the water won't refreeze. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The salt is diluted by the addition of more water (snow or rain), but of course it does not vanish entirely.  The thing that determines the temperature at which the salt/water solution will freeze is the salt concentration, which is weight of salt/volume of water/snow.  So as more water is added, the salt becomes more dilute, and the freezing point of the salt/water solution rises.  Typically, what will happen is that the temperature at night will drop below the freezing point of the salt/water solution, and freezing will occur.  The end result is that the addition of salt results in far more freeze/thaw cycles.  That's why the roads in the midwest are so crappy (am visiting Minneapolis-St. Paul now, and wow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The salt does not prevent freezing, it only lowers the temperature at which water freezes.
So essentially the salt doesnâ€™t go anywhere. </p>
<p>Actually if you want to be really picky, at the lower temperature the ice crystals form and push out the salt so in a confined environment as the temperature drops you get bigger and bigger ice crystals and stronger and stronger salt concentrations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the sodium and chloride ions becomes incorporated into the crystal lattice of the saltwater ice, just as compounds other than iron, that are present in molten steel, become incorporated into the iron crystal lattice when it solidifies.</p></div>		</li>
