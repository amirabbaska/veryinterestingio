			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't believe the universe has an edge. It could be that it's finite and wraps back around on itself over exceedingly large volumes. Certainly beyond what our observable universe is. </p>
<p>But our current best data seems to suggest that the universe may well be infinitely large, and yes, infinitely massive accordingly. All the big bang can tell us is that at one time the universe had a very high density, but it could have been infinitely large then too.</p></div>		</li>

Using the illustration of the universe is on the surface of a balloon, the &quot;center&quot; would be the center point inside the empty space of the balloon...or am I just mixing visuals that don't mix?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it a safer assumption that the universe is really really really big, as opposed to infinite? To claim that the universe is infinite, it seems like you would need some sort of indication beyond the fact that our frame of measurement can't accommodate its size.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The mass could be infinite, but it could be finite as well, same as the total volume. We don't know. If it is finite, it is probably similar to the <strong>surface</strong> of a sphere (without any interior) but with one more dimension, which doesn't have a center either.</p></div>		</li>

infinite mass/infinite volume, finite/infinite, infinite/finite, finite/finite.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn’t that mean that we can’t calculate a center of mass, not that there isnt one? Or is that not a meaningful distinction. </p>
<p>Is it related to the fact that different parts of the universe aren’t gravitationally bound to each other, there is no single center of mass? So you could only ever find, for example, the center of mass of your own observable universe? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Saying we don't know, and what that person said are two different things.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least one physicist has argued (back in the 1990s do this could be out of date) that if the universe is bigger than what is observable (the distance light could have traveled since the big bang) then it would mean alternate universes. Imagine an observer 30 billion light years from us. Nothing in his observable universe is detectable or able to causilly interact with anything in ours. For all practical concerns it's a separate universe. My knowledge breaks down here though. I have no idea what it suggests if he is at say 20 billion light years - putting us and him outside each other's observable universes but part of his observable universe possibly observable from other parts of ours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't think it has edges. If there aren't edges, you can't define a center. Imagine the surface of a sphere, there's no center (of only the surface, the center of the sphere doesn't count).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No I think the universe we see only encompasses the amount of light that can travel back to us from the expanding edge. Slowly all the Stars will be too far for us to observe them. I think every day that goes by, we probably loose several galaxies to the expanding universe. The galaxies are still there, but we can't see them anymore. Beyond those there is probably an infinite sea of galaxies as far as the expanse can hold.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the big bang theory is correct, shouldn't there exist a point in the universe where everything started from? Why can't that point be considered the center? (Not the center of mass).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The big bang is when all of the discs between everything everywhere in the universe expanded all at once. </p>
