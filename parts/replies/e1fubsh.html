			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's OP's question though.  I mean, it is in terms of <em>what</em> the dried bits are, but the question is <em>why</em> do the plastic containers have it while the non-plastic containers (like waxed paper cartons or glass, for example) not have it?</p>
<p>I'd assume that the plastic containers tend to have more of it for the same reason that plastic containers don't dry as fast in the dish drain as other materials do.</p>
<p>Fluids stick to materials differently.  On glass (and maybe wax paper too) fluids tend to form a thin film rather than beading.  This means that the fluids can, well, <em>flow</em> away and it also means a larger surface area for the moisture to evaporate from.  On plastic fluids bead, then dry in place.  These two approaches would lead to different end results in terms of the distribution of the solids and non-evaporatable bits.  Where it beads, on plastics, you get little flakes where the droplets were; on glass or ceramic (and presumably on wax paper too) you get a haze over the surface instead.</p>
<p>It's the same material (and maybe even roughly the same amount of material), but the way it's distributed is different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually been reading about this for an art project. It's a matter of surface energy. In order for a coating to cling to a surface the coating material generally needs a lower surface energy than the substrate. Milk jugs are made of HDPE which has low surface energy but isn't quite as low as wax which will tend to shed a liquid coating completely before it dries</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention the screw cap and jug threads which have the function of spreading the dribble of milk along the threads. The lower threads being accessible to the air allow for a pretty consistent line of milk to dry. And once you take the cap off again the force of unscrewing breaks up the solids into small chunks.  </p>
<p>My wife refuses to have milk if there’s only a little bit in the bottom as she says it’s mostly backwash. I’ve tried to cut down over the years from drinking directly from the jug, but sometimes in the middle of the night when I’m standing naked in front of the fridge, eyes partially open, I can’t convince myself to grab a glass for fear of waking up even more. This is usually when my wife catches me on her way to the bathroom. </p></div>		</li>
