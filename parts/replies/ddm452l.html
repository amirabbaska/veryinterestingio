			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much all theoretical. There are some gravitational effects of black holes that we can measure (eg, orbits of stars under the influence of an inferred black hole or gravitational lensing like the kind that our own sun was observed to produce during the famous general relativity confirming eclipse of 1919). Those examples I just noted are really just consequences of general relativity though and they're (largely) independent of whether the massive body is collapsed into a singularity or not. I don't know nearly enough to tell you if we have experimental confirmation of black hole phenomena that go beyond general relativity such as this present conversation on bayron/lepton numbers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a related note, think what would happen if the corresponding particles would annihilate: you would get gamma radiation instead of the particle/anti-particle pair. But wait, gamma radiation is light, and light is also trapped inside a black hole. So it would still be just a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the answer is even simpler : when antimatter and matter annhilate what is released? Radiation. Light. What is a black hole? Something with enough gravity that even light doesn't escape from, by definition. Thus, a black hole formed of matter and one formed of antimatter, even if that information was somehow still relevant and the &quot;constituent particles&quot; annihilated, would still just produce light ultimately trapped in a bigger black hole. </p>
<p>So in the end it doesn't matter what the composition is.  Nothing gets out and the hole just grows. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could just be because that's how the Universe started out, its initial conditions were such that there was more matter than antimatter. This is a rather unappealing explanation, however, and also not very likely. Baryogenesis is the process in the early Universe that caused more matter to be produced than antimatter. In most situations, unless at high energy, baryon number will almost certainly be conserved, so for every baryon created with a baryon number of +1 an antibaryon will also be created, with a baryon number of -1. In order for baryogenesis to occur, some process must allow for the non-conservation of baryon number (in the standard model the sphaleron process). There are two other conditions, namely there must be C and CP violation. This ensures that there is some preference for the production of matter over antimatter, as equal rates of production would lead to no net gain. The other condition is thermodynamic inequilibrium, which ensures that the reverse process doesn't occur at the same rate, again cancelling out any net gain of baryons. These conditions are collectively known as the Sakharov conditions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ok, let's try to make this as clear as possible. A proton is like a socket. An antiproton is like a plug. Annihilation is when the plug is plugged into the socket. A black hole is like a fire. You throw a plug in one fire, and a socket into another. They're not a plug and a socket anymore, they've burnt. If you join the fires, you're not plugging a plug into a socket, you've just made a bigger fire.</p></div>		</li>
