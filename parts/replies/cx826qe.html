			<div class="markdown"><p>I interpreted the question in terms of biomass, which was the easiest to get numbers for, but obviously that's just one interpretation. </p>
<p>But I like your interpretation - &quot;devoid of all life&quot; is really open ended. Does it mean life was never there in the first place to fix carbon and calcium? Does it mean we fish it all out tomorrow?</p>
<p>If we only consider the biomass of currently living things, what about their waste? Their shells aren't alive per say, but does that mean we should fish out all the shells from the deep too? And the water in their cells - if we fish out all the fish do we wring them dry first? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I very much so liked your interpretation, however I felt I should offer the other interpretation. Using my interpretation I went for a HUGELY conservative estimation of the biogenic component of ocean sediments. My back of the envelope calculations did not take into account the current biological load in the oceans because the number is not significant in comparison to the biogenic component of total ocean sediments. I would also estimate that the actual number if you were to remove all biogenic sediments would be anywhere between 65-180m globally, but again it all depends on what rate of sedimentation you choose, and how long you decide the oceans were dead. </p>
<p>With you example of only living biomass you bring up an interesting point with water in cells. If you go for the interpretation of all the life disappears in an instance I would say no the water should not be wrung out of them first (now this is a funny mental image), but then again I suppose it is up to the person who wrote the question to determine his parameters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But those organisms get that calcium from the water in the first place, causing more to dissolve from both the sediment and calcium bearing rocks. Would the overall material in the ocean really change much if we'd never had life? Possibly, but the bulk of those changes would likely be from gas production - things that actually leave the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what of the <em>carbon</em> that they are ultimately sequestering from the <em>air</em>?  (It's of course still a pittance compared to the total volume of the oceans.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point. I was originally thinking the answer to OP's question was zero since ocean life is composed of water and other molecules that would be part of the ocean anyway. However, the photosynthesis in the ocean does convert CO2 (that otherwise might have been emitted into the atmosphere) into organic molecules.</p>
<p>The answer is still very close to zero, but much more complicated than I originally guessed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They get the minerals from the water yes; but is the change in density between the water and the calcium-carbonate positive or negative?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, even if sea level changed due to the absence of sediments, the ocean itself would not be any shallower.  The seafloor would simply be in a lower place relative to the terrestrial surface.  It would still have roughly the same depth, bathymetric (topographic) changes notwithstanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely correct. I admit in reference to &quot;shallower&quot; I was using the comparison of water level to the terrestrial surface rather than true bathymetry, this was in part due to how I had interpreted the question. </p></div>		</li>
