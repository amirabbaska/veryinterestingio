			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the power of the enormous consumer markets. I'm in energy efficiency and the impact of one led is negligible on the national consumption scale. Every household in America changing out 15 incandescents to leds is an astronomical difference. We've been so successful on doing so that odds are residential general service lighting is going away as a major efficiency channel in the next five years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It still really blows my mind how amazing LEDs are. It's like magic. We went from something that doesn't last long and uses high amounts of energy, to something that essentially lasts forever that takes almost no power. Amazing. If only we could make that leap from current lithium batteries to something else.. although unfortunately lithium batteries were the LED bulb of power... for now, at least.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It took 100+ years but we have maximized the transfer of electricity to light. We started at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_lamp" target="_blank">arc lighting</a>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LEDs are basically the ultimate way to create light. </p>
<p>You carefully create two different materials, such that free electrons in one have slightly less energy and momentum than free electrons in the other. And that difference in energy momentum is exactly the amount of energy and momentum of a photon of a specific frequency. You stick those materials together and run current through them. Electrons flow from one material to the other, but to do so they need to lose energy and momentum - which they emit as a photon of a specific frequency. No messing around, just a direct conversion of electrical energy into light.</p>
<p>Of course, you then need some sort of fluorescence to turn that into non-monochromatic light, which spoils it a bit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not magic, its Government investment in research.  Same reason we have abundant availability of Natural Gas.  We invested in making LEDs cheaper, for both residential and consumer uses, we also invest in Energy Efficiency deployment.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you concerned at all about the changing of LED standards to allow LED's to burn out faster for more sales? Which largely defeats in my opinion half the point of LED's?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you talking about the issue where many cheaper LED bulbs tend to be manufactured with rather poor quality parts (the LED driver and such - but also design issues like inadequate cooling), causing them to fail a (small) fraction of the way through their LED's expected lifetime? As far as I understand it, the issue is that there are no standards being followed in the first place, so I'm confused at your reference to a change in standards. I suppose you could be attempting to refer to informal &quot;standards&quot; seen in the marketplace, but those are not exactly coherent or enforceable, and the tactic of cutting costs at the cost of producing subpar products is an issue seen with countless different product markets - LED bulbs are hardly unique in this aspect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found this entire discussion interesting (and even read parts of a government standard on a Friday night) and pose a slightly different view point on why EnergyStar (EPA) may have changed the requirements slightly that does involve simply &quot;increased sales&quot;.  </p>
<p>From /u/rezachi Below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When theoretical 50,000+ hour lifetimes are possible, it seems a little short sighted to shorten bulb life requirements and then require energy to be used creating and transporting new bulbs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can make cars that go over 230 mph as well, but they are crazy expensive.  What if the EPA did a market analysis and it showed that less longer lasting bulbs were cheap(er) enough / at a price point that a way larger percentage of consumers would replace inefficient bulbs, outweighing the additional shipping of cheap(er) LED bulbs?  Add in that most of those bulbs would last longer than the required 15K hours anyways and they have a win/win scenario.  Doing this probably brought some additional competition to the market as well since cheaper manufacturers would now be able to label their product as EnergyStar^TM.  </p>
<p>Edit:  1) I need to go to bed, 2) even if you are shipping <em>more</em> of the less longer lasting LED bulbs, would you still be shipping less than incandescent/squiggly bulbs as 15K hours is greater than either of those <a href="http://www.ehow.com/facts_5794793_life-expectancy-light-bulbs.html" target="_blank">two typically?</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I built our house 4 years ago I insisted on LEDs for all the canned lights (of which their are many). Our house is a single story, 3200 square feet, is very energy efficient and is in Austin, Texas. Last year our average electricity bill was $88. And yes, we have natural gas for heating. We pay an extra $2 per month to have our electrical cooperative buy our energy from wind and solar providers.</p>
<p>Our house is so efficient that I once had a solar guy come out and run the numbers. There's just no way solar made any sense for us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A REC is a Renewable Energy Credit. In some (maybe all) deregulated states, energy producers are required to have certain amount of renewable energy. I know Ohio is this way. </p>

<p>Companies that don't meet the standard are allowed to buy RECs typically.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In CA, the independent system operator is pushing the distributed energy resource aggregate program so communities can aggregate their renewable resources and sell on the open market. All you need is 0.5MW of aggregate power. The nice thing is that this counts towards the states 50% renewable mandate plan. </p></div>		</li>
