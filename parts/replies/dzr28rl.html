<p>I also learned that after harvest produce gets washed for two minutes with a bleach based sanitizer to remove dirt and germs.</p>

<p>Thats not always (mostly?) how it looks. I worked harvesting fruits and vegetables and we never used anything more than clean water. As far as I know neighboring farmers used only water too. That's how it was when I worked in Germany. </p></div>		</li>

<p>German food quality is miles beyond ours.  Our produce hardly tastes like anything in comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve worked (some time ago now) packing veg and none of it was washed. I worked with sweet corn, squash, strawberries, green beans, rhubarb and marrows etc and it only got washed by the rain. They much preferred picking on dry days as the produce would last much longer without getting wet. (This is in the UK, early 90s, but I can’t really see them changing it much.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YES. Huge difference for the most part. Most farms follow food safety standards and are expected to pass multiple annual inspections to ensure everything is clean and orderly. The larger the facility, likely the higher standards they are held to. I’m taking enormous binders of information. In my industry, one of the most popular audits is GAP (good agricultural practices). People love to hate on large farms but we are held to far higher standards than small ones. Most of the rules that apply to farms in FSMA are based on income and number of employees. This is not to say small farms are bad, but I think our world is becoming far too sterile and getting produce with soil or a little mycelium on it is good for you, but yes there is absolutely an enormous difference between mass producing food and growing for a farmers market. If you kill someone with your produce, you’re going to prison for a looong time. As far as residues go, I’d be more concerned about bacteria and the like from peoples hands touching produce than from crop protectants.</p></div>		</li>
