			<div class="markdown"><p>Like many things in astronomy, it's a lot of educated guesswork. The optical depth τ(x) is defined as τ(x) = Nσx, where N is the column density (number of photon absorbers per square meter), and σ is the average cross section of the photon absorbers. These can be found with knowledge of the star's chemical composition, which is typically measured through spectroscopy.</p>
<p>(Take this all with a grain of salt, as radiative transfer isn't really my specialty.)</p></div>		</li>

Of course, we've gotten a bit better at it since now we can measure it <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/750/2/135/meta" target="_blank">from space</a> with much better equipment.</p>
<p>We can also <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/529492/pdf" target="_blank">measure</a> it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helioseismology" target="_blank">helioseismology</a>, which is studying the properties of seismic waves on the sun, which we can see thanks to the <a href="http://physics1.usc.edu/solar/project.html" target="_blank">Doppler shift</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Hmm, I've only ever heard of defining a photosphere by the location where τ = 2/3.  This is where the gas is thin enough to allow photons to escape out to space, but still thick enough that the gas is emitting a good deal of light; per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_depth_(astrophysics\)" target="_blank">the Eddington Approximation</a> this is also where the effective temperature = actual temperature, and thus most of the photons we see are from that depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's true. I remember seeing a 1 used somewhere, although it may have been a crude approximation for rough estimation/ease of calculation. I've updated my comment to reflect that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since it depends on wavelength, an optical depth of 1 is typically a good value to teach undergrads in astrophysics. Values much greater than 1 indicate an optically thick medium, values much less than 1 are optically thin, and the <em>exact</em> crossover isn't addressed much. If a first year student were asked to calculate the optical depth and describe what it meant, and got a value of about 5, I think they'd be perfectly justified in saying that it was neither clearly optically thick nor thin. That limit is only ever listed as approximate, but it's a good (and easily memorable/usable) number for a student. It's what I covered during my undergraduate, and I think it's fine to leave the exact number to the academic papers. </p></div>		</li>
