			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting, but I'm having trouble understanding. You mean there is a bulge in the atmosphere facing the sun because of heat expansion? How does it compare to the tidal force caused by the moon? Also, could you talk a bit more about the atmosphere's resonant period and its effects? By &quot;propagate around the Earth&quot;, you mean from one edge to the other (propagating in all directions on the surface) or full circle (circulating around the planet)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bulge actually peaks about 45 degrees from the sun-Earth line. Normally the torque from this tide is negligible compared to the lunar torque on the oceans (which don't respond to thermal heating as much because they don't expand when heated), except when the Earth is spinning near atmospheric resonance. At these points, the generated thermal tide can be very large and exceed all other tidal forces on the Earth, at least according to the (relatively simple) calculations in our paper and a few other related papers we reference. </p>
<p>By propagate around the Earth, I mean that the waves disperse spherically, but since the Earth is roughly spherical, the amount of time to travel around the equator vs disperse around the Earth and return is roughly the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, solar winds are high energy charged particles, mostly electrons, and (thankfully) don't contribute a measurable amount to the heating of the earth. This is just due to heating of the atmosphere through photon energy, mostly visible light. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, the solar wind does contribute a <em>lot</em> to the heating of the very upper atmosphere, although somewhat indirectly.</p>
<p>Charged particles from the solar wind get temporarily trapped in the Van Allen Belts, but depending on the interplanetary magnetic field, these can get dumped onto the atmosphere. Spiraling inwards on magnetic field lines, they get accelerated to some pretty serious velocities, and end up heating the exosphere quite a bit.</p>
<p>Consider that the Earth's exosphere is heated to ~1000K, while the exospheres of both Mars and Venus (lacking magnetospheres) are only around 200K.</p>
<p>This is totally separate from the Hough modes you're talking about, though, which is direct thermal heating through radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for answering this! Everyone is talking about ocean tides, and I was very confused. From what I read, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_tide#Lunar_atmospheric_tides" target="_blank">the ocean does play a small role in atmospheric tides,</a> but not as much as heat.</p></div>		</li>
