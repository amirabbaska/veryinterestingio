			<div class="markdown"><p>If I read him correctly, peanuts (and perhaps foods like avocado) unfairly were lumped into a category into which they do not belong (peanuts being less detrimental than red meat), just so the USDA could avoid saying &quot;eat less red meat&quot; for political reasons. A lesson in unintended consequences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very random. I'm helping my girlfriend studying for the RD exam currently. One practice question of A-D multiple choice options had peanuts as the correct answer as the most carcinogenic. It's obviously relative to the other options, but it must be notably carcinogenic to be a stand out answer. I'm too lazy to Google/research why, but thought I'd comment. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you ever compared the nutrion label of &quot;regular&quot; food to its low fat counterpart? <a href="http://www.nutritionpedia.com/images/1177970407-Food%20Label%20-%20Nonfat%20vs%20Regular.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.nutritionpedia.com/images/1177970407-Food%20Label%20-%20Nonfat%20vs%20Regular.jpg</a></p>

<p>Several decades ago the (I believe) USDA came right out and said &quot;eat less red meat,&quot; in response to sound science</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The science was anything but sound. Politicians needed to look like they were doing something, so they used bad science to demonize something and just went with it.</p></div>		</li>
