			<div class="markdown"><p>The mercalli scale is highly dependent on the area it affects though. The same earthquake could have completely different magnitudes on mercalli vs Richter when it hits a forest, a Japanese city and a Haitian city. Its not great for saying how violent an earthquake is, its a scale for destruction caused</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Mercalli scale is not meant to measure destruction caused, rather it looks at destruction caused and from that attempts to deduce how intense the shaking was. It takes building quality into account when doing so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about this exact scale but for measuring actual impact it's useful to measure the intensity on a scale that is based on reports. You can make the questions and interrogations scientific enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you're saying, perhaps what I meant was it is not necessarily based on hard numbers.  I still think it is useful in certain contexts, just like the imperial system.</p></div>		</li>
