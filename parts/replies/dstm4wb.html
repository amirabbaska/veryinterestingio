			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont doubt it but i can only speak for outer body parts in regards to high mag aluminum alloys. Possibly frame as well but im not entirely sure. There are hundreds of different alloys for many purposes that we make and we usually arent told exactly what ends up being manufactured from it after rolling and cutting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to remember reading somewhere that there was an older sports car model (Porsche 911 Targa perhaps?)that had a magnesium frame. I thought I remember it being notoriously called the “Widowmaker” because it would light up if the car’s frame were to make contact with the asphalt at a high velocity. Anybody know anything about that or am I just imagining this? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;widowmaker&quot; was applied to a few 911s, mainly 2wd turbos - but that was to do with the handling, weight distribution and power - never heard anything about flammability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dan Gurneys 1966-67 F1 Eagle was entirely made of sheet magnesium. He refused to use seatbelts in case of fire or crash, he preferred to be ejected from the car. He died on the 14th at age 86.</p>
<p>I worked with vintage magnesium wheels, we always had a mechanic ready with an extinguisher.</p>
<p>So yes, late 60s early 70s race cars used significant amounts of high magnesium alloy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were called &quot;widow makers,&quot; yes, but not because of a tendency to catch fire, but because they were notoriously difficult to drive.  They had a tendency to spin out mid-corner with even an above-average driver behind the wheel and it wasn't unusual for the outside of the corner to contain a tree or other car.</p>
<p>Old 911s have really, really light front-ends (the front inside tire will often lift off the ground during hard cornering), but also a heavy rear that wants to pull the rear of the car out. </p>
<p>Here's a cool video of a guy explaining how to drive an old 911 fast.</p>
