<p>Another thing that we look out for is water activity, this is the available water in a system and is required for bacteria or fungi to grow. Typically, bacteria need 0.9 or above and fungi need minimum 0.7. Honey, which seems well known for it's &quot;anti-spoiling&quot; character has a water activity of around 0.6. Things that contribute to water activity include sugar and salt, so products high in either (like honey) tend to spoil a lot slower. An open jar of honey will absorb water from the atmosphere and thereby increase it's water activity.</p>
<p>Further to this, the question is dependent on your qualification of &quot;good&quot;. A undamaged can of food can be food safe for a very long time, however, any or emulsions (such as a sauce or soup) will separate gradually just due to Brownian motion (random movement of particles) and gravity. This separation initially can be reversed by shaking but after a while, fat will separate to the top and create a &quot;plug&quot;. Manufacturers add emulsifiers and stabilizers to subvert this but nothing is ever fool-proof. So for me, food won't stay &quot;good&quot; as I'm not a fan of eating lumps of fat.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other bacteria that produce endospores (dormant survival capsule) and are therefore quite heat resistant, but none are as dangerous as Clostridium botulinum. Many of them produce gas, so a contamination would result in a bulging can, indicating the spoilage. There is actually a super heat resistant bacteria (Bacillus thermophilus, if I recall) that can spoil the food, and its endospores can survive even the commercial canning process. However, the active bacteria are all killed, and the endospores of this species will not germinate at normal household temperatures so normally it causes no problems. Leave cans of food for long periods in warm places (like inside your car in the summer) and you can &quot;awaken&quot; the endospores, in which case your cans will get spoiled even though no seal was broken. They use this bacteria as an indicator that something is completely sterilized--they will take sample cans from a batch and incubate at 55 C for 7 days. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23728430/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23728430/</a> </p></div>		</li>
