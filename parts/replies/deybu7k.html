			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're getting registration codes (AKA tail numbers) confused with transponder/squawk codes.  </p>
<p>ATC IDs aircraft using transponder codes, which are either connected to an IFR (instrument flight rules) flight plan that the pilot filed (and received clearance for) before taking off, or the controller can assign a squawk code to VFR aircraft requesting flight following. VFR codes always look like &quot;12xx&quot;, including thousands of airplanes right now flying below ~18,000 feet, talking to no one, and squawking plain old 1200.</p>
<p>ATC refer to aircraft by their tail number (private) or call sign (commercial or military). </p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>If something happens and the airplane loses it's ability to send information to the ATC, a power failure, terrorist take-over, or just incompetence, the person responsible for that piece of airspace has to contact it a number of times and if it does not respond it hat to notify the military or the air force that they have a rogue plane.</del></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a plane has difficulty, they have transponder options:</p>
<p>hijack: change squawk to 7500</p>
<p>No radio: 7600</p>
<p>Emergency: 7700</p>
<p>Also keep in mind even small private planes frequently carry more than one radio and continually monitor &quot;Guard&quot; frequency, which is used an alternate/emergency frequency. If I saw an aircraft in controlled airspace that I wasn't talking to, I would coordinate with controllers in adjacent airspace to make sure the guy has the right freq. Then I would hail the plane on Guard frequency.  Seldom goes farther than that.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>US ATC protocol does not work that way, there is no universal transponder requirement, and taxi clearance is only required at controlled airports. </p>
<p>Lots of small to mid-size commercial jets operate from uncontrolled fields and nobody but the neighbors would have any clue that they departed if conditions were VFR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only true with adsb... Not a standard mode c transponder. And either can be disabled or modified. </p></div>		</li>
