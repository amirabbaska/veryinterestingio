			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes,  it is incorrect to say we see in 3D.  We see two 2D images which produces a perception of depth.  Seeing in 1D means you see in a continuum along one dimension.  You can see its left and right side simultaneously. Seeing in 2D means we see in a continuum along two dimensions, as we do.  You can see the left and right,  top and bottom simultaneously. Seeing in 3D would mean seeing in a continuum along three dimensions.  Seeing in 3D would mean you can see the front and back of an object simultaneously (along with left/right and top/bottom).  Depth perception does not allow us to do this.  It merley attributes a depth to 2D images projected onto a plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We see the world in 3D only. If you can percieve the shape of an object then you have accuratly seen it in 2D. If you can percieve the distance at which an object is kept, then you have seen it in 3D.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a single retina only picks up a 2D image. </p>
<p>However, binocular vision, parallax, depth of field, and other factors allow our brain to perceive a depth to the 2D image. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More so, but not entirely. You only lose the binocular cue, which really only work for close objects. You still have parallax, depth of field, and angular size.  </p></div>		</li>
