			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition certain cultures traditionally had a much less varied diet than what OP refers to. See inuit diet, which is rich in vitamin C just from eating the right types of meat and some berries:

			<div class="markdown"><p>In more addition, our modern diet of eating just the &quot;best&quot; parts of something would be completely foreign to a hunter-gatherer society.</p>
<p>The Iniuit diet, in particular, was mainly meat, but not just steaks. They ate the organs, marrow, etc. This allows for a much greater variety of necessary vitamins and minerals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My understanding is that those <em>were</em> regarded as the best parts, but I can't vouch for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution is not intelligent. If we evolved out of having a trait, it was because either there was a benefit where people who did not have that trait reproduced and others did not, or there was no pressure either way and those who lacked the trait somehow benefited (in this example, saving energy by not producing vitamin C could have staved off starvation?)</p></div>		</li>
