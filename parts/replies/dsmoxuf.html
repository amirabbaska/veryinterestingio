			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Environmentally respectful</strong> can't be overemphasized in this context. </p>
<p>The largest (at the time) fire in Arizona history was started, in part, by a stranded motorist trying to attract the attention of a helicopter.  </p>
<p>So began the &quot;Chedeski&quot; fire which eventually merged with the arson-caused &quot;Rodeo&quot; fire to create the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodeo%E2%80%93Chediski_Fire" target="_blank">Rodeoâ€“Chedeski fire</a> which burned for 3 weeks in 2002, across nearly 500,000 acres of forested land.</p>
<p>The &quot;Rodeo&quot; arsonist went to prison for 10 years.  The &quot;Chedeski&quot; motorist was not criminally charged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Open ground. Cut/scrap a &quot;Help&quot;, &quot;SOS&quot;, or anything unnatural in the earth that will attract attention.  </p>
<p>Single tree with a fire in the open. You get the idea.  A plane will see it.</p>
<p>Edit: One instructor taught me. If you find a wooden telephone/power pole.  Burn it/cut it down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One fire, people think it's someone camping. Three fires, people investigate. Plus it's an international distress signal, so the professionals will know you're in trouble </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're going to stay put, by all means make yourself obvious.  Light fires, hang bright things from trees, <em>make a freaking impact</em>.  </p>
<p>This lady got lost in the woods, stayed put for 26 days and apparently did <em>nothing</em> to make herself easier to find.  She ran out of food and died.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the more general version of this problem, a party is separated into two or more parts. Then it is pretty clear that &quot;always wait&quot; isn't going to be a good strategy. If you can decide ahead of time, you can usually use a &quot;adult-child&quot; strategy, and designate some particular person as a mover, and everyone else as a stayer.</p></div>		</li>
