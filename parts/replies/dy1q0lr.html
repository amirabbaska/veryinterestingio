<p>Brown dwarfs arn't stars since they don't sustain fusion. They are on the threshold but still not large enough to be stars, instead they emit heat solely from gravitational compression. Jupiter does this too, but not nearly on the same scale (Jupiter is the only planet in the solar system that hasn't reached thermal equilibrium yet).</p></div>		</li>
