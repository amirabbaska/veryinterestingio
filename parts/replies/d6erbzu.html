<p>Would it even be possible for a human to get close enough to a black hole to notice these effects? I understand that the gravity around a black hole is extremely high (is that the right word?). Wouldn't that much force kill a human before we got close?</p>
<p>I'm just curious because this was the question that came to mind after watching that scene in Interstellar where they landed on a planet so close to a black hole that time was moving slower (relatively) for the people on it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd guess it would take an extraordinary amount of delta V to park in a circular orbit about a black hole at 1.5 Schwarzchild radius. Plus the obstacle of traveling light years is likely insurmountable.</p>
<p>For small to moderate sized black holes tidal forces would tear you apart. Spaghettification is the term sometimes used, if memory serves.</p>
<p>For very large black holes the gravity gradient might be shallow enough to allow your body to stay intact. Even in this scenario, I believe the extremely energetic environment would create lots of heat, gamma rays, high energy ions, etc.. Not a good place for meat bodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So we'll likely never get close enough to a black hole to see how it would look in person or to see if time dilation would work the way we think it does? I assume our best bet, if ever we were able to travel that far, would be to send drones or cameras rather than people. Bummer.</p></div>		</li>
