			<div class="markdown"><p>I had tinnitus back in 2013, for a period of time. I can't remember exactly but it was probably for around 3 months or more.</p>
<p>I sympathize with all of you, it sucks and you really don't appreciate not having it until you actually experience what it's like.</p>
<p>I got a question though, why wasn't mine permanent? It was terrible at the start, I would wake up in the middle of the nights DUE TO the sound being so high, sleeping was a pain and I always had to put on some waterfall/rain noise or something to be able to sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nerves recover slower than other cells. I think that that there are multiple different disorders that cause tinnitus. As such, there is no universal explanation as to what causes it. It's not a satisfying answer, so I'm sorry. There are lots of different ways nerves are injured - toxins, deficiencies, viral infections, etc. Maybe you healed up on your own maybe it was something else. Tinnitus isn't as &quot;sexy&quot; as heart disease so fuck decent funding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I reckon you had some non permanent damage or maybe an infection in your ear and you recovered. Either that or you have a magic brain that managed to drain out the noise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely sure if it can be solely caused by it, but stress can definitely increase it. Maybe you still have it slightly and it was increased by outward factors that are no longer present?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just suddenly had it after I was at the mall, I can remember it like it was yesterday, the only thing that stood out was that at the mall, my ear became &quot;clogged&quot;, you know the thing that can happen because of pressure differences, like when you drive into a tunnel, or take off or land in a plane, usually not a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend claims she can actually make herself hear a high pitched tone by tensing some muscles in her ear or something. I think she is crazy, but could there be a similar explanation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible. I have tinnitus and can make louder if I clamp my jaws together. Your girlfriend might want to check for TMJ disorder (which can make your ear ring as well.) I don't have it but was tested for it when I told that I have somewhat control over the ringing.
It's also possible that she just can push the ear drum to create noise.</p>
<p>So no worries, not crazy. (At least not with this. Haha!)</p></div>		</li>
