			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually when you burn wood or something other organic (as in carbon based) material, it combines with atmospheric oxygen to make CO2. However, when you heat it in a low or no oxygen environment, all the water evaporates off and the long chained molecules begin to break down into shorter-chained molecules. This is pyrolysis. Pyrolysing wood is how you get charcoal. It's useful because most of the &quot;investment&quot; of energy has been made into breaking the molecules without getting the energy out, so you have something that burns more easily and at a higher temperature.</p></div>		</li>
