			<div class="markdown"><p>If someone is wondering why, normally boiling water has a max temperature of 100 °C.  If you give more heat to the water, temperature doesn't go up, but it is used to make the liquid transition into gas. </p>
<p>If you raise the pressure though, the boiling mark raises, so water boils at more than 100 °C</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Pressure canning is the only safe way to process many meats and vegetables at home.</p>
<p>Also, we totally can salmon in actual cans.  You can buy then by the case locally

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the can, or the lid, rusts and gets a hole in it, and germs get in that way. That's why, if you find that your canned food has a loose lid, or if the pressure bubble on the lid is popped, you should discard it- the can got unsealed at some point, and you don't know how long it's been open.</p>
<p>Or because sometimes, not <em>all</em> the germs were killed, and, over enough time, they can thrive inside the can. This is uncommon- even if it weren't for the boiling, the environment inside cans and jars isn't good for most germs-, but one of the germs that can do it, <em>C Botulinum</em>, lays down an incredibly poisonous chemical when it grows. (When it's in its dormant state, it's mostly harmless.) It creates gas as it grows, so cans that look like they're bulging from the inside are especially important to avoid.</p>
<p>And, last, some foods gradually break down over time, all on their own. The acids in tomatoes, for instance will- given enough time- reduce the rest of the fruit to mush. This kind of spoiled food isn't usually <em>dangerous</em>, but it's pretty unappetizing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As it is sterilised at 128⋅C all the bacteria are killed, even the spores which generally survive a standard. The food will not actually go bad inside, just the taste will start to change, as long as the can is in perfect condition.</p></div>		</li>
