			<p>The thing is, until recently, college DID guarantee a good job.  It wasn't until recently that practically everyone went to college, and so it used to be that a degree gave you a huge advantage in the job market.  As far as the spending is concerned, while yes, overspending is a problem, I don't think it's as bad as you make it out.  I mean, a decent-sized TV really doesn't cost all that much these days.  A lot of things that were once considered extreme luxuries are much more affordable than they once were.  A basic computer used to set you back a couple thousand dollars, now, you can get one for a few hundred, and that's not even factoring in the effects of inflation which means that $2000 Apple II cost a lot more back then and could do far less.<br><br>There are some problems, to be sure, but I don't think this generation is any less responsible than any other - it's just they were prepared for an economy that doesn't exist anymore, an economy where a college degree guaranteed success and employment was a lot more stable.  <br><br>And I mean, in addition the flood of college graduates, look at the type of employment.  It used to be you could get good money through loyalty and hard work at a factory job.  Now there's no such thing as a stable job, and you really have to fight to get any job which commands a high salary (and even then, that job could disappear at any time).  And that's a HUGE thing - if employment is far more fluid, then you really can't plan for the future.  Forget saving for a house, you can't buy a house if you have no assurances you'll have the same employment five years down the line.  Maybe there's a little more living for the moment, but only because it's been made abundantly clear that you can't make any sort of long-term plans in this economy.</p>		</li>
