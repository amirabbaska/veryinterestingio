			<div class="markdown"><p>This is rubbish.</p>
<p>Numbers are just a human construct, to help us understand things, and order those things. Numbers are not how the universe operates. Its our best attempt to understand it, and create repetitive patterns to analyse things beyond our natural ability, and self. Its our version of a 'shared intelligence' with each other, in order to build upon discoveries of other humans. A comon language. No less significant with regards to science and human progression than when humans started to speak to each other.</p>
<p>As for the Origins of life (Im sure you mean Origins of Species) which was presented by a biologist, not a philosopher. You putting SCIENCE down, because of some preconcieved religious notion, is rubbish. Evolution is one of the greatest Scientific discoviries ever made. And yes it shits on the bullshit in the bible called creationism.</p>
<p>I agree, that religious thought, however, is utter trash, with no scientific evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant the origins of life.  Differentiation in species is certainly a question for biologists.  But how life originally arose, where the universe comes from, the big questions of creation are fundamentally mathematical questions now.</p>
<p>In a way you are right that math, english, logic, are a bit like different computer programs.  I could write out with words a description of how a ball falls through gravitational accelleration in microsoft word.  I could use powerpoint (logic if you will permit the analogy), to show it using slides and animations, but I think you will agree that it is Excel, where i can input the formulas, that is the most useful application for the task.  In fact it becomes absurd to try and use word to describe a nuclear reaction, or powerpoint to illustrate the physics of turbulance.  But excell keeps working.  Excell seems to handle everything... except perhaps quantum (which is its own kind of exciting).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the mathematics of it, like I said, is just a way of reasoning.. a communication tool, to logically assess events. A shared communal logic that is integral to human advancement. It's our biological advantage so to speak, that keeps us relevant. (At least to each other, and how we interpret the world around us).</p>
<p>Physical discoveries are just as important. And it's not just about quantum theory. </p>
<p>This is a question that man has always speculated about since forever. And frankly, we are not even close to significant enough as a species. A dot in the cosmos, to answer these questions. </p>
<p>We can only broaden human understanding of the world around us. Not really find answers to what really is.</p>
<p>Even human free will... is based on evolution. On our genetics, and the linear events that have happened to us. (Life experiences). </p>
<p>Hell we aren't even the dominant species from an evolutionary point of view. We're just the dominant mammal. (And even then we haven't stood the test of time).</p></div>		</li>
