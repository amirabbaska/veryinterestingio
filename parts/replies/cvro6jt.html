			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen lions in the wild, and ever since then every time I see one at the zoo it makes me so sad how different they look.  So weak and worn down.  The wild ones look like killing machines, and their eyes are like demons.  Zoo lions just look like they're tired and restless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah people need to stop saying lifestyle. Cats strength and musculature has nothing to do with their lifestyle. Male lions for example do not hunt. Female lions do the hunting yet the males are larger and more muscular. This turns this entire lifestyle thing on it's head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not exactly true.  Male lions hunt all the time.   They hunt for themselves on their own or in pairs or threes when they leave their home pride as adolecents, and they are particularly valuable to a pride in areas where larger prey animals like buffalo, giraffe, hippo, and zebra are common because their size and power really helps.  If you merely hit up YouTube  you'll see dozens of videos of male lions hunting. </p>
<p>Either a female or male lion that isn't out doing shit will be a sad reflection of it's potential.  Males hunt, fight, and patrol constantly, and if they don't, like in a zoo, they are fat and soft.  Females are the same, they just don't have the testosterone and genes to make the huge powerful bodies the males have, but if they were sedentary ALL the time, they would be weak.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's fairly common knowledge that female lions do the hunting in prides. Males only hunt when they do not have a pride. Again your argument can be shown to be false simply by pointing out that the male lions with a pride who do no hunting do not dwindle in muscle mass. They remain larger and more muscular than the females.</p>
<p>I don't see what your second paragraph has to do with anything other than some sort of weird excercise lion fat shaming. Not sure where you're going with this. I'm not a lion nor am I advocating lion laziness as a &quot;sad reflection of their potential&quot;. What the fuck does that even mean? Are you like a lion pesonal trainer or something?</p></div>		</li>
