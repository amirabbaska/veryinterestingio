			<div class="markdown"><p>Hormones are plant growth regulators (PGRs) the differences as to whether they are hormones or not is if they are endogenous. Indole acetic acid (IAA) is a hormone, it is produced primarily is in the apical meristem. Phenylacetic acid (PAA) and indole butyric acid (IBA) are also endogenous auxin hormones. Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4 Dichlorophenozyqcetic acid (2,4 D) and 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5 T) are synthetic auxin-like compounds that are not technically hormones. They are still considered plant growth regulators and are used in tissue culture as cheap auxin-like alternatives.</p>
<p>Auxin is actually is one of the primary factors in root growth, it is produced in the meristem and transported to the roots. Auxins are involved in root hair growth and in tissue culture are used for the induction of adventitious root growth. Cytokinins (the other major plant hormone or PGR) inhibit root growth.</p>
<p>Also gravitropism is for gravity and is achieved through specialized amyloplast in the roots. These plastids contain starch granules that fall to the bottom of the cell in relation to gravity acting as a signal for the roots to grow in that direction.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to comment on the accuracy of the post you're replying to, but whether a chemical messenger is considered a &quot;hormone&quot; or not depends on how/where it's being used.</p>
<p>Adrenalin (epinephrine) in humans for example, is considered a neurotransmitter when used to carry messages from neuron to neuron across a synapse, but a hormone when released into the blood to carry messages to disparate targets. </p>
<p>In addition to neurotransmitters (seeing as how we're talking about plants after all) There are also chemical messengers that are used in signalling other nearby cells, or even the same cell that excreted them. Traditionally, hormones are only those chemicals that are released broadly, and that carry messages between distant targets (particularly through the circulatory system)</p>
<p>Some feel this classification is overly strict though, so don't be surprised if you see someone using it differently.</p></div>		</li>
