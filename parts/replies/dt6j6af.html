<p>The conditions that must be satisfied in order to ignore orbital mechanics are: The distance to the target must be negligible when compared to the orbit's length The delta-v must be negligible when compared to orbital speed The time it takes you to reach the target must be negligible when compared to the orbital period</p>

<p>Hi, I am terrible at markup.</p>
<p>I think this summary is great - I would love to plagiarize it</p></div>		</li>

<p>Looks like you've edited and corrected that, but I think it was better before.</p>
<p>Burn prograde -&gt; increase your speed -&gt; increase your energy -&gt; increase your altitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I had that in mind, but I &quot;took a shortcut&quot; because I was thinking circular orbit and meant that when I burn prograde to increase my speed it will raise the apoapis and then when I am aat apoapsis I burn again to circularize.</p>
<p>But yeah, totally should have written it like this. Thanks for clarifying this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll just go with the intuitive concept: you're changing the potential energy of your satellite, so burning outwards will definitely put you in a higher orbit. At the same time the velocity vector will no longer be perpendicular to the position vector, so your orbit will become elliptical as others said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a bit of difficult to grasp this. If I burn outward, it doesn't change my speed along the prograde vector, so how come my final orbit will be higher? That is really bugging me.<br />
Is this because:  </p>
<ol>
<li>I made the assumption that burning radially did not have any prograde component (which is wrong, except at apo and periapsis)?</li>
<li>I made the simplification that altitude of orbit is defined by speed where it should be that altitude of orbit is defined by <em>energy</em>? But in this case, isn't it the same?</li>
</ol>
<p>So how can I solve this &quot;problem&quot; of burning outward?<br />
In the light of your comments and the other comments, here is what I've got, but I know this is wrong:</p>
<ol>
<li>burning outward (radial out) in an elliptical orbit has <em>necessary</em> a prograde / retrograde component, so this <em>will</em> increase my speed along the prograde vector, so this will change my altitude. But then this seems to mean this is inefficient and thus should never be used, so clearly I am missing something.</li>
<li>
<p>burning radial in/out at apo and periapsis will &quot;rotate&quot; the ellipse without changing its altitude. The way I understand it is that if I burn outward at apoapsis, I will tend to &quot;hold onto my apoapsis a little longer&quot;, which effectively &quot;drags it with me&quot;, so, to simplify I will stay at my apoapsis at long as I burn, and when I stop, the new apoapsis will stop moving with me and I'll begin descending back to the planet.</p>
</li>
<li>seems plausible, but I know 1. is wrong. I still don't understand it, though :/</li>
</ol>
<p>As for rendezvous, that was very clear, and I think this is &quot;solved&quot; in my head now, thanks again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Velocity alone is not enough to define an orbit. Also energy alone cannot fully define it, but it determines the semi-major axis of your ellipse (or radius if it is a circle). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy</a></p>
<p>You appear to be confused about the prograde component. The burn itself does not provide prograde velocity, but you already had some prograde velocity before burning (otherwise you wouldn't have achieved orbit) and the outwards burn is adding a perpendicular component to it.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://i.imgur.com/e0KS4VJ.png" target="_blank">this diagram</a> (don't take it too literally because it is hand drawn without caring much about the mathematical details). Before burning you were in a circular orbit (the smaller circle a bit to the right) with velocity v1. The delta-v was perpendicular to it, and after burning your velocity becomes v2. You are faster because the magnitude of v1 + deltav is greater than the magnitude of v1. So I drew an ellipse that is a bit bigger than the circle.</p>
<p>In any case, your new orbit must be tangential to your new velocity at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok I see. But if I had burned prograde at the same point. This would have grown the small ellipse at its opposite point, right?</p>
<p>So it seems both by burning prograde and radial out I increase my semi-major axis. But I have the feeling that burning prograde does that more efficiently. Hence my wondering about the need / use-case to burn radial at all.</p></div>		</li>
