			<p>Research on pain and pain science backs this up. Check out the noigroup or body in mind if looking for eli25 explanations.</p>		</li>

			<p>And that explains phantom limb pain and sensation along with other pain sensations when no obvious tissue damage has occurred. <br><br>But it isn't the full story either. The brain is critical for processing the input and creating the perception of pain but the inputs that feed the brain are vastly critical too. If the nocioreceptors aren't working, there's no input to the pain to process. Kinda like a CPU without heat detection. I was reading about erythemelalgia on Wiki and  I'll paste the really interesting bit:<br><br>&quot;In 2004 erythromelalgia became the first human disorder in which it has been possible to associate an ion channel mutation with chronic neuropathic pain;[3] when its pathophysiology was initially published in the Journal of Medical Genetics.[4] Conversely, in December 2006 a University of Cambridgeteam reported an SCN9A mutation that resulted in a complete lack of pain sensation in a Pakistani street performer and some of his family members. He felt no pain, walked on hot coals and stabbed himself to entertain crowds.[5]&quot;<br><br>Link: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythromelalgia" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythromelalgia</a></p>		</li>

			<p>An interesting aside to this is that you actually can make pain stop in limited situations.  If I'm experiencing a steady throbbing pain in, say, my arm or leg, or a headache, I can convince myself that the pain doesn't exist by insisting to my brain that where it hurts actually feels just like the corresponding limb or side of my head that does <em>not</em> hurt.  This doesn't work well for a quick sharp pain, probably because it's not a long enough sensation for me to head off, if you will.   I used to think I was making my body produce natural painkillers but apparently I'm just psyching myself out.</p>		</li>
