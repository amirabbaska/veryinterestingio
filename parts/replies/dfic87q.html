			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually wrong, and I only do chem. You're describing absorption/emission, but it's scattering/reflection that applies here.</p>
<p>If it was absorption that caused reflection, you'd need an excited state for every colour of light that gets reflected, and as we all know, excited states are quantized: only specific frequencies of light get absorbed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classically, reflection is caused by interaction between the electric field from the incoming electromagnetic wave and free electrons (assuming a metallic surface). There are plenty of free excitation states of free electrons to consider it as an absorption continuum. Oscillatory motion of the electrons induces emission of an electromagnetic wave, similar to a dipole antenna, which cancels  partially the wave propagating in the medium and the collection of these radiators emit a well defined reflected wave following Huygens-Fresnel principle (I hate these calculations). The incoming light is absorbed at the surface (skin depth) which is significantly shorter (~10nm) than the wavelength that can be absorbed (~&gt;500 nm in most metallic conductors) so the reflected light maintains phase coherency.</p>
<p>You are describing interaction between light and a material with quantized states such as nanoparticles or non-conductors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally a proper answer.</p>
<p>Another question though- how does water reflect light when it's electronic structure is obviously not metallic? Also why the angular dependence on reflection, some angles reflect but some don't?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it impossible for this interaction to produce (reflect) light of a different wavelength than that of the incoming light? If I understood reflection as an actual bounce, it would make sense that there could be no wavelength change, but if reflection is a transfer of energy and a release of that energy due to instability, it seems like there would sometimes be occurrences where the wavelength changes upon reflection. I understand that with lasers, it is possible to double a frequency (which I understand means to half the wavelength) in order to achieve green light from infrared light, but I don't understand how.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fluorescence if it produces light of a significantly different wave length, and thinking of reflection as an actual bounce is the best way to think of it. Reflection is an elastic scattering, though in real life situations there is a little bit of energy loss which causes a minuscule redshift (not large enough to measure).</p>
<p>Lasers are a whole different ball game I don't feel comfortable talking about atm.</p></div>		</li>
