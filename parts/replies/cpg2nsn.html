<p>Completely false. Many industrial nations out there have private multi-payer systems. In Europe the two most commonly mentioned examples are Germany and Switzerland. </p>
<p>Did you mean universal healthcare perhaps? Universal healthcare just means &quot;everyone gets healthcare&quot;, but yes America is the only industrialized nation that does not cover its entire population. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak for Switzerland, by my understanding of the German system is this: </p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody is required to have health care. If you are very poor, the government covers your premium, otherwise you pay it yourself. </li>
<li>There are several public (i.e government sponsored) health insurance companies whose prices are slightly different, but not by very much. They are always a certain percentage of your income. They don't have much wiggle room in the pricing, since there are strict regulations about it. Public health insurance normally cannot refuse to take you, unless you have changed into private health insurance before (see below).</li>
<li>There are also private health insurers who have a bit more freedom with their pricing. Generally, they are cheaper than the public ones when you're young, and more expensive when you're old.</li>
<li>You can only opt for a private insurer if you earn more than a certain amount of money per month, and once you've switched, there's no easy way back to public health care. The only way would be to show proof that you are so broke you basically need welfare, in which case (among other things) you get reassigned to the public system.</li>
<li>An official catalogue lists the prices for every insured medical procedure, ranging from a simple consultation to a complex surgery. Public health insurers will pay doctors the base price, while private insurers will pay the base price * some multiplier.</li>
<li>When you're in the public insurance system, you hardly ever see any medical bills. The main exceptions are dental work and glasses/contact lenses where you usually have to pay at least part o f the cost (unless you're on welfare, in which case the government steps in again). At pharmacies, you also pay some part (up to 10 Euros, I think) of a medication's price. Your premiums are not affected by how much or how little you need to get medical care. (The idea is that it averages out in the long run – everyone has times when they are healthy and times when they are sick. If the pool of insured patients is big and diverse enough, there should be enough money available at any given time.)  </li>
<li>Private patients will often get better service (i.e. nicer hospital rooms, shorter waiting time for doctor's appointments), but they usually will have to foot their medical bills themselves, first, and then send them to the insurance to be reimbursed. As a private patient, your insurance premiums may rise, if you have the insurance pay for a lot of medical bills.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've skipped over a lot of details, but AFAIK that's the basic design of the German system. (Somebody correct me, please, if I made mistakes.) It's not perfect by any means – &quot;fixing health care&quot; has been on the agenda of every government since the 1980s – but from my perspective as a lowly public health care patient, it works comparatively well. At least I never have to worry about not being able to afford necessary medical care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Germany and Switzerland run healthcare markets with such stringent regulation it would be unrecognizable to Americans. The Swiss model, for instance is not without controversy and a constant push for reform, and in addition some of the regulations are completely unworkable for an American market. Deo is correct and you are describing two unlike things using the same language. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like how you pull that number for Canada out of your ass and nobody challenges you on it.<br />
Canada actually suffers from huge healthcare cost increases every year.  So by 2012 they were spending $6000 per capita, not $3500.  And the only reason why this number may have improved since is that their currency tanked in value, which is hardly an achievement of public health policy.</p>

<p>The US certainly still spends more, but not that much more than Canada, and if you actually look at the rate of growth of costs Canada has been doing really badly so I wouldn't be surprised if they caught up to us in another few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, you're correct I remembered 3500 but 4500 would be more accurate. However, the data still states plainly that the US spends far more than most other nations for its healthcare.</p>

<p>United States 8,508
Canada   4,522</p>
<p>Also, if you take into account the difference in who is covered, per capita costs of people who actually get medical treatment in the US are approaching twice the price of Canada. I don't think your argument that we don't spend &quot;much more&quot; than Canada holds water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canadian here. This is exactly what I thought. Not to mention that the high tax rate that Canadians currently pay still does not cover all of the costs. We are creating an enormous federal debt, due to health care spending; and this is creating a false idea of which health care services should be expected. I feel guilty that the future generations are going to suffer picking up the tab. </p></div>		</li>
