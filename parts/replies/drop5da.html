			<div class="markdown"><p>Depressive realism is not considered to be an illness in and of itself according to the DSM-V. As a result, there are technically no &quot;symptoms&quot; as such. A depressive realist may be someone who is depressed because of their realistic evaluation of the world around them, or it might be that they are depressed and therefore have a more realistic outlook on life. The reality is that, beyond being an observed phenomenon, depressive realism is not really well understood or classified. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you say raises an excellent question that has yet to have a satisfying answer. Acknowledging one's very limited control over the universe is a central tenant of many philosophies that are purportedly excellent for alleviating the symptoms of depression - notably Stoicism and Buddhism. So why is that same lack of control also associated with exacerbated symptomatology? Perhaps the answer lies in one's response to the lack of control, but I couldn't say for sure. Nevertheless, it is certainly a question mark.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Stoicism and Buddhism, pain and avoiding pain is a central theme.  It's not satisfying because we will never be able to get rid of the downs and will never be able to keep the ups.  Acceptance is key here, and I'd argue that it's super satisfying because it helps stop anxiety and fear. Chronic anxiety and fear can cripple you or turn you into a radical.  In that way, I believe we have <em>the most</em> control over our fate and ourselves, which is the thing that we're ultimately trying to control.  At least it's the only thing really worth controlling IMO.</p></div>		</li>
