<p>The tldr of it is that the best evidence for racist theories just don't have enough power to reject the null hypothesis of racial equality</p>

<p>So to answer OPs question: How do we actually know that scientific racism is wrong? </p>
<p>We can't. But there is no evidence that it's right, so there is no reason to assume so. It can go in any direction which &quot;race&quot; is &quot;superior&quot;, but either way, variances within races are just as large as between races it's meaningless to draw conclusion based on &quot;race&quot; (an intelligent person of an on average less intelligent &quot;race&quot; is more intelligent than an average person of a more intelligent &quot;race&quot;).</p></div>		</li>
