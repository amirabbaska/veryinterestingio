			<p>On print, in a newspaper. <br><br>Just like: on the big screen, in a movie. <br><br>Or: on TV, in a series. </p>		</li>

			<p>You would say you read something &quot;in&quot; print, not &quot;on&quot; print.</p>		</li>

			<p>Hmmmm. Now that I'm reading this, I'm not sure that I'm entirely correct, but I'm sure I have a reason for saying &quot;on print&quot;... Hold on, I'll do some research later. </p>		</li>

			<p>But he is comparing the right things. He said &quot;in a movie&quot; and &quot;on a TV show&quot;. What are you saying is the wrong thing? The question didn't mention the big screen <em>or</em> the television.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ah yes you're correct. I think the error comes from the evolution of the English language and speech patterns mostly. As I think it would have been more technically correct to say in a show (as in, in a TV show) but has since merged with saying on the television (or on TV). <br><br></p>		</li>
