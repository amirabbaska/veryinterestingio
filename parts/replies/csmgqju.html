			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes you're correct. I think the error comes from the evolution of the English language and speech patterns mostly. As I think it would have been more technically correct to say in a show (as in, in a TV show) but has since merged with saying on the television (or on TV). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He is in a tv series</p>
<p>He is on tv</p>
<p>He is on a tv show</p>
<p>It all depends on context but all of those can be said and they all generally denote the same concept. &quot;In a tv series&quot; means a recurring actor in a weekly show. &quot;On tv&quot; can mean one time or recurring, depending on the context, but usually as a one time meaning it means <em>now.</em> &quot;Turn to channel 9. Mom's on tv!&quot; If it doesn't mean one time, &quot;he's on tv&quot; can mean &quot;he works in the tv industry as an actor.&quot; It still denotes this currently active thing. Much like you are also &quot;in a play.&quot; Note no one ever says you are on a play. In or on tv. In movies. In plays. Never on movies or on plays. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I'm trying to get at is that this is a result of how language has evolved to use both in and on TV shows. Because the sentence &quot;He is on this TV show&quot; is only said because of the word TV, as you can say &quot;He is in this TV show&quot; and thus probably evolved from saying &quot;on TV&quot;. </p>
<p>It's all about whether you are speaking about being IN the intangible idea of a SHOW, MOVIE, PLAY, or ON the tangible medium, TV (Television screen) , BIG SCREEN (movie screen, projector screen, I dunno what else it may be called), STAGE. </p></div>		</li>
