			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm... that is actually not a trivial question. I think the answer is yes, but the difference would be <em>tiny</em>. Hot water has more energy to propel the water molecules more quickly through the porous substrate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer is no. You said yourself the reaction is exothermic, so according to my confused and inappropriate application of Le Chatelier's principle, adding heat to the equation should push the system away from the [soaked napkin] state and back towards the [dry napkin] + [cup of water] state.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wrong, obviously, as several users have pointed out below. Kinetics are not the same as thermodynamics and I should be made to face the corner with a dunce cap on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only would the driving force change, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity#Water" target="_blank">the viscosity of water decreases with temperature.</a></p>
<p>So a lower viscosity would mean faster spreading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say yes, but if you were to actually test it, you'd be losing a lot of the hot water on the napkin to evaporation which isn't part of the system you're trying to test. Doing the test with near-freezing and warm water would be interesting though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're actually wrong about the entropy part (you've got it backwards). Water molecules don't form &quot;cages&quot; around hydrophilic surfaces like cellulose...</p>
<p>A more intuitive way of thinking about the capillary force here is to think of it like droplets of water on an oily surface. Because water and oily don't want to be next to each other, the water balls up. The reason for water to minimize the surface area is to maximize the entropy of the system because at the surface, water has to form a defined cage like structure (water can't h-bond with hydrophobic surfaces so there are fewer degrees of freedom for surface water molecules).</p>
<p>Well air is also hydrophobic, but the napkin is not. So in the absence of water, the system is in high tension because the &quot;water-like&quot; surfaces of the napkin are being constrained in such a way that they are all contacting the hydrophobic air. This forces these water-like surfaces to adapt very confined orientations or even coordinate single water molecules on their surface. This has a very low entropy. When water is introduced, the water will happily displace that air to minimize the surface area of the interface between water-like and hydrophobic surfaces, which increases the total entropy of the system. Now the water-like surfaces of the napkin are free to adapt many different conformations with all the different molecules in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Just from an intuitive understanding of entropy, that there's no way a wet napkin has less entropy (ie. has more order) than a separate glass of water and a dry napkin. On that note, he's also incorrect in the adding the enthalpy and entropy give you change in free energy, it's enthalpy subtract entropy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They actually do form ice like cages if the molecule is the correct size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect you'll always get some... and there are a ton of factors like the nature of substrate material, the nature of the fluid you're moving (capillary action isn't exclusive to water), etc.</p>
<p>wildfyre mentioned equilibrium... I'm pretty sure stronger gravity would just change where the equilibrium point is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct in some ways. And this number is a moving target depending on what your substrate is. Glass and trees both experience capillary action, but water affinity for them is not identical. The equilibrium is more that water molecules are swapping places as they interact or dont interact with the cellulose. Gravity won't change the favoribility of this interaction</p>
<p>I don't feel equipped to do the math, but my gut says a truly IMMENSE gravitational field would be required to prevent water from traveling up a napkin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Massive. It's important to remember the gravitational law: F=G x m1 x m2/(r^2 ), where G is ~6.67 x 10^-11. This means that gravity is actually a very weak force for mundane objects, and for an object as small as a single water molecule (mass of roughly 3 x 10^-23 grams) it has almost no effect. Instead, the forces on the molecule come from intermolecular forces, which dominate on a small (nanometers) scale. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... just to be pedantic, F=ma, so a=F/m. The acceleration from gravity generally has nothing to do with the mass of the object being &quot;pulled.&quot; It has as much effect on an atom as it does on you. It's kind of a weird &quot;force&quot; in that respect.</p>
<p>That ridiculously tiny G constant is what really matters. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law" target="_blank">Coulomb's law</a> uses Coulomb's constant, which is 20 orders of magnitude larger!) Gravity is just an extraordinarily weak force in general, and only matters at all because many forces don't work on macroscopic scales (like the strong nuclear force) and things like EM are hard to produce on very large scales. It's hard to organize enough electrons to make planet-sized magnets or charged objects; but it's easy to make gigantic gravity wells, you just need a humongous pile of anything with mass or energy. The earth's magnetic field is very weak, barely enough to push against the solar wind, but its gravity is strong enough that you can't even tell it's spinning around at hundreds of miles per hour.</p></div>		</li>
