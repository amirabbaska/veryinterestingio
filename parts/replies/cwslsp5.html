			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think we even consider whether we want to believe it. Usually the primary factor is whether we feel good reading/listening to something. If the answer is no then we tend to become unreceptive and antagonistic. If the answer is yes then we'll be open and uncritical. It's almost automatic by then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The annoying thing about knowing this is that the people who would benefit the most from realising it are the most opposed to accepting it.  If only atheists realised that they aren't that way because they sat down and thought logically about it until they came to a conclusion... but that they actually simply felt from the beginning that none of that bible shit really sounded true.</p></div>		</li>

So when his brilliant and correct mathematical deductions for relativity showed this wasn't possible, he doctored them with some &quot;cosmic constant&quot; so they met with his belief system. Even a genius has predispositions that colour their reality.</p></div>		</li>
