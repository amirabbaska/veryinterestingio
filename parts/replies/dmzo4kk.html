			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s interesting how complicated some of these licensing agreements can become. One that gets discussed a fair bit is Apple’s relationship with their suppliers. Someone like Foxconn licences the rights from Apple to build a device and pays them a licensing fee. They then use that licence to manufacture (assemble might be more accurate) the device. Apple then buys the assembled device from Foxconn in the most tax efficient way for the region they’re heading to. </p>
<p>It’s completely unintuitive as the average person on the street would assume Apple pays Foxconn to build the devices for them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So Apple and Foxconn just exchange money back and forth for rights and products? Meaning that both can use each other as an expense, is that correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s part of it, yes. But it’s also about being able to incur those costs in territories that allow the companies to be tax efficient, so it gives them a certain amount of flexibility. Apple being the size that they are can also place extremely onerous conditions in contracts with people like Foxconn which shifts liability and costs for production issues (and other things) on to the suppliers. </p>
<p>My better half works in commercial law and apparently Tim Cook is held up as a god like figure in those circles because of what he was able to do as COO at Apple. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanna say, thank you for putting this info out there. In fact, thanks a ton to everyone in this thread, and thank you OP for asking this question. Taxes are so complex but often times it becomes a shouting match about whether they should be raised or lowered and for whom. People need to know what's really going on in the world and why we have so much drastic income inequality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On that note, let's take a look at the highest American  tax brackets over the decades, shall we!</p>
<p>Americas Highest Tax Brackets</p>
<p>Today: $450k ($450k today)</p>
<p>1970s/80s: $200k (worth $650k today)</p>
<p>1960s: $400k = (worth 3.2 mil today)</p>
<p>1940s/1950s = 400k =  (worth $7 million today)</p>
<p>1930s = 5 mil = (worth $70 million today)</p>
<p>We're going backwards citizens. </p>
<p>Amazing to think that the highest taxed citizen in 1940 was earning the same income IN REAL DOLLARS (not adjusted for inflation) as today. </p>
<p>Because you know, someone earning $450k per year is pretty much equal to someone earning $45 million/year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems that simple but it's not. Reagan not only lowered tax brackets but he and Tip O'Neil (a Democrat) also simplified it. So while yes there was a 90% bracket there were a lot more deductions. Our tax system is convoluted still. </p></div>		</li>

<p>'Why should they pay more when they work harder?' </p>
<p>EQUALITY! It's a joke how much our society let's the mega rich get away with the taxes they do. Obviously this is relative to the country, but it's simply not true that if a millionaire is subject to very high income tax they will up and leave. Like everyone else they will be using the free healthcare and high quality standardised public services and they entire country will be better off for it. </p>
<p>And people think Scandinavia is a utopia :/ I don't, I think it's fucking fair and what every progressive nation should be working towards</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This argument isn't meaningful without more information. At what rate is the highest bracket taxed? How does this rate differ from previous years? What were the other tax brackets and their corresponding rates?</p>
<p>I'm not saying you're wrong, because I don't know the answers to these questions. Just that the information you've provided here doesn't definitively say much at all. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Monaco residency requires the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A signed lease, title deed to property, or a notarized letter from someone who owns property in Monaco legally swearing to the fact that you reside there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bank attestation from a Monaco bank stating that you have sufficient funds to reside in Monaco.  The banks will not give this to you unless you have sufficient funds with them.  This can be upwards of $100k in a bank account or invested in funds with them, depending solely on the banks requirements.  SocGen had the lowest barriers to entry, asking only to have $30k deposited with them to offer this letter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No criminal record</p>
</li>
<li>A valid long stay visa from France (which has its own set of requirements)</li>
</ol>
<p>Your second question I don't know the answer to.  I think the cayman islands will be much less likely to give up their corporate tax havenship since that's pretty much all they're known for, though. </p>
<p>Edit: I should say the most arduous of these requirements is actually the first given the absurd cost of renting a flat in Monaco, though the second one can be equally brutal if the bank wants to screw you.  Also, as an American, I had a hell of a time finding a bank that would even talk to me, as when I lived there it was around the time that the American government raided UBS to get at tax dodgers.</p></div>		</li>
