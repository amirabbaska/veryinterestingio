			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for National Instruments in Texas, and had to explain to everyone that we <em>didn't</em> make calculators. Got even more confusing when y'all bought National Semiconductor. </p>
<p>I really like TI. I like to tinker with random hardware projects, and they're usually pretty awesome about sending me samples of ICs and stuff for free. Granted the quantity cost of those things is like a buck, but they're all very nice even when I make it clear I'm not a viable manufacturing lead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What was explained to me is that the idea is that if you do eventually work on a large scale project, you may prefer TI because you've used their ICs and they've worked (hopefully) so you pick their ICs over competitors. Same idea with student versions of Matlab, PSpice, Altium, and EagleCad. When you go to work you'll have a stronger preference to use what you're more familiar with, provided you get a choice. </p></div>		</li>

<p>it's not like anyone is going to use Octave </p>
<p>also doesn't matlab have a way to convert your test code int a C++ executable. </p>
<p>at this point though, I am a software engineer so I'm going to write my FFT algorithm by hand (and graphing functions...and much more) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Thanks&quot; is probably the less common reaction from folks familiar with LabVIEW; usually they've got opinions on where I can shove a RIO chassis :)</p>
<p>LabVIEW <em>does</em> do some pretty cool things, and it definitely allows science/engineering professionals to do their science without having to also be programmers/software developers. There are also a lot of other folks who would rather not deal with the extra layer of NI's spaghetti, though, and I totally get why that could be miserable.</p>
<p>Were you using it as a student or or in industry?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The TI83 has a price around $100, and the calculator hasn't changed in decades. This is a perfect example of how startup costs can destroy the ideal of a free market.</p>
<p>At least make the damn things rechargable. Come on!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think high mark ups are the only incentive a company has to continue making a niche product. There are no more assembly lines making the chips that go into the TI83. At this point the chips are being made in small batches since the TI83 is basically obsolete, and making things in small batches is expensive. The fact that the model is so old is the reason it's going to cost a lot.</p>
<p>It's like rebuilding a classic car. The parts for a 30 year old car are much more expensive than parts for new car models because the parts for the old car are no longer being mass produced.</p></div>		</li>
