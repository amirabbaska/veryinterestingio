			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example is video game graphics. Games always look &quot;even more realistic&quot; than the games before it. In 2010, <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDGW_BWJgO4/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">the new Madden</a> looked realistic because we were used to those kind of graphics, but have you seen <a href="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gDZAzyBvYESGoUudV98H5R.jpg" target="_blank">Madden '17</a>? The difference is ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really good example, funny that two people thought of the same example at almost the same time. It does show how fast our perceptions of &quot;realistic&quot; can change, the same goes for TV with the move to 1080P and Ultra-HD coming from the old cathode screens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't buy this argument for a second. I never thought the NES, Genesis, N64, PS1, etc. looked remotely realistic. Why would I? I've seen reality, and those consoles don't come close to it. Same is true for art.</p>
<p>Also, comparing a horrifically jpg Madden 10 picture to a relatively high res Madden 17 picture (which also looks significantly fake btw), nice.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Me either. That's why I didn't say anything about any of these. I said that Madden 10 looked realistic in 2010. If you compare it to other video games at the time, it looked very realistic. It was close enough.</p>

<p>I don't understand what you're saying here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the technology gap as to fine point pens/pencils vs oil painting, but what about sculptors? How did they create such detail out of marble and other stone without the advances of todays tools?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hmm, good question. That does somewhat undermine my argument doesn't it, when you think about it sculptors were creating pretty &quot;photorealistic&quot; works long before the advances in the printing press and the advent of photography.</p>
<p>That said I don't think tools have really advanced that much when it comes to sculpture, even if you use electric or pneumatic tools then it is still a piece of metal hammering a stone.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is more cultural then, and we can blame the love of oil painting throughout the ages , and the colours achieved with that medium, for the differences in photorealism between today's work and those from the past.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then old sculptors probably didn't need advanced tools to get such details since the medium makes it easier to do so</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most renaissance sculptures didn't make all sculptures poportionate or realistic at all. Michaelangelo's David is a great example of this. Originally the plan was to have the sculpture placed on a roof, due to what Michelangelo wanted to be seen, the hands are huge, the head and neck large (especially the hair), and in reality, very slender for his height.</p>
<p>Theres also a lot of classic sculpture where realism wasn't wanted, the goal was idealism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of my perception of vidrogames from maybe ten years ago. I thought they are very realistic, but when i see those games today i' m not very impressed. I assume this is the same effecr.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a good example, I should of thought of that because it is obvious how our perceptions have changed in such a short time. If you had told me 10 years ago that video games would look the way they do or that televisions would have the resolutions they do I am not sure I would believe you. Ultra-HD still looks weird to me sometimes when I see it on a good screen.</p></div>		</li>
