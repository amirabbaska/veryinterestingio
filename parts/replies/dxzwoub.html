			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats not really how modern wafers get Copper lines put in place.  </p>
<p>Modern wafers use a Damascene process for Cu layers.  There will be a film [of_some_sort] dep onto the wafer, then you'll get the resist mask as you talked about.  The pattern will be exposed/rinsed/etc.  Then it will go into an Etch process BEFORE the copper dep.  This will create VIAs (Trenches) for the Cu traces.  </p>
<p>Once you have the VIAs, the Cu is sputtered onto the wafer after another passivization layer is applied.  (Cu is a very mobile Ion and will diffuse on it's own into the substrate unless you block it. This is usually another metal compatible with Cu.)  The Sputter layer is very thin, but the Cu VIAs need to be much thicker.  Sputtering is very inefficient for this, so after the sputter, they get sent to a electroplating process that will electroplate 6-10x more Cu on the wafer.   The wafers go get annealed after plating to fuse the Cu crystalline structures.  </p>
<p>At this point you have a relatively thick layer of Cu on the wafer.  It will then go into a Planarization process to (Basically) sand the Cu off the top of the wafer down to the top of the previously Etched VIAs.  You're left with separated Cu lines, separated by the film that was etched previously.   </p>
<p>Cu is notoriously hard to etch a pattern into, so you will almost NEVER see Cu being applied to a wafer in a true production environment without some variant of the Damascene process.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In engineering, my materials prof spent weeks talking about the production of Si wafers and how to manufacture different features into them. He loved the subject because it was within his field of research.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the exam that we realized none of this was actually included the course material, and the exam had completely different questions on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahahahahahahah i find this so funny because my materials prof did the same, except with old paintings. Canvases were not cheap, so many artists would reuse them and paint a on top of another painting. </p>
<p>So through some analysis, you can recover the paintings underneath. There would be literally layers of paintings on top of paintings. Even Picaso did it. </p>
<p>None of that was on the exam though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right.  I was using trench as a laymen’s term.  They really aren’t VIAs until they are filled with Cu, until then they are still a trench.   </p>
<p>Also in practice they are rarely square, more trapezoidal.  It’s actually favorable that they not be perfectly square.  In practice.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good explanation, but I think the order is reversed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put down a complete layer of copper as mentioned above,</li>
<li>Coat with a second layer of photo-resist,</li>
<li>Expose desired circuit pattern to cure the photo-resist in the copper,</li>
<li>Etch away the unexposed photo-resist to leave behind the circuit pattern, and</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ul>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct for a “dry” etch process.   The explanation above is a lift-off process, and there also wet etch process.  They work much the same as you described. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For CPU manufacturing lift off processes are not reliable enough. As far as I know all CMOS layers are patterned by etching.</p>
<p>Here the wiki page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS" target="_blank">CMOS</a>. There is a nice overview of the major process steps in the article.</p>
<p>Another small detail is that features in the range below 40 nm are not created by light, but by electron beams and resists that are sensitive to the electron beam instead of UV-light.</p>
<p>Also I believe all depositions are made by sputter deposition as it creates very uniform layers over large areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As nodes get smaller and smaller, wet etch becomes more and more difficult. This is apparent when you notice a certain chip manufacturer has gone away from their well known process timetable (sounds like click clock) in recent years. Very little actual silicon etching is fine using wet etch these days, it's mostly just used for cleaning/removal of mask material and organics. Most metal etching is being done via dry etch.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that only works if you do not use a silicon wafer which is what you need for transistors. I mean the way I understand your explanation you want to define the circuit first, but it would be impossible to then stick that to a silicon wafer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is one alternative method, IIRC usually used for larger features as etching the copper in this process will usually be done with an acid, which can lead to undercutting of the resist, making it unsuitable for nm order patterning. Also some of the acids used won't be suitable for wafers which have already had pre-processing (I'm thinking HF and Aqua-regia), whereas photoresist developers are pretty benign. </p>
<p>For MEMS fabrication (my current thesis), we usually go:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Liftoff is used for mems because it is cheap and easy but the yield is bad. You not only get signifigant sidewall deposition that can remain, but thick layers require a second liftoff layer which limits feature size and you get particle redeposition on your wafer. When you are building a mems device (which are large and sparse compared to IC) you can discard non functioning devices but if you are building an IC the loss is unacceptable because you need an entire circuit to function.</p></div>		</li>
