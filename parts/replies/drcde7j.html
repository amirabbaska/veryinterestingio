			<div class="markdown"><p>People who can hold their breath a long while aren't starving their brain of oxygen; they have a large lung capacity through training and their blood absorbs the oxygen remaining in their lungs to keep feeding their body. </p>
<p>If however they were to get stuck or something and couldn't surface again; when their body starts telling them to take a breath again; that's when their brain is soon to be starved of oxygen and they will begin to drown. </p>
<p>If they are resuscitated soon after; they may have incurred some brain damage depending how long it was they were without any oxygen in their lungs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that when resuscitating people nowadays, just focus on chest compressions and not giving them breaths.  Wouldn't it make sense to give them breaths so that at least a little bit of oxygen enters their lungs to be absorbed so that their brain can sustain itself a bit longer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain doesn't try to force a breath when running out of oxygen. The breath response is triggered by co2 levels. That's why inhalation of oxygen-free gas is a peaceful way to end a life.</p>
<p>Freedivers hyperventilate to reduce their blood co2 levels, which delays the breath response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure that the body adapts to this situation through training to prolong this time.<br />
E.g. larger lung capacity, less energy use while holding the breath.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. Isn't the record for holding one's breath underwater around 19-20 minutes? Their lung capacity must be devilishly large.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because they have trained/enabled their bodies to redirect blood flow away from organs and muscles and focus on the brain and heart while reducing the bodies overall metabolism. Their brain may even show reduced overall activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to what I was taught is that brain death starts at 4 minutes and is complete at 8 minutes when not given oxygen. Now if oxygen was applied before the 4 minute mark, and someone was there to ventilate the patient there would still be damage to the brain due to lack of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
