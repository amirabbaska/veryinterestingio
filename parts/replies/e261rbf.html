<p>They did tell me that my one kidney was larger to compensate for missing one. I thought that was kinda neat. As long as nothing happens to it, it functions like having two. I guess that's why it wasn't caught earlier on. I never would have known otherwise.</p>
<p>I can never join the military, though. I'm just about too old now anyway. </p></div>		</li>
