			<p>How is this illegal? It seems like this is something that directly happens all the time in a capitalist market. A car salesman will tell me that this car has the clear coat and is worth X. They'll try to get the highest possible price for it despite knowing it's not worth that much, which is one of the foundations of capitalism. It seems like this is just normal business behavior.<br><br>What am i not understanding?</p>		</li>

			<p>When a stock broker is investing someone else's money, they have what's called a fiduciary duty, which has certain legal strings attached to it, like a duty of care, IIRC. It's not exactly akin to the normal sales situation (though I agree to some extent that this is what capitalism is largely about). If you are lying to someone about their own investment dollars for your own personal benefit, you are breaking your fiduciary duties to that person. <br><br>EDIT: see /u/amadeusflow comment below. Apparently RIA's have the fiduciary duty but Brokers do not. However, although not technically fiduciaries, Brokers do have a duty of fair dealing and to disclose conflicts. </p>		</li>

			<p>I think this is a very important point. I think not knowing this is a big piece of the puzzle I was missing, thus my lack of understanding.</p>		</li>

			<p>I want to clarify that this is not actually true. Stock brokers are <strong>NOT</strong> held to the standard of fiduciary duty. Legally speaking, they are only there to facilitate the transaction, not to advise their clients.<br><br>Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) <strong>ARE</strong> held to the fiduciary standard.<br><br>What made Jordan's actions illegal was that he illegally owned large portions of the companies that he was selling to his clients.</p>		</li>

			<p>By God, you are right. BUT let me add that although they are not strictly fiduciaries, they are held to a duty of fair dealing and to disclose conflicts, which Belfort certainly would have been guilty of as well. </p>		</li>

			<p>Why is that illegal? If anything, doesn't it just show you are confident enough in your investment advice to your customers that you are invested in the same stocks? Like if the people that work at BMW drive BMW's, that seems to be a sign of confidence in their product, not something illegal...?<br><br>Hell, it practically seems desirable. I wouldn't want to, say, go to a coffee roaster/shop where no one drank the coffee they produced for example...</p>		</li>

			<p>Technical correction: a broker/dealer does not have any fiduciary responsibility to his/her client (there is some momentum to changing this standard when it comes to brokers of certain retirement related securities).<br><br>It is investment advisers that are charged with fiduciary duty. IAs perform a different function than brokers. Brokers sell you the security. IAs offer guidance and advice, at which point you will engage with a broker. This is primarily why IAs do not charge commission. They are fee only (usually hourly or portfolio based depending on the type of services provided). This allows them to make their money independently of the advice they provide, ostensibly (but admittedly not completely) eliminating the bias that is present when commissions are involved.<br><br>Edit: I just saw that /u/AmadeusFlow beat me to it. lol</p>		</li>

			<p>What you're describing would be illegal if the dealer is lying. One of the foundations of capitalism is that both parties have the same access to information and make an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm's_length_principle" target="_blank">Arm's length transaction</a>. When one party lies or has a unfair bargaining position the contract can be ruled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscionability" target="_blank">unconscionable</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>Lets say there is another car on the lot and it looks just the same, if not better on visual inspection. The salesman then talks it up. He lies and says its better than the other car. He could sell you either one, but Car B is a much better car, by the way, it costs less than Car A. He shows you literature that looks real but isn't. In fact, the dealership produced it themselves and put all sorts of false claims in it. This is all pre-internet, so you have no real way of verifying the information. He then sells you the car, which in fact turns out to be a complete piece of shit. On top of that, he owned the car and not only made his commission, but made a fortune on the profits of the insanely over priced pile of shit. <br><br>The SEC highly frowns upon this practice in the stock market.</p>		</li>

			<p>I always just thought this is how the sales world works.  You tell people your product is the best out there, and to buy it - and there you go, you got someone to foolishly spend their money on your product.  <br><br>I actually worked in a precious metals investment firm and we did our sales exactly like this. I didn't realize it was illegal until I saw The Wolf of Wall Street.  My manager used to tell us to tell them <em>anything</em> we had to in order to get their numbers, after all we need to have a paycheck. </p>		</li>

			<p>In this case though, he knew his product was not the best out there, and in fact, wasn't even a product at all, and he controlled the product, and intended to destroy it after you bought it.<br><br>So to make an analogy with, say a car....<br><br>Suppose someone builds a shitty fiberglass frame over a golf cart, puts a bomb in it, and sells it to someone as a sports car.  And then before the guy realizes it's a golf cart and can sell it to someone else to get his money back, he detonates the bomb and blows it up, and then says &quot;Oh, your sports car got bombed?  Yeah that sucks...&quot; and then cashes your check.</p>		</li>

			<p>Oh okay, gotcha.  Thanks! <br><br>However, we would sell coins and bars and say they were uncirculated although they were indeed circulated and beaten up.  Then when the customer wanted a refund we'd tell them we don't offer an exchange policy or refund even though we had already told them they would be able to if they didn't like the product.  As far as salesmen and businesses go with products I feel as if they all talk it up even though they know it sucks.  I do see how lying about stocks (something that's not even seen necessarily or held, it's just going off someone's word) is wrong.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well in the US, you are allowed to market using methods that any rational person would assume not to be true (ie.: 'Best in the ___').  However, once you move into potentially 'fact' based or non-evidently false marketing then legality steps in.<br><br>Brokers tend to all fall under the 'fact' based category in their sales pitch.  However, they can still get around in by using vague overly-false claims (ie.: best stock of 2014, this stock has the potential to make you scream wowza, or something else).  Thing is, almost anyone investing would laugh at a broker saying that stuff.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; I always just thought this is how the sales world works.<br><br>A lot of people seem to think this. I hear ads on the radio all the time that are illegal, but the people making the ads don't know any better and the government rarely ever enforces illegal advertising unless the FDA or EPA are getting complaints about a product.<br><br>source: used to work in advertising, wife works in marketing</p>		</li>
