			<div class="markdown"><p>How did this method even thrive like it did? Jordan Belfort was immensely wealthy because of stuff like this. Wouldn't rumors of his company always trying to get people to buy into shitty stocks lead to their demise a lot sooner? Were all of their customers first-timers by default, because their investments wouldn't do anything or would even lose them money and they would bail after their first trade?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that his biggest, most influential clients were still making money.  The people that were losing their assets were the small time every day joes.  No one cares what Joe Plumber says about stocks...He probably did something stupid.  After all, this firm is making millions for all of the wealthiest people in the country...   obviously they are doing something right.</p>
<p>As long as there are investment-stupid people with money, he would have fresh meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even investment-average people may decide to engage a trader because of positive press (Jordan Belfort made me x% on this investment! He's amazing!). Joe Plumber lost his money, but he was never a big voice anyway, and when John Glazier decides he wants to invest, he's gonna look to the big names to see who makes them the big money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. As a kid of the 90's, there were a lot of things I did not know outside of my area (Nor Cal) or California for that matter. Information of what was happening in another state or small town was all left up to the nightly news.</p>
<p>If there was a small town shooting in Oklahoma... I wouldn't know about it unless my nightly news covered it.</p>
<p>If I wanted to find a place to buy the best stereo... I had to use the Yellow Pages and word of mouth. The Internet is truly revolutionary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know if you're an NHL fan, but in the mid-90's there was a HUGE issue where this guy John Spano basically conned his way into purchasing the New York Islanders even though he didn't have the money. Took them months of him delaying/missing payment before anyone caught on and started to question things. ESPN did a 30 for 30 documentary on it called &quot;Big Shot&quot;. It's pretty interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always just thought this is how the sales world works.  You tell people your product is the best out there, and to buy it - and there you go, you got someone to foolishly spend their money on your product.  </p>
<p>I actually worked in a precious metals investment firm and we did our sales exactly like this. I didn't realize it was illegal until I saw The Wolf of Wall Street.  My manager used to tell us to tell them <em>anything</em> we had to in order to get their numbers, after all we need to have a paycheck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case though, he knew his product was not the best out there, and in fact, wasn't even a product at all, and he controlled the product, and intended to destroy it after you bought it.</p>
<p>So to make an analogy with, say a car....</p>
<p>Suppose someone builds a shitty fiberglass frame over a golf cart, puts a bomb in it, and sells it to someone as a sports car.  And then before the guy realizes it's a golf cart and can sell it to someone else to get his money back, he detonates the bomb and blows it up, and then says &quot;Oh, your sports car got bombed?  Yeah that sucks...&quot; and then cashes your check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh okay, gotcha.  Thanks! </p>
<p>However, we would sell coins and bars and say they were uncirculated although they were indeed circulated and beaten up.  Then when the customer wanted a refund we'd tell them we don't offer an exchange policy or refund even though we had already told them they would be able to if they didn't like the product.  As far as salesmen and businesses go with products I feel as if they all talk it up even though they know it sucks.  I do see how lying about stocks (something that's not even seen necessarily or held, it's just going off someone's word) is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in the US, you are allowed to market using methods that any rational person would assume not to be true (ie.: 'Best in the ___').  However, once you move into potentially 'fact' based or non-evidently false marketing then legality steps in.</p>
<p>Brokers tend to all fall under the 'fact' based category in their sales pitch.  However, they can still get around in by using vague overly-false claims (ie.: best stock of 2014, this stock has the potential to make you scream wowza, or something else).  Thing is, almost anyone investing would laugh at a broker saying that stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot of people seem to think this. I hear ads on the radio all the time that are illegal, but the people making the ads don't know any better and the government rarely ever enforces illegal advertising unless the FDA or EPA are getting complaints about a product.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>two very different firms were being represented in these movies. I worked for sterling foster, which was largely the basis for Boiler Room, and a friend of mine worked at stratton (wolf of WS)
he and i had some similar war stories, but we also had some very different ones too.
where i worked, there was just a lot of railroading clients into specific stocks that were not much more than shell companies that were invented to create an IPO that the firm could twist and mangle.
it didn't take me long to figure out that the place was corrupt and then i left. no more than a few months later (maybe even weeks) the place was raided by the FBI and people were carted away in buses, just like the end of boiler room.</p></div>		</li>
