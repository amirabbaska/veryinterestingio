			<div class="markdown"><p>Upvoted because you taught me something new.  I knew that humans, parrots, and songbirds had the right neural stuff to mimic a very large array of sounds, but had no idea about bats, cetaceans, elephants, sea lions, or hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Question (if you can/feel like answering): Are there any reptile or amphibian groups that, even if they aren't quite as advanced as the ones you already mentioned, come closer to having the right neural stuff than other species?  Like, ones that might have precursors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Among reptiles, crocodilians are probably the closest. They are very social and use a wide range of vocalizations. That's not at the level of the other animals mentioned, but they're probably among the top in reptiles.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor correction, but otariids (sea lions) are not vocal learners. Phocids (true seals) are, the most famous of which was Hoover at the New England Aquarium. However, the evolutionary distance between the two families is quite large: at least 25 million years.</p>
<p>(Interestingly, sea lions are capable of entraining body movement to rhythms, including music.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! A real reply. Read this one, OP! It should be at the top. And if it's too long, here's a summary: while chimps are anatomically similar in many ways, they lack the the right kind of larynx and the requisite brain structures that would make imitating human speech possible.</p></div>		</li>
