			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscles that constrict/dilate the iris are similar to smooth muscle right? Is smooth muscle generally innervated by pain fibers? Or is this specifically known in the iris' unique case?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would’ve thought that the pain you feel is from the muscles that dilate your eyes.  Curious, that’s it’s not yet understood, despite being something nearly everyone’s experienced at one point or another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In there it says that was one hypothesis, but someone blind to the extent their pupils don't react to light (hence no muscular exertion) still felt it, and if anything was <em>more</em> sensitive as her eyes were always wide open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most parts of your body make a special pain signal. Pain signals like extreme heat are transmitted by your peripheral nervous system until they transfer over to your central nervous system where you then subjectively experience the pain.</p>
<p>Your peripheral nervous system can do the job of pulling your hand away from a flame before you even register that your hand was burned.</p>
<p>With your eyes it is different. Your retina are hooked right up to your brain. When you feel pain/discomfort from bright lights, it isn't from regular pain signals in your peripheral nervous system. </p>
<p>Some system is measuring the signal coming from your eyes, noticing it is too bright, and creating a feeling of pain. Most all humans display photophobia as well, an aversion to bright lights.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Fun elaboration on this: that process is actually performed entirely by the neurons in your spine! It happens &quot;before you even register&quot; because it's literally a shorter distance for electrical signals to travel through the nervous system. </p>
<p>And the fun elaboration on THAT is that it's not really &quot;neurons&quot;, because there's actually just one BIG LONG axon that goes all the way up and down your spine, with many many dendrites off its ends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pulling your hand from the hot stove is a reflex. Your brain is not even involved in the decision, instead it's informed (mere moments) later.</p>
<p>Instead, the signal of &quot;this is causing damage&quot; travels to the spine, and neurons in there directly transfer the signal back to the muscles to contract.</p>
<p>This process saves time, because the signal doesn't have to travel as far. So less time spent in the damaging g situation.</p></div>		</li>
