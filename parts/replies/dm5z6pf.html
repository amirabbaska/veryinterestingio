			<div class="markdown"><p>I think &quot;x&quot; lost its favor as the default multiplication symbol since its the most common letter used for variables. Writing &quot;XxY&quot; is pretty confusing... The &quot;hanging period&quot; is much better for that (X·Y), or the asterisk (X*Y), or of course using no symbol at all (XY), although the latter can be confusing if you start defining two-letter variables...</p>
<p>Fun fact: Unicode has a special &quot;<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2715/index.htm" target="_blank">✕</a>&quot; character for multiplication purposes only, different from the normal &quot;X&quot; letter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a mathematician (of sorts), I use them interchangeably (when not working with vectors, of course). I think I tend to use x with numbers and · with algebra (although I also sometimes use · as a decimal separator, which is probably bad).</p>
<p>As for distinguishing x (the letter) from x (the operator), the habit I picked up from somewhere (and I think is quite common) is to use a curly x for the letter, and a straight one for the operator.</p>
<p>Fun fact: often in films or TV shows with maths, you'll have a shot where a character is finishing off some equation/formula on a whiteboard or similar. Usually most of it is written by a researcher/set dresser, with the actor filling in the last bit on camera. Sometimes this is really, really obvious when they use the wrong &quot;x&quot; (a straight one instead of a curly one). This always amuses me for some reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's pretty standard to switch to curly/serif-ier letters for variables in &quot;higher level&quot; math. t gets curled to differentiate from +, i gets curled...because?, x gets curly to differentiate from...uh...x, z gets a bar to differentiate from 2, etc....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only ever use X for the cross product - every other time, if I absolutely have to make the multiplication explicit I'll use a dot. In particular if I'm doing some arithmetic, I'll write e.g. 200•30•7 = 42,000.</p>
<p>Despite that I still use the curly &quot;x&quot;! Except when it's a capital - e.g. in separation of variables, X(x) -  then it's completely straight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well until you get into vector calculus and linear algebra, where the concept of &quot;multiplication&quot; turns into cross product (x) or dot product (•).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but then you usually use letters like u, v or w for vector so that no problem results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, you rarely see plain letters as a matrix. You almost always have something like an arrow, bar or hat over it. The only time you don't see that notation is in typeset, where they use bold and italics. It still gets confusing, but it isn't too bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using the x is still common among anyone who isn't accustomed to using variables, though.  In fact, I wouldn't expect most people who didn't study math/science/engineering/programming to know what the dot or the asterisk mean.</p>
<p>For symbolic math, it makes sense to use no symbol as variables in equations are almost always one letter (I don't think I've ever seen multiple letters actually).  It's different in software, though, where multi letter variables are encouraged and so the asterisk makes sense in that context (probably just because of its similarity to the center dot...and the fact that it's easily available on a keyboard)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is the added complication that there is more than one type of multiplication. For integers they are the same, but when multiplying vectors the dot product and the cross product are very different things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool, so based on actual population, North America, Eastern Asia and India most of the world uses decimal point and not a comma. They should just phase out the comma over time for that purpose for uniformity in mathematics.</p></div>		</li>
