			<div class="markdown"><p>It works well for the babies also, as their initial words are usually a demand for attention, and by recognizing that they gain a certain parent's attention by making a certain sound they are conditioned to repeat that sound, and thus correlate the sound with the person, thereby solidifying the name in the baby's brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The baby is going 'mamamama' as it is riffing with its babbling and notices mum getting excited and responding 'mama mama mama'. Doesn't take the baby long to realise that it's causing the mum's reaction. Same thing happens with 'dadada' or 'papapa' or 'babababa'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After babbling, babies hit a pre-linguistic stage called &quot;jargon&quot; in which they throw one syllable words like mama in with other sounds which belong to the language that they are learning. Jargon also contains the same intonations as their target language and even the same stress patterns. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When my daughter was very very young, a couple months old I discovered that she enjoyed being 'scared' or startled albeit in age appropriate ways. Example she liked me to sneak up (out of her limited field of view) and say grrr as I gently grabbed or touched her belly or lightly tickled her. She would smile and later as she got older laugh out loud. So much so in fact for a short period of time the only person who could get her to laugh was me (much to the chagrin of my wife). Result, now that's she's about six months old and attempting language with baby talk I notice when she interacts with me she makes a funny growling noise that she doesn't really make when engaging with anyone else. I think in some rudimentary way this is her way to signal the game she wants or maybe even her 'word' for me. So I fully expect instead of Daddy someday soon I'll get 'grrrr' as my label. Right now she looks at me makes the growling noise and then smiles. When she wakes up and sees me she smiles and growls. I'm raising a little bear</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my god. I can't wait to have a kid. I mean, I can and I will, because I want to be working in the career I'm studying for and be able to afford to take care of them properly... but this is the most magical, heart-warming thing I've read all day. I'm so excited to be in a place in my life where I get to experience hanging out with and raising a brand new person. It's gonna be amazing. Probably also exhausting. But so worth it. Thanks for sharing this story!</p></div>		</li>
