<p>Meat breeds are bulky fat ass chickens and actually are kinda crappy layers.</p>

<p>Not to mention slaughtered before they'd even start laying. Most breeds don't start laying til around 6 months while most meat birds are slaughtered at around 6 weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard about chickens that would &quot;escape&quot; at a kill plant. Different plant than the one I worked at with much less &quot;security&quot; around the chicken hangers, so they could escape. </p>
<p>The plant management just let them roam for a week or two and they kept feeding them. Eventually they grew large enough that their legs wouldn't support their own weight and plant personnel could easily catch them. </p>
<p>I suppose it is easier to catch a chicken when it can't walk anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We used to slaughter &quot;spent hens&quot; on occasion where I worked. Apparently they were popular for the production of &quot;rappie pie&quot;, an Acadian/French dish similar to a Shepherd's pie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine that's how chickens were historically consumes. You'd keep the egg laying ones untill they stopped laying eggs then chop their heads off and throw em into a cauldron of boiling water with some roots. It's not untill very recently that factory farming has engineered 'laying hens' and 'meat hens' which are incapable of doing the other's job. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think a whole lot of engineering has gone on. If so-called &quot;meat hens&quot; were allowed to reach sexual maturity, they would no doubt produce eggs. If a laying hen were fed the same diet and kept in the same conditions, they would no doubt be indistinguishable from &quot;meat hens&quot; of the same age.</p></div>		</li>
