			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational collapse releases gravitational potential energy. It's how stars initially become hot, and planets as well when they form.</p>
<p>A gas-dominated planet, as it cools, will contract (as gases do when cooled). This contraction again releases gravitational potential energy, which then (partially) counteracts the cooling. Jupiter is still contracting like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational potential energy.  The molecules (apart) have more gravitational potential energy than the molecules (together) and that difference is converted to kinetic energy in the form of heat.  Eventually it would cool off as the heat energy radiates away into space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But pure oxygen is toxic isn't it?  You wouldn't survive too long even if you were at the point where the pressure was one bar.  Also assuming that the molecules were O2, would they stay that way?  What if they were ozone?  If the liquefied oxygen happened to be uncompressed enough that it turned back to gas, would the gas be ozone or O2?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The toxicity of oxygen depends on pressure. In regular atmospheric pressure (1 bar) you can breathe pure oxygen for several hours. As pressure increases, it quickly becomes toxic, but it can be used for diving not too deep (&lt;50m) for not too long (minutes).</p>
<p>Lower pressures, like 0.5 bar can be breathed indefinitely. See this chart: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pulmonary_toxicity_tolerance_curves.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pulmonary_toxicity_tolerance_curves.svg</a>. Such atmospheres where used in spacecraft for a while, as it decreases the amount of air you need to put to orbit, and the pressure the vehicle has to handle. It does have some downsides, mostly the EXTREME fire hazard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by planet full? Because earth's atmosphere is like a thin blanket around the planet, and oxygen is only 20% of it. 20% of a thin blanket is a handful of thread. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean enough to exert a gravitational pull sufficient to ensure that the escape velocity of the whole exceeds the molecular speed of the gas you are releasing. I would expect it to exceed the amount of oxygen available on Earth because the mass of the planet is much greater than the thin layer in question and is made of much denser materials (rocks, iron...) Less mass would likely result in complete dissipation (loss) of atmosphere, as we see on the Moon.</p></div>		</li>
