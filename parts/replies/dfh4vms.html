I’ll explain why we’re so confident that certain animals are actually extinct for all time, and which kinds of animals we’re most likely to be wrong about! A long answer is easier to write than a short one, so enjoy!</p>
<p>You’re right that the oceans present enormous unexplored habitats, and investigating marine life is an exciting frontier in science. Though much of the oceans are hidden from our direct view, we’re getting better looks all the time with remote vehicles and sensing equipment. I recommend cruising materials from the Monterey Marine Biology Laboratory as they survey the creepy deepies: <a href="http://www.mbari.org/" target="_blank">http://www.mbari.org/</a></p>
<p>To answer your question, let’s consider three aspects of hunting for extinct marine animals. First, we need to distinguish between how the animals live in the sea. We can sort animals into those that live on or near the sea floor (“benthic”), vs. animals that live in the water above the sea floor (“pelagic”). We can detect these animals with different tools. Next, we’ll consider who is most likely to still be lurking down there, based on who is most and least likely to have a clear representation in the fossil record.</p>
<p>Life in the open water: Modern observations focus on large animals we eat and on tiny organisms that control our planet’s chemistry.</p>
<p>Animals can live in the open water by powerfully swimming or by drifting around. Our best modern records of powerful swimmers are of things we like to eat – fish and squids. Our best modern records of drifters come from traps to catch them. We can do this actively by towing a fine net through the water and capturing a world of microscopic complex animals. I used to do this as a lab for teen science students when I lived on an education ship in Hawaii. It’s a lot of fun! Google some images of these critters: copepod, cheatognatha, veliger, barnacle larvae. Microscopic drifters form crazy food webs that include photosynthetic producers and many tiers of grazers and predators. The producers (google image: diatom, coccolithophore) are critically important for cycling the planet’s oxygen, carbon, and silicon, so they are another target we watch closely. We can catch them directly with stationary traps. Scientists on a sea voyage will place a trap at some depth in the ocean, then come get it later. Even though the trap is placed in a tiny spec of sea, it is filtering through water for a long time, catching dead and drifting critters born on distant currents. We can even use satellite data to detect blooms of these microscopic organisms that cover huge areas of the surface ocean. Scientists can combine info from the traps and the space images to decide how marine life is shaping global chemical reactions.  </p>
<p>Life on the sea floor: Modern observations focus on coastal settings with tasty and pretty critters.</p>
<p>We know who’s in coral reefs because they are hotbeds of diversity, because they are ecological wonders, because they produce food for large populations of people, and because we like to stick their residents in home aquariums. Similarly, we know a lot about who’s living in coastal habitats along the temperate coasts. As you point out, it’s a lot harder to peak under the ice at coastal habitats in the arctic. </p>
<p>But what about sea floor habitats far from land? We can only explore deep sea hydrothermal vents with daring submersibles and remote vehicles. And most of the sea floor is far from the coasts, hidden under thousands of meters of water, and not near a chemical reaction supply.</p>
<p>So that’s an explanation of what we DO know about modern sea life. We get decent surveys of the open oceans, and we have good looks at coastal, but not very deep, sea floors. How does the fossil record give us confidence that some things are actually extinct, even though we haven’t searched for them thoroughly today? And if something IS sneaking around down there, who would it be?</p>
<p>Some animals fossilize better than others. Some habitats produce fossils better than others. A snail living in a coral reef has a decent chance of getting his shell cemented up for the fossil record. An angler fish lurking in a deep submarine canyon is probably never going to get recorded. Animals that produce robust mineralized parts are most likely to make it into our records. Habitats that bury critters regularly with the right chemistry are the most likely to preserve any record at all. Deep sea floor records get pulled under continents via tectonic conveyor belts, so these can be the hardest to have in the fossil record past about 200,000,000 years ago.</p>
<p>We are confident that some animals are extinct because the fossil record represents a truly absurd amount of time, and a very nice selection of habitats. Let’s consider a few candidates.</p>
<p>Trilobites are favorite fossils of seafloor-dwelling rolly-polly arthropods, and people often ask me if these critters might be snooping on the deep sea floors outside of our view. Probably not. Despite dominating coastal habitats for tens of millions of years, these guys disappear entirely 250,000,000 years ago. We have a quarter billion years of sedimentary rock, from the entire planet, without a single trilobite. And you can bet if anybody found one they would win, well, we don’t generally get Nobels in paleontology, but it would be a big deal. And we know a bit about how they lived. Animals need to be connected to a food web, a big ecosystem, to make a living. I don’t think trilobites are lurking on sea floors away from hydrothermal vents or coasts, because they’d be too far removed from their friends in the food web.</p>
<p>Seafaring ammonites have been extinct a comparatively shorter amount of time, since the demise of non-bird dinosaurs at the end of the Mesozoic Era, 65 million years ago. These coiled aragonite mineral shells held squid-like animals that ruled the seas for about 300 million years. If I had my pick of extinct animals to pop up again, this would be it! Ammonoids relatives are still with us: octopus, squid, cuttlefish, and the shelled chambered nautilus. Again, 65 million years represents a lot of sedimentary rock with no preserved ammonites found yet, and we DO have nautilus, so I would expect that if ammonites were still around we would have found them. </p>
<p>If any animals we think extinct are secretly still cruising the seas, I would expect it to be a bony delicate fish that doesn’t taste good. Fish are hard to capture as fossils, because their flesh gets eaten and their delicate bones have to be buried just so to preserve nicely. Hence the coelacanth was thought extinct but discovered in modern times. </p>
<p>And finally, what have I found?</p>
<p>Well I once got to swim with a live ore fish, 14 ft 10 inches long, the likes of which had only been caught on video for the first time a few years earlier. They favor open oceans, and when one bumbled into a marine reserve on Catalina Island, and died in the shallows, we carried it on shore and gave it to the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles where it is now on display in a glass case. (It looked WAY cooler alive.)

<p>Of fossils, the closest thing I’ve found of relevance were some spines of a sea urchin that might have been an earlier example than previously known from the Jurassic Period, so that was cool. </p>
<p>Finally, the very awesomest deep sea resident is a samurai snail lined with metallic plates unlike anything, to my knowledge, known from the fossil record. It totally messes with my head that biomineralization physiology like this can surprise us completely!

<p>So to keep knowing the seas, we have to explore the past and present with new tools, and keep watching the rocks.
Thanks for the fun question! Enjoy your physics future!
