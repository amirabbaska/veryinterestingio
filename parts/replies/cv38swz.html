			<div class="markdown"><p>Laser beams do spread - it's called beam divergence (there are a few other things that lead to beam spread, but this is the one which is analogous to waves in water spreading).</p>
<p>It's just that laser beams move <em>much</em> faster, and their beam divergence tends to be very small over any given segment.</p>
<p>However, if you shine a laser at a target many kilometers away, you can observe very noticeable spread.</p>
<p>That's why it's illegal to shine handheld laser devices at flying aircraft - because by the time the laser reaches the craft, all the sources of beam spreading have made the beam be a foot or two in diameter, which makes it much easier to blind the pilots with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How does a laser beam move faster than incoherent light? Shouldn't both move at the same speed with the only difference is that coherent having a smaller spread over distance?</p></div>		</li>
