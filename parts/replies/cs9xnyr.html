<p>I have myopia. When I just lower my eyelids, the image only gets slightly darker. I have to <em>squeeze</em> my eyes to squint, and that makes the image remarkably clearer. What I've been told by eye doctors before is that I'm actually bending the lens itself in order to focus the light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Patently false! You cannot &quot;squeeze&quot; your lens by squeezing your lids. The pinhole affect is because of aperture, nothing more, nothing less. When the pinhole becomes smaller than 2.5mm, the degradation in image quality is such that it stops working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is the aperture. In order to compensate for your prescription you would have to flatten your cornea in the squeeze explanation. That's not going to happen with squinting.  </p></div>		</li>
