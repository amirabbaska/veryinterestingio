<p>At the top of the photosphere, the gravitational attraction is about 28 times Earth standard. </p>

<p>If you're in orbit, you couldn't feel that anyway, beyond the gradient maybe, and even then that'd be way to small to be noticeable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An orbit that low isn't going to be stable, due to drag.  Your choices are to be subject to the sun's gravity and falling in or burning up due to frictional heating and a decaying trajectory.  </p>
<p>An orbital ring lets you have the exterior of the structure interface with the photosphere at any arbitrary velocity, including stationary with respect to the sun.  If the internal rotating structures are set up properly, you can have a 1G effective gravity for habitation/maintenance/etc.</p></div>		</li>
