<p>Islam contributes to this contrast as it similarly emphasizes austerity and simplicity in places of worship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only in so far as to include actual images and picture of living things. In islam caligraphy (like qu'ran vers in nicely drawn arabic as a piece of art) and art depucting geometric shapes etc (mosaics as an example) are filling much the same role. If you check islam on Wikipedia,  if memory serves the representing image at the top is a caligraphic rendition of the islamic gods (Allahs) name/title (one name out of many). It is art, just not of a humanoid. And you can very well argue it serves the purpouse of an icon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many mosques are also amazing works of art in their architecture. Catholic churches also tend to have more intricate architecture than Protestant churches (at least in the states) for the reasons mentioned above, too. Pomp and circumstance vs. austerity and simplicity. Obviously, there are exceptions and outliers as there are spectacular works of architecture in Protestant churches, as well as some rather spartan Catholic churches out there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is worth mentioning that while what I said is true for a majority of muslims/Islam, it isn't the universal rule or norm. Especially not if you go through known history/art history. There are and has been depictions of humanoids, some of which are quite intricate, made by islamic artists. Some years back (last I heard it was subjected to some more restrictive practices these days) you could easily buy posters of the Prophet on the street in Teheran. The purpouse of these posters, besides how they're actually rather nice artworks, is not for me to say (as I'm not a muslim, where shia as would be the case for Teheran/Iran). </p>
<p>If I recall, the reasoning behind the &quot;ban&quot; on painting humanoids has to do with how it can be considered a false icon that detracts from true worship. I've also heard a claim (but I'm not sure about this one) in that it may do something to the effect of &quot;capturing&quot; the soul here on earth. Basis for this idea is how muslims have de-faced (literal meaning - removing the face of a figure in some artworks on the walls) images in cathedras or churches that they've conquered (think: ottoman empire as an example). </p>
<p>It's been a while since I actually read some of the litterature I have on the subject, so if I got some details wrong I'll apoligize. </p></div>		</li>

<p>...and Hinduism all use large amounts of physical representation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and there is a reason. In the Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says <em>&quot;For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.&quot;</em> </p>
<p>The reasoning is that as mortals in a physical form, we are sensory beings. It's difficult for us to connect with something that is intangible or unmanifest. Hence the use of icons.</p>
<p>It's not impossible to connect with an unmanifested God, but it's difficult, given that everything else we interact with is with physical form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting.
Growing up Filipino and briefly studying pre-colonial beliefs, paganism was mainly the belief back then. It's a very nature-based belief wherein anything that's inherently connected to the earth is praised or respected, as a way of also respecting the god (called Bathala.) </p>
<p>A lot of pre-colonial Filipino cultures involved venerating gods, especially those who are thought to control weather conditions and calamities, and the success of farming and harvest. Everything was basically tied to one's way of life.</p>
<p>Fast forward to colonialism and spread of Catholicism via the Spanish occupation of 300+ years, some of the pre-colonial nuances merged with the new religion.</p>
<p>From venerating trees and other stuff from nature to now, idols - statues and physical representations of God and saints, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The early Church also combined pagan images to Christian images. Christmas was generally seen before Christian practice as a winter solstice holiday. St Patrick used the three leaf shamrock as an analogy of the Trinity. </p>
<p>When Spain colonized the Americas, same tactics appeared. Our Lady of Guadalupe has a complexion of an Aztec princess and she appeared before an Nahuatl boy instead of Spanish clergy. What made Catholicism spread rapidly throughout the world is the combination of force (in case of the Spanish colonies, the Spanish Inquisition) and the adoption of local beliefs and folk stories into Catholic stories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. In the Philippines, we have this portrayal of Jesus known as the &quot;Black Nazarene&quot; whose devotees count to millions, and every year, people come out in MILLIONS just to be part of the procession and &quot;touch&quot; the figure. They liken the sacrifice to penance for their sins, and for requesting favors from god.</p></div>		</li>
