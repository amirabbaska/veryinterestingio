<p>It’s also why a car on a hot day feels oppressively warm the very second you turn the AC off.</p>

<p>LPT: Cool the windshield down with the defroster set to max cold and this will REALLY cool down how the car feels. </p></div>		</li>

<ol>
<li>Set AC to Max cold</li>
<li>Open all windows entirely</li>
<li>Drive away (causing cooler wind to replace the hot air and move it out)</li>
</ol>
<p>Indeed it is fast and effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, but they block most of the heat radiating from the inside of the room to the outer dark night sky (which counts as a <em>very</em> cold object when it comes to heat radiation, so the heat transfer would be significant).</p>
<p>E: technically they don't <em>block</em> the heat, but rather count as a significantly warmer source of heat (at least compared to the night sky, which is about -270°C)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  Primary reason is the difference in radiative heat transfer when your walls and windows are hot vs cold.  Thank you goatymcgoatfacesings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiative heat transfer at normal human temperatures is insignificant. The transfer of heat out of your house is primarily convection and conduction, unless you left a window or door open for different temperature air to circulate through.</p></div>		</li>
