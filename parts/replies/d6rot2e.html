			<div class="markdown"><p>Is nobody gonna bring up the idea of Montezumas revenge? Im no expert, but it makes sense to me. Montezumas revenge is when people who arent from Mexico/central america travel to there and get sick from the water. People who live there dont get sick from it, because their stomachs/intestines? are used to the bacteria. Like i said, im no expert, but it seems to make sense to me that we just arent used to the bacteria. I eat really rare steak all the time, but some people i know will get sick off eating it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>With ground beef the entirety of the meat is contaminated so you need to be more thorough in your cooking.</p></div>		</li>

Traveling to another region can sometimes make you sick from the unfamiliar bacteria in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some argue that starting to cook food allowed us to grow bigger brains faster.  Cooking food offloads some (or much) of the energy expenditure required to break down food during digestion, allowing us to spend more energy maintaining our giant (relative to other species') brains.</p>
<p>I half remembered this - so here's a link I haven't read but is probably the source <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/?no-ist" target="_blank">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/?no-ist</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also read somewhere that cooking also means not having to spend a ton of time literally chewing things (<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/?no-ist" target="_blank">four to seven hours a day for great apes</a>) which frees us up for tool usage and pokemon go</p>
<p>Edit: I used the same link, haha</p></div>		</li>
