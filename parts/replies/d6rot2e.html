			<div class="markdown"><p>Is nobody gonna bring up the idea of Montezumas revenge? Im no expert, but it makes sense to me. Montezumas revenge is when people who arent from Mexico/central america travel to there and get sick from the water. People who live there dont get sick from it, because their stomachs/intestines? are used to the bacteria. Like i said, im no expert, but it seems to make sense to me that we just arent used to the bacteria. I eat really rare steak all the time, but some people i know will get sick off eating it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With steak, the outside is what is contaminated so just browning the outside takes care of most of the problem. You can still get ill eating a rare steak, it is just far less likely if it was handled properly from animal to plate.</p>
<p>With ground beef the entirety of the meat is contaminated so you need to be more thorough in your cooking.</p></div>		</li>

Traveling to another region can sometimes make you sick from the unfamiliar bacteria in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. If the animal is healthy, there are few/no bacteria within the muscles. If the meat is eaten right away it is not likely to be contaminated, but if the time is taken to process it, package it, and ship it, and wait for it to be purchased, and wait for it to be eaten, there have been a lot of steps where it's possible for the meat to become contaminated. Even then, many meats (beef mainly and as of recently, also pork) very rarely have contamination within the meat if it's a solid cut (not ground), which is why rare steak is safe to eat (edit: as long as the outside is fully cooked). This does not apply to poultry though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything that meat comes in contact with can contaminate it. With modern meat processing meat comes in contact with oodles of things. If you have one piece of meat that is contaminated and it touches a surface, each piece that touches that surface will be contaminated.</p>
<p>You can eat raw meat straight from the animal, you will run the risk of illness, but the risk is considerably lower than eating raw meat from a store because of that cross contamination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the reason is that meat might have been handing in a storage locker for a day, week, or month, and did it stay &lt; 40 degrees the entire time? did they put meat on a counter, then later put more meat on that counter without steralizing it? did the freezer/cooler at the grocery store go out for an hour, or did that 15 year old grocery store worker put back meat somene had moved to a shelf, etc.  if so then that raw meat can make you sick.  If they did everything right theres not too much risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some argue that starting to cook food allowed us to grow bigger brains faster.  Cooking food offloads some (or much) of the energy expenditure required to break down food during digestion, allowing us to spend more energy maintaining our giant (relative to other species') brains.</p>
<p>I half remembered this - so here's a link I haven't read but is probably the source <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/?no-ist" target="_blank">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/?no-ist</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also read somewhere that cooking also means not having to spend a ton of time literally chewing things (<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/?no-ist" target="_blank">four to seven hours a day for great apes</a>) which frees us up for tool usage and pokemon go</p>
<p>Edit: I used the same link, haha</p></div>		</li>
