			<div class="markdown"><p>Your sources seem to suggest the danger of Radon is connected to its radioactivity and not it’s decay products. The main danger of Radon is its radioactiveness, not the fact that half of it turns to lead after 20+ years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically, it's the fact that radon is a radioactive <em>gas</em>, with a relatively short half-life. So in a high radon environment, some non-negligible fraction of the radon you breathe will decay inside your lungs, and once decayed into the lead 210 daughter (which itself won't decay for years) basically stays there. The fact you end up with some lead in your lungs is not a huge issue (chemically speaking, anyways): the amount you'll end up with is tiny. It's the fact that the decays happen <em>inside your body</em>. Most radioactive substances aren't all that dangerous as long as they stay outside your body, as skin/air or simply distance means you don't end up absorbing much of the radiation (or any at all: a foot or two of air will pretty much block all the radiation from radon and daughters). But once inside you, you absorb <strong>all</strong> the radiation from not only the radon but also its daughters, which causes massive amounts of damage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Internal tissue doesn't respond well to radiation.</p>
<p>Our skin is remarkably resilient to ionizing radiation, usually requiring heavy long-term exposure to get a meaningful mutation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radon itself is not very effective at causing lung cancer, since it's a gas it typically tends to be at some distance from the walls of the lungs when it decays and its alpha particle has a very short range.  It's Radon's immediate daughter nuclides (decay products) that pose the real danger, they are all highly radioactive solid metals and they are electrically charged when they first form.  So they tend to attach themselves to the walls of the lungs or to dust particles which become attached to the lung wall.  Then they go through a cascade of radioactive decay each producing a new daughter nuclide that then quickly decays, irradiating the surrounding tissue. </p>
<p>What Radon does do, since it's a gas, is allow radioactive material that would otherwise stay in the earth to migrate out into the air where it then decays into suspended airborne highly radioactive solid nuclides.</p>
<p>Radon is a product of the nuclear decay of Uranium 238.  The natural Radon in our environment all comes from this source.  The Uranium 238 decay chain includes some 14 daughter nuclides in the main branches with several lower probability side branches.  The immediate precursor of Radon 222 in the U238 decay chain is Radium, Radon 222 is a direct result of the alpha decay of Radium 226.</p>
<p>The immediate daughter nuclides (decay products) of Radon are: Radon 222 =&gt; alpha =&gt; Polonium 218 =&gt; alpha =&gt; Lead 214 =&gt; Beta =&gt; Bismuth 214 =&gt;Beta =&gt; Polonium 214 =&gt; alpha, the two Polonium isotopes being the most dangerous.  Radon 222 has a half-life of 3.8 days and its daughter nuclides listed here range from a half-life of 27 minutes to .000015 seconds.  </p></div>		</li>
