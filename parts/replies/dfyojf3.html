It wasn't a particularly fancy place but since I was the only male server/waiter I had to look a bit nicer than my female coworkers and definitely more presentable than the bussers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What impresses me with them is the outsole durability for walking around. They really fucking last, and I burn through dress shoe outsoles, your average $100-at-the-mall pair doesn't even last me a year. I'm not doing athletic shit in them either, just walking properties and walking my dog and the soles just don't wear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which ones do you use? I did a quick google search and saw some that look dressy but they had one that was athletic. I wear out shoes like no tomorrow and could use a nice dressy shoe. </p></div>		</li>
