			<div class="markdown"><p>I once posted a sarcastic post to a sub about how to use a service offered by the company I was working for, and I guess the company didn't like my attitude. This was on an alt account, mind you. Well this is also an alt..anywho. Within three days I got a message from someone moderating the sub I posted in saying he was with said company and they had a meeting about my post and were attempting to get my IP address to figure out who I was. I was like &quot;lol sure&quot;.</p>
<p>Two days later my job had a meeting about the post and it was brought up in the meeting that they had obtained the IP. Since I post from mobile and use a VPN, it was too much of a hassle to track it through the VPN or some shit. (<em>Edit</em>: my point is im trying to say I knew this wasn't possible...my bad.) </p>
<p>Holy moly I was all nerves inside, but glad they gave up on it. They never found out it was me. Worked there for another year and people would occasionally bring up &quot;The Reddit Post&quot;, and people would speculate who among us did it.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand further, they would have to get your VPN to disclose who it was and what the originating IP was. If your VPN is truly no logs, then they can't obtain that information.</p>
<p>Let's say your VPN is shady and does give that information out, but most likely wouldn't just respond to any old company. It likely would require law enforcement.</p>
<p>But let's say they do get that information, you would then need to get that IP (now your mobile carrier IP) to trace to a person, requiring your carrier to identify you.</p>
<p>So to be fair you were still fairly protected, although I'm guessing in those cases where there's no legal case to have legal authorities get identifying information about you, writing style and correlating activity time is probably easier to pinpoint who it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To cover my ass after the meeting I deleted the post and account.</p>
<p>It was just about what systems the company uses to do the job I was doing and how our retarded customers couldn't figure the system out, so here's a guide ya dumbasses. So I disclosed proprietary info on our internal system and insulted customers which is a big no no. </p>
<p>This was about three years ago as well. I'm pretty sure they can't do shit outside firing me, but I quit that job myself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, there is. Depending on your country, the internet provider has to save data on who used what IP at what time. That's why it's so important to at least use a proxy if you do illegal stuff on the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This becomes hard when the IP changes. Most DHCP services from ISP's hand out the same address when a lease is renewed and unless the client if offline for a period of time it normally retains the same IP. If a client manages to spoof another HW address, it might be able to grab a new public IP (if the ISP has a HW address recycling feature on their end). </p>
<p>In cases where a hosts ip address changes, it seems hard to be able to track someone on an IP alone. If the ISP retains DHCP logs, it can see the address changes over time, but it seems unlikely for an ISP to receive this kind of request. But if a timeline of which IP a customer has can be built it is only a matter of linking web logs to those timestamps and you can get a full picture of activity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ISPs absolutely log which accounts are associated with which IP addresses at which times. You're probably not going to have any luck spoofing your cable modem's MAC address anymore, since service is associated with known MAC addresses now. I've also noticed, at least with Comcast, just restarting your modem will likely land you a new IP address, but again, they log these things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you could argue that's pretty sophisticated. It's a &quot;timing attack&quot;. They're not just looking at who used it on a given day, but actively syncing up connections from entry nodes (where the real IP is known) to exit nodes (where the destination site IP is known) with a small window of time (and you need a lot of data to narrow it down from the many users). And that requires that you control a sufficiently large number of entry and exit nodes, because if you only have one of those, you can't do it. You need both the entry and exit node (or the target server, but that can be even harder to get).</p>
<p>It surely helps a lot that few people want to run exit nodes, since they're the ones whose IP would be on record for accessing any bad things that someone using TOR might access.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No... they are apparently storing data about which users connected to any known TOR nodes on their network, then looked at the time the email was sent and connected the dots.</p>
<p>Remember this all happened on their own network. The guy used TOR on Harvard's network, which was apparently being carefully logged. It is very trivial to find likely suspects in that xase.</p></div>		</li>
