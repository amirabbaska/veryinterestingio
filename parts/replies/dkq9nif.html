			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the location in question and datum you're using.</p>
<p>Most datums describe a perfect ellipsoid.</p>
<p>Sea level is described better by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid" target="_blank">geoid shape</a> that has lumps due to uneven distributions of gravity.</p>

<p>Different datums supply a different ellipsoid.  For example WSG84 is a datum designed for global use while NAD27 is a datum specifically designed for North America.  On a GPS receiver you should be able to go into the settings and change your datum, providing slightly different GPS coordinates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that really how it's supposed to be spelt in this context? Because modern English uses 'data' to mean both plural and singular bits of information... it would be interesting if the plural of datum in this particular planet-measuring context was commonly known to be datums.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to make sure I'm getting this.  The datum would be the level of the solid matter if the earth would be bulldozed over, right? So there would be a 2600m deep ocean over all of the earth if all the mountains were used to fill up the valleys in the ocean?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where are you getting this martian datum definition from?</p>
<p>I ask because (1) I've seen other martian datum definitions that don't include this and (2) it seems a rather awful way to design datums.  Usually modern geodessy relies on gravitational data, rather than volumetric data of physical surfaces (the aforementioned “<em>bulldozing</em>”).</p>
<p>The two ways choosen by NASA for Mars are here:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Mars#Zero_elevation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Mars#Zero_elevation</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the Mariner 9 mission up until 2001, this was chosen as 610.5 Pa (6.105 mbar), on the basis that below this pressure liquid water can never be stable (i.e., the triple point of water is at this pressure). This value is only 0.6% of the pressure at sea level on Earth. Note that the choice of this value does not mean that liquid water does exist below this elevation, just that it could were the temperature to exceed 273.16 K (0.01 degrees C, 32.018 degrees F).</p>
<p>In 2001, Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter data led to a new convention of zero elevation defined as the equipotential surface (gravitational plus rotational) whose average value at the equator is equal to the mean radius of the planet.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going from the mean radius definition you gave, the 'bulldozing' explanation was my attempt of dumbing that down to an ELI5 level.</p>
<p>I wouldn't suggest trying to explain geoids, bouguer anomalies, etc. to a five-year-old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most upvoted response doesn't really correspond to the 2001 datum. Bulldozing physical surfaces doesn't necessarily yield the same thing as a specific equipotential surface.  The latter deals with gravity (which doesn't perfectly correlate with volumes of dirt because ground density isn't homogenous everywhere), which he failed to even mention.</p>
<p>Those are two different things.  In fact the most upvoted response here just seems plain wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just gravity, it's gravitational and rotational equipotential, so that the result more closely matches the surface of the planet.</p>
<p>While what he describes is not the mathematical process used to define the datum, I think it is a reasonable representation of what the datum is attempting to define.  I for one would have trouble ELI5 the equipotential surface in a more accurate manner.</p></div>		</li>
