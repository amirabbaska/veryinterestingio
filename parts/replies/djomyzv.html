			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, but it should also be noted that effective defence is only effective if the fighter is coming back with something - not just defending and moving off.</p>
<p>Also with effective defence, people often think that clinching gets you nowhere. Watch the fight Tyson vs Botha. It went a long way that Botha was winning because he was clinching and then punching or throwing a combination then clinching up. Because the clinch is used to compliment an attack, it is classed as effective defence. So yes, clinching works. <em>except this didn't stop Tyson finishing Botha as he was about to clinch and knocking him tf out</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mayweather doesn't use the clinch method. </p>
<p>Mayweather tactic is more of a counter-puncher. You throw a 1-2 at him, he'll lean back so you miss the jab then your cross will hit his shoulder and BANG, he's got you with the rear straight. This is what he's famous for. Now, because he's defended the 1-2 and made a counter, that's <strong>effective defence</strong>.</p>
<p>Mayweather whole style is very technical, he'll go into a match saying &quot;How can i defend this guy's punches?&quot; instead of what most boxers say &quot;How can I attack this guy and hurt him?&quot;</p>
<p>He's a very good counter puncher. His head movement is on point. He's quick. Search his style up on YouTube, that's how he scores so well.</p>
<p>Edit- Also, if you look at Mayweather. He'll move off instead of backwards. This is good ring control. You're not gonna find him trapped in the corner a lot. Judges look for this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Judges score on a 10-point scale. Most rounds will end 10-9, with the more dominant boxer receiving 10 points, the other receiving 9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe I'm missing something, but how is a ten point scale if you only ever use the last few points on the scale?</p>
<p>Was this like a &quot;Windows 10&quot; thing?</p>
<p>&quot;Ok, we've worked it all out, here is our 3 point judging scale. 3 is winning, 2 is losing, 1 is making a shame of yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;3? What the hell kind of top score is 3? Just add 7 to everything, people like round numbers&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the part I was missing. I was attempting to figure out why all Boxing Matches went <em>up to</em> 10 points, but it's the reverse. Both boxers start at 10. If you fuck up, you lose a point, but if you land a solid/cause the other guy to fuck up, they lose a point. In the event that you've already lost a point when you land a solid hit, you go back up to 10. </p>
<p>It makes sense now that most professional matches are ending 10-10, 10-9, or 10-8, because that is literally how close the fight is. (disregarding KO's and the like). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was stated that the losing boxer usually gets a 9.</p>
<p>Do they ever get a 6? a 3? </p>
<p>It seems like it's not really a 10 point scale here in practice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watching that again was tough. What the fuck were those judges thinking? The first round in particular? I mean on every single criteria the Russian was worse. </p>
<p>I noticed in the commentary that they referred to the Russian getting a dodgy decision in his previous fight as well. </p>
<p>Absolute scum to cheat an athlete like that. Did they ever explain or suffer any consequences? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They tried that in the olympics a few years by having the judges all push a button when a punch scored.  If all the judges push the button around the same time the boxer got a point.  The scores were shown live.</p>
<p>It sounds like a good idea but you could watch punches land and see that no point was given. Seeing the score live changes the strategy. When boxers were ahead they would just run away the rest of round.  The Chinese team was really bad about that.</p></div>		</li>
