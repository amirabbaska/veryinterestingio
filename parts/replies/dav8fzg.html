			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a more general description might be that infants don't know what features / dimensions are relevant for discrimination / tasks / living / survival. </p>
<p>An interesting example of this might be a gradual loss of mirror symmetry invariance which seems to happen as we learn how to read. For most objects in the natural world, it doesn't matter what side we see them from so we have some amount of mirror invariance. However, this invariance is a problem when it comes to discriminating between 'b' and 'd'. Children confusions between these letters gradually decrease from ages 4-8 (<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/com/55/6/897/" target="_blank">Gibson et al. 1962</a>). That is, we lose some amount of mirror invariance. </p>
<p>Although this seems like the opposite of the examples above: losing ability to discriminate between faces or phonemes, the explanation for losing an ability in one case and gaining one in another (discriminating letter forms) may actually have the same underlying explanation. </p>
<p>For a comprehensive summary of some earlier research, see <em>The Psychology of Left and Right</em>; for a more modern take, see <a href="http://www.unicog.org/publications/2013-20594-001.pdf" target="_blank">Pegado et al. 2014</a> &lt;-- pdf which also compares to illiterates who retain mirror constancy into adulthood.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would only be true for color-grapheme synesthetes who are a very small portion of the population. </p>
<p>Edit: I should clarify that I meant my answer as a hypothetical. I'm unaware of any studies that have looked at mirror reflection errors in children with synesthesia. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty cool! Is there any evidence that it could be limited  somehow by information quantity? Something like the brain having to select important information to retain vs discard?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I follow your question, so I'll take both of the interpretations I see.</p>
<p>In one sense, one might worry about the brain &quot;filling up&quot;, like a sponge that cannot retain any more water. We don't have good evidence for this being the case, and I think it's unlikely because the amount of neurons and possible connections within the brain (both posited as mechanisms of memory) are really, really large.</p>
<p>In another sense, the brain might stop interpreting parts of the signal that don't seem to matter. This might happen at the perceptual level (e.g., in sensory adaptation, where we stop perceiving things that remain constant) or at the representational level (e.g., as we learn a representation for some thing, we no longer retain the non-diagnostic characteristics of that thing). We've got pretty good evidence for both of these processes occurring (see Webster, 2012 for a review of sensory adaptation, and, uh, Doumas, Hummel, &amp; Sandhofer, 2008 for a dense account of the latter).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting. I'm going to download that paper and give it a look. First note though, is that all of their subjects had cochlear implants before 3 years 6 months. I don't know offhand the estimates for critical period of phoneme discrimination, but it's well within the overall critical period.</p>
<p>I'm still sympathetic to alternate hypotheses, though. I think a lot of our difficulty with second languages may come from having built up the system of our native language, rather than strictly a critical period of enhanced language learning ability.</p></div>		</li>
