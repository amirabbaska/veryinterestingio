I didn't have PPD with my first daughter but I have it now, after the birth of my second, and my feeling is that the main issue for me that isn't strictly biological is the massive amount of stress involved in caring for a demanding combination of baby and toddler, alone with no breaks for 13+ hours per day and on very little sleep. I wouldn't be at all surprised if it affected parents who used surrogates.</p></div>		</li>
