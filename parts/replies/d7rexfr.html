			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand, eli5 &quot;why can't we have our own&quot;: when startups like Google Fiber and Chattanooga's city run service took off, major ISPs (after losing at the federal level) bribed most states into passing legislation that banned new startups in areas that had &quot; adequate competition&quot;. Unfortunately that phrase combines home and cellular as far as the ISPs are concerned. For example, where I live Time Warner is the only home internet provider. Verizon and AT&amp;T's wireless works pretty well out here as well. Because of that, I couldn't create my own home connection and offer it to others, as per state legislation, my area has &quot;competition&quot;. Even though for home access, Time Warner is my only option, currently.</p>
<p>However, they don't block services that are already established. Taking my area as an example again...AT&amp;T's Uverse (rebranded as a local company here) is slowly rolling out fiber to my area which should be complete sometime next year. That's fine under the legislation. My area deciding they want a city provided service? That's not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wireless is another matter, but then it comes down to more towers being built (and limited spectrum).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stuff like this makes me happy I live in one of the areas where Comcast and Verizon are in direct competition with each other. I went with Verizon because I used to work for Comcast and they fired me over a tweet I made, so fuck them. But, the point is, they both consider this area to be their home turf, so they're at war with each other here. My net never goes down (I might change ISPs if it does), services are cheaper than expected, it's actually pretty great. Though, to be fair, the services may be so cheap because I live by myself and can get away using slowish Internet. (50 megs up and down)  I could go way faster if I wanted, but what I have is fine for just one person. I imagine a family of 4 would find 50 megs to be borderline unusable when everyone is home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, fiber is super expensive, but you don't need fiber to create an Internet. It used to be all copper wires, remember?</p>
<p>I want to hijack to the top answer to say that <strong>some of us did have our own internet</strong>. In my country - and I assume in many others - we had neighborhood networks. These were usually run by 2-3 people in their 20s who illegally climbed on apartment buildings, illegally pulled wires between them, illegally installed routers and illegally asked for money to let you connect to their routers.</p>
<p>Most of these networks were eventually connected to an ISP, but that wasn't necessary. We had access to each other's computer files and some people ran ftp servers (warez), web servers (porn) and email servers (why?). We had our own small internet made of up to hundreds of computers. We didn't have access to Altavista (it was &quot;the search engine&quot; before Google) but we still had access to a lot of resources between ourselves. Some of the admins connected the networks to ISPs and you got up to 5 KB/s to external networks through the ISPs (this if you were lucky and only 20 people used the 1 Mbit connection at the same time).</p>
<p>The more enterprising guys connected these networks together and bought out the others and eventually they sold them to the ISPs everyone is talking about and thus these small networks ended up connected to all the other networks around the world. Over time the ISPs replaced the wires and routers with new ones and pulled cables along with existing cables between poles instead of buildings so there weren't wires all over the place when you looked up, then they put most wires under ground and replaced them with fiber. That's how we got to the FTTP/FTTH we have today and 1 Gbit connection to any other computer around the world.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess it depends. If you want something physically resilient, go with wires because anyone can replace them. If you want something fast that can replace the existing Internet, go with fiber.</p></div>		</li>
