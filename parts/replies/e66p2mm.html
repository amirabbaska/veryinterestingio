			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes steroids dangerous is overuse, abuse, and not managing side effects which can have lasting effects. </p>
<p>LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) is a symptom that can cause cardiac arrest in some. It’s not incredibly common until you get to the higher levels of use and abuse/ high levels of bodybuilding. </p>
<p>Increased hemoglobin causes the blood to thicken and additionally bad cholesterol goes up and good cholesterol goes down which can lead to a heart attack. </p>
<p>Testosterone aromotizes into DHT and estrogen which can cause gynocomastia and mood swings if not regulated with an aromotase inhibitor. </p>
<p>Other steroids have various effects on the body in desirable and undesirable ways.  There are numerous different ones which have so many different side effects that it would take too long to list them here. </p>
<p>Check out r/steroids wiki for more information! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...and then there are SARMS, which produce some of the muscle enhancing effects of anabolic steroids without a lot of the disadvantages.</p>

<p>also see /r/peds</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm not saying Sarms are safe to use, or aren't harmful. Research is simply too inconclusive yet, so the safe road is to assume they might be harmful.<br />
Don't ever consider taking them lightly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are on a list to be banned. Anyone selling them at the moment must do so with the disclaimer: not for consumption...So they have to advertise their product by basically saying, We’re selling this for this much money. Don’t eat it.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not cleared / legal for human consumption, they are in the same &quot;just don't do it&quot; area for the general population.<br />
That said, they are being prescribed to people recovering from cancer to help battle muscle weakness, and you can bet your ass a lot of sporters are using them.<br />
One aimed specifically at improving endurance (cardarine) has been cancelled from further tests because it was said to promote cancer growth in lab test mice, other people claim that was only relevant to mice already having cancer and with extreme dosage.
Some people even theorized Lance Armstrong may have used Cardarine in excessive dosages causing his cancer.</p>
<p>The thing with Sarms is - there's a lot of different varieties - each with their own pros and cons, each with their own risk or almost lack of risk. Lots of people have been using them to great effect, but the safety hasn't been determined.<br />
You'll find people on either end of the discussion either promoting them or warning of the grave dangers.</p>
<p>As with anabolic steroids - using them is not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>It's for everyone to decide for themselves. Just read up for weeks on the matter, get informed, and make your own risk / reward assessment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SARMS are more harmful because you are not replacing the testosterone your body will stop making.  Do not use SARMS. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Testosterone suppression with Sarms differ per kind, and usually is <em>way</em> below that of anabolic steroids.  But I'm very interested in your point of view!
Can you point me to the study/studies you informed yourself with?</p></div>		</li>
