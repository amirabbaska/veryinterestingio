<p>Well, it depends on your intentions. Treasury bonds are the very definition of a long-term, safe investment. There is, in fact, no safer place or form your money could be in. But if you're looking to get rich, you're not. Demand for treasury bonds is so high that interest rates are ridiculously low, usually barely edging out inflation. Good way to stay rich, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can. In the form of a Treasury Bond. It's a form of investment where you give the government money and they give you a promise to repay you, with interest, over time.</p>
<p>It is considered a very safe investment to make.</p></div>		</li>
