			<div class="markdown"><p>So why is it the opposite in the US? California has higher emission standards but you can only get 91 and not 93 octane as in other states?</p>
<p>Edit: tl:dr of responses: The US and other countries are addressing different types of pollution and calculate emissions differently. Higher combustion pressures need higher octane fuel which shifts emissions from CO2 to NOx. NOx leads smog, acid rain, ozone depletion while CO2 is a greenhouse gas that absorbs more energy from the sun.</p>
<p>Edit 2 <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating" target="_blank">wiki</a>:       </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research Octane Number (RON)Edit</p>
<p>The most common type of octane rating worldwide is the Research Octane Number(RON). RON is determined by running the fuel in a test engine with a variable compression ratio under controlled conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane.</p>
<p>Motor Octane Number (MON)Edit</p>
<p>Another type of octane rating, called Motor Octane Number (MON), is determined at 900 rpm engine speed instead of the 600 rpm for RON.[1] MON testing uses a similar test engine to that used in RON testing, but with a preheated fuel mixture, higher engine speed, and variable ignition timing to further stress the fuel's knock resistance. Depending on the composition of the fuel, the MON of a modern pump gasoline will be about 8 to 12 octane lower than the RON, but there is no direct link between RON and MON. Pump gasoline specifications typically require both a minimum RON and a minimum MON.[citation needed]</p>
<p>Anti-Knock Index (AKI) or (R+M)/2Edit</p>
<p>In most countries in Europe (also in Australia and New Zealand) the &quot;headline&quot; octane rating shown on the pump is the RON, but in Canada, the United States, Brazil, and some other countries, the headline number is the average of the RON and the MON, called the Anti-Knock Index (AKI), and often written on pumps as (R+M)/2. It may also sometimes be called the Posted Octane Number (PON).</p>
<p>Difference between RON, MON, and AKIEdit</p>
<p>Because of the 8 to 12 octane number difference between RON and MON noted above, the AKI shown in Canada and the United States is 4 to 6 octane numbers lower than elsewhere in the world for the same fuel. This difference between RON and MON is known as the fuel's Sensitivity,[5] and is not typically published for those countries that use the Anti-Knock Index labelling system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tl;dr2: Europe and Australia use RON, tested in a variable compression engine at 600rpm. MON is harsher, preheating the fuel and running at 900rpm resulting in MON rated octane (a measure of how much compression the rule can withstand without ignighting) being 8 - 13 LOWER. The US and Canada use AKI which averages the RON with the MON ([R+M]/2). Fuel from Australia would have a lower octane rating by US standards, which is the opposite of what many of the replies I got, and I thought as well. TIL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not actually sure the parent reply is entirely correct - Car-face's reply is closer to the truth IMO. </p>
<p>However: EU regulates and in some cases taxes CO2 emissions. This is not the case in Australia, and IIRC not in California either. Higher compression engines actually tend to produce more of certain kinds of pollutants (eg nitrous oxides, though these pollutants are reduced again in catalytic converters). But, they produce less CO2 per unit output, due to higher efficiency. They also require higher RON.</p>
<p>So the answer is likely: California regulations are stricter on nitrous oxides, while EU regulations are stricter on CO2 emissions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Europe seems to use RON, while USA uses the average of RON and MON. MON tends to run a few points lower than RON as it's a stricter test, so it's likely that USA 91 AKI or (R+M)/2 is higher octane than 91 RON. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in an oil refinery and ran the octane tests on gasoline (including 87 and 91 blends).  At least for our blends, when we produced 91 blend, the RON was definitely higher (anywhere from 93-97) depending on what products went into the fuel, vapor pressure, etc.</p>
<p>And we didn’t even separately blend 93.  We blended 84 or 91 and then the pipeline companies would spike the gas with extra toluene or ethanol to get it up to 87 or 93.  I don’t know if that’s how other refineries did it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Emissions&quot; is a really broad term.  A lot depends on the type of emissions you are reducing.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions are going to be directly related to fuel use. The more fuel in, the more carbon that must come out.  One good way to reduce fuel use is to increase compression ratio. Higher compression ratio means more power means less fuel is needed. But you need higher octane fuels to achieve this.</p>
<p>NOx emissions on the other hand are going to be based on how much O2 and N2 from the air combine.  The higher the combustion temperature, the more NOx generated.  When you increase compression ratio, you increase temperatures which increases NOx.  There are other means to remove the NOx post combustion and ways to better design the combustion chamber, but increasing compression ratio makes that job more difficult.  The emissions regulations in the 70's and 80's caused compression ratios to drop in the US by quite a bit.</p>
<p>So you can reduce emissions in such a way that increases emissions of another sort.  </p>
<p>California is in a climatic environment that NOx (which leads to brown smog) is a concern so are chiefly concerned with NOx production.  The EU is in a geopolitical situation where fuel use and CO2 use are more of a concern so they focus more on CO2 emissions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the same, since they have 150ppm in regular fuel, while USA and Europe around 10ppm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Australia uses the same emissions regulations for cars as Europe. If you look up the recent ADR's (Australian Design Rules) for emissions standards and they will basically say refer to the  European standard.</p></div>		</li>
