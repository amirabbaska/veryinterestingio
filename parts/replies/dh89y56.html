			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. The electron shell is ~20,000x larger in diameter than the nucleus.  </p>
<p>Once in a while a photo <em>could</em> hit a nucleus.  Not sure what happens then. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just thinking of this. i saw a nanotech demo about how gold is differently colored at extremely small quantities. Im not entirely sure about the details but it seemed like it might be slightly visible. They also use gold on glass in very thin layers that you can see through so I would suspect that if you could see it, it would be very difficult.</p></div>		</li>
