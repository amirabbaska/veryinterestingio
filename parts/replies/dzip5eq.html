			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that by this definition Harvey Weinstein and Scientology gangstalked their victims. It sounds to me like organized gas lighting, and we already know how often sociopaths gas light. In this instance it would seem to be 1. Wealthy sociopaths  using their organizational resources to group gaslight someone, or 2. A group of sociopaths collusively gas lighting a victim. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really recommend that Last Podcast episode because I really didn't go into that much depth about it, but you're right. There are actual instances of it happening to people like whistleblowers, ex-scientologists, etc. Basically people who pissed off wealthy, well-connected organizations. And then there's the idea that normal people get gangstalked as a form of &quot;practice&quot; for high value targets and that's where you get into the people who are actually paranoid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, man I was empathizing getting group gaslighted by a powerful organization, say like Weinstein did to young actresses or Scientology likely did to Katy Holmes, and that stuff is scary. Manipulating someone's reality. </p>
<p>I think in people's rush to classify this as a mental disorder they are ignoring the reality of how often it actually happens, say even an employer might do this to someone if they want to fire them but don't have cause, or want to fire them but don't want to pay unemployment, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/05/14/chipotle-wrongfully-accused-a-manager-of-stealing-636-she-just-won-millions-in-court/" target="_blank">so they make up unverifiable stories</a>. And they'll specifically target people who are vulnerable. Although I'm sure there are also cases of mental illness. </p></div>		</li>
