			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't remember where I read it, so take that for what it's worth, but I read about a study that was done that showed snakes were the number one predator humans could spot. Even out of periphery, we can spot them better than anything else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw the same thing, but it included spiders.  They did a test where they put a collage of all kinds of animals together and asked the person to find animal x.  They consistently found the spiders and snakes quicker than everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm I wonder if it could be because they both look so distinctive. Kind of easy to pick out the animals with either no legs or eight of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall a recent reddit post that not only do humans instinctively recognize snakes, there is an involuntary response to them. Similar to u/naturefreaklife's post below, people will have their body &quot;freeze-up&quot; and stop while out in nature, and only then notice a nearby snake. The instinct trumps the conscious mind before they even know it. Presumably, snake-avoidance is too important to leave to our irresponsible conscious brains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow - this exactly happened to me walking my dog a couple days ago. Heading up the sidewalk and suddenly froze like a flare had gone off. I looked at my dog (who was happily sniffing at the latest news on the ground) and this snake (a racer I think?) popped into my vision. He didn't do anything to attract the attention - was just  sunning himself i guess - but it has been plaguing me ever since. Did I get lucky spotting this one, or did I just happen to see this one and I'm literally surrounded by snakes 24/7 that I <em>haven't</em> seen? I feel slightly better now. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I encountered a rattle snake trail running last summer and even though I was moving fast, I came to an immediate full stop about 15 feet away from it before I even registered that not only was I seeing a snake but that it was a rattle snake.  I'm not particularly afraid of snakes but my instincts stopped me from potentially dying out there, which is likely what would have happened if it bit me.  I was at least 6 miles away from a road in either direction at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are also instinctively afraid of snakes. Humans are also instinctively afraid of insects, whereas monkeys are not (monkeys think they are snacks). It has been argued the insect-phobia has to do with the development of agriculture and understanding of hygiene.</p></div>		</li>
