			<div class="markdown"><p>Critical care dietitian here. I'm not sure if you truly meant to exclusively mention TPN as a source of nutrition, but early nutrition interventions are actually a promoted standard of care. Unless the patient is on high dose pressors or has some other contraindications, tube feeding should be started within the first 24-48 hours. Saying people on intravenous nutrition have worse outcomes could be true for anyone since it highly increases the risk of sepsis. Maybe you're thinking of a specific patient population where early nutrition has adverse effects that I'm not considering. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The trial Epanic demonstrated that early PN is deleterious. European guidance is early NG feed, and PN if NG targets aren't met after 3 to 5 days for people with a normal pre-morbid nutritional state. Jean Louis-Vincent has suggested a useful flow-chart.</p>
<p>In sepsis NG feed provides the calories a patient needs. Anything not required isn't absorbed. TPN bypasses that self-regulation which is why it's less useful and actually hazardous.</p>
<p>Out dieticians also reduce the target calories in septic or critically ill patients for the first few days. In the absence of calorimetry it is quite a lot of guesswork.</p>
<p>Edit: just realised that by tube feeding do you mean enteral? In which case yes to early enteral feed for the reasons above. Enteral nutrition whether you're hungry or not probably doesn't cause any harm as anything not required isn't absorbed and just transits through. All our patients are enterally fed from admission unless there are surgical reasons not to (a constant battle)... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I misunderstood your initial post. It sounded as though you were saying early nutrition support has adverse effects for critically I'll patients. I now understand you were specifically referring to parenteral nutrition.
It's especially refreshing to hear your appropriate patients are mostly fed from admission, since I initially thought you were saying the opposite was true/encouraged. </p>
<p>Yes, tube feeding means enteral. To further clarify, nutrition support references enteral and parenteral. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but there is some evidence that obese patients have a better survival in sepsis. Most body fuel is stored as fat. Accepting the huge hormonal dysregulation that occurs in sepsis, fat still remains a preferred fuel source. Whilst protein loss is very high and significant, muscular patients don't have a survival benefit that I'm aware of. That said, being aerobically fit is associated with a greater ability to survive the horrific physiological challenge that is sepsis.</p>
<p>Of course, nutrition is just one aspect of managing critically ill patients. The general rule is, however, the healthier your body systems are to start with, the better your chances.</p></div>		</li>
