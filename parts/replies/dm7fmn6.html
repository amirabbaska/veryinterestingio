			<div class="markdown"><p>I too started balding in my early 20s. It's less than ideal, but you probably care more about it than anyone else will. Eventually I stopped trying to use minoxidil (Rogaine) products and just went the shaved head route. I'll scorch the earth every two weeks or so. There's a lot that goes into male pattern baldness, but generally men with higher testosterone levels have higher incidence. So although you might feel less desirable bc of the hair loss, your higher testosterone probably means that you have a deeper voice and an easier time building musculature and keeping off fat. Things that a lot of men care about, and that other men and women find attractive.</p>
<p>I have a typical Wahl trimmer and a special trimmer called the Bald Eagle that works really well for shaving your head bc it fits in your hand more ergonomically. You could even use a pair of scisors and a razor. Regardless, you will save lots of money on haircuts. Plus, I liked to wear baseball hats and beanies anyway. And now I don't have to worry about hat hair in the winter. </p>
<p>As a final bonus, if you're ever in a bind at Halloween all you need to do is get a pair of white jeans, a white t-shirt, and a mop, and you can be Mr. Clean. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gah!  The money I wasted on Rogaine!  But I was in my early 20s and insecure. The only bald &quot;role model&quot; on TV was George Costanza from Seinfeld. Toupees were still common with some actors, teaching men that baldness is something to be ashamed of and hide. I'll admit, my vanity put me in a deep depression and almost suicidal.<br />
Then Star Trek TNG came out! Jean-Luc Picard was boss AF! He was cool, powerful, and brave. My dad hid under a toupee and I was considering buying one until Patrick Stewart. Instead of buying a rug, I went out and bought some clippers and never looked back.  I honestly admire Patrick Stewart and consider him a true role model.<br />
Funny thing: I'm kinda nice in real life but I have the male equivalent to Resting Bitch Face and always look grumpy. I've been accused of being a skinhead and Nazi more than once, especially recently. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I have very high testosterone and I ended up with high pitch voice. My metabolism is so fast that I have to push myself to reach BMI, as in, I struggle to even gain weight, let alone muscle.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just take the plunge. Shave it all off. It'll take people a few days to adjust (and for your head to get a bit of a tan to match the rest of your face) but it's certainly better than going for shorter and shorter hair cuts for years... it's obvious when someone is delaying the inevitable :P Also, buy your own shaver and do it yourself, saves so much money, shave my head once every 2 weeks or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, OP. Don't hide under a baseball cap. Skin that shit and own it!  Your friends might bust your balls for a day or two, but that's what friends do. After a week you won't even notice it anymore.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this isn't super helpful in answering the question but this guy is right that you should just go with it. I saw a picture of myself at disneyland and I was grinning like a stupid kid and you could see my scalp. As soon as I got home from my trip I shaved my head, I have since also grown a beard and Bald with beard is awesome. Embrace the look, you will be happier in the long run! (unless you look terrible but i doubt you will)</p></div>		</li>
