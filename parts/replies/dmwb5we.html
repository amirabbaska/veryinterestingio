<p>The Bureau of International Settlements believes it is a front for sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds whose <em>owners don't want to reveal their positions</em>. So are Luxembourg ($212 billion) and Belgium ($98 billion). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're saying while it's reported as Cayman Islands ownership, it's actually owned by others.  Similar to Luxembourg (another financial haven nation). </p>
<p>The Department of the Treasury (which is the source for country holding information) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>imperfections caused by “custodial bias” remain in the current MFH table. Some foreign owners entrust the safekeeping of their securities to institutions that are neither in the United States nor in the owner’s country of residence. For example, a German investor may buy a U.S. security and place it in the custody of a Swiss bank. In both the SLT and the periodic surveys of holdings of long-term securities, such a holding will typically be recorded vis-a-vis Switzerland rather than Germany. This “custodial bias” contributes to the large recorded holdings in major custodial centers including Belgium, the Caribbean banking centers, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the example, the German investor owns the bond, but it's reported as Switzerland.  </p>
<p>Edit: Based on recent <a href="http://www.cimoney.com.ky/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147485584" target="_blank">financial statements</a>, the Cayman Islands central bank only appears to own about $24 billion in US treasury securities (bills and notes).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fractional reserve banking. if 10 people each deposit 1 dollar at a bank a bank has $10, it can loan out $9 and keep $1 in the vault in case someone needs to withdraw $1. Provided everyone wants to keep their money in the bank, there is no problem, eventually the $9 is paid back, but with interest so it's $10. Now the bank has $11.</p>
<p>Interest makes this work out favorably for the bank in the long run.</p>
<p>unless there is a run on banks (everyone withdrawing at once, aka no confidence in banks/currency) things work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the trust funds are exhausted, the program still pays out ~90% of expected benefits. So about 10% of the annual disbursements are from the funds. Social security pays out something like $800b or $900b per year and we're just hitting the front edge of baby boomer retirement so the math roughly checks out (my numbers would suggest about half of the $3t, but that doesn't account for inflation or more recipients).</p>
<p>Has anyone seen projections on how the SSA looks once the baby boomers stop collecting social security? Does it start running a surplus again once that huge population bracket is done, or do future demographics keep it close to breakeven? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In about 30 years the SSA will run a deficit. (Well, they won't... they will just pay the 90% like you said) in 70 years they will be revenue neutral and in 100 years will be in a surplus. </p>
<p>That is of course assuming congress doesnt do anything. Anything like raise retirement age or actually tax rich people for social security. (They currently don't tax incomes over 100,000k or so)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Social Security pays as it goes - it pays the benefits of retirees out of the wages of workers today. Every deduction on your check goes right out to some older person every month.  </p>
<p>Social Security has been taking in more than it has been paying out. That's where the &quot;surplus&quot; comes from, which is now $3 Trillion. </p>
<p>At some point, there will be more $ going to the retired than is coming out of the paychecks. The surplus will fall. </p>
<p>once it its zero...nothing will happen. Taxes will still be taken out of paychecks and paid to retirees. But, there's no more treasuries to rely on for payment. So...the government will just borrow or tax (as it always does) to cover the shortfall. Which is exactly what it was doing before; the US government was using general fund revenue (from taxes or from borrowing) to pay &quot;treasuries&quot; which then get used to pay social security benefits. When the trust fund runs out, instead of paying off a treasury &quot;owned&quot; by the social security trust fund, they'll just give the money directly to social security. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you noticed there are a lot of people nearing retirement these days?  </p>
<p>Those people retiring (and their medical care) cost more than Social Security taxes in in taxes.  Currently they're just spending the interest earned on the $3 trillion in treasuries, but starting in 2020, they'll start spending the $3 trillion too.  The people who run Social Security best forecast is for the $3 trillion to be gone by 2034, at which point they'll pay 79% of scheduled benefits, or congress will change the rules.  </p>
<p>The interesting thing to watch will be public debt auctions and non-social security spending as Social Security doesn't roll over their $3 trillion as they've been doing for the last 30ish years.  That's a lot of additional debt that needs to be raised.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>holding US debt is like slowly going bankrupt, which is arguably why better than quickly going bankrupt, so if you have way too much cash (Cayman Island bankers) and need a reliable place to store it, US bonds are the way to go. The reason china holds US bonds is also because they are super stable if negative(ish) returns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, most US government bond rates are sub-inflation right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-price-index-cpi" target="_blank">Inflation at present is 1.7%/year</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us" target="_blank">Current bond rates</a> for 3, 6, and 12 months are <em>0%</em>, so those lose you 1.7%/year real.</p>
<p>2 year is 1.25%, so you're losing 0.45%.</p>
<p>5 year is 1.63%, so you almost break even.</p>
<p>It's not until you get into the 10 and 30 year bonds, which are 2.25% and 2.75%, that you start getting any real return.  And that's only presuming that inflation stays as low as it is for the next decade or three.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>U.S. dollar inflation (at around 1.7% annually at the moment) is higher than the interest rate on most U.S. government debt, so the real value of your investments goes down with time when invested in most U.S. government debt.</p>
<p>This is also why your savings account loses value with time. In order to keep up, you have to earn returns at or above the inflation rate. Some investors are willing to invest in assets with sub-inflation returns, though, if they value safety extremely highly. And U.S. government debt is viewed as one of the safest investments you can make (other than erosion to inflation, expected to never decline in value).</p></div>		</li>
