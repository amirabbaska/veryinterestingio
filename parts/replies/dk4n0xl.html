			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, you're partially right. As with mosquitos, male ticks don't take a blood meal. Only the females do, and only because they need the blood to produce/feed their eggs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Male ticks attach, but do not feed or become engorged. Because the adult males do not take a blood meal, they do not transmit Lyme disease, human anaplasmosis, or babesiosis.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADULT male ticks do not take a blood meal and cannot transmit disease, but nymphal male ticks do &amp; can. The tick life cycle goes from larvae -&gt; nymph -&gt; adult with a blood meal between each stage. The bacteria that cause Lyme disease is not passed from the mother to her offspring, so larval ticks do not have it. They can contract it during their first blood meal (needed for transition from larva to nymph), though, and then pass it during their second blood meal (from nymph to adult).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was imagining it would be adult ticks being released into a problem area. But what do I know - I don't have a PhD! </p>
<p>Btw, do you have any ideas to control the spread of Lyme?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What part of the country do you live in? Or where did you do your research?</p>
<p>I live in middle Tennessee and about 15 years ago I got bit by a tick that stayed attached to me overnight. (Should have done a tick check but was just out in the yard). In about a week, I felt horrible with flu like symptoms, neck pain, and the site of attachment got that angry infected look. Did not get the bullseye rash. </p>
<p>Went to the doctor and told that wretched woman about the tick and her reply?  'We don't have Lyme here'. Went untreated for a while and just got worse (a band of numbness around my waist and feet went numb along with numerous other symptoms).</p>
<p>Went to a neurologist for my symptoms and showed him the tick. I knew what kind of tick it was. He couldn't even identify the tick!! </p>
<p>I went on the Lyme network and called a person from close to my area. They connected me to an MD out of state in Missouri. Got treated with antibiotics and am much better today. </p>
<p>The Vanderbilt associated physicians were horrible and arrogant. I would have gone down in flames with them chanting in the background, &quot;no Lyme here, no Lyme here&quot;!!</p>
<p>Has your experience with physician acceptance been different? Or has it changed over time to more acceptance that there is a Lyme problem?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know if the rates of lyme disease in humans are higher than in dogs?  I read a study that said only a tiny amount of dogs actually get lyme disease and in like 99+% of cases the dogs immune system successfully fights it off.  Curious to know if humans fare as well.</p></div>		</li>

There was an information sign describing something about the history of the wall, and all I remember was the phrase &quot;between propaganda and terror.&quot; I've always thought it would make a great album name for a metal band. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There could be a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Maybe they didn't know the answer before they asked, but have since done research based on the answers received.</p>
<p>Maybe they wanted to spark a discussion on the subject to get the concept out there for people to think about.</p>
<p>Maybe they knew that it would work, so the question is more about why it hasn't already been done, rather than a question about the possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then someone needs to go rogue and forget ahead.</p>
<p>I'm 100% on board with this. Humans are great at eliminating species. We need to do this intentionally for a few key species, for the greater good of all creatures. Mosquitoes and ticks can eat a bag of dicks.</p>
<p>I'll gladly suffer a couple extra tick bites this year, if it means they then disappear <em>forever</em>!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Male ticks might not transmit Lyme, but they transmit other diseases. I work in a vet micro/path lab, and we always use male ticks for pathogen acquisition and transmission studies. Females attach to one host and feed until repletion, but males feed for shorter periods and move from host to host more frequently, spreading disease to new animals. </p></div>		</li>
