			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but higher voltages require more insulation, and are more dangerous to the end user.</p>
<p>It's tradeoffs all the way down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really 120 volts he is not going to make you any less dead then 240 a lot of the consideration of voltage has to do with the early incandescence light bulbs, 120 volts is a lot less harsh on the filament than 240, between 120 and 250 volts AC the installation requirements don't differ much</p>
<p>Amperage on the other hand is significantly different between 120 and 240, it is much more difficult and expensive to deal with high Amos than high volts</p>
<p>I much prefer the 240 volt main feed that can comfortably feed 16 kilowatts over a 16 mm cable single phase</p></div>		</li>
