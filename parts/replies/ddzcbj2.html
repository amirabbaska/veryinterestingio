			<div class="markdown"><p>The theory addressed in the article is not taken very seriously. In either case, the book that introduced the theory is called &quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot;. It is worth a read and is fascinating.</p>
<p>Essentially, the idea is that breakdown of the bicameral mind happened as language was developed. The author's thesis is that consciousness is a metaphor we tell ourselves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also the idea that our mind has evolved/changed that drastically just 3000 years ago is a pretty out there according to the current scientific consensus.</p>
<p>But with that said, the only real consensus on consciousness, is that we have no idea what it is and why we experience it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How has it been discredited?  That  is one of the problems I see with the thesis, it's not clear to me how it could be discredited.</p>

<p>That's not the hypothesis. Jaynes supposes that there could have been some evolutionary pressure at work during the Late Bronze Age Collapse, but it is not necessary for his thesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the voice thinking about the voice that you're thinking about. I've discovered there's another voice behind the voice. For example, I said in my head a name, but it was the wrong name and behind that another voice called out the correct name as soon as my brain figured it out, but I was already consciously thinking the wrong name. This is the best way so far that I know how to describe this. Lol</p></div>		</li>
