			<div class="markdown"><p>I always imagined it more like a effigy being burned.  You make an effigy of someone you don't like and make it the most offensive/rudest that person is ever perceived to be and they judge that person or thing on those merits alone.  </p>
<p>Example: The leader of a country is forcing journalists to all be entered into a government database where what they're currently doing is always being tracked and noted.  People might make the leader of that country out to be hitler, then make the argument that that person is hitler and now the argument is about whether that person is or is not hitler instead of the actual merits of what the leader is trying to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation, although it misses one thing: a strawman argument is often done intentionally, but it can also be done accidentally, if they actually misunderstood their opponent's argument. </p></div>		</li>
