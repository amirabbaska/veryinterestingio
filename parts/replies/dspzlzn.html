<p>Do they cease to exist if they hit something and arenâ€™t reflected?</p>

<p>Yep. If they hit something like a piece of black construction paper, they will be absorbed and turned into heat.</p>

<p>For that matter, don't the photos actually cease to exist even when they are reflected? My understanding is that things that reflect light actually absorb and re-emit it, though I could be completely off base there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are absorbed and re-emitted, yes. The photon that's re-emitted is identical to the original except for the direction it's travelling, so in some sense it's sort of the same photon. Talking about something ceasing to exist on that timescale is kind of iffy, but it's basically tomato-tomahto.</p></div>		</li>
