<p>So why not why not block based on the far more difficult to manipulate ANI?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ANI is usually delivered to the first tandem switch in the chain, but not necessarily to the end office of the subscriber.  It is used primarily for billing.  As you might guess, phone companies are very averse to messing up their billing system by monkeying around with ANI.  It is not at all difficult to manipulate ANI digits so long as you own the phone system the call originates in.  I have done it and can do it with ease.  The scammers can easily purchase their own phone system or rent service on a system that allows them to manipulate all parts of the call record.</p>
<p>Normal call processing is something like this:</p>
<p>Local End Office (the office where your call originates which attaches ANI digits) calls a Regional Tandem (which is responsible for directing your call to another end office, a cross country carrier tandem, or an international gateway) then routes reverse order down to another tandem then to another local end office (in which the called phone number resides).</p>
<p>ANI does not necessarily travel with the call from start to finish.  It can be picked off at the local office, regional tandem, or carrier tandem.  After that, it is just an artifact that may travel with the call or may be removed and replaced with other digits.  Remember that it is designed primarily to facilitate billing so once the billing information has been collected ANI data is unnecessary.  I won't go into the details of how and why CPID is different from the ANI digits, but suffice to say that the CPID is not involved in billing the call.  We would also have to discuss the SS7 signalling network - that in theory knows everything about where the call originated and where it is going - removing the need for the end offices and tandems to know anything at all about the call except that it is to be set up with an end to end path.</p>
<p>The database is commonly referred to as a Line Information DataBase (aka LIDB).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Telecom billing is probably the best (and most complex) in the world.  Every time a I/CLEC terminates a call they get paid from some other I/CLEC.  You don't need to 'trace' a number, just the billing information.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that telecom's MAKE MORE MONEY FROM THE SCAMMERS than if they were to stop them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They're making money by turning a blind eye. If good actor service providers or government regulators enforced a blacklist against known bad actor service providers, the system could be cleansed of scammers taking advantage of end customers very quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree that it's profit driven. By its very nature, it is assessed from beginning to end - origination to termination. Just because a verizon customer got a scam phone call doesn't mean there's any significant skin in the game for them to earn money delivering you that call (that's what you pay for service for anyway!) nor is it worth backpedalling through the carrier that handed off to them, and that carrier to the next. You can't call your carrier and say 'Bob on sprint can't call me'. Tell Bob to call sprint. He pays them, it's his job to complain about his service.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the phone company is in the business of delivering phone calls, not policing them and forbidding them on some arbitrary technical basis that would just be a cat and mouse game that would also inevitably have false positives and deny some legitimate calls.  </p>
<p>And, just like web hosting and virtual private servers, verizon internet can't blacklist anything to the IP range belonging to a company that resells and 1 of their customers is a scammer - you couldn't access webpages from any other of that hosting company's customers. Same with voip. I resell my network access to 10 people - 1 is dishonest - should 9 honest people be cut off the phone network? Ultimately, the answer to telcos shutting off scammers is telcos blackballing the telcos that provide that access. Imagine if sprint cocking up was significant enough to cut them off from the American phone network - the same rules would have to apply to them.  </p>
<p>My personal opinion - a nationally mandated fraud reporting center that has access to call records across all carriers in the USA to track origination. VOIP is only good cause it's cheap but also let's you access US regulated services from within the US from anywhere. Cut off an account or entry point of some foreign scam center from originating calls in the US and you shut them down. In the absence of a national policing effort, nothing can happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually think the government can stop this??? How is the 'Do Not Call' list working????  Did it stop all those cold calls?? No? hahahahaha</p>
<p>Unless you take the money our of these phone centers they will never stop.  The telco's have no reason to stop because profit.</p></div>		</li>
