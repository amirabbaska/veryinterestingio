			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a ridiculously misleading and disingenuous answer. There are quite significant differences between campaign contributions and bribes, the primary one being that campaign contributions can only be spent on the politician's campaign--he or she does not directly benefit from it. Nobody gets &quot;handed a pile of cash&quot; in campaign contributions: they are tracked and reported and can only be spent on certain things. I know less about the quid-pro-quo aspect, but that's an important distinction, too.</p>
<p>You can argue that campaign contributions represent still too much influence, and I won't try to debate that, but by saying &quot;in the US, bribery is legal,&quot; you're being overly literal about a metaphor and obscuring important distinctions between a system you don't like and an actual crime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The campaign contributions help them keep office AND prevent anybody from taking it from them. The office gets you power, influence, and access. At a certain level, it is legal to trade on inside information and trade in sectors that are being legislated upon.</p>
<p>Career politicians are a huge problem, and it's not because they are super effective and do the best job anybody could possibly do to represent their constituents. Feinstein and Schumer come to mind - people who have become very rich as career &quot;public servants.&quot;</p>
<p>So, yeah, they don't hand them a pile of cash directly. They pay for their ability to enrich themselves by repaying favors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia we had campaign contributions delivered to one minister's election fund by a chinese company that then was then one of the successful bidders for a large development property. In that particular case, he was destroyed in the media and had to resign from his position due to the conflict of interest.</p>
<p>I'm interested to know if in America there is a consideration for conflict of interest with regards to politics that you know of. Would Exxon for instance be able to donate to a candidate that was then in the position to provide preferential treatment to them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a distinction without a difference.  Staying in power will land you piles of money.  If you leave office and were a good little minion, you will be offered large piles of cash when you leave.   Any bribery via campaign contributions are just a down payment on future bribery.  This isn't even vaguely theoretical.  Anyone who took campaign bribes like a good little toad gets a pile of cash when they leave.  This is the American system.  We don't call it bribery by tradition, not because it isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a European it have always looked so weird that companies have such close ties to so many politicians. And that you spend extreme sums of money to campaign and it really becomes a class issue to become a politician. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the small part where bribes are direct transfers of $, whereas campaign contributions can only legally fund campaign expenditures.</p>
<p>Suggesting that there is no difference between US-style campaign contributions and the sort of bribery that is pandemic in many countries is <em>astoundingly</em> naïve. Sure, if you have money in the US, you can deploy it, and that will garner you influence. But that doesn't mean that there are no meaningful distinctions between that and all other things that are called bribery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that view is that money is fungible. So you give me $1million that in theory I can't use for my Maui vacation. But it is now also $1million of my own money I no longer have to spend on my campaign. So now I get both my Maui vacation &amp; all the campaign money. The only difference are what column on the ledger the money was reported, but the effective result is the same nonetheless: a bribed politician.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very few candidates ever put their own money into campaigns. So the &quot;1mil kept I can now spend on vacation&quot; never happens because it would never be campaign money otherwise. They would just have a poorly funded campaign, and maybe lose. But they lose with their personal money intact. </p>
<p>The rare self-funding politicians are guys who are beyond rich, where that 'fungibleness' just doesn't matter. They were going to have both their vacation and campaign regardless.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Focusing on the dollar value instead of purchasing access and favor-debt is naïve. The guy you're replying to is spot-on. Simplistic quid pro quo bribery has been out of style for a long time and a variety of alternative, effective methods have been working really well.</p>
<p>Whether or not that qualifies as &quot;bribery&quot; in your book is irrelevant since the outcome is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Focusing on the dollar value? Commenting on &quot;purchasing access&quot; or favor-debt? </p>
<p>Since I said nothing whatsoever about any of those things, and you appear to be completely in the dark about what I did I say, I'll just remark that your opinions are worthless until you can look at English sentences and read them for what they transparently mean, instead of whatever the hell you're hallucinating them to mean. </p></div>		</li>
