			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if there is any sexual selection going on for penis size since women are now more aware of the variations among men (i.e. women won't go for small penises and will go for above average to larger sizes) eventually leading to directional selection towards a population with a larger overall average penis size.</p>
<p>I haven't had too many discussions with my female friends about size, but from the ones I have heard from have said they prefer between 6 to 8 inches, which is above the world's average. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They might prefer those penis sizes. But, how many of them got all of the way to the bedroom, saw the penis size, and decided against sleeping with the guy? How many performed a penis inspection before deciding to have sex?</p>
<p>Also, how many would choose a guy with a large penis, but no education and no job, over a guy with a smaller than average penis who was successful and educated? </p>
<p>Even in modern times, many women place a higher value on things other than sexual satisfaction. Especially when sexual satisfaction can be bought on Amazon with free 2-day shipping. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That selection pressure would have to be consistent for a long, long time to make any difference (thousands of years). The preference may be as much fashion as preference for certain body shapes, etc. </p>
<p>For example, in Renaissance Italy, the preference seems to have been towards smaller penises, judging by contemporary art. Apparently a smaller penis was associated with better self-control and discretion, so that's what was considered ideal at the time. </p>
<p>I don't know how much these preferences might have changed over time, but the more they change, the weaker the selection pressure would be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting viewpoint on which types of people maintain a stocky build.  I visited Spain and Southern Italy, and because I have slightly broad shoulders (I have largely Slavic forbears) I could not buy a jacket there unless it was XX large.  And I'm not overweight either.</p></div>		</li>
