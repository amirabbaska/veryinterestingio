			<div class="markdown"><p>It was widely accepted, although technically not proven. Plato (200 years before Eratosthenes) knew the Earth was round, just because that was the general opinion at the time (&quot;If you could fly above the clouds, the Earth would resemble a ball&quot;). Pythagoras, Aristotle, Achimedes (&quot;Liquid at rest is part of a sphere with the centre of the Earth as its centre) all thought the Earth was round.</p></div>		</li>
