			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is the reason I think it's so odd that anti-vaxxers have picked, well, vaccines as their target. They tend to not want to put chemicals in the body and are in favour of things being &quot;natural.&quot; But vaccinations are actually the most natural way of dealing with pathogens that we have. </p>
<p>Vaccines literally only work because they use your natural immune system to do all the work! We have two ways to deal with flu: the flu vaccination, and tamiflu. If you get the flu vaccine, your immune system is what fights off the flu virus. If you don't and you have to get tamiflu, it's a drug that fights off the flu virus.  It seems that if you want to survive the flu in the most natural manner, the vaccine is what you'd go for. </p>
<p>Weird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. Sadly a lot of people forget about the immunocompromised whether it be due to a disorder, medications or even pregnancy. I'm on heavy immunosuppressants and work in healthcare so I fear one day I'll eventually catch something because of anti-vaccinators. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why antivaxers are so ridiculously selfish. They cause a gateway of risk to people whose choice was made for them by fate. </p></div>		</li>
