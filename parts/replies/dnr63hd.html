			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is part of why a properly insulated house is really a necessity.  If your walls are 5-10 degrees hotter than your air in the summer, the thermal energy they radiate is going to offset the feeling of the cool air.  In the winter, if your walls are 5-10 degrees cooler, they will absorb more of the thermal energy -you- radiate, instead of reflecting it back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. I think well-insulated houses suck because they can't cool down at night when it's warm during the day! Terrible for sleep</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most houses are literally designed with the ability to poke gaping temporary holes in the insulation...windows. If you didn't have insulation you're house would just be the same temperature as outside :b...including all the times you don't want it to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it depends on climate, but I find in hot weather in the UK our well-insulated house gets less hot to start with so is much easier to cool with open windows in the evening</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually backwards logic, if your home was properly insulated and ventilated then it would not heat up during the day. Opening your windows at night and allowing your home to cool down is an active approach to cooling but the need to do this implies a poorly designed building envelope. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in the high desert, and radiant heat from the sun is a way bigger factor in how warm we feel outside than air temperature. Thanks for the explanation</p></div>		</li>

<p>Convection and conduction both transfer heat linearly with changes in temperature, but radiation’s heat transfer is to the fourth power of temperature.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With convection and conduction when you have twice the difference in temp you get twice the heat transfer. With radiation when you have twice the temp difference you get 16 times the heat transfer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Convection = aT, conduction = aT, radiation =aT^4 </p>
<p>where a is some constant. If the temperate goes from 1 to 2, convection and conduction double, while radiation is 16 times larger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Net radiation is [Th ^ 4-Tc ^ 4]. Assuming both objects are black bodies then if your surroundings go from 75 to 80 and you are at 70 the heat transfer goes up by 2.2 times. Regardless radiation is not whats going on here. Its 100 percent dry vs humid air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Sidenote: It's linear wrt <em>absolute temperature</em>. So a 90°F vs 45°F is not a double in temperature, it's ~305/280 which is less than 10% different.</del> <em>sigh, algebra</em></p></div>		</li>
