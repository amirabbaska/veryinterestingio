			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's paint. IIRC from a documentary, he wore a patterned vest and sleeves for his tattoos. Close up shots would involve actual painting on the skin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though, notice how his tattoos were positioned perfectly so when he was wearing regular clothing with long sleeves, none of his tattoos were visible. </p>
<p>It was kind of hinted as &quot;for story reasons&quot;, but for production this means 90% of his shots had no tattoos visible. </p></div>		</li>
