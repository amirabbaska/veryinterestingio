			<div class="markdown"><p>Have to add. Took a 60's project out of mothballs in the 70's and suggested maybe a magnetic field or something. But if you just want to get ball lightning to bounce through the back door and walls of a company, low level fusion works perfectly. It bounces everywhere and goes right through the walls and bounces a few more times and gets absorbed by the ground. It makes for a lot of ufo reports at night from the locals.</p></div>		</li>
