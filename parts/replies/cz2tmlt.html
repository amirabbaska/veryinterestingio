			<div class="markdown"><p>Re-entry would kill, almost universally, due to gravity. But you also have to consider the fact that you are going from normal Earth into space, which is less stressing physically than Earth is. Then you have multiple generations of flies. The ones that come back down from the ISS would not be the same generation (by far) as the ones who went up. So you have flies coming down who have never ever been on Earth. Their systems would be specialized for zero-G. Get to Earth and their systems will no longer function right.</p>
<p>This is a simplistic explanation but it's what happened, in all likelihood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanaition. That makes sense.<br />
It's interesting to me that they can adapt fine to zero-G after living on Earth, but reversing the process wipes them out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I highly, highly doubt that there would be any significant level of evolution towards zero-G in 180 days...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering that he compared them to astronauts and it seems unlikely that the astronauts were having babies on the space station that seems unlikely. The heart is a muscle and it can grow and shrink depending on the workload just like any other muscle. Most likely their hearts decreased in size because they had to exert less force to pump the blood around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fruit flies only live something like 50 days. If it was a 180 day experiment, then that's the 4th generation coming back to earth. Evolve may well be an appropriate word, especially since I can imagine the selection pressure to be very high for flies that handle themselves well in zero-G.</p></div>		</li>
