			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. It keeps players from being whiny bitches and taking cheap shots with the various weapons at their disposal because things aren't going their way. In hockey, there is a lot of opportunity to rock someone's fucking world, but if it can be perceived as dirty, you're going to have to drop the mitts and dance with a big fella, so it better be fucking worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, many players (and coaches, refs, etc.) believe that fighting reduces injuries by holding players accountable for dirty, injury-causing type hits. No idea if this is actually the case or how we'd even study that though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. But then a goon from &quot;the other team&quot;, referenced in your scenario, will take a run at one of the higher value skill players on the team of the player that took the dive. Goon gets a penalty and maybe tossed, but could knock a much more valuable player out of the comeptition. It's economic game theory in practice. </p></div>		</li>
