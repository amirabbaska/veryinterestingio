			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I don't get...  If an animal is already at a foster home.  Wouldn't it be more likely to be adopted?  An animal in a foster home tells me several good things about the pet.</p>
<p>1.) It is well taken care of.
2.) Less behavior issues
3.) Doesn't destroy furniture</p>
<p>Are my assumptions correct?  Maybe foster homes are just very tolerant of some problems so the above three may not be correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every shelter operates differently. The one I foster for which also serves as city &quot;pound&quot;, puts animals on the foster list for several reasons. The animal is sick or injured and needs a quiet place to recuperate. The animal is too young to be spayed / neutered,  these are the ones I  usually foster. And the last reason us what they call &quot;behavior observed&quot; which means they are semi-feral or perhaps acting aggressive out of fear.  They do not advertise animals that are in foster care. Once the animal is well or old enough it is returned to the shelter, then put up for adoption.
I hate taking them back so I started posting them on my local subreddit. I've been really lucky to find homes for the last 15 kittens I've fostered. The adoption still goes through the shelter. I just give people a heads up so to speak so they have first dibs on adopting.</p>
<p>You are correct in the sense that fostered animals are usually better behaved. The shelter environment is loud and chaotic. Animals are stressed and fearful. It takes time for them to settle in to a home environment.
I encourage everyone to foster. Not only does it make for a better pet. It also makes more room at the shelter,  hence less euthanized animals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question regarding fostering.  Is it normal that the foster home has a pet already and then they decide to foster one from the shelter?  Are there any problems with that?  My biggest concern is regarding separating the foster one from the home pet later because it gets adopted or goes back to the shelter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to destroying furniture... I've found that if you provide enough things that a cat <em>can</em> scratch, they will leave your furniture alone. It's a scent marker for them. I have 3 cat trees with scratching posts built in as well as the cardboard ones. Some cats prefer horizontal scratchers, some prefer vertical.  With the foster kittens, they don't start trying to sharpen their claws until they are about 4 weeks old. They learn by watching my older cats. And if I see them trying to scratch the furniture I just say No! and take them over to an acceptable scratching area. They pick it up pretty fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup I learned that already.  I have 3 cat scratchers and a big cat tree.  Mine is 1.5 years old.  So all the bad habits are trained out of her.   </p></div>		</li>
