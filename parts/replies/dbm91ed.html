			<div class="markdown"><p>Best response here. A photon sized pinhole means nothing without the wavelength which would determine the size. Also aiming it into such a small opening would itself be a challenge as you cannot know precisely the path it will take, and if it is perfectly the size of the wavelength that would be the conundrum and nothing would be able to get through. Not to mention atoms are so much larger (depending on wavelength size), you couldn't build a spherical hole that size, it would at best be hexagonal, or through a carbon nanotube. This question is full of issues, but do to applied mathematics we can predict it would scatter with itself as the hole is impossible to make, and have a hexagonal diffraction at best, or the impossible hole made of an electromagnetic penning trap, would again, have the same effect depending on how many magnets are used... </p>
<p>Edit: depending on the van der walls volume for carbon (1.7 Angstroms) is 7239 eV or 1.168 Ã— 10-15 joule which is 0.00017002605237899355 nm </p>
<p>So an xRay laser, would make a fairly small diffraction pattern if shined through a carbon electron hole, if it happens to hit</p>
<p>Edit 2: if you're not observing it the whole time of course!... Also , let's say you have the LHC at your disposal, you might be able to guide a wavelength in the neutrino domain after a collision to be measured by the interactions and then you can even use the spaces in between the protons and neutrons (of the detector!) per the electroweak theory</p>
<p>Edit 3: found this interesting paper on landau levels in asymmetrical graphene sheet strain</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.00076.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.00076.pdf</a></p>
<p>Eventually the question turns into something else entirely ( the asymmetry of electrons to positrons in the universe as per this paper claims ) </p>
<p>I myself think this is more related to a hofstadters butterfly fractal because of the electron/chemical interactions, but hey</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a probability that <em>no</em> photons get through the aperture during some pulses from the laser? Or will there always be some pattern of resulting radiation on the other side?</p></div>		</li>
