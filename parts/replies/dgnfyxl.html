			<div class="markdown"><p>Well how did those people know in the first place that they can get away with way less sleep, and how can I? A lot of people view Donald Trump and Gordon Ramsy as crazy directly due to their sleep deprivation by the way. </p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that includes one of the most divisive leaders in US history, one of the most divisive leaders in UK history, and a man best known for hurling abuse at anything that moves. Hardly the best role models for Team No Sleep.</p>
<p>Elon Musk reportedly gets about 6 hours, which is short but not crazy short.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness to Ramsay, he's a pretty successful chef and a lot of it is played up for the cameras. The difference between his British show and American show was pretty big. And have you seen him when he does the kids version? A different bloke altogether.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alternatively, the woman who stood side by side to reagan to defeat the soviet union and win the cold war, one of the best and most successful chefs in history, and a political nobody who ran a mind-bogglingly masterful campaign to unseat 200+ billion dollars worth of political interests and steal the victory against all odds. Jim Cramer does just yell though.</p>
<p>Either way, my point was not originally political, but some people have such seething hatred for anyone who disagrees with them, they must make it so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have many friends who are teachers and frequently get 5 hours (or less) per night.
While they are able to function in their day-to-day tasks they have a number of problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are constantly fatigued - they can do their job but by lunchtime it's obvious fatigue is setting in and by the end of the day they are basically dragging their knuckles on the ground because they are so tired. </li>
<li>They can be more easily agitated/annoyed. </li>
<li>They forget things quite frequently and write down every little thing that they need to, even the simplest of things. </li>
</ol>
<p>Although, one or two of my teacher friends get about 5 hours sleep per night and appear fine with it. They keep really hydrated and active and at least come across as functioning normally. </p>
<p>I too would like the ability to sleep less and get things done but if I get less than 7 hours a night (or 6 or less frequently) then I struggle a bit the next day, eat more junk/bad foods and tend to be more irritable. Additionally, my performance in tasks isn't as good compared to if I had more sleep. </p>
<p>Just a little insight from another perspective :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good to know (:</p>
<p>Sleep is a mystery, like if they can do it with 5 hours and be able to teach, which also means being ready to answer any relevant challenging question asked by students, they would need their cognitive function to be at a fairly normal level. So why is it that for me, as a student, I should not do it? I see only a slight different when I am sleep deprived than when I am not.</p>
<p>Finally, how did you come up with the 6 or 7 hours thing, did you just use an application that tracks your sleep or is that when you wake up without an alarm(naturally)?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it definitely is haha. I would love to be able to get very little sleep and still function fully as if I had lots of it. </p>
<p>I thought that too about them but sometimes they have told me they gave an answer to a question that was never asked haha. But there are definitely some who it doesn't seem to have a negative impact on. </p>
<p>For me, I just experimented. I tried getting roughly 2 hours sleep per night (and was completely exhausted). I then gradually increased it by one hour per night to the point where I was sleeping as little as I could and also feeling quite good. </p>
<p>I can get by on 4/5 hours sleep once or twice a week if I can sleep more the other days of the week but I couldn't maintain it consistently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotel evidence which proves nothing. It is entirely possible for people to run on less then 4 hours sleep a day. For my last year of uni i have succesfully ran off 2.5 hours a day using a very regimented polyphasic sleep cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People here said that polyphasic sleep would not work on most people, so do you consider yourself one of those &quot;special gene&quot; people? I wish to learn polyphasic sleep for the obvious reasons of gaining more extra awake time, but am afraid of the health effect and productivity decrease. What do you think? Thank you!(:</p></div>		</li>
