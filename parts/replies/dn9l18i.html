			<div class="markdown"><p>You collect samples of fallout and determine their makeup, using these samples you can determine which facility made the device. Most of the fissile material in a bomb doesn't get a chance to react, as the bomb blows itself apart before that happens. You can't reduce the amount of material in the bomb, though, because the unstable isotopes provide neutrons that help keep the reaction going. Something interesting to note is that the reaction starts, and ends, before anyone actually sees anything at all.  So you have a lot of unreacted material laying around, albeit scattered all over the place, and you can do radioisotope analysis on that, as well as finding the reacted parts, since nuclear reactions form very specific isotopes themselves depending on what the composition of the fuel was.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for the response. I guess my question is, how easy is this material to find? It's not like it's just laying in a ball. It's all been vaporized and presumably spread over cubic miles. It's not as simple as just picking it up in a bucket. </p>
<p>You can tell fusion vs fission bomb by using a rock sample if you can get one, which presumably you could if it happened where OP asked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all super radioactive. You use radiation detectors to find it. While it is spread out, there will be a lot more near the center of the blast, and less farther out, so it's not as hard to find as you'd think, especially since all of it has a built in radio beacon (The radiation) calling to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You solve a rather complex set of coupled differential equations, with all the known quantities and processes of the bomb to work out the starting conditions, This might have been difficult in the past, but somewhat easy for modern supercomputers. This also why Livermore and Las Alamos have supercomputers as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockpile_stewardship" target="_blank">&quot;Stock Pile Stewardship&quot;</a>. Since we can't actual test anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a powerful laptop or desktop you can do those same calculations these days as long as you have the right software. No supercomputer needed! Though you might argue that high end desktop and laptop workstations are supercomputers in their own right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that you know what % what the sample was because you know what it is now. Enrichment standards differ. You could tell if your sample was originally 5% or 50% or 90% U 235 based on what you have now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also use that I formation to determine how efficent the enriching process was. From there you might be able to tell what type of a facility enriched it. Or what countries have that enriching ability.</p></div>		</li>
