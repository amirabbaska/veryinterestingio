			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems a bit limited for a large, capital ship with a large crew?</p>
<p>Is that just potable water, or also process water for things like boilers and steam turbines, or are those systems so well closed-loop they have negligible losses?</p>
<p>I'm trying to calculate all the water loads - you have obviously human consumption, and the demands for water from the galley for cooking and washing. I'm aware of 'navy showers' where you only get a splash of water to wet down and soap up, then another splash to rinse, but that's still probably a few gallons per person. I've heard the toilets all use seawater.</p>
<p>When we do Burning Man where you have to pack in 100% of your own water, the absolute minimum amount is about 2 gallons (~8L) per person per day, and that's not doing much bathing and assuming you're using fully prepared food in disposable containers and utensils. If you want to shower or wash dishes, the amount goes up significantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sorry, I forgot to say that is per unit, most ships have 2-8 units onboard (depending on size).
Also there is only 2 ships left in the US fleet that run on boilers, the rest of the ships run on gas turbines or reactors (and the reactors have their own special RO units). So the RO units are only used for potable water. </p>
<p>So the average sailor gets about 40 gallons a day of water, thats used between cooking, cleaning, showering, and to drink. </p>
<p>BTW saltwater toilets are limited to certain classes of ships due to the higher maintenance than fresh water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting... On the carriers especially, I would have thought using the cooling water from the reactors that was going to be pumped overboad anyway would be an efficient way to do things. Learn something new every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a dairy plant that uses an RO system is to pull the water from skim milk. Where it's located, in Wisconsin. There is no shortage of water. So we dump a couple hundred gallons a minute down the drain. Areas like California, with all the dairy production they have, could benefit from this. As the water is quite clean. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I've read about systems like that (also heat exchangers) where they use the water for irrigation or as drinking water for the cows. Very interesting! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Combine all that with the fact that residential usage in California is something like 2% of the total water consumption and you can see why there isn't a big push. People's lives aren't at risk in CA droughts, even in the last severe drought there wasn't a risk of people running out of drinking water except in places where the water table dropped and municipalities relied on well water. Instead business revenues in farming and industry are at risk, and those businesses aren't willing to pay the sky high costs for desal and long distance pumping.</p></div>		</li>
