			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this (one of the) the reason(s) anti-semitisim developed?  </p>
<p>People of other faiths got jealous of the Jewish people, inventing those stereotypes like &quot;the greedy Jew&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>I'm not justifying anti-semitisim! At all! It's disgusting to hate on a group for no reason.
I'm just trying to make sense of anti-semitisim, because it's so stupid, but also interesting, that one faith is so disliked by people of all other (major) faiths.</p>
<p>Edit:<br />
My wording may be a bit off, English isn't my first language. I'm definitely not suggesting that it would be in any way OK to hate on Jews! Just to clarify that. I'm just interested in the reasons why people are awful to each other. It's like a morbid fascination. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, there were a lot of jobs that Jews were not allowed to have back in the day. This fact, combined with the fact that many Jews were literate and/or somewhat educated, made it popular for Jews to work as tax collectors and such.  </p>
<p>It was a self-perpetuating cycle by that point. Again I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure there are many more religious laws instructing Jews on how to be farmers than on how to be bankers/accountants/taxmen.  </p>

<p>That's a pretty strange way to phrase things. Antisemitism <em>is</em> an interesting social phenomenon, but I rather doubt it's ever been about the actual faith. It's probably got more to do with the fact that Jews had their own secluded communities and were perpetually outsiders -- and small communities can easily turn the outsider into a scapegoat whenever it is convenient. This account is really just my personal understanding -- but I'm sure if you went to /r/AskHistorians you would be able to find a good account of historic and/or semi-recent antisemitism, or at least be recommended some good literature on the subject.<br />
Also, historically I don't believe there were any problems at all between Jews and Muslims -- to my understanding Islam considers Jews to be 'brothers' (figuratively of course), and Judaism was never concerned with what religions non-Jews followed since people aren't 'supposed' to convert to Judaism anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anti-semitism goes back to antiquity. One Jewish  practice that baffled Roman and Greek writers is that they would rest on 7th day. Christianity didn't help with explicit proclamations that Jews are to blame for Christ's death in the gospels. That's a main reason why Jews were expelled from France and England at that time. I do not condone any of it, but find a history of it fascinating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muslim from Bahrain here. Although it's forbidden by Islamic law, most banks charge interest on loans whether it's for buying a house, a car, or just a cash loan.   On the other hand there are banks that follow Islamic rules and it's called Islamic finance. The way they go about in giving loans is that you specify what is it that you want the loan for, let's say it's a car that costs X dollars. They'll buy the car for you and sell it to you for X + interest = Y amount but of course you'll pay back by instalments on a monthly basis. In that way the bank owns the car but you're BUYING it from them over an X period of time. The difference is in the name of the transaction. It's not a loan anymore but it's a selling and buying transaction. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an episode of Planet Money about that exactly. </p>
<p>If I recall correctly you tell the bank the house you want, the bank pays for the house upfront and then they sell it to you for a higher price. They don’t breakdown the interest in the monthly payments so to your eyes they aren’t charging you any interest.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also varying degrees of what constitutes usury within islamic finance.</p>
<p>For example, some authorities consider it acceptable to charge an upfront fee for the lending of money - so if a $1,000,000 loan would earn me $200,000 over the repayment period at market interest rates, I loan you $1,200,000, with a $200,000 upfront financing fee taken out of the principal. You walk away from my bank with $1,000,000 and pay back $1,200,000. </p>
<p>That's effectively identical to borrowing $1,000,000 and paying $200,000 in interest, but because its not actually &quot;interest&quot; the authorities think it's okay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also other, more complex islamic finance agreements for financing generally, but typically it is structured in something similar to a sale and buyback (over installments) with an underlying asset or class of assets (but not prohibited assets eg. A pig farm).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Co-buying a house is practically the same as charging interest in everything but name. After all, the entity that sold you the house needs to have some gain from the transaction. Doing things in an Islamic manner is sadly just another profitable business: Halal food, halal school, halal mortgage, etc.</p></div>		</li>
