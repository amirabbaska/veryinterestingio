<p>1) they're cheaply made </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is most of the answer.</p>
<p>Lots of modern devices use brushless motors, or induction motors, which are very much quieter. Brushed motors are cheap, small, and powerful, but the switching action of the commutator means you have magnetic fields changing very rapidly, which makes a lot of banging. Run a brushed &quot;universal&quot; motor off load, and just doing nothing they're very loud.</p>
<p>EDIT. Should make clear there's a big difference between DC brushless motors and AC induction motors. Induction motors are generally very quiet, but to get plenty of torque they're bulky and heavy, which is why you don't often see them in anything you'll have to lift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brushed motors have a torque response suited to these types of applications (100% torque when stalled) and stupidly simple construction and they can run at very high speeds. Speed control via a rather basic TRIAC is also easily accomplished.</p>
<p>Single phase induction motors are quiet but have very poor stall torque, making them only suitable for stuff like fans and pumps. They're also locked onto the AC frequency.</p>
<p>Brushless DC motors combine the best of both worlds but they need electronics to work which means more $$$.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most still use brushed motors. That's one of the reasons vacuum cleaners, hedge-trimmers, lawn mowers etc are all still so noisy.</p>
<p>One of Dyson's cleaners uses a brushless motor and it's very much quieter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because a blender (like a vacuum cleaner etc) is a &quot;Use it for a few minutes in the middle of the day&quot; device. You don't leave a blender running while you try to sleep or watch TV like you might with a dishwasher or washing machine: you blast it for 30 seconds a couple of times, then turn it off.</p>
<p>There's no real <strong>need</strong> to make it quieter, so why put the extra cost onto making the product?</p>
<p>I'd also note that some more modern blenders aimed at the &quot;fitness&quot; market <em>are</em> quieter, because they're going for a &quot;premium&quot; feel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anyone wants to know more, brushless motors are still switched. But they are switched by a dedicated motor controller chip instead of by a physical mechanism. The motor controllers carefully regulate the current going to the motor so that when it's time to switch over to a different winding, winding A is gradually turned off while winding B is gradually turned on.</p>
<p>This more gentle switching causes less vibration, and less vibration means less noise. It also has another interesting benefit - it allows you to very precisely control the speed of the motor. Go to RC meetups and ask people what kind of motor is best for your off roader/qaudcopter/R2D2 and there will be a LOT of people in favor of brushless motors for that reason alone.</p>
<p>The same principle can be seen with stepper motors - a type of brushless motor that I am particularly fond of. Stepper motors can be controlled in many types of commutation patterns. Full stepping, for example, is basically just on or off - and it generates a lot of vibration. But you can get very cheap controllers that transition between on or off with 256 or more intervals of regulated current. The result is very close to an ideal sine wave, and the motor runs smoothly and quietly.</p>
<p>Brushless motors also last much longer because the brushes in brushed motors eventually wear out. And now you know way more than you need to know about motors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Brushed motors are usually larger for a given power output. Both brushed and brushless motors commutate, the difference is if it's done electronically or mechanically. You see brushless motors in all sorts of weight critical applications. The recent explosion of electric RC aircraft like quadcopters has been in part due to the drop in price of the speed controls for these motors. The other part has been lithium batteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the reason they are loud, sure, but not why they are still so stupidly loud, surely the technology exists for a much quieter option at not too much of a higher price?  On TV cooking programs for example I expect they use top of the line blenders but you still can't hear anything over the noise of the blender. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know that the technology really does exist. If you put enough acoustic shielding around a motor that spins that fast the blender would be the size of your stove. A blender motor is basically The type of motor you'd find in an angle grinder. </p>
<p>We have a moderately high end blender that cost around $300 and it will still wake up the whole house if you use it first thing in the morning to make a smoothie, not to mention the fact that any time you use it to chop anything solid it's going to make a tremendous amount of noise anyway so the noise coming from the motor is it really that big of a deal. </p>
<p>In its defense though I swear I could go buy a half pound of wheat or barley and turn it in to flower in that thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it has to do with a consumer's expectations too. If I recall a vacuum cleaner that makes slightly more noise is perceived to be stronger that an equivalent suction that makes less noise. That is unless you are specifically buying a vacuum cleaner that is low noise like a miehle.</p>
<p>People expect a loud blender to a degree and if they hear a quiet one they will assume its not as powerful. </p>
<p>Also I have a blendtec, its rather quiet when you spin the motor with nothing in it, its like model airplanes, if you spin the motor without the propellers its really quiet, once you put something to push air it makes the noise.</p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>The real reason its so loud?  It's going 28,000 RPMS.</strong><br />
Nothing engineered on earth stays whisper quiet while spinning that fast, even at half that speed, not without engineering some kind of considerable noise dampening around the device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the motor of an electric car isn't going anywhere near those numbers, instead of psycho rpm's, the engines in electric cars have crazy torque.  Electric car motors probably operate between 2000-4000 rpm on the highway, 12x-7x slower than the high end blenders.  If you got a car motor to hit 28,000 rpm, it wouldn't be quiet, it would sound like a jet getting ready to take off, right before it exploded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay... might be a stupid question, but is there an actual reason it has to go so insanely fast? I mean most are used for cutting up things that aren't that that hard in the first place. Wouldn't it be trivial to make one that works at say, 10000 to 15000 at the cost of taking more time to use? Or to just have a &quot;quiet&quot; option that does the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Go take a $99 Walmart blender and shove celery stalks &amp; kale in it.  Turn it on full blast, but keep your receipt because you're about to return it.                </p>
<p>Try to drink it.  You can't, it still needs chewed because instead of actually liquefying a stringy item like celery, it just minces it into tiny pieces like a fine chunky minced salsa, you need a spoon.  The high rpm blenders like vitamix and blendtec spin so fast they can actually liquify those items, you can slurp the results back without detecting a single chunk slide over your tongue.  I can toss a can of dry peanuts into it, it literally spins it into liquid peanut butter.  This is valueable to someone like me because I hate eating veggies, but every morning I can liquify some kale, cucumber and spinach and drink it quickly.  <strong>I didn't want to spend so godamn much money on a blender</strong>  I started with a $120 ninja and had to return it because if you actually want to <strong>drink</strong> vegetables, you gotta step up to the high rpm ones, and if you're going to step up to those, you may as well get one thats built to last.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Model S can go ~14k but is fix geared 9.73:1, giving more torque. But they also have loads of space for noise isolation, and it's a $70K car, not a blender with limited space and it's directly in front of you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They probably <em>can</em> technically hit 10k, but take my car for example.  The meter technically reaches 8500 rpms, but actual operation at 65mph down the highway?  2700.  If you took any 70k electric car to its 10,000 rpm peak, it's not going to be a silent ride at that speed, you're going to hear that thing roaring, probably enough to scare you into slowing down.             </p>
<p>Go grab a dremel tool that spins 30,000 rpms.  Take it to 10,000, note the decibels, not too bad, bump it up in 5,000 rpm increments, note how the volume keeps doubling every 10,000 more in you increase.  A 28,000 rpm blender will sound like a jet engine compared to a blender spinning 10k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amusingly, a vitamix has about a 2 horsepower motor, if you convert that to watts, it's about 1500, your typical 16 amp household circuit can crank out about 1800 watts.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most household breakers in the US are 15 amps, not 16. They usually run at 120V which gives you 1800w and it accounts for sag during peak times which may limit you closer to 1500w. </p>
<p>Many homes also run 20 amps circuits. Mine for example, as when I designed my home I anticipated higher peak loads. Plus the bigger wires afford less sag from big appliances and increase the lifespan of those motors. </p>
<p>If you have a vitamix, putting it on a 20 amp circuit with appropriately sized wires is better for the motor long term. Because lower sag voltages will heat up the motor more leading to premature failure. </p></div>		</li>
