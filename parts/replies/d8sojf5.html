			<div class="markdown"><p>First, thanks a lot for the response. I have a few more questions:</p>
<p>So everything hinges on the input and it's randomness. Do you think there is opportunity for better inputs in the universe?</p>
<p>If so, where do you think we would find those? </p>
<p>How integral are fair and random numbers in today's world?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Define better inputs? And the problem is that math doesn't really like random numbers. Nature doesn't like random numbers. Random doesn't really exist anywhere in the universe. If you go deep enough, you can always determine the outcome of something. So the closest we can get to a randomly generated number would be to add so many layers that it resembles a random number because we don't care to figure it out.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Wow I can't believe this got gilded! Thank you! And before I get one more cotton picking comment saying that I don't know the word random, or qm is random, or I'm just a fucking failure in life, etc, i just wanna point out I'm a computing guy, not a qm guy. I'm actually a 12th grade guy too. A 17 year old one to be exact. But thank you to anyone that provided actual intelligent conversation!</p>
<p>Edit 2: I deeply apologize for making a comment about something I don't know everything about. I commented what my current understanding was, I didn't mean for anyone to take my word as absolute fact. I over exaggerated when I said random numbers exist nowhere in the universe. I meant more mathematically in terms of things your computer in front of you can do. I'm no longer replying or paying any mind to any comment saying &quot;you're simply wrong, radioactive decay is truly random.&quot; Or &quot;You shouldn't comment when you don't know what you're talking about&quot;. At this point, you're saying that for you're own benefit, I woke up to 89 comments saying the same thing, other people have beaten you to the punch. So to satisfy those people, I suggest you ignore anything you read in my comment and I'm sorry my comment got gilded.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not true. The outcome of certain quantum mechanical measurements is completely random, which is exactly why such systems are used to generate random numbers for cryptography.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your edit is really sad. People responded to you almost entirely politely, explaining why you were wrong. They weren't being pedantic -- the entire <em>point</em> of your comment is telling people that randomness does not exist in the universe, which at best is not supported by any evidence whatsoever, and at worst is completely contrary to the currently accepted physical theory (Copenhagen interpretation of QM).</p>
<p>Instead of gracefully editing your post to include this information and correct the highly-upvoted misinformation that you spread, you edited your post to complain that people had the audacity to correct you, and you wailed about how you're young so you shouldn't be expected to actually know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>It's OK to be wrong. It's not OK be wrong but be mad that others pointed out you were wrong and act like you were <em>right</em> for being wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern operating systems actually collect randomness (aka entropy) to provide applications with a source of good unpredictable random numbers if they need something better than the current time. The sources of entropy are varied, but I believe they include things like low level data about user input (mouse movement, time between key presses), and electronic chatter from devices. Any one of the sources may not be particularly random, but they are all at least a little unpredictable, and when the OS combines them all together it gets a source of pretty good entropy. However, that source is small, so the numbers taken from it are generally not used directly, but instead as the seed to a random number generator.</p>
<p>As far as how integral random numbers are, the answer is very. Random numbers are at the core of modern encryption. Encryption protocols often involve picking something randomly. If the random number generator used is too predictable, then an attacker may be able to use that weakness to figure out what the secret being picked is, and break the encryption that way.</p>
<p>A number of other algorithms also incorporate random numbers, but for non-security focused algorithms the quality of the random number may not be very important.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Didn't the NSA get some hardware RNGs to do exactly that ? Weaken the randomness so it still looks random, but the NSA can brute force it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the guy you asked, but I can say that common practice can use anything and everything from variations in cosmic microwave background radiation to the air pollution index in a random city in China.  </p>
<p>As far as &quot;better inputs&quot; I would counter that idea with &quot;what input isn't good?&quot;  Usually the important thing about &quot;randomness&quot; is that you don't want to be able to predict where the number came from.  Don't limit all of the world's computers to getting randomness from the same source, get them from different sources and increase the &quot;randomness!&quot;</p>
<p>The question of fairness of today's random number generation is a topic of hot debate that basically boils down to who you ask and is a large topic (see cryptography) The TLDR is any system is hypothetically crackable given enough time, you just try to make it so hard that the effort needed makes the reward of doing so not worth it.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I looked into Bitcoin a while back. My first thought was &quot;Why spend all this effort trying to mine coins when there are so many sitting in abandoned/lost wallets? The private key is only 51 characters, that's not very long at all. I can generate millions of wallets per hour on my fairly standard PC. Why not just record every possible address, sort them by public address, and compare them against the blockchain to find wallets with an active balance? </p>
<p>I got interested enough to play, and looked at the storage requirements and processing time required to &quot;brute force&quot; bitcoin. Then I decided to play Minecraft instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so the practical endgame really is not finding a true &quot;random number&quot;, rather it's finding an un-guessable algorithm with an untraceable seed--or the least guessable combination of both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All modern microprocessors or their companion chipsets have a device that interacts with the outside world in some way to get a seed from which a truly random number is generated.  Without this hardware we can also get nearly truly random numbers by starting multiple processes and threads that generate load and then time the rendezvous at a point in which they communicate with each other, combined with system time, system load, temperature of CPU/chipset/power supply.  On mobile devices we have, along with the hardware RNG, more sources of nondeterministic data like motion, barometric pressure, GPS drift, and the list goes on.  We can also read from uninitialized memory which is pretty nondeterministic.</p>
<p>On Debian systems like Ubuntu there was a serious but simple error in their port of OpenSSL that produced predictable keys because the software random number generator used uninitialized memory as part of the seed.  Well, someone in the Debian project ran a code analyzer that flagged reading from uninitialized memory as a problem and patched the code to clear the memory before it was read. In this case it was a false problem but it took a while before this was found and corrected.  If I recall correctly, if you knew the time and date you could guess any key you wanted.</p>
<p>All such guessable keys were generated and published in the openssl- and openssh-blacklist and blacklist-extras packages just in case you happen to accidentally use one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem for environmentally sourced randomness is usually speed. </p>
<p>If you need a good amount of random numbers they often acceed the capability of your hardware to provide, forcing you to throttle down or except a pseudorandom input. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More than that, the Debian issue was that they accidentally removed other sources of entropy while removing the use of uninitialised memory. They didn't clear memory, they commented out the function call that added entropy to the pool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like no one explained that true RNGs have been present on computers for a while. Every Intel architecture after Sandy Bridge includes a special on-die hardware RNG based on thermal noise in a small gate. This forms the basis of the RdRand instruction. AMD has a similar implementation in their Zen based architectures coming soon(tm).</p>
<p>Many people had a panic because some information linked this instruction to an NSA backdoor, but I don't know the proper details so I'll leave that alone.</p></div>		</li>
