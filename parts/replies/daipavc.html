			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that really only the case when dealing with different forms of braking radiation? In that case would the lack of quantized energy be do to the fact that (to our knowledge) space itself (and thus position and momentum) are not quantized.</p>
<p>Given the fact that General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics don't play nice together, at least in the math, could that mean that space is quantized, just on a level that we still have no instruments to detect, leading to the detection of continuous energy levels?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quantized energy does not correlate to a quantized space directly.</p>
<p>For example if you take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator" target="_blank">quantum mechanical oszillator</a>, a prominent and very important example, the math is transferred to many other problems. There you have a quantized energy, but not a quantized space (you have a uncentanty on the space though).</p>
<p>I've got no problem in mind where you get from your calculation, that space is quantized (I hope someone will throw one in and correct me). But an example where you work with a quantized space is when you are looking at crystals. A very simplified model to describe it (but still useful as it is even analytically solvable for some cases for example) is the tight binding approximation. There you describe the crystal using an approximation where the electrons are very stongly bounded to the atoms. So you say that the electrons can only be at discrete positions, but can hop a certain distance (e.g. to their next neighbor atoms). Using this you then can calculate the energy eigenvalues. For a 1d chain of atoms you get for example a cosine dispersion relation (the dispersion relation describes what the energy of an electron in this case is when it has a certain momentum or wavevector k, which is p/hbar where p is the momentum). For an infinite number of atoms (if this would be possible) there would be a continous energy distribution, but the discrete allowed positions for the electron would be unchanged.</p>
<p>Regarding the quantization of the space I cannot say anything but if I'm not overlooking something (please correct me, if I'm wrong), the quantization of the energy has in general nothing to do with a quantization of space.</p></div>		</li>
