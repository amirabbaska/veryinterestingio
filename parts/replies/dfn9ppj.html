			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Your ISP would just see an encrypted connection to the VPN server.  Conversely, the VPN server's ISP will then see a fuckload of random traffic from everyone using that same VPN</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Potentially you could leak anything that still has an active connection, so websites you still have open, email clients etc.  </p>
<p>There's an app called TripMode that you can use to block all apps from internet access, then you can just enable your browser.  This gives you control as to what has access while on VPN or not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course companies are still bound by laws prohibiting then from making false promises, so if you go with a VPN (or ISP) that explicitly says they won't do something then they are legally bound to not do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except a similar law was passed in Europe where VPN's with servers located there are required to show data on call to the government. So if the US and Europe did this, the servers will simply have to be located in a country that isn't under those governing laws. Then you will still be able to connect and not be tracked. Private Internet Access is probably <em>the</em> best VPN provider as of now. </p></div>		</li>
