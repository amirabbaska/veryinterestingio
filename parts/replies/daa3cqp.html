			<div class="markdown"><p>pretty much, all the upgrades plus the fact that more users using it all the time and the wifi + mobile net  eats the battery a lot on top of the screen.
My Galaxy S6 last for 6 days between charges but I don't use mobile internet, wifi very,very rarely,maybe 1 time a week for a little bit, don't game on it. I only talk on it around 30 mintures per day. So it really lasts long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically. If you buy a cheap feature phone that can only do texts and calls, it'll easily last several weeks.</p>
<p>If you disable as much as you can on your smartphone and only use it as a feature phone, it might also last a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While a week is stretching it a bit, I have indeed used my smart phone as a dumb phone and it easily lasted me about 4 days (granted, I didn't make or receive many calls during that time). Turned off all transmitting and internet functions, screen was off most of the time.</p></div>		</li>
