			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true at all, yet here are 2,800 upvotes.</p>
<p>Three sources:</p>
<p>Some English-speakers stereotype the French as permissive about
anything risqu√©. This was particularly true a hundred years ago when
the phrase took off as an &quot;apology&quot; for swearing. &quot;Excuse my French&quot;
or &quot;Pardon my French&quot; isn't just play-acting that you're speaking a
foreign language. It's also a bit like saying, &quot;I know those words are
naughty - but maybe I could get away with behaving like that in
France, where people are more tolerant of obscenity.&quot;</p>
<p>What is the origin of the phrase pardon my French?</p>
<p>This phrase, in which French refers to &quot;bad language&quot;, is employed
when the speaker feels compelled to use an obscenity despite having
listeners who might be offended.  It's a late 19th century euphemism
which first appeared in Harper's Magazine in 1895.</p>
<p>It is thought that the term French is employed in this sense as it
already had a history of association with things considered vulgar.
As far back as the early 16th century, French pox and the French
disease were synonyms for genital herpes, and French-sick was another
term for syphillis.  The OED [Oxford English Dictionary] also equates
the adjective French with &quot;spiciness&quot;, as in French letter for
&quot;condom&quot;, French kiss (1923) and French (i. e. &quot;sexually explicit&quot;)
novels (from 1749).</p>
<p>Why does someone who swears &quot;apologize&quot; by saying, &quot;Pardon my French?&quot;</p>
<p>This phrase is simply another of the many American and English
expressions that equate anything French with sex and obscenity. French
postcards, French novels and French kissing connote the risque.
&quot;Pardon my French&quot; started circulating on both sides of the Atlantic
around 1916, and almost certainly stems from the World War I escapades
of American and British soldier</p>
<p>French were considered rude / risque. That stereotype has lasted to this day. So swearing was a &quot;french&quot; thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>French was, quite literally, the Lingua Franca throughout Europe after the reign of Louis XIV... that's where the term Lingua Franca comes from. It was spoken in every court, from Paris to London to Vienna to St Petersburg. So while they might have picked up that particular joke from English, there's also a similar cultural origin to make it relevant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is factually incorrect. Lingua Franca originally referred to a common language used in the Mediterranean, often by traders. It included words borrowed from a number of languages, but was mostly Italian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably stems from the fact that French was actually the official language of Russia's royalty - Russian was considered the commoner's language. It was the same way in many European monarchies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People all over Europe did this. French was the international lingua franca before English. Kinda like how now, in non-English speaking countries, people use English words and expressions in their speech to show how hip and internationally oriented they are.</p>
<p>(I'm partly joking, I'm guilty of this too. It just happens sometimes)</p></div>		</li>
