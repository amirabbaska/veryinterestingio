			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer.</p>
<p>One note is that Turks entered modern Turkey <em>long</em> after there was any notion of an Ionian tribe. Turkish very likely got the name from Persians who did have early contact with Ionian Greeks.</p>
<p>Interesting aside: during the Ottoman Empire, it was much more common for Turks to refer to Greeks as Rum, since when they met them, they were still the Roman Empire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh the Greeks are also a good example they don't call themselves Greeks or their country Greece. They are Hellenes,but just like Germany their names are derived from a particular group of people that the western world came in contact with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Etymologists think this comes from the word nemy, or “mute,” and that the ancient Slavs called the neighboring Germanic tribes mutes because they couldn’t understand their language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This theory is underscored by the term &quot;slovo&quot; (from which the name Slav is derived) means &quot;word&quot; (or &quot;letter&quot;) in most Slavic languages. Slavs are the &quot;people with words,&quot; while the Germans were &quot;mutes.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
