			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not exactly.  It depends on the availability of other heating methods.  For example, if a heat pump is available (i.e. a modern HVAC system) then it can heat a building using 50% less electricity than Bitcoin mining.  This is because Bitcoin mining produces <em>new</em> heat whereas the pump just moves it from one location to another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At my office even when the outside temps are in the 40's (farenheit) the AC is still running to keep the temps at 72 degrees.  Figure 700w per person, 100w per monitor, we each have two, and an average running load of 600w per computer (3d design work, dual CPUs, GTX 1050s etc...).  That's not insignificant.</p></div>		</li>
