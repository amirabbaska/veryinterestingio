			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question, and I would say that there is mutual inspiration such that neuroscience research, particularly into the function of large neuronal ensembles but also brain-machine interface and other applications, is inspired by machine learning, and that machine learning is inspired by neuroscience. Neuronal ensembles have evolved to make extremely rapid and precise computations, so understanding how that occurs can inspire next generation computing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd also be interested to hear more about potential/ongoing research that takes advantage of computational approaches. </p></div>		</li>
