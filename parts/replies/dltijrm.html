			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that the difference between chugging and sipping has to do with what the kidneys actually need to process waste. An excess of water is just passed through with electrolytes (because we effectively cannot store extra), which is the reason we need to drink at regular intervals whether we &quot;chug or sip&quot;. You can't drink your whole 3 liters at once every day, but that's kind of an extreme anyway.</p></div>		</li>
