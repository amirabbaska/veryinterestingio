			<div class="markdown"><p>I work from home. My sleep hygiene is such a fucking mess that every time I try to use an app to track my sleep I stop because looking at a week of shitty sleep sucks, or because I just don't remember when I go to bed.</p>
<p>I swear my cycles seem to &quot;move&quot;, getting sleepy later and later until I'm falling asleep at 6am and sleeping 5 hours. At that point I go for an all-nighter to &quot;reset&quot; myself, wake up somewhat earlier the next few days, trying to get direct sunlight for at least 15m each morning, etc. </p>
<p>Until the cycle begins to &quot;lag&quot; again. </p>
<p>Full disclosure: I'm on Xanax and Zoloft for anxiety and depression. I don't, and will never, abuse Xanax to go sleep, don't want to go through that path. I don't exercise because I'm lazy as fuck, but I do move quite a bit and have a standing desk. I feel my diet is adequate, and I'm not overweight, just skinny-fat (which isn't 100% healthy but isn't that bad I think).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the conflicting feeling of not wanting to get up but knowing you need to is the 'wake up' chemicals and 'sleep'  chemicals 'fighting' (reacting.) When you hit the snooze button and go back to sleep, your 'wake up' chemicals lose that 'fight', but you just used some of your daily wake up chemicals that are now 'dead.' So when you actually do wake up, you feel real groggy.</p></div>		</li>
