			<div class="markdown"><p>I answered this question a few months ago so I'll shamelessly tack this on to the top comment.</p>
<p>For a simply toy model, everything is made of atoms, so atoms are
the densest thing that there is (barring white dwarfs and neutron stars, etc). Think of a block of gold- if you cut that gold block in half both halves will have the same density as the original bloc. If you continue the halving process until you only have one atom, then that atom should, by induction, have the same density as the matter you started with.</p>
<p>A galaxy (or universe) on the other hand, is not solid like a brick. It is mostly vacuum. Asking what's denser: an atom or a universe, is like asking what's denser: a single brick, or all the bricks in the neighborhood? Obviously the lone brick will be denser because when you try to find the density of the bricks in the neighbohood, even though some are clustered into houses, you have to consider all of the space in between them when calculating the volume they occupy, which is going to drive your density way down. </p>
<p>Don't mind me though, OP gave a solid answer, and other commenters have already debunked the &quot;atoms are mostly empty space&quot; misconception, so I won't bore anyone with that here. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: sspelling</p>
<p>Edit 2:  There are things that exist in the universe that are not atoms and are much more dense than atoms, but for simplicity, we are operating under the assumption (not fact) that /u/VeryLittle gave that &quot;everything is made of atoms.&quot;  </p>
<p>But let's say we do include black holes in this.  As far as I know, black holes have infinite mass, and the universe has infinite volume.  The question we then have to answer is, is the universe bigger than a black hole is massive?  I have no idea how to answer this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with you there, you definitely said it better than I was going to. Moreover, the volumes of atoms can overlap each other. Therefore it is possible to have two atoms with a higher density than one.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I thought the point was that an atom has <em>higher</em> density than the material it comprises.  They are putting an upper bound on the density.  As long as atoms can't 'overlap', then anything made out of atoms must be less dense than the atoms themselves, right?</p>
<p>As for whether atoms can 'overlap', that completely depends on what you mean when you say an atom's size.  You can define it as a bond-length (e.g. C-C bond), in which case you can have some volume overlap in compounds with shorter bonds (e.g. C=C bonds).  But if you say the size is the expected radius of an electron in the 1s orbital, you aren't going to find any atoms packed closer than this distance (i.e. no overlap) except in funky situations like neutron stars and black holes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tempted to make a 'yo momma' joke. Phew! Narrowly avoided that one...</p>
<p>On topic; The boundaries are fuzzy between quarks and we're not really sure if they are point-like. Additional to this confusion is the situation where virtual quarks and anti-quarks are continuously being created and annihilated inside.</p>
<p>There are situations where we can certainly agree that something is not empty. Neutron stars have overall densities of 3.7×10^17 to 5.9×10^17 kg/m3 (2.6×10^14 to 4.1×10^14 times the density of the Sun), which is comparable to the approximate density of an atomic nucleus of 3×10^17 kg/m3. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star" target="_blank">Source</a> ... So essentially a neutron star is as dense as solid atomic nucleus (without the fuzzy cloud of electrons around it).</p>
<p><del>Electron</del> Quantum degeneracy pressure is the force which prevents the compression of matter into a smaller space - it is also the reason why we don't pass through the floor despite the floor being 99.9999996% empty space. Matter can be compressed further but it will collapse into a black hole and we can't see them - so the neutron star is a good candidate for something that we can define as 'not empty'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protons are already empty space... they're made of two &quot;up&quot; quarks and one &quot;down&quot; quark, which at rest mass only compose 1% of the proton's mass. The rest of the mass is the kinetic energy of the quarks and the gluon fields that hold the quarks together.</p>
<p>On the other hand, none of the proton's components are really &quot;matter&quot;, as while they have mass they have no volume (they're pointlike, meaning the proton volume is effectively empty) so the proton is about as small as you get and still have something that you can poke and prod.</p></div>		</li>
