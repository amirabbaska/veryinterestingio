			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in low power mode doom playing is a possibility but it may be hindered. The lack of energy would cause weakness that would reduce the focus you have during your trip to hell. Doom is fucking sick though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have 2 options. You either underclock your computer and reduce display brightness to increase battery life, but it means either Doom will run poorly, lag and stutter or you reduce graphics settings and display resolution. Overall the game won't be as good and you will suck because it is more difficult play on a dark screen and lag or low resolution.<br />
Or you keep your computer at full power, run Doom at max settings and 60 fps but your battery will be empty in 30 minutes and your computer will suddenly shut down.  </p>
<p>So either your body stays in saving mode which means you are somewhat lethargic, slower, less attentive and have longer reaction time but you can last before starving or you can force yourself to do sports, to keep your body at high power but you might simply collapse at some point.</p></div>		</li>
