			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense, thank you! </p>
<p>So, if you are losing weight, can your body metabolize the fat that spilled into arteries or other places it shouldn’t be? Or is it like...once it’s where it shouldn’t be, it’s there forever? </p>
<p>Also if I want to read more about the complicated mechanisms, what are some keywords to look for, researchers or authors to read, etc.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arterial plaques can be removed by High Density Lipoprotein (HDL, aka &quot;Good Cholesterol&quot;). They essentially are empty shells of cholesterols and proteins that can package up fat (triglycerides) inside them. Your body makes HDLs by burning the fat stored inside for energy, usually in your muscles. This greatly helps fight cardiovascular disease. Here's a good review on the subject! <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5042826/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5042826/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5042826/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this actually scientifically confirmed? because I’ve heard from other scientists that recent evidence has put into question whether or not HDL is actually beneficial or is just a bystander effect where high HDL is usually a sign of good health but doesn’t have a direct effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of cholestrol efflux is reglated by a negative feedback loop revolving around three proteins called ABCA1, ABCG1, and ApoA1. ABCA1 and ApoA1 complex together to remove cholestrol from arterial endothelial cells. However ABCA1 is regulated by a microRNA miR33a5p tha inhibits transcription of the gene. This regulatory disfunction of miR33a5p results in inhibition of ABCA1/G1 transcription, even when there is an excess of cholestrol, that leads to plaques. ABCG1 has HDLs that complex with it to get cholestrol to efflux to the cell that is eventually excreted by the liver into the digestion pathway and pooped out</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a quick bit to that response that may not be immediately clear to some people - atherosclerosis leads to higher BP/HR because the blood vessels will be partly blocked by plaque, increasing the amount of force needed to pump blood through them. Higher BP and heart rate can lead to heart / kidney strain, causing them to enlarge over time, leading to other negative health effects. Not exactly the same situation, but steroid induced  cardiac problems can cause similar issues and reading the autopsies of dead bodybuilders like Dallas McCarver can be interesting</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>And because the walls of the blood vessels get harder and less elastic. Normally the walls of arteries will expand a bit with each pulse, and then spring back again which ”gives kinetic energy back” to the blood. As the walls get more inelastic this becomes less efficient, wasting energy which ultimately means the heart must work harder and that each pulse results in a needlessly high spike in BP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read that heavy lifting hardens arteries even without supplemental steroid use. The article suggested it was due to repeated high pressure (valsalva maneuver), but could it also be due to natural steroids or whatnot produced during muscle growth?</p></div>		</li>
