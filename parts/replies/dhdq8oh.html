<p>One theoretical way to do it is to use a polarizing beam splitter which is (more or less) lossless, like the Nicol prism, and then use the Faraday effect to rotate the polarization of the other before finally combining them again. But this seems rather impractical.</p>

<p>You can flip the linear polarization by 90Â° with purely geometric means, simply by combining a cross-faced with a parallel-faced periscope, which is wavelength independent unlike  faraday rotation (or the more commonly used birefringent crystals aka waveplates).</p>
<p>The main problem however is rejoining the two beams. The phase between the two parts will be fluctuating, as that is the defining property of unpolarized light. So you cannot just combine them coherently. That's not surprising as fully polarizing an unpolarized state with purely passive means would mean reducing entropy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Faraday effect rotates linear light by delaying one circular polarization component relative to the other.</p>
<p>That means that for a given material, geometry and light frequency any incoming linear polarization will be rotated by a certain angle into a certain direction.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I understand your question.</p></div>		</li>
