			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's really really corrupt. </p>
<p>Basically Chinese economy is hitting a brick wall, so the people with money there are trying to get out before china falls into economic collapse. </p>
<p>There's a bunch of ways of getting money out.</p>
<p>And the government here for racial and economic reasons refuses to take accurate states on who's buying what. </p>
<p>Basically if you have money you send it through your children, who are no longer considered foreign once they spent enough time leaving in the country. </p></div>		</li>

I live in Vancouver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in Newmarket, (just north of Toronto) and we had people knock on the door making offers on houses that weren't for sale. They even went as far as to offer to buy the house and lease it back to you for a year so you had time to move out. </p>
<p>Every house on the street that went up for sale went a minimum of $50,000 above asking price some way higher than that. Sometimes they'd just buy a house and tear it down without even stepping foot inside to rebuild it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>International investment is the best way to get money out of China (they intentionally overpay for everything) and there's also nothing to invest in, in China; real estate is a depreciating asset there and stock market growth is capped; Also, 10k's are wasted toilet paper because corruption is so rampant. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Cue everyone getting their money out of whatever ropey country in the region.</p>
<p>Iranians, ex-Soviet, anything ending in -stan (I think we're restrictions on sending money out <em>unless</em> for business) plus any 'black money' from places like India.</p>
<p>Now half the properties are empty, many many not completed due to economic crisis or not even started due to erm, ripping people off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I actually did a report on this. A significant portion of Vancouver's home sales were going to foreign buyers, who tended to overpay and drive prices up. Years and years of this made the median Vancouver home over a million dollars.</p>
<p>After enacting the 15% foreign buyers tax their purchases plummeted, but so did the whole Vancouver market. So much value was added that nobody wants to sell anymore unless prices inflate back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's crazy. I know that 30% less homes were being added to market, and overall supply of homes for sale were much lower than the recent past. I wonder if that is driving the prices up of the homes left on the market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prices haven't corrected in vancouver, they're just slower but they're still up there. The sales for mostly the 2m+ market have slowed significantly but the prices in vancouver are still very healthily in the million mark. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would love to see your report and your method as it's very difficult to determine foreign purchases!</p>
<p>Vancouver sales are down but inventory is way down so make no mistake the market is still a crazy sellers market. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really struggled to find solid data. The city of Vancouver did a study shortly before enacting the tax to see how many purchases were by foreign buyers. </p>
<p>I found lots of other claims, but that's where my 15% comes from. As for raw housing prices and demand, that comes from published data and alot of it relying on the reporters having accurately sourced their information. It was actually really hard to find firsthand concrete data for anything beyond median house prices.</p></div>		</li>
