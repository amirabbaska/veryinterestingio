			<div class="markdown"><p>In DSM-IV-TR, a &quot;mixed episode&quot; was a week where a person met full criteria for major depression AND mania. This is among the most intensely miserable psychological states that I could imagine. People in mixed states are extremely irritable, restless, dysphoric, and make dangerously poor decisions. They are at increased risk for suicide based on epidemiological studies, but the convergence of suicidal thoughts, disinhibition, and energy to act on these thoughts makes for a highly dangerous situation. Based on more recent data that dysphoric features are not uncommon during hypomania/mania and hypomanic/manic features can occur during depression, DSM-5 broadened the idea of mixed states to the specifier &quot;with mixed features.&quot; This speaks to our growing understanding of a &quot;bipolar spectrum.&quot;</p>
<p>The degree of dysfunction that accompanies mixed states (mixed episodes or mood episodes &quot;with mixed features&quot;) is remarkable. Thankfully, they are fairly uncommon in the community. They are not characteristic of &quot;everyday life.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. &quot;Depression&quot; is often used indiscriminately to describe the &quot;symptom&quot; of depression/dysphoria, the &quot;syndrome&quot; (aka, the constellation of symptoms and other clinical features) of a major depressive episode, or the &quot;diagnostic entity&quot; of major depressive disorder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depression is the condition, it has a variety of symptoms. People often refer to feeling sad as being depressed in the clinical sense.</p>
<p>Feeling sad may well be an indication that you have depression, but it is not depression in and of itself in the same way that a persistent wheezy cough might indicate that you have asthma, but the cough isn't asthma...it's a cough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just thought I'd toss that in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no consensus on this yet. Much of what passes for &quot;bipolar disorder&quot; simply doesn't meet criteria, which could be either a) because these individuals don't actually have bipolar spectrum illness or b) because the criteria are not refined enough. Could be a little of both. This wrinkle is one of the reasons behind the introduction of &quot;Disrupted Mood Dysregulation Disorder.&quot; Children were being diagnosed with bipolar at unprecedented rates, which led many to think that we were losing the purity of what we have understood bipolar disorder to be. Additionally, active substance use all too often confounds a clear diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>McLean and the ISSD think that there is a consensus for this.  In fact, it's usually a dissociative spectrum disorder that's misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder.  Also, as the literature states, any diagnosis of bipolar disorder in someone who is in puberty, or has not reached puberty yet, is by definition a misdiagnosis.</p>
<p>That you're not aware of these things has me a bit worried, frankly.  You're not in Australia or Canada, are you?  </p></div>		</li>
