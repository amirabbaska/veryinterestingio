			<div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge birds have not been allowed to fly aboard a spacecraft. It would be very difficult to attempt to test that hypothesis (Does a weaker magnetic field alter a bird's navigational/migration abilities?) because space aboard the ISS or STS was so limited. NASA is very strict in its space flight safety guidelines for experiments and requires them to be fully contained (often with redundancy). For our insect experiments we were pretty much limited to about a shoe box sized volume. </p></div>		</li>
