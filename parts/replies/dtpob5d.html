<p>Red/green. This is called the duochrome test. This takes advantage of the fact that longer wavelength (red) light is refracted (or bent) less than shorter (green) wavelength.  If the red side is more distinct it indicates the light is refracting in front of the retina and you need to increase the minus power. If green it indicates the light is refracting behind the retina and you need to increase the plus power.</p>

<li>The yellow dye is fluorescein. It is used for many reasons. Often used to check the pressure of the eye in conjunction with a blue light and a tonometer. Also often used to check for irregularities in the cornea because the fluid will pool in certain areas (eg. If you have a scratch of the eye, or dryness of the eye). </li>
