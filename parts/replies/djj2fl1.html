			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a common misconception. Everyone produces the same breakdown products from asparagus. The difference is that only some people have the gene for the functional odorant receptor for methanethiol. They tested this in one of my favorite scientific experiments of all time where they had participants eat asparagus and then smell each other's urine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take issue with this assumption that asparagus pee is always unpleasant. I for one like asparagus very much, in part because I get to enjoy it twice. Sometimes thrice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I admit, I dislike the smell - and taste - of asparagus. But whatever floats your boat, I must say - this is, by far, not meant as a personal attack. At least you got more asparagus for yourself, now. :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read before that the enzyme that makes cilantro taste like soap to some people is related. (ex.  If you think cilantro tastes like soap then you don't  the have the funny asparagus pee smell) </p>
<p>Is there any truth to that? </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Nature&quot; says there is a genetic link in tasting cilantro as soap, yes.</p>
<p>&quot;SciShow&quot; puts it that the gene responsible for cilantro's soap taste is OR6A2... </p>
<p>...but neither are talking about any correlation between asparagus and cilantro. Any different sources?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, crazy! A group of us at work came to this conclusion by our own informal survey, except it was the opposite. Those who could smell asparagus pee liked cilantro, and those who couldn't thought cilantro tastes like soap and don't like it.</p></div>		</li>
