			<div class="markdown"><p>In your reference frame, you are at rest and the ball is traveling at 50 mph. Also in your reference frame the light from your headlights is traveling away from you at the speed of light (c). Relative to some external observer, the light is also traveling at 'c'. In order for you to both see the light moving at 'c' no matter what your relative velocities are, something's gotta give which is where things like length contraction and time dilation come into play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very concise answer. I like it.
It took me the longest time wrap my mind around WHY time slows down in moving objects/reference frames relative to an observer in a different reference frame.
It’s because the speed of light/causality is NOT the variable. It’s a constant. Therefore spacetime must be the variable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah but an observer would see the tennis ball travelling at 150mph, so why wouldnt they see the the light travelling at the speed of light + 100mph?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its because velocity addition at c doesnt work like that. Because you cannot go past c, both you and the observer see the headlights moving at c. Mathematically the formula is not just v1 + v2 = v3. It is more like v3 = (v1+v2]/(1+((v1*v2)/c)^2). So the tennis ball isnt seen at exactly 150mph. Its more like 149.99999999 mph. But for most of science that 149.9999999 is close enough so we just use the 150. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, they don't, not quite. They see the tennis ball travelling <em>very slightly</em> slower than 150mph. It's just than 150mph is nothing compared to the speed of light, so the difference between the speed they perceive and 150mph is very small, so it's difficult to notice and practical to ignore.</p>
<p>The actual formula for adding velocities isn't <code>a + b</code>, but</p>
<pre><code>  a + b
---------
1 + ab/c²</code></pre>
<p>So for adding 100 and 50 we get 150/(1 + 5000/671,000,000²) = 150/(1 + 5000/450,000,000,000,000,000) = 150/(1 + 1/90,000,000,000,000) = 150 / (90,000,000,000,001/90,000,000,000,000) = 149.99999999999833333333333335185185... i.e. very almost 150mph.</p>
<p>But when you have two things at the speed of light, you get (c + c)(1 + cc/c²) = 2c / (1 + 1) = 2c/2 = c, so it's very different to just adding them normally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, addition of velocities doesn't work like that anymore.</p>
<p>It seems intuitive to say, &quot;if you're traveling at 50, and you turn on your headlights, the light should travel at c + 50&quot; - but that's no longer how it works.</p>
<p>For every-day low speeds - on the order of 100mph, etc. - it's close enough, where the difference is infinitesimal - but as you get closer and closer to c, the differences matter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They've always worked the same, it's just our understanding that's changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic principle is that the laws of physics are the same in all reference frames. By reference frames, I just mean things moving relative to one another.</p>
<p>In particular, the laws of the electromagnetism <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations" target="_blank">Maxwell's equations</a> don't change, and the speed light travels at is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations#Vacuum_equations.2C_electromagnetic_waves_and_speed_of_light" target="_blank">determined straightforwardly</a> from said equations.</p></div>		</li>
