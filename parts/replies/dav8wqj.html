<p>Mark Twain on watermelon: From Puddinhead Wilson
&quot;The true Southern watermelon is a boon apart, and not to be mentioned with commoner things. It is chief of this world's luxuries, king by grace of God over all the fruits of the earth. When one has tasted it, he knows what the angels eat. It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took: we know it because she repented.&quot;
From the Autobiography:
&quot;I know how a prize watermelon looks when it is sunning its fat rotundity among pumpkin vines and “simblins”; I know how to tell when it is ripe without “plugging” it; I know how inviting it looks when it is cooling itself in a tub of water under the bed, waiting; I know how it looks when it lies on the table in the sheltered great floor space between house and kitchen, and the children gathered for the sacrifice and their mouths watering; I know the crackling sound it makes when the carving knife enters its end, and I can see the split fly along in front if the blade as the knife cleaves its way to the other end; I can see its halves fall apart and display the rich red meat and the black seeds, and the heart standing up, a luxury fit for the elect; I know how a boy looks behind a yard-long slice of that melon, and I know how he feels; for I have been there. I know the taste of the watermelon which has been honestly come by, and I know the taste of the watermelon which has been acquired by art. Both taste good, but the experienced know which tastes best.&quot;</p>

<p>BRB.  Going to shower myself, and then scour the supermarket for watermelon, and thereafter planning my garden next summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot, buddy. This is the time of year when I am finally glad it's cold and getting ready to enjoy our 3 weeks of winter. Thanks to you (and Mark Twain) I am prematurely longing for summer... it's going to be a long January.</p></div>		</li>
