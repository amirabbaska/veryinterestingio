			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no good answer. Mice are just really shitty models for a lot of diseases, for many reasons. They dont always have the same proteins and receptors we do. Their immune cells develop somewhat differently, and have different markers - and for things like immunotherapy, a lot of what we're doing is messing with or targeting immune cell markers. (Just realized eli5, when I say marker what I mean is - we categorize types of immune cells by the proteins that stick out of the surface of the cell, there are many and they do all sorts of things). When we're looking at things like cancer, there's a lot of evidence that B cells can help in humans, but have almost no function in mice. We're also studying a lot of things by taking all of the immune cells out of mice and replacing them with human cells, and they don't work in the exact same way so of course there are issues with this. Finally, mice don't even get many diseases we do so we &quot;force&quot; them to get the disease, for example if you study a Staph infection you can graft human skin into a mouse and replace the immune cells with human cells to see how the immune system responds, but this is still not ideal since the inner workings of mice at molecular levels aren't the same as us.</p>
<p>Alternatively we're trying to figure out better ways to do things. The challenge is that the human body is so complex and the interaction of so many cell types, the immune system, organs, etc is involved in disease. The problem is that we obviously can't study things in the human body by causing people to get diseases and dissecting them to run science experiments. So there's a huge push in the field to develop better ways to study these things than simply growing one cell line in a petri dish and doing things to it. On the absolute cutting edge, I just saw a speaker from MIT talking about systems biology on a chip. Basically, their lab got a huge grant for developing these &quot;chips&quot; where they grow human tissue that has all of the various types of cells and functions like the organ it comes from in a small dish system. They figured out how to link 10 of these &quot;organs on a chip&quot; together in a big system, and can send drugs through to see how a drug would be metabolized in the actual human body, rather than in a mouse or just throwing it on some cells growing in a petri dish. It's very new and in early stages, but they tested a few drugs and were able to show they were metabolized (broken down to smaller components) in the same way as they are in people (they used drugs already on the market). This is hugely important, because one of the challenges here is that while a drug might fight a disease, it can be broken down by organs in the body to byproducts that will kill you.</p>
<p>Also, just in general, scientists are starting to more often move away from 2d models and trying to develop 3d models of human cells so that we don't have to rely on mice. What's that mean? Well, in your body everything is lined with a layer of cells called epithelial cells that form a protective barrier and give us structure. When you're infected with a pathogen, it has to somehow get through this layer, and commonly the pathogen is infecting these epithelial cells. A 2d model is taking a human cell, usually from cancer and growing it in a dish. Since it's a cancer cell, it will keep dividing forever, and this is how we develop what we call a cell line. It's called 2d because in a petri dish, these cells will grow in just a single layer attached to the dish. This isn't at all how cells work in the body, obviously. By doing a variety of techniques, we can actually make these cells form multiple layers and &quot;differntiate&quot;, or turn into multiple different cell types more similar to our actual tissue. For example, I work with airway epithelial cells. I use cell lines that come from a cancer that will grow flat in a petri dish. But if I grow them on basically a small piece of f porous plastic with media (basically, liquid with nutrients they need to live) underneath and not on top, they will automatically grow out and form layers that look and function more like the actual epithelium in our airways. We can then test experiments on these that are at least closer to what is really happening in our bodies.</p>
<p>Finally, there's a real challenge because like I mentioned most of the human cell lines we use to study things come from cancers. Cancer cells are very different from normal healthy cells, but most of the cells in our body aren't continuously dividing forever so will quickly die if we try to grow them in the lab. Usually this is limited because our chromosomes have a bunch of extra repeated DNA bases, called telomeres, at the end. Every time the cell divides a little bit of the DNA at the end of the chromosome is lost, and once these extra bases are &quot;used up&quot;, the important stuff starts getting lost and the cells die. We can make them live forever by adding an enzyme that constantly adds more of these extra bases, but is still drastically altering how the cells work. I'm just telling you this as an explanation of why we still use mice. Despite all the differences I mentioned they at least grow and develop similarly to humans, and we have made big advances in medicine using mice. Sorry for the super long post, hope it helps to explain things! If you have any other questions feel free to ask!</p></div>		</li>
