<p>People tend to believe these artificially yellow eggs to be more healthy</p>

<p>I’ve come to associate darker yolks with better eggs since I only run into them at farm to table restaurants.</p>
<p>The belief that yellow yolks make better eggs has pushed the factory farm system into making the opposite true. Beautiful irony.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, if anything the OP should have said &quot;make them more orange&quot; instead of &quot;make them more yellow&quot;.</p>
<p>A normal supermarket egg that hasn't been fed an enriched diet of pigments will have a pale yellow yplk, compared to the deeper orange or even almost reddish colour of one fed carotenoids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of not doing the process and leaving them naturally less yellow. Companies opt to do this because they think it's worthwhile to have very yellow yolks, but it's entirely optional and doesn't affect the nutritional value or heath of the egg. </p></div>		</li>
