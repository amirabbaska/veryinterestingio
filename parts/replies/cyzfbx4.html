			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact:  It's theorized that a massive volcanic eruption at the end of the Permian period caused a huge amount of the fossil fuel reserves created from the un-decomposed trees to catch on fire.  The resulting flood of CO2 and methane caused almost all life on Earth to die. This was the time known as the Great Dying.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was just reading about Viruses and the biological warfare between humans and viruses that has been going on for millions of years, and the types of things we evolved to protect ourselves against viruses and conversly the types of things that viruses have evolved to attack us despite our shields are pretty amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the first great extinction the most fascinating.</p>
<p>About 2.5 billion years ago off the top of my head when the surface of the earth was covered in photosynthesising organism. Algae, bacteria, very early protoplants. They are loving the high CO2 environment. They are having a fucking party and photosynthesising their little chloroplasts off.</p>
<p>They chuck out loads of oxygen and eventually get to a point where the oxygen is at toxic levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh shit...&quot; Mass extinction, ecosystems collapse. Life basically resets. The only survivors some bacteria that have been living under sediment so have been in a higher oxygen environment long enough to evolve to survive it.</p>
<p>It like a group of humans sealing themselves in a room with beer, pizza and computer games then realising after a few weeks that the room has toxic levels of CO2 and mountains of piss and shit. Not fun!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely it was just plowed under with the rest of the bio-debris that everything was growing on top of.  It eventually became part of the coal as well, but the fire is not mechanism by which the coal was made.  </p>
<p>If you have a chance sometime compare lump charcoal for a grill with an actual piece of coal.  You'll notice one is (edit) Partially combusted wood in a low oxygen environment (/edit), the other is heavy compressed carbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biological decomposition ends relatively soon after burial (and in the carboniferous there wasn't much decomp yet), so the &quot;decomposition&quot; process is mostly chemical and is fueled by the temp and pressure.  This continues long after burial and lasts for a thousands or millions of years.  </p>
<p>Most organic molecules are primarily Carbon with Oxygen and Hydrogen.  The Oxygen and Hydrogen leave the system as water and are either boiled or squeezed off.  The result is carbon that is compressed over time into purer forms.  Relatively young coal you can still see some plant shapes, leaves, bark, etc in it (Bituminous coal), older more refined coal is almost all black carbon and sometime even breaks like glass (Anthracite coal).  </p>
<p>Other less common elements manifest as pyrite or other precipitates in the coal seams.</p></div>		</li>
