<p>Not to weird because both are salamanders stuck in their larval state. Larval states will look pretty much the same within clades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They mean clade, in a very general sense. Consider embryonic development. The more distantly related two species are, the further back in embryonic development you have to look for them to share a similar form. Go back 600 million years, and the clades ( &quot;superphyllums&quot;) of deuterostomia (eg vertebrates, starfish, sea urchins) and protostomia (eg arthropods, molluscs, worms) diverge after the eight-cell stage. Larvae are just distinct juvenile forms of animals. Because taxonomic order only roughly reflects the phylogenetic tree of life, and because similarity is a subjective, relative measurement, &quot;clade&quot; will do. With the obvious exception of kingdom (plants and bacteria don't have larvae) and superphyllum, similar larval forms can be seen at the phyllum level (Echinodermata, ie urchins and starfish).  TL;DR, &quot;Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot; - Ernst Haeckel</p></div>		</li>
