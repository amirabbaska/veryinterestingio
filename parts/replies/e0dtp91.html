			<div class="markdown"><p>Cooling is especially used in repairs of aneurysms and dissections of the ascending aorta and/or aortic arch. Because of the methods the surgeons have to use to replace the affected aorta, blood flow often has to be stopped completely, at least to the lower body. We typically use antegrade (normal, forward flow) cerebral perfusion or retrograde (backwards) cerebral perfusionist to maintain blood flow to the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly... I’m not sure. I mean it’s like the most invasive thing we do to people and from what I understand there is actual data to back up that some people seem to suffer from the condition. However I have limited interaction with my patients after their procedures and the people I’ve known that have had open heart procedures all were fine afterwards. I get the feeling it’s real, not sure if it’s actually bypass that causes it or not, and that it exists in a small minority of patients. I don’t know how to avoid it, as some procedures are simply impossible or just as dangerous without the heart-lung machine. I hope that was a reasonable response to your question. I never want to be a patient on bypass, but if I had to go on cardiopulmonary bypass to live I would personally take the risk... well in most cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also a perfusionist, so I'll give my take.</p>
<p>It definitely is a real thing, but it doesn't affect every patient. One of my co-workers had a CABG (coronary artery bypass grafts) and experienced it. It's similar to concussions and CTE in that you can't always see anything physically wrong with the person, so it can be hard to believe anything is wrong.</p></div>		</li>
