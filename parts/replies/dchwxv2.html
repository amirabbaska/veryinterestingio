<p>Noting Si is a semiconductor is an important point- doping the Si with different elements, one in at a higher state of charge and one at a lower state of charge, to promote &quot;flow&quot; of electrons once the &quot;excitation&quot; in the top comment occurs after exposure to photons.</p>

<p>If no photons are present to promote this flow, the cell is no longer conductive and will actually resist flow. If partial shading exists (particularly in older solar modules), the shaded (i.e. non-conductive) cell is holding this charge and dissipating via heat. This is what causes fires or cell burnouts in some cases as resistance becomes a load.
Newer modules have introduced bypass diodes to isolate portions of the module which are not conductive.</p>

<p>Solar cells are only capable of converting about 1/16 of energy in sunlight.</p>
<p>Typical solar panels are around 15% energy efficient</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1/16 is 6.25% so I need clarification of your numbers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, but that doesn't address the discrepancy in your numbers.  Single or multiple only affects efficiency if some are in shade, and it would only lower it for panels as opposed to single cells. You're saying cells with 6.25% efficiency make a 15% efficient panel. How?</p></div>		</li>
