			<div class="markdown"><p>If we look far enough back at the history of mars would there be an explanation as to how it built up an ocean in the first place, before it all started disappearing? When I see water on mars being explained it always starts half way through the story where mars already has a ton of water and it all starts disappearing from there. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There's really <em>not</em> a consensus about this yet, it's just one of a couple hypotheses. </p>
<p>One big problem with this explanation is that we still see issues with the isotope ratio of deuterium-to-hydrogen in water found on Earth. While it's currently a good match for certain kinds of asteroids (but a poor match for comets), there's also good evidence the deuterium ratio of Earth's oceans has been enriched over time, suggesting that water on early Earth was not a good match.</p>
<p>An alternative hypothesis is that much of the water already existed as Earth formed trapped in hydrated minerals. As the planet came together, heated, and differentiated, this water was then released, forming our oceans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a report on water in Mars in college around 5 years ago, this info sounds new and interesting.</p>
<p>One question I have is how much of the original planetary composition was asteroids. The Great Asteroid Belt probably contains a certain percentage of the asteroids that survived within the Sun's orbit. I presume the planets cleaned up all the other asteroids in their orbits either as they formed, or over time after they formed..? (The main asteroids to be concerned with here are ones from inside the Solar System, right?)</p>
<p>I guess I have some uncertainty over whether this information means that the planets had no water when they were initially formed. My assumption would be that planets had a high content of asteroid rock (and hence water) to begin with, even before absorbing the rest of them. Not sure if there is any conclusion on that? (Were planet conditions too hot initially to allow for water retention?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars used to have a strong enough magnetic field that deflected high energy solar radiation. So back in it's history the erosion of the atmosphere was much less. However, as it's a smaller planet, it's core cooled quicker and as a result it's magnetic field was lost when the core solidified. This allowed the high energy radiation to start eroding away at the atmosphere over time.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You have to be careful here. A magnetic field can only deflect charged particles. There's still plenty of high-energy solar radiation in the form of ultraviolet photons that are uncharged, and therefore pass straight through the magnetic field completely unhindered.</p>
<p>In fact, the whole point of my post is that much of the Martian ocean evaporated away even while Mars still had a magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is rust, and it was created when oxygen reacted with iron on the planet's surface. I don't know what the source of all of the oxygen is but at least some of it is from long-gone water. I think /u/goodguys9 was asking what proportion of the oxygen on Mars' surface came from the ancient ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth was red at one point too, though from a different process. Cyanobacteria produced so much oxygen as a by-product all the iron rusted out of the oceans.  You can see the result in Australia.</p></div>		</li>
