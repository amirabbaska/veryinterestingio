			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find anything supporting the shut off of atria--got a source?</p>
<p>The only thing I have found is that the lungs and skin are considered a pulmocutaneous circuit and are thereby both supplied by the equivalents of the pulmonary arteries. Meanwhile, the right atria is used for return of systemic, deoxygenated blood while the left is return of pulmocutaneous, oxygenated blood; the same as mammals.</p>
<p>Maybe you meant some early-stage developmental quirk in their physiology that doesn't show from a cursory Google search...</p></div>		</li>
