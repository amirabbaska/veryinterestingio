			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they're different actions. The submit button posts your data to a server. Google's captcha communicates with Google's servers. </p>
<p>But also It's also easier on the devs part. Instead of coding a whole new anti-robot captcha system that may take thousands of lines of code and hundreds of hours, they can instead just paste a little snippet of code that Google already made. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really. The only difference between GET and POST is that POST allows an unlimited sized body, whereas GET has limits on the query string length (the server will response with a 414 error).</p>
<p>I see no reason to trigger it with a button click. Just track all the human interactions and send it via AJAX for verification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a question of if it's possible. Of course it's possible. It's a question of what makes the most sense for the developers. The makers of the captcha are providing a service to anyone who wants to use it. They don't know what every developer may want it for. It's possible that it might be used without ever submitting a form. To facilitate that, I imagine they designed it in the most flexible way they could and apparently that involved not tying it to a submit button.</p>
<p>Think of it like this. When you build a PC you buy each part customized to exactly what you want. Video card makers build their cards to fit into the PCI slot but they don't know exactly how your computer works. What you're asking is similar to &quot;Why do video cards have to be so big? Can't we just build them onto the motherboard?&quot; Sure. Of course we can. Laptops do this. But in doing so you lose the ability to pick whatever graphics card you want and swap one out later for an upgrade or repair. At the same time you gain a much smaller computer.</p>
<p>These types of decisions are all about trade-offs and my guess is that the builders of the captcha wanted to make their service as flexible as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't answer the question as to why the user still needs to check the box. Whatever script that's executed when the checkbox is clicked should be able to do a similar type of detection without the checkbox.  The question is why the physical check is required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because this is exactly what Google is using to check if the site user is a human. It's how humans click a checkbox and, my best guess, how they react while waiting for confirmation that lets Google know if you are a human or not. Having the user click something instead of just hovering the mouse is probably not only part of the process, but also a better design decision.</p></div>		</li>
