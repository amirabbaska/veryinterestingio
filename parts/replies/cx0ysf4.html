			<div class="markdown"><p>This is coming from a Psych class in college. I remember that men tend to choose ways that are based on the likelihood of success. Women tend to avoid violent methods that will damage their body in obvious ways. My professor posited that Women tend to have a higher preoccupation with what others think even when planning for death.</p>
<p>Men on the other hand are more afraid of failing. In society men have a lot of pressure placed on them to succeed. If nothing else in their life is going well, and then they fail to kill themselves, it's another piece of shame placed on the pile. So in turn, they prefer methods that are more of a sure thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could also be that women care more about how they look when they're found because they don't want to traumatize or hurt other people. </p>
<p>For example, it's less disturbing to find a body that overdosed on sleeping pills than a body that's been hit by a train, thereby traumatizing the conductor and passengers, as well as any witnesses. Flying body parts from train suicides have hurt or killed bystanders before. The same goes for people who jump off tall buildings. In regards to gun suicides, women may have reduced access to firearms due to expected gender roles, or less confidence in their ability to aim properly. </p>
<p>So, I don't think women are more narcissistic than men when it comes to suicide, as some posters are suggesting. Instead, it seems to me that they're more thoughtful of how their method of suicide will affect others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, so even when planning their deaths men pick things that are less likely to fail and women pick things that won't damage how they look or be messy.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However trivial it may seem, to me this is absolutely fascinating. How much does something have to be ingrained in your brain to think about it even when you are on the edge of death? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also doubt over the statistic that women attempt to commit suicide more than men. Since men generally don't seek help for mental illness. It is likely that they do not report any attempted suicides either. Meaning they either continue to attempt suicide until they succeed, they give up and move on without telling anyone, or finally they do tell a professional, leading to an overall decrease in stats recorded regarding attempted male suicide. </p></div>		</li>
