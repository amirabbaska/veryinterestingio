			<div class="markdown"><p>There are no Colorado state laws against marijuana and they have decided not to spend their resources to enforce the federal laws, but it is still illegal on the federal level. Even though they have said they won't, if the FBI or someone really wanted to they could go arrest people for breaking those federal laws, but it isn't worth it for the most part. That's my understanding of the situation anyway.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not disagreeing with /u/tryin2figureitout. As /u/Mrredditorson has mentioned, Colorado Amendment 64 does say that marijuana is legal in the state. I was just pointing out that this does not mean that the federal laws do not still apply. The federal laws would trump the state laws if someone actually cared to enforce them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah...I mean that's a nice promise and all but that's this specific admnistration. We need something in writing, something like<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1940" target="_blank"> H.R. 1940</a>, which, though unlikely to pass, would be essentially the best middle ground for congress in both preserving federal law and respecting states rights. Marijuana should be legalized and regulated at the federal level a la alcohol and tobacco (though it is vastly different from either substance), but this would at least allow states and the people within them to choose their own direction, you know, democratically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Law student here, I'll elaborate on what you said a bit (you're mostly spot on).</p>
<p>Marijuana remains illegal on the federal level but the only thing stopping the federal government from enforcing federal laws in the states isn't lack of resources (although that certainly plays a role) but conscious, specific non-enforcement.  It's worth noting this distinction because this non-enforcement can be rescinded at any time and has literally 0 legally binding effect.  I read a case in crim law last year (can't for the life of me remember the name) about a guy who was arrested under federal law for medical marijuana (in a state with a medical program) and it was held that the federal government is allowed to break its word at any time.  Just because it makes a grand announcement that it won't prosecute individual growers following state regulations doesn't mean that it has to follow this.  And in fact, the federal government has violated its own non-enforcement policy many times.</p>
<p>2009 was a big year for non-enforcement.  Before this there was a quasi war between state and federal governments, best exemplified in the case Gonzales v. Raich.  Angel Raich was arrested by federal authorities for growing marijuana in accord with California state law, fought his case in the US supreme court, and lost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there something special about mj or could the same thing happen to other schedule 1 drugs in the future? </p>
<p>Could we potentially face a legalization of medical heroin  (diamorphine), which several other countries already have? I'm not sure about other illegal drugs, but heroine and marijuana both have definite therapeutic purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going to tack on to the top comment: There's also some understanding that CO and WA are &quot;experiments&quot;. The federal government, via the attorney general, <a href="http://www.dfi.wa.gov/documents/banks/holder-letter-08-29-13.pdf" target="_blank">did communicate -- PDF WARNING -- </a> with the governors of CO and WA and reiterated that their priority was to keep marijuana out of the hands of minors, prevent the sale of pot to fund criminals, prevent inter-state commerce of the drug, and so on.</p>
<p>If everything had gone to shit in CO and WA after legalization, I'm pretty sure the federal government would have stepped in and put an end to it in no time.</p></div>		</li>
