			<div class="markdown"><p>Touring is really only lucrative to mainstream musicians and orchestras, able to fill entire stadiums with seats. Smaller musicians typically lose money due to the prevalence of &quot;pay to play&quot; agreements. And both advertising and merchandising are really only lucrative if a musician has enough broad appeal. There are exceptions, but they're too few and far between to be considered a developing trend. I think we'll see more smaller musicians trying to garner larger payments from their few fans by selling one-off albums and EPs, similar to Wu-Tang's <em>Once Upon a Time in Shaolin</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even lesser known artists will make most of their money from live shows. Sure, of you have one EP out on SoundCloud you're probably not in demand, but artists like Danny Brown who do abysmal sale numbers will be able to draw a lot of people to live shows. Same with SoundCloud rappers, I doubt Lil Pump or xxxtentacion have made any money to speak of from streams, but their shows are packed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your examples support my statement!</p>
<p>Danny Brown, Lil Pump and xxxtentacion are all signed to fairly large record labels -- Warp, Empire and Tha Lights Global, respectively. Warp is arguably the &quot;smallest&quot; of these labels, considering the backing the other two have from their parent companies, and it's still <em>huge</em> company.</p></div>		</li>
