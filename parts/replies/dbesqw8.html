			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey man I usually don't comment on stuff like this but I just really have to. Reading your comment and the thread that you linked just made me ball my eyes out. I just realized the path I'm headed down if I continue my lifestyle. I'm currently a sophomore in college and I am struggling. Sitting here on my desk, thinking back through my last year and a half of my time in school, all I remember is sitting in my dorm smoking, sleeping, playing video games, watching Netflix, all while I am barely coherent due to pot and alcohol. Me and my roommate would smoke about an ounce a week. My grades are falling and I can see it. 3.9 to 3.6 now down to 3.2. I have 8 dollars in my bank. I'm trying my hardest to seek help and get myself back on track but I honestly have no idea where to start. I have already told my family about the issue recently and started seeing a psychiatrist for my drug-induced depression. But the idea of rehab terrifies me. I never thought I would end up down this road and I don't know what to do. I haven't really been the most popular kid in school and I have a pretty narrow pool of friends who also smoke but not as much as me and a small part of me says that they might not be once I'm clean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, feel free to come talk to us at /r/leaves and /r/stopdrinking. Easily two of the most supportive groups I've ever been a part of. </p>
<p>Your story and mine are extremely similar, except my GPA dropped from 3.9 to failing every class in the course of a semester at a stupidly expensive private school. I was perma stoned and often drunk. The only way to feed this addiction was to start selling, which quickly became a full time job. I didn't give two shits that I was wasting thousands of my parents' hard earned dollars so I could be a drug dealer and keep me and my &quot;friends&quot; (aka people who surrounded me because they knew I always shared my weed on my quest to be popular) high. My parents only found out about my across the board failure when the school sent me my academic suspension. They then sent me to rehab, and my life has become something I enjoy instead of eternally resenting. Rehab wasn't a walk in the park, but I learned so much about myself, and I know for a fact that I wouldn't be able to support my first child arriving in 3 months if I never made those changes. I wouldn't have the support of my family if I didn't make those changes. I wouldn't have friends that care about my well-being instead of my jar of weed unless I made those changes. I honestly might have killed myself over the things I had done in the course of my addiction unless I made some changes. </p>
<p>If you ever want to talk, feel free to shoot me a PM. You're at the crossroads, and having someone to talk to is something I wish I had when I was at that point. I got to where you are a few times, but my brain would do some Olympic level gymnastics to convince me that my lifestyle was OK. Without my parents intervening, I'd still be stuck. Make the right decision for yourself. It's empowering as fuck according to my friends who decided they needed rehab. One of the hardest things to do (still hard, even after lots of practice) is asking for help. It requires a combination of surrender (I can't win this one), humility (I think I could win if I had some support), and courage (because by asking, people will know I couldn't win). It is precisely the opposite of weakness. </p>
<p>Hope you see this today, and even if you're high/drunk/whatever, shoot me a quick message. Much love</p>
<p>Edit: To the people who PM'd me, I got back to you! Sorry it took so long (work is a bitch, right?). If anyone else wants to chat about quitting alcohol/weed/any drug shoot me a message. I guarantee you'll receive a nice ramble in response</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Far out man, reminds me a lot of myself when I thought about stopping. I was in terrified, thinking that I didn't want to go back to being that person that no-one liked. There is hope and things can get better. There seems to be a lot of talk about meetings in this thread and what some of the people have pointed out is true, it's not for everyone. That being said, NA worked for me and my life is pretty good now - I'm content with my life as it is, which is all I think I ever wanted. At the end of the day, it's worth a shot and if it's not for you then you're one step closer to finding something that may work. At worst it's a group of kind people who want nothing more from you than to see you get well. At best, you can get some of your life back. I wish you all the good will that I can send to you.  </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>To support individuals who have chosen to abstain, or are considering abstinence from any type of addictive behaviors (substances or activities), by teaching how to change self-defeating thinking, emotions, and actions; and to work towards long-term satisfactions and quality of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a science based program, and evolves as the study and understanding of addiction moves forward.  All the materials for the program are online.  The online support community is excellent.  I found it a really positive experience, and felt motivated and hopeful, instead of shame and failure.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to look for social groups to hang with (clubs, sports, work, volunteer) other than those that you party with.  Find positive role models, people who deal with issues in a healthy manner.  Stay working with your psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Good luck.  You are not a victim of addiction, and you CAN make your own future.  Not easy, but you can move forward and be happy.  Let me know if you have any questions or need any support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was interesting that you acknowledged the permanent damage that can with substance abuse. Many others seem to say they will never feel the same and might as well not stop since they can't imagine never feeling like that again. Those that recovered successfully don't even want to feel like they did on the substance because the side effects will interfere with whatever they're doing and impair their thinking. Almost as though they could take it and not do it again because they don't like it anymore, but still acknowledging that it isn't worth the risk or test. </p></div>		</li>

Whether it be suicide or driving drunk someone will die.  I live with that healthy fear of where a drink will take me.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason most people don't want to get drunk every night is because they don't like it and it would interfere with their life. The goal for an addict is to get that point as well, he should also not want to get drunk every night the same way a normal person does. However even though he feels he is finally at that point, where he doesn't want to get drunk because he has other responsibilities, he should not feel like he should test himself and think &quot;maybe just one drink to see if I'm ok&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are a walking, talking (well, typing) manifestation of the step program my friend.  I'm glad it worked for you, I feel like it doesn't work for the majority of the addicts I've run into in my life, myself included.  Biggest reason being the higher power stuff, and the overall &quot;I'm hopeless&quot; attitude that it promotes isn't good for people who are lost in the paralyzation (yeah i made it up) of shame and guilt.  That promoting that idea can make them feel more worthless, and send them further into depression.  I don't think it's enough for some people.  I think it's an old and arguably dated version of modern CBT therapy, and that medication can play a successful and vital role in recovery, but you don't see anything like that pushed at meetings.  It's sort of a &quot;you're with us, or not&quot; group of addicts.  I get the us against the world mentality.  I've  just seen more people not succeed at this program than the oposite.  Thanks for sharing and being an inspiration for others though.  Just my 2 cents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an atheist and found an atheist group. Not all aa groups are exclusive, such as it seems your experience has been from your post. I relapsed dozens of times before figuring out that I could do it without &quot;finding God&quot; or a higher power or some such bullshit (in my opinion). I love going to my heathen meetings and I sincerely miss my friends there when I don't make it every Sunday. I only go to one meeting a week. I don't have a sponsor or work steps in the AA tradition. I've found my own way and my group supports me in doing so. They're there if I have questions or a hard time or whatever and I'm, in turn, there for them. </p>
<p>I get where you're coming from though. I was there, too. The sanctimonious bastards will always be there in every aspect of life. You gotta navigate around them and find your way. It's worth it, for sure. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been shown to be less successful than most ANY other treatment program. But since many times more people go through AA than other programs, there are far more success stories. 10% of 1,000,000 is a lot more evangelists for the cause than 50% of 10,000, so whenever AA or other step programs gets criticized, you get people it worked for rushing to defend the program, and since most people aren't aware of AA's limitations and failures and see it as the best option due to how prevalent it is in society, neutral people tend to agree with successfully reformed AA members that those critical voices are causing more harm than good. It's a tough cycle. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the God thing in AA programs isn't essential and can be dropped from modern programs. What's essential is the &quot;just for today&quot; mentality. Instead of stopping drug use forever, stop to use just for today. It's a goal much more attainable. Tomorrow you'll have the same goal, namely, to stop the drug use just for that day. But tomorrow is another day: focus on the present.</p>
<p>I did CBT and I see the similarities to the AA program. My addiction problem is with the online use of computers (it's a behavioral addiction). I stopped using computers completely for almost a month and my life improved a lot during that time. My psychologist was supportive of the &quot;just for today&quot; mentality because it has a higher chance of success (and my goal wasn't to cut off myself completely from the net - and I'm here after all).</p>
<p>My psychologist would say that his drug addicted clients had a hard time understanding that, just because you slipped yesterday you don't need to commit the same mistake today. Today is a different day and you can still not use drugs today even if you were on a good streak interrupted by yesterday's drug use. I think that's the right mentality too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who complain about &quot;God&quot; and &quot;religion&quot; in AA have only given it a cursory look. It says right in the book if you don't believe in God, make your group your higher power. </p>
<p>The concept is: you haven't been making the right decisions on your own, because you don't come to AA unless you're a struggling alcoholic (that doesn't mean living on skid row; you can be an alky with a million dollar home, 2 cars, and a country club membership). You need to follow the decision making of someone or something else for a while, as you learn new patterns. In the 30's, when the program was developed, using &quot;God&quot; as that guide seemed sensible and reasonable. I didn't believe in God when I started in AA, and I still don't believe in the &quot;God&quot; of my childhood - an old man with long hair and a beard who lives in the sky, who alternately loves us and abandons us. However, I have had a spiritual awakening, and I learned there is a power extant when a group of people truly believe in something.</p>
<p>Think of magnetism for a moment. In a typical iron bar, all the magnetic domains are jumbled together, and the bar has no magnetic force. Align it with a magnetic field, strike the bar a few times, and the domains begin to align themselves. Do this repeatedly, and now the bar is a magnet. It has a power it didn't have previously.</p>
<p>So it is in AA. When you come in, your personal values (magnetic domains) are all jumbled. You want to live and enjoy the world, but you also want to drink. As you continue to come to meetings and work the program, slowly, your personal value domains begin to align themselves. At some point, you feel the change - you don't feel the craving to drink, the need to escape, etc. You have a power you didn't have previously. </p>
<p>Now, 1000 years ago, when we didn't know about electromagnetism, magnets were considered magic. 1000 years from now, when string theorists have done the math, we'll know there are spiritual dimensions we cannot technologically perceive at present, and that AA worked in those dimensions as magnetism does on iron. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These step programs - as the original commenter mentioned - make you feel shame for &quot;taking a pill&quot;. I'm a physician assistant working in opioid addiction. I can't tell you how many patients from AA/NA talk about how taking Suboxone for opioid abuse or even antidepressants are like &quot;changing seats on the Titanic&quot;. This is a wrong idea. Some pills can help you correct the neurobiological imbalance that is driving the addiction. There is a 90%(!) relapse rate within the first 6 months of patients going off Suboxone. Same as quitting cold turkey with cigarettes. This notion that you are a bad and weak person for using medication-assisted treatment is archaic. Imagine telling someone with high blood pressure they are a pathetic addict for taking their Lisinopril? Why not just treat your hypertension with group therapy and prayer you pathetic loser?? For alcohol we don't have something as miraculous as Suboxone but we regularly use vivitrol injections for alcohol abuse disorders that contain a 30 days worth of naltrexone - a drug used to help curb cravings for alcohol. With that said, I'm grateful the step programs helped you despite the added needless torture it no doubt caused you!</p>
<p>TL;DR Using medication-assisted treatment for opioid and alcohol dependence disorders is the best recommendation current medicine has for treating addiction.  </p>
<p>Edit: The &quot;changing ships on the Titanic&quot; notion refers to Suboxone just being another pill you take that you are dependent on. The most common push back we see from patients is an honest one: &quot;How does changing from one drug of dependence to another help me?&quot; The dose of heroin/Percocet the user is taking never decreases and rarely stays the same. It almost always increases. This is a collision course with overdose and death. The dose of buprenorphine (active compound in Suboxone, Subutex, zubsolv) almost always decreases. Often it simply stays the same. The dose cannot be rushed down otherwise you risk running into withdrawal and possibly using again. The danger here is reverting back to using your usual dose after being clean for an extended period of time. Your brain is now sensitive to the opioid and you overdose. This is the most common mechanism of overdose in opioid patients coming out of in-patient rehab facilities. When we decrease Suboxone we decrease 15% of the dose every 2 months and never in the summer because heat causes you to metabolize the drug faster and leads to worsening withdrawal. The average patient is on Suboxone for 3-4 years give or take assuming they start on the average of 16mg. Meanwhile, the patient should attend some sort of therapy on a weekly basis.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Preach dicktits! Thank you for sharing your experience working with addicts.  I spoke about this with another person a few days ago, about my experience getting clean amongst alcoholics and heroin users.  I don't want to say it's explicitly like a popularity contest, where the more fucked up you are, the mroe popular you are, or more sympathy you get (that was my experience), but the lives of the two(heroin vs alcohol) can be night and day.  I think it might be detrimental as far as support systems go to have a detox/rehab center that mostly goes by the step system that is housing these two together.  I've seen alcoholics hit rock bottom, but not rob every store in town rock bottom, or watching your friends OD in front of you levels of trauma.  Personally, I felt alone in a system that was designed for support.  It was garbage.  In a town that touted itself for having one of the best anonymous systems around (says a lot), it was far from it.  Those dudes that said &quot;look around, maybe 1 out of the 20 of you will stay sober&quot; weren't bullshitting at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This notion infuriates me.  Every time I've mentioned psychadelics to a person in 12 step recovery, they've said it's &quot;substitution&quot; even though there is a evidence that psychadelics can help people break addictions to addictive drugs.  Not to mention that addiction to psychadelics is insanely rare.</p>
<p>The notion that one would switch from daily use of booze/pills/coke/heroin etc to daily use of LSD is totally crazy.  I&quot;m sure it has happened, but its terribly unlikely - it's totally irresponsible to dismiss the possible use of psychadelics in recovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting certified to prescribe buprenorphine (Suboxone) is remarkably easy. It requires completion of one eight hour online course. <strong>The amount of time in the course agenda dedicated to taking patients off the drug is nil. No doctor I spoke with recalled the topic of withdrawal from Suboxone being mentioned during the certification process.</strong></p>
<p>Many doctors have found that prescribing Suboxone is akin to installing an ATM in their waiting rooms. It’s the perfect storm. Patients are desperate when they come in, willing to pay significant sums of cash for services, and rarely shop around for the perfect fit between patient and practitioner. In many cities there is a waiting list to get in to see a doctor able to prescribe.</p>
<p>No background in addiction medicine is required to take the course.</p>
<p>This creates a wide berth for physicians who may be opportunists to cash in on the vast and growing population of opiate addicts frantic for a solution. Wrestling with Big Pharma The difficulty of compelling a pharmaceutical company to take suggestions from the public is directly related to the power Big Pharma wields in the United States.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies spent almost three billion dollars lobbying the U.S. Government in the last five years. Pharma is the largest of all 121 lobbying entities and donated over $90 million dollars to federal candidates and political parties. Advocates for an exit strategy from Suboxone have the weight and effect of a single fly in the chardonnay of Big Pharma. There are some lobbying groups working on issues of addiction treatment, and the numbers of these groups are growing. New York, Florida and Pennsylvania have advocacy groups, but their efforts tend to be focused on broader stroke issues. With an entire health care system in transition, obtaining any treatment for addicts is the fight these groups are concentrated on.</p>
<p>Big Pharma's Inconvenient Truth: Pharmaceutical companies gross massive annual earnings; a whopping $950 billion dollars globally. It is an industry of Goliath momentum and political reach. Relying upon recipients of lobbying influence to look their gift horse in the mouth? In the battle of ethics and commerce, conscience rarely rears its inconvenient head. Like Jesse from Breaking Bad, we might ask “What about science, bitches&quot;? Where are the impartial and sovereign scientists? The reality of scientific investigation means taking marching orders from drug companies.
