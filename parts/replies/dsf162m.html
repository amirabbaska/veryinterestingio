			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this not make having one channel impossible as it would require an undercut (or overhang) that is then inaccessible to the needle? </p>
<p>Edit. Ignore me.. I thought about it for 5 more seconds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually touched on something, due to the nature of how the signal is generated by the position of the tip of the needle the actual range of sound that can be directly produced is restricted. Its called dynamic range and various attempts were made to compensate the effect electronically in order to generate a richer more natural sound. Techmoan covers it in this video, <a href="https://youtu.be/E5XCvsNUkmI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/E5XCvsNUkmI</a>
Edit, the reason that dynamic range is lessened on stereo vinyl is due to the fact that the range of movement in each channel is limited by the range of movement in the opposite channel. This was due to the requirement to still be able to play existing mono recordings on the same equipment rather than an actual inability to do so. It was possible to make a stylus that had perfect stereo dynamic range however it would have been unable to also play mono recordings accurately as well, it was simply the best compromise they could arrive at. The ideal solution would have been a record with two grooves in parallel with independent needles for each channel however how you would align the needles for each channel in the correct grooves at the same time in the correct orientation is beyond me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah! I actually thought for another 20 seconds after my previous 5 seconds and decided there must be a restriction. Interesting stuff. Thanks for the info!</p></div>		</li>

<p>The compromise is that the two needles are turned 45 degrees, so that the point at which they meet is the needle tip. This way, they can have two axes, while still taking advantage of the greater horizontal space (the axes will both move up and down and left to right).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more important reason for putting the left and right channels at 45 degrees from horizontal is backwards and forwards compatability. If a stereo record player plays a mono record (the track moves left and right only) then the left and right needles will read equal signals, so you get the correct sound out. If a mono record player (needle only moves left and right) plays a stereo record then it will read the average of the left and right channels, so you get acceptable sound out (really the best possible sound, considering the limitations of the mono player).</p></div>		</li>
