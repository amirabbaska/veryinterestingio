			<div class="markdown"><p>In the lay media entanglement is indeed almost always presented in the singlet state, where the twins would indeed get opposite results if they measured in the same direction.</p>
<p>They like this particular state because of this property, which makes it easy to describe, but there are countless other states that if a bit more complicated are just as entangled.</p>
<p>The one I talked about does not always give the same results when the twins measure in the same direction, it does that only if the measurements are in the x-z plane.</p></div>		</li>
