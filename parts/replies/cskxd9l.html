			<div class="markdown"><p>Asians dont have stereotypically smaller penises but even statistically. That doesnt mean that every Asian penis is small but the Asians average is smaller than the worlds average. </p>
<p>Sadly I dont know enough about the living and the cultures in Asia which can affect this too. Many people assume that the penis size is related to the body height (Asians are in fact smaller in height) but I cant tell you if its true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No matter how hard people try to find one, there has never been any verified difference in erect penis size with race or ethnicity. Asians aren't tiny, black people aren't huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cant find the statistic anymore but African penises are definitely bigger than European ones. The hot temperature is also the reason for their bigger nose and lips. Its just about getting maximum surface. Believe it or not. Its a fact. Just because some people think its better to lie because the truth hurts people or these facts could create a new form of racism. </p>
<p>At this point I show you my opinion towards races which could differ from the majority. I believe in different races which visible differences. Asians usually have smaller eyes, africans have mostly brown eyes, etc.
But it doesnt affect (or better: shouldnt; because the race sadly influences the character) the persons behavior. From this point on, its gard for me to show my pov, so I make it short: for me there are different races with different cultures and different values. but in the end, we are all humans and come from the same sperm.
Just because someone is born in another place and thinks different because of their generation or family, it doesnt make him worth more or less</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't find the statistic because no medical journal has ever published one that is methodologically valid. As for different races, we've known there's no such thing since they decoded the genome.</p></div>		</li>
