<p>Edit: To whoever deleted their comment about why I want to know, I'm a computer scientist and find it interesting that these companies have this kind of technology. Tech is cool</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you see them advertising on TV, chances are they have it. For mid sized places it's a bit of a gamble but you can usually tell. Smaller places don't need to rely on it. There's usually only a few managers at the smaller local places and you'll probably get caught pretty fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel you. I just finished up a week long family vacation to both Disney World and Universal and while the fingerprint scanning was a little off putting, it also put my mind at ease knowing my niece and nephew (8 and 2) had their fingers scanned and were a part of our &quot;group&quot; of fingerprints so that if they got lost somehow, their fingers could be scanned and all of our names would appear.</p></div>		</li>
