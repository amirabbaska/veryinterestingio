			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so that's what had me confused is that they sold 1.6billion $2 tickets (give or take since about 50% of the money goes to prizes).  I figured they'd sell every possible combination if they sold that many tickets.  But reading what you posted it sounds like there's quite a lot of overlap in those tickets so a lot lower percentage of the possible combinations is actually played than I thought.  Do I have that correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct. You can do this yourself. Roll a die 6 times, there are only 6 outcomes, but it's pretty unlikely that you would get 1,2,3,4,5,6 chances are better that you'll have a double or two. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's not how it works.</p>
<p>The cash prize in $913M.  The previous cash prize was $690M.  That means they had to earn 223M more for the prize, which works out to about 223M tickets at $2 each (because about half goes to the prize).   There are like 360M combinations, that's how I guessed 2/3 of the numbers sold.</p>
<p>The non-lump-sum number $1.6B is much better marketing, but that's all it is.  The lottery gives the cast prize to an annuity company and they pay you over 30 years, and it's $1.6B including the interest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the odds of a duplicate winning aren't very good, and by that I mean much less good than the extremely unlikely chance of winning. </p>

<p>Are you sure about this?  I imagine that something like the birthday paradox might come into play here to make the chance of a duplicate winning much higher than you give credit for.  I mean if they sold 52% of all possible combinations, that means that a random draw has a 50/50 chance of being a duplicate (unless they only allow unique numbers for the random draw).</p></div>		</li>
