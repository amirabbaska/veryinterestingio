			<div class="markdown"><p>It is most certainly a loss leader.  The warehouse clubs sell rotisserie chickens for $5, which is far less than it costs them.  It's just to get you in the door to shop.</p>
<p>You can truly save a ton of money if you only shop for the loss leaders and sale items.</p>
<p>Also, most state laws have very strict guidelines about bait and switch.  If they do NOT advertise &quot;limited quantities,&quot; then they must either order one for you or offer you something comparable at the same price.</p>
<p>(I spent too much time in retail.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not <em>just</em> a loss leader, though.  Often stores will take any uncooked whole chickens that they haven't been able to sell soon enough and would have to throw away tomorrow and cook them and sell them today instead.</p>
<p>It's not expired, it's perfectly good chicken, but if they didn't sell it today they'd have to throw it away anyway, and not that many people will want to buy uncooked chicken that expires tomorrow.</p>
<p>If they can sell it to you for a little less than what it cost them to buy it in the first place, that's still better for them than throwing it away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the exact same size chicken for $5 at walmart and Sams. It's to get you in the store. Op bought his toward the end of the day after it had been in the cold section. I've done the same thing twice this week. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. I just looked up CO and it appears to have bait and switch laws too. It's worded that a business must supply &quot;reasonably expected public demand&quot; unless the ad states limited quantity. How do they determine &quot;reasonable demand?&quot; I feel like that would be difficult to actually enforce. </p></div>		</li>
