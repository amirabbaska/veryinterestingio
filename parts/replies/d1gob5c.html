			<div class="markdown"><p>Silly: So your saying for humans to &quot;fix&quot; this vision problem we need to reenter the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; race to weed out the flaws in our DNA.</p>
<p>On a more serous note I'm just glad our Tech has gotten to such a high point we can take care of many issues with the human body. The only problem with this is sure we can fix vision problems but those fixes are artificial and won't be passed on to the next generation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well technically, it doesn't have to be that cruel.  If you educate people about this, maybe the people who have defects in their genes would just decide not to reproduce to help protect our gene pool?</p>
<p>Even the method I suggest may sound cruel in this society, but it is definitely one of the cheapest ways compared with alternatives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This brings forth another &quot;interesting&quot; theory for me.  </p>
<p>Lighter colored eyes are brought in relation with more strain light entering the eye.<br />
Sunlight exposure seems to play a role in nearsightedness.  </p>
<p>Cold areas, lots of staying inside, less sunlight exposure.  </p>
<p>What my question would be now is;<br />
Is there any research (South Africa or something) compared to the North Pole/Northern Sweden? This could offer a great reference to the factors above.  </p></div>		</li>
