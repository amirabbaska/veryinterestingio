<p>To explain the principle of superposition, let's have a look at this &quot;simple&quot; <a href="http://imgur.com/ypKgs4p" target="_blank">electrical circuit</a>. I don't mean to bore you with the details and maths of all this, but let's say that I need to find out what current goes through the middle resistor of 3.3 kÎ©. The thing is, it's kind of a pain in the ass to find out because there are two voltage source to consider at the same time... </p>
<p>That's where the principle of superposition gets interesting. Simply put, it means that you can consider the impact of each source individually one after the other and then add up the results to get the final answer. So our inital circuit can be rearranged as <a href="http://imgur.com/UVnVJfC" target="_blank">this one</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/THBk9A3" target="_blank">this one</a> treated one by one and adding up the current in each case, and so it gets super easy (that is, if you know the equations!)</p>
<p>Well, it just so happens that a voltage source like the one in the previous circuit is exactly the same as a wave, it just has a frequency of zero. But this means that the principle of superposition applies to waves as well! So if you have pure waves of different frequencies and add them together <a href="http://imgur.com/uLLdUdG" target="_blank">like in this picture</a> (notice how the second one is slightly more dense than the first one), the resulting wave is not going to become a new &quot;pure&quot; wave: it's just going to become the sum of both waves at every point in time. Have a closer look at the previous graph, and you'll notice that if the 2 waves are aligned and on a crest, the corresponding crest will be twice as high, and if both are in a trough, the corresponding trough will be twice as low, and if one is high and the other is low, the resulting point will be zero. That's the principle of superposition in action! </p>
<p>But the point is that, in no case does the resulting wave become something pure like the two waves in input, just like a pure wave of red added to a pure wave of blue won't give a pure wave of violet or whatever, just like if you hear someone talking and a cat meowing at the same time, it doesn't create a new completely different sound: it's just the two sounds heard at the same time. But, unlike our hearing, our sight is fooled when red/green/blue is added together and it &quot;thinks&quot; it sees a new pure color like violet, and so we use this bug of ours to allow us to watch our bright 50&quot; TV screens when in reality there's only just 3 colors out there.</p></div>		</li>
