			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea who either of them are ... but as someone who worked telcom/isp ... you have no idea of what people do daily with technology.  I should write a book about things I witnessed or stumbled, but honestly the amount of laws that writing it alone would break would take years to prosecute.</p>
<p>Lets be honest here ... all the sleazy things you see on reddit, the hate and the donkey's ... they are all out there free in in the real world &amp; there's more like them who are too busy sitting in City halls across the country reading reports of cellphone taps on their ex-girlfriends/wivesmistresses or summaries of dragnet style &quot;stingrays&quot; assigned to follow their loved ones around.</p>
<p>To quote a marvelous write, &quot;You know nothing John Snow&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT: TL;DR ... no one needs to sensationalize this stuff ... the truth is far more unbelievable &amp; unlike fluff - the truth does not need to resemble anything you expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not speaking to your point about /u/maxwellhill, but they're one of the saner, more hard hitting journalistic organizations out there and do really good, in depth work on a lot of shady things done in tech. I haven't noticed much sensationalism from them. Especially compared to bullshit like what's on TV.</p></div>		</li>
