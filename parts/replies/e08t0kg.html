			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it felt kind of good to sneeze, but I’ve probably only sneezed 5 times in a row max. I can’t imagine 15-20, especially sleeping? I’m glad it’s fixed,  but when you feel like you need to sneeze again you should try to look up into a light, that usually triggers it to come out (-:</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha, yeah I've always actually enjoyed it as well. It was just such a commitment. But if I were home alone with nothing to do for 15 or so minutes, I'd just stick my head in a towel and let 'er rip. I'd be exhausted afterwards. I've tried looking up into a light, as that used to make me sneeze. Not anymore. Odd.</p></div>		</li>

What is this cleaning out? Should I talk to my gp about it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) and it's very common. They clean you out and then widen your sinus openings so they drain better. Several of my friends had it done before me and they all highly recommended it. Changed their lives. I don't actually know if it's really something they do just because of sneezing. It's for people who get chronic sinus infections and headaches and are always getting sick. But if you <em>do</em> have sinus problems, I'm guessing sneezing is a common symptom. It certainly was for me.</p>
<p>Because of my deviated septum, I couldn't naturally breathe through my right nostril for 20 years. That ultimately let to a sinus infection in all my right side sinuses. Tons of polyps.</p>
<p>It's outpatient surgery and most people only miss a single day of work. I can't personally say how bad it is, because I had it done in conjunction with rhinoplasty to correct my septum. So I was on my back for about 2 weeks.</p>
<p>I also can't say how much the FESS has to do with my condition now, since I started getting allergy shots around the same time and they're definitely helping with other symptoms like itchy ears, nose, and throat.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'd definitely talk to your doc. They'd send you to an ENT for a consult. Good luck!</p>
<p>PS: I tried normal septum straightening right after college but it didn't take. The doc told me it wasn't a sure thing and if it didn't help much, I'd have to try full rhinoplasty down the road. Just didn't get around to it for several years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never ever in my life sneezed more than 3 times in a row. It's just not possible for me. 2 times is the most frequent one and when it's like super dusty in an old house the extra 3rd sneeze will make sure everything is unblocked. And I also have problems with sinuses that are not straight and some small allergies. But then again I might have less complications with sneezing, but I have issues with my ears. They're really sensitive and I have a lot of pain in them when changing attitude or getting water into them. I can't dive or stuff like that.</p></div>		</li>
