<p>Glad to hear :3</p>

<p>It depends on your definition of &quot;certainty&quot;. Imagine walking in to an empty kitchen. There are two empty pots on the stove and four empty plates on the table. You can probably tell that four people ate something here. If you have a closer look at the plates, glasses and the pots, you can maybe tell they ate pasta with sauce and drank red wine. Maybe the pots are still kinda warm so you know they left not too long ago. Is this certainty? You pretty much know what happened. Or do you need to know <em>who</em> exactly had dinner here. Do you want to know what exactly they talked about  word for word? Who had how much wine and pasta?<br />
Uncertainty is much more inherent in archaeology than, for example physics. It's a weird hybrid of cultural and natural science, so there is no such thing as &quot;the truth&quot; for us. With that said, some of our methods have really high standards. If we have a complete, not too heavily damaged skeleton, we can determine sex, age, height and general health to a degree that would hold up in court. But we can never tell you what that person thought, what they laughed about, what they worried about when they couldn't sleep...</p>

<p>We're making discoveries all the time at a pace that's impossible for a single person to keep up with. I'm currently preparing a presentation about <em>Homo naledi</em>, a supposedly new genus of human that has many traits it shares with modern humans but also many it shares with more archaic ancestors. It's age is uncertain, it's either very old or rather young and both results would have dramatic implications on our understanding of human evolution. Another exciting field where a lot of change is constantly happening is domestication of crops and animals. We have ideas about where and when it happened but new breakthroughs in gene analysis offer new insights. It turns out that many crops weren't just definitely domesticated ONCE at ONE location but crossbred and slowly adapted many times before they &quot;show up&quot; as clearly domesticated for us. </p>
<p>The thing is, the general public has a different idea about what &quot;discoveries&quot; are. Many people think of spectacular discoveries like Troy, Machu Picchu, Pompey or even expect us to find subjects of myths like Atlantis.<br />
The main problem is that there is never really a <strong>moment</strong> of discovery in archaeology. Single moments like when Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and it was instantly clear he made the discovery of a lifetime are a rare exception, not a rule. How it usually goes is that you discover something, then you make some preliminary excavations, then the media gets wind of it and runs a small story on it. You secure more funds, return many, many years for campaigns, carefully date the artifacts, discuss results, write papers and when you finally have the whole picture and realize how significant it is, nobody's really interested anymore. Because it's not a &quot;bang!&quot; A good example is the Turkish site of Göbekli Tepe, a pre-agricultural temple (?) of enormous proportions. The whole scale, the level of social and technical complexity necessary to build something like this, the symbolism, all of it has huge implications on our understanding of emergence of society. But the excavations there  have been going on for over 20 years and what we know about it is the results of those two decades and not of a single discovery on one day.<br />
Another problem is that archaeologists usually don't have the money to really <em>search</em> for stuff. In Switzerland, we're <em>relatively</em> well funded but we usually just have enough money for &quot;emergency excavations&quot;, to save what's threatened by construction projects or falling lake levels. And even then we only have the money and time to work on the area affected directly (it also usually makes more sense to leave unthreatened finds where they are). </p>
<p>From the top of my head, there are a few discoveries that <strong>might</strong> be made in the future that could make international headlines. Discovering the tomb of Genghis Khan is one. Allegedly, it's located in the middle of nowhere so it's almost impossible to find, if it exists at all. But its discovery could be akin to the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb. Melting glaciers in the Alps might release another ice mummy like Ötzi, which would be pretty significant. My personal guess (and hope) is that another &quot;paleolithic cathedral&quot; like Lascaux might be found somewhere in France. And one I'm fairly certain will happen in the next few years is confirmation that America was settled long before the Clovis culture. Maybe not permanently, maybe not on a large scale. But recently paleontologists discovered mammoth bones in Californa that were most likely manipulated by humans as long as 130'000 years ago, which is long, long before the currently accepted age for initial settlement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very interesting how there are still important sites yet to be discovered. I also had no idea there are still genus of humans who are unknown. I don't know about anything as much as you know about this. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd highly encourage you to go to your local museum and, should you ever see archaeologists in the field, don't be afraid to ask them what they're doing. It's our job to reconstruct our <em>common</em> history. We do what we do for the public, not (only) for our own enjoyment. And if nobody is interested in what we're doing, we can't do our job...  </p>
<p>I'd love to recommend some books to you but unfortunately, I don't really know any good English books on the topic. I'm sure they exist, I just don't know them. &quot;Archaeology - A Very Short Introduction&quot; I vaguely remember being fairly good, but I read that <em>before</em> I started studying so I don't know how it holds up. Also, there are some PBS documentaries about archaeological topics on YouTube and the ones I've seen so far usually were pretty good.</p></div>		</li>
