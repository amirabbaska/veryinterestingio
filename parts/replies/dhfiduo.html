			<div class="markdown"><p>When working at a Christian Retreat center I met a King Jame Only-ist. I had completely forgotten about that till your post but you are right about the conspiracy theories. Dude made a huge deal over how in the KJV one verse said something about fasting and praying, but the NIV only mentioned praying and then lectured me about reading the NIV (what I had on me at the time). I then pulled out my phone app that I generally used when studying so that I could reference multiple translations... but the guy was definitely set on the KJV being the only &quot;correct&quot; one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother's become a KJOist. It's odd because we're not in America and there are hardly any others around here. He doesn't tell me specifically he is one but he's adamant that KJV is the correct version, goes on about the Dead Sea Scrolls, and often brings up various (often US based) conspiracies such as the height of the Washington Monument being a FU to God.</p>
<p>It's so odd. I don't argue with him but I question the things he tells me. He's been the most logical and sensible person I've known my whole life and now he's become this person so I'm showing as much patience as I can with him, despite me not believing and the type of person who is eager for debate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some people are super logical but lack perspective. They believe the first version they hear of anything when they are young, and thne can't let it go. They learn to do logical thinking, but they always cling to the axioms they learned young and can't critically examine themselves</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It messes up the doctrine of sonship and adoption when you turn all the pronouns into neutral ones. It occludes the clear message of Paul which was that God, in salvation, is bringing you into a type of relationship with him that is analogous to the adoption of a male heir in Roman times. </p>
<p>Not female. Not baby. Not &quot;it.&quot; But a place of honor and inheritance, which women and babies couldn't do in that culture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Historical context and a good Greek/Hebrew/Aramaic to English dictionary make the bible so much more interesting. Things like knowing that the Romans were on edge because the Jewish people had recently rebelled a few times before Jesus showed up helps to make many passages make so much more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that Paul was saying that women couldn't receive adoption or inheritance through faith, but rather, addressing men and women, he asserted that adoption and inheritance (not available culturally to women) was equally available to both men and women in Christ. </p>
<p>I know this is what you were saying, just wanted to clarify for those who would see your wording as, oh yeah, Paul hated women. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was hoping to ask you a question as an academic expert. I have religious discussions with a very Evangelical atheist type person. He believes that the person Jesus Christ never existed at all. I have always understood that Jesus Christ was a real person who lived and any argument would be over his divinity. Is it not conclusively proven that Jesus Christ was a real historical person who lived and died? Thanks for your input.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could ask your friend if he believes Socrates exists. It's extremely hard to &quot;prove&quot; someone existed thousands of years ago, especially non-Kings and Emperors, but there is much more evidence that the historical Jesus existed than, for this example, Socrates. But very few people doubt that Socrates wasn't a historical figure, just that we may not know with precise detail what happened in his life. This is common for many historical subjects, for instance we may have a quote from another work but the work itself is lost or the only source of a subject is considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dido#Questions_of_historicity_and_dating" target="_blank">unreliable</a>. </p>
<p>Here's a Wikipedia article about the subject: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus</a></p>
<p>EDIT: An interesting parallel is the existence of the historical City of Troy. In the 19th century almost all serious historians considered Troy a legendary location like Camelot. After the discovery of the ruins of the City of Troy, Homer was reevaluated. Does that mean that the Odyssey is a modern history book? Of course not, but there has been a general trend towards looking at historical documents in a new light rather than in the past when a document with fantastical elements would have been dismissed as a historical document. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a different way of approaching this. I would not do this with everyone, and I'm not saying to do it with your friend. </p>
<p>But I think you've made a rhetorical error. You've allowed him to set the field of play, the rules, and he has you on the defensive. More importantly, he's got God on the defensive. He's judging God and the Bible as lacking according to HIS standards. </p>
<p>I think you need to flip this around. Make him prove that he exists. Make him prove that his mom exists. Make him prove that Plato existed. &quot;Conclusively&quot; prove that Plato exists and then you'll entertain his little notion. </p>
<p>He'll give up, sputter, get angry, and the discussion will be over. </p>
<p>He will need to adopt all our presuppositions in order to prove this, really to prove anything. </p>
<p>This is called Presuppositional Apologetics. </p>
<p>Then when he's sputtering, you hit him with TAG, the Transcendental Argument for the Existence of God. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/transcendental-argument.html" target="_blank">https://www.gotquestions.org/transcendental-argument.html</a></p>
<p>Then just have some coffee and talk it out. Now you are on your playing field, with your presuppositions in play. Not his impertinent questions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. The KJV is beautiful. The NKJV updates it just a touch and still keeps all that Shakespearean iambic pentameter.  The NLT does a nice job with poetry though with a very modern twist that I'm still not concerned about. </p>
<p>The NASB is very literal, I can read it in English and guess the Hebrew/Greek and get it right sometimes (when I remember!). But literal isn't always best for meaning. You miss idioms and colloquialisms that way. </p>
<p>I preach/teach from the ESV. It's the best general translation today IMHO. But they are all good. Really, all our translations are very fine. </p></div>		</li>

I'd never even heard of the others except for the NKJV until seeing them mentioned here.
