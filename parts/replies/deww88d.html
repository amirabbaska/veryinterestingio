			<div class="markdown"><p>Hospitals are often incentivized to send to central labs (where they can bill for every lab, from glucose to potassium... so some barriers are financial, and others in regulatory (the whole Theranos hype and debacle didn't help things). . In general the ability to do POC is expanding, with several devices on the market often used in urgent care/ER or remote clinics (cost per test will still often be more than a central lab). With microfluidics and integration with mobile devices (including smart phones), we'll see more of these tests in patients homes to rural villages. </p></div>		</li>
