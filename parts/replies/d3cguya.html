<p>it has proteins that are basically oily on one end and watery on the other</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Close, but they're not proteins, they're phospholipids (lecithin), the phosphate  groups are polar and attract water molecules, the lipid part of the molecule sit in the fat phase and help to stabilise the mixture.  They're essentially surfactants, like a detergent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>salt causes some of the proteins in the eggs to break down</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Salt, sugar and acids don't always break down proteins, more often they denature them - causing them to fold differently than they do in their native state, so their function is affected, leading to them curdling in some cases.  Cooking also denatures proteins.  The different solutes like salt and acid will bind to the polar groups in the protein so they may interact with the solutes more strongly than with other amino acids, thus affecting the shape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Butter is an emulsification</p>
</blockquote>
<p>emulsion: is the mixture (like mayonnaise)</p>
<p>emulsifier: the surfactant, like lecithin that stabilises an emulsion</p>
<p>emulsification: a process that makes an emulsion - like blending a mayonnaise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely correct. I know very little about chemistry beyond the sort of stuff that affects my cooking, and that has just been sorta pieced together from experience and random magazine articles. . Thank you for clearing up the language and providing the insights. I don't feel bad about not knowing about phospholipids, but I fell kinda dumb for the emulsion thing.</p></div>		</li>
