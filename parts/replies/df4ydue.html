			<div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic here. The same is true for when we yawn or when our fight or flight response is activated(e.g. gasping when surprised). As we get tired we yawn frequently to reopen those alveoli that begin to get &quot;tired&quot; as well with increased parasympathetic response. In fight or flight our body the brain will make that &quot;take a deep breath and get ready for this shit about to go down&quot; signal to the lungs opening the alveoli allowing increased oxygen exchange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just learned about this also but I now remember seeing a video about waters surface tension. Regarding surface tension you could see the water droplet bounce off of water, wouldn't that be tension? If it has a lower surface tension doesn't that mean it would be easier for molecules to &quot;bond&quot; for a lack of better words, and make atelectasis easier?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey friendly neighborhood stoner here, this increased &quot;bonding&quot; effect is actually why surfactants are used in soaps. With the addition of a surfactant oils are able to be dissolved into water, thereby lifting grease and grime off one's dishes.</p></div>		</li>
