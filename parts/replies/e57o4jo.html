			<div class="markdown"><p>Or never existed at all.</p>
<p>To create the convective current required to punch through the atmosphere, it requires an enormous amount of power, sustained over time. That means the nuke itself can't do the 'lifting' of the soot which is produced after it explodes. The idea was that cities were filled with fuel which would provide the necessary thermal energy as it burned, but there are serious questions about whether or not cities would burn hot and fiercely enough to create the conditions which would result in a nuclear winter. It's true that cities are filled with combustible material, but they're also filled with material which does not burn so well like concrete and glass and steel. The experience in Kuwait and Iraq with the (many concentrated) burning oil wells is relevant enough to cast some serious doubt -- I mean, one would have to believe that cities would burn significantly better than oil, I think, in order to believe that the threat from nuclear winter (as put forward originally) ever existed at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A small addendum:</p>
<p>I assumed that you asked about the risk of nuclear winter from the strategic use of nuclear weapons (i.e. on cities and structures). We don't have to constrain ourselves to that... I suppose that if the world was hell-bent on causing a nuclear winter, expending nukes on the same spot repeatedly to 'lift' plumes of particles might feasibly have an impact on climate. Air bursting nukes over and over, higher up every time, would probably create a 'ladder' which would boost a bunch of particles as high as we like. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>concrete, glass and steel don't need to burn if they are vaporized in the flash and those vapors condense in the upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>that being said, the term &quot;nuclear&quot; winter is probably extremely inaccurate, considering it basically has the same effect as a large volcanic eruption (for example, &quot;The Year Without a Summer&quot; was the 18 months after the eruption of Mount Tambora, and to a lesser extent the burning of European cities in both World Wars 1 &amp; 2 might have contributed to what were called the harshest winters that the northern hemisphere had seen during the 20th century) and isn't an uncommon thing to happen for the planet, while an actual nuclear war has never happened (apart from the two popguns that ended WW2)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely if it's petroleum it's going to burn quite cleanly, so the heat transfer is there but with no particulates riding the gradient the winter won't happen.</p>
<p>Look at 9/11 and the volume of particulates created, now add instead of a few thousand gallons of kerosene you have the entire city burning. All the fire resistant insulation is taken way above its retardant temperature into its burn incredibly hot temperature. A million car fires, 4 million tires burning. I wouldn't be surprised if the asphalt itself ignites with these kind of temps, and you've got natural gas lines if not holding tanks depending on the city.</p>
<p>Add another 100 gas stations that probably self ignite with all that going on. And that's just the spark, now you've got millions of sofas, billions of cloths in the houses let along the stores, the carpet on your floor.</p>
<p>The firestorm over a major city that's been nuked is simply impossible to predict, it's got to be on the same level as a major erruption from sheer particulates. Times that by the 1000 cities that are burning and I don't understand how it's even debateable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple points to consider:</p>
<p>1) The burning oil wells did not burn cleanly. We refine petroleum so that it burns cleanly. Straight out of the ground, it doesn't burn super well. Even squirting out of the ground into an aerosol I am skeptical that enough oxygen would be available to support full combustion of raw crude at that scale just from surrounding ambient air. </p>
<p>2) There's plenty of fuel in cities, that's for sure -- but they're also spread over many square kilometers. The actual density of fuel isn't as high as if it was all in one place. I imagine a city fire would be closer to a forest fire, which we know from experience do not cause global cooling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) I completely agree it's raw crude and not refined petroleum or gas as Americans call it, but the commenter said it petroleum so I ran with it.</p>
<p>Sure there is alot more particulate suspended in crude oil but I'd wager it's an order of magnitude less than what a city would produce.</p>
<p>2) were both speculating on what kind of fuel and its energy density is, a mattress factory full of foam could burn 1000 times hotter than a gas station or maybe only half we'd need more information.</p>
<p>And a third point is what's the critical situation needed to create a firestorm that can rip through suburbs? I'd imagine the city combusts enough to create a self sustaining firestorm where convection pulls in more and more oxygen to fuel the fire, imagine 2-3 million homes engulfed. Especially full of highly flammable insulation and the majority at least north american are engineered wood and siding. A forest fire is going to look tame in comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the temps arnt enough to convect the particulates above the water cycle, so they get captured in raindrops and fall back to earth.</p>
<p>Imagine that picture is a city of 10 million plus people, with suburbs of millions of houses and a firestorm with 200mph winds is ripping all the roofs off those houses and igniting the insulation, the wood frames, all the plastics used in manufacturing the foam mattresses the carpets etc. Billions of square metres of highly flammable materials. That smoke from the oil fires wouldn't even be visible under that kind of storm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly there was the idea that the speed of energy release and absolute temperatures reached meant that more ash would get sucked up into the atmosphere faster, giving it less time to cool down and allowing it to rise farther. </p></div>		</li>
