			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think this is a problem with a lot of office buildings built in the 2000s. In the name of HVAC efficiency, everything is super sealed and insulated, so you don't get any fresh air. They call it &quot;Sick Building Syndrome&quot;. All the ozone and toner from the printers can't get out, humidity and fresh air can't get in.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct but only sort of. The V in HVAC stands for “ventilation”, which involves exhausting the inside air and replacing it with outside air at a certain rate (based off a lot of factors but largely volume and expected amount of use). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ACH (Air changes per hour) is calculated from square footage, room volume, occupancy and occupant activity level, and there's pages and paaaaages of tables to consult for it.  I just finished a course on it and it's a real pain in the ass.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, sunlight (UV radiation) is a great disinfectant, and kills airborne microorganisms that don't have specific mechanisms to combat it. So airborne viruses and bacteria from a sick person will be less likely to survive long enough to get into your body in outdoor scenarios. (Density dependent of course, you hit up a music festival or amusement park and all bets are off)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly related: When I was buying a new wood stove, I learned that mobile/manufactured homes are sealed far better than most houses. A normal wood stove can deplete the oxygen in trailers to an unsafe level because They are sealed so well. The fire uses up too much of the available oxygen and not enough &quot;new air&quot; is coming in from the outside. </p></div>		</li>
