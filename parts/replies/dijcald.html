			<div class="markdown"><p>For private companies, it's typically based on valuations for investments... ie. if last round of funding was $2 billion for 5% then that would value the company at $40 billion.</p>
<p>For public companies, obviously the value is the market cap of the shares outstanding and investors make their own determination about future prospects and whether it's worth investing or not. While P/E ratio is useful for mature companies, it obviously doesn't work for money loosing start-up phase companies. So one could look at things like revenue growth, or try to project new product pipeline and that effect on growth.... but look at Amazon or Apple, especially the iPhone. How do you really predict the growth in those? You might see a trend, but don't know if it's a 5x or 1000x growth idea.</p></div>		</li>
