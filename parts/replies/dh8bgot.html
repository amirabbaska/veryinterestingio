			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, graphene is essentially one big ol molecule. Assuming we are talking about wooden planks, we're talking about an array of plant cells all smooshed together. I assume the content of the plank is mostly water and cellulose. It's hard to imagine how you could possibly make that one atom thick without it just falling apart. It's part of why graphene is so neat, and strong besides.</p></div>		</li>
