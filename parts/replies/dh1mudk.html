			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Debt to income ratio&quot; seems pretty straightforward. What if I asked you what your apples to oranges ratio was? You have one apple and two oranges. So you have an apples to oranges ratio of 50%. How much debt vs how much income. It's a simple math problem using math terminology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the ratio is typically how much of your income does it take to make your monthly payments.</p>
<p>Like I could have $60,000 in debt, which I have to pay $1,000 on every month.  My monthly income could be $5,000 (annual of $60,000).</p>
<p>So my debt to (annual) income would be 60,000/60,000 = 100%.  But really we're more interested in the 1,000/5,000 = 20% (which is how much it costs to service the debt).</p>
<p>I get what they mean by it, but I think there's better terminology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What could be simpler? It's exactly what the words suggest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>debt service ratios (DSRs), which represents the amount of your gross monthly income that needs to be used to service your debts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not pretty much, it's the exact same thing. They're both a figure of how much of your income goes towards paying your debt and a mortgage company won't push you above a certain amount which sounds like the same amoutn (45%) for both the US and Canada. I'm really not sure what is confusing about this.</p></div>		</li>
