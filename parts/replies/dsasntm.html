			<div class="markdown"><p>More like blood sugar is so variable that for this to be at all useful you need to have a huge sample and a lot more controls. In other words, you can't take anything from one person doing this experiment, once. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. At any time I would expect a 5-20pt difference between tests.</p>
<p>However, as a T1D for 20+ yrs, artificial sweeteners do not raise your blood sugar. It's really that simple. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would support the theory that the brain’s reaction to sensing the sweetness of food sends an insulin surge thereby reducing blood sugar &amp; explains why later on you crave/eat more sweet things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are probably triggering an insulin response, but the substitutes <em>by themselves</em> do not increase or decrease blood sugar. I think they are signaling to the body that they are sugar (but don’t follow through with actual glucose) so the pancreas makes extra insulin, which eats into the coffee alone’s blood sugar portion instead.</p></div>		</li>
