			<div class="markdown"><p>You know what the issue is? Everything is cheaper as you said, but that doesn't increase the wealth of people. They just buy <strong>more</strong>. Look at the kids going to Primark, what they carry out there every day is insane. Think about how clothes were bought in the sixties and how it is today. Think about cheap dollarstuff from china. Plush toys. All that stuff. The west is importing garbage, not cheap standard of living.
People like to consume stuff, they want to buy stuff, and they will spend all their money either way. The only difference is that before, people saved up all their money and buy something nice one day, and today people buy cheap shit and have nothing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>your iphone, which has parts and rare earth minerals from all over the world, doesn't cost $1500</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But surely &quot;on average&quot; our trade balance is negative? Which means all our great standards of living is just about us borrowing from the future?</p>
<p>That looks like a very questionable improvement.</p></div>		</li>
