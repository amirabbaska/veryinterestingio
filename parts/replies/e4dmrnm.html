<blockquote>
<p>The actual identification of patient zero can be important in stopping the spread of a disease as it can allow medical staff to identify the source of an outbreak, whether it is a cooling tower (legionella), animal to human transmission (flu viruses, SARS/MERS and ebola), contaminated food (E.coli, listeria), etc. Knowing patient zero and their habits can help narrow down possible sources for the outbreak. A recent trip to Saudi Arabia could be the source of a MERS outbreak, or the commute to work could pass a contaminated steam outlet for example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These can also be used for a baseline in looking at how the pathogen evolves in a population over tieme, this helping create more effective treatments both during the outbreak and in possible future outbreaks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh that makes sense. I assume if patient zero dies, it would be harder to find said cooling tower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. As long as you have a good idea who the person was it's still possible to reconstruct their daily routines. It's basically good old detective work. On top of this there are often more than one patient zeros. For example, IIRC, Southern Africa had 200+ listeria outbreaks over the past year or so. It was discovered that every &quot;patient zero&quot; had eaten the same brand of sausage thus allowing investigators to identify the plant that was the source.</p></div>		</li>
