			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid like maybe 11-13 years old I used to do this. This was in the 90s. I used to pretend I was an underage girl and send photos taken off the web to older male perverts.</p>
<p>After the 2nd or 3rd picture I would sent them a program disguised as a picture giving me full access to their computer. I don't remember the program I used to do this, if someone can name one of those old programs I am would appreciate it, it would be a trip down memory lane.</p>
<p>My favorite thing to do was to type on their search bar that I was the FBI or some shit then delete windows. </p></div>		</li>

<p>He get's messaged one day from a girl he didn't know on Facebook, but he accepted her friend request because she was hot. </p>

<p>Anytime anybody complains about Facebook, I just don't understand it at all. This. These are the people who complain about Facebook. If people criticize Facebook it tells me more about them and their ability to understand how something works than it does about Facebook. </p>
<p>You pick what subs you want on reddit, you pick what 'friends' or brands or organizations you follow on Facebook. It is no different than someone showing up and subscribing to nothing but r wtf, athiesm, watchpeopledie, and then complaining how negative and depressing reddit it.</p>
<p>Maybe subscribe to only aww and eyebleach and have a totally different experience with the site. You can have a perfectly acceptable Facebook experience as well.</p></div>		</li>
