			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless these algae can deter soil erosion, expel moisture into the atmosphere, feed animals of every imaginable order, and provide a home for birds, the side effects of widespread deforestation starts to become more problematic than just determining adequate CO2 and O2 levels in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>
