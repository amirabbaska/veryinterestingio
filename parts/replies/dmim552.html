			<div class="markdown"><p>Just nitpicking here but I wanted to point out two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>compacted/rammed earth is made of compacted soil, but nuclear tests occur far into bedrock, which in many locations starts no more than 10 feet underground. Hence, using compacted earth as an exemplar for the earth involved in a nuclear test is likely not accurate, unless the nuclear test site is in an ancient valley in the desert that was filled in with sand, which has the same density as compacted earth.</p>
</li>
<li>compacted earth is not dense. 1600kg/mÂ³ is only 1.6 times more dense than water. Bedrock is typically 2-3 times denser than water, so nuclear blasts have even more work cut out for them than you portrayed in your comment</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Density is all relative. Compared to air, water is super dense. Water is more dense than many organic compounds that are liquid at room temperature, like alcohol and oils. However, nearly all solids that don't contain tiny air pockets (such as pumice) are denser than water. Metals are usually 5-10 times denser than water, but some like gold, tungsten, and osmium are over 19 times denser than water. To get a sense of how dense gold is, about 2.5 teaspoons of gold has the same mass as an entire cup of water.</p>
<p>Water is not known for being dense, but it does have some significant interesting properties. One is that the solid form is less dense than the liquid form. Water is also known for having a very high specific heat. It takes much more energy to heat up a cup of water than it does to heat up a cup of gold to a given temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. </p>
<p>It's denser than gaseous air, by a lot. </p>
<p>Solids tend to beat it if their composition is mainly elements after oxygen... Well this is not generally true, it is often true. </p>
<p>Compare these densities with steel or most metals, or probably rocks, and you'd find that water is not very dense. </p>
<p>Though, supposedly you'd be able to stand on mercury if there was enough of it in an area, and you didn't slip, which would be difficult. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know how they dig a hole that deep? Lol. Is it just a hole or is it a giant hole, is there anything in the hole besides dirt? I always imagined it being in some giant underground cement chamber with cameras and stuff but that's probably just my imagination because obviously everything would get wrecked. I've always been fascinated by nuclear tests </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know exactly how the hole is dug.  Suffice to say it's drilled slowly but surely.  Also, to help contain fallout, the hole was in a &quot;j&quot; or hook shape.</p>
<p>400 tons of test equipment were also placed in the shaft and probably a lot of it was destroyed, but may have been designed to relay data up until destruction, or be recovered afterward to be analyzed.  How they would recover something that deep underground, though, I have no idea.</p></div>		</li>
