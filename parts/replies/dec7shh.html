			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is wrong. We can do this. ABB (the European version of GE and employer of 135,000 people) <em>is</em> doing this. Basically run a bunch of solar power panels in North Africa and use them to power Europe. It's called the &quot;European Grid Vision&quot; and, like all great death metal music, was conceived in the 1990's.</p>
<p>What changed?</p>
<p>The advent of production ready Hybrid HVDC breakers.</p>
<p>Backing up, it's a common misconception that DC is less efficient for transmission than AC. At high voltages and currents, DC is more efficient but significantly harder to &quot;Grid&quot; - i.e. hookup a bunch of power stations in parallel and failover if one goes offline. </p>
<p>As a very dumb ELI5 analogy: High Voltage AC is like a speaker at a rock concert. The energy travels pretty far (and fades off) and if you need to turn it off it's a simple switch - or you just stop playing. It's a million angry pixies dancing in a field. Music stops playing, the pixies stop dancing. High Voltage DC power on the other hand is like a freight train - it takes a lot of energy to get it going but once it's going it's trucking, it's not fading off, and it's efficient. The problem is you can't stop it on a dime. Imagine a million angry pixies sliding down one of those super steep water slides fast as they can, except the water slide is as wide as the Colorado River and they're all packed shoulder to shoulder and did I mention? There's a million of them. If the ones in front suddenly want to stop sliding? Well guess what. Not happening.</p>
<p>This ability for DC to not 'stop on a dime' meant you couldn't switch it, which meant you couldn't grid it - unless, well, you built mini-versions of power stations that popped up every couple of blocks in a neighborhood. To use one analogy, it's like throwing a spigot on your home's plumbing. Easy to turn the water on and off when it's 1/2&quot; pipe - throw a spigot on the Colorado and it's just going to get washed away. To use the other analogy, it's the equivalent of using a bunch of hand trucks to move power around rather than a freight train. The mini-station model was less efficient and meant investors did not choose to build the nation's grid with DC. It's a subtle nuance in the AC/DC efficiency debate - and part of the reason why Edison was so pissed at Tesla - he believed you could grid DC if you could solve the switching problem and scale it up it was the clear winner. Nobody really listened because all he had to show for it was an army of cute hand trucks and a dead Elephant. Nothing compared to Darth Tesla and Emperor Westinghouse and the unbridled firepower of the fully armed and operational Niagara Falls Adams Power Station. But anyways, whatever, that's ancient history. DC is more efficient than AC, it's why we use it to maximize our phone's battery life, and why (if we could figure out how to scale it up) use it to connect grids.</p>
<p>But starting in the late 1960's ABB began making strides in being able to switch high voltage DC. The original breakers were mechanical single stage devices that murdered people. Later we got two stage breakers. Fast forward 60 years they have perfected High Voltage DC switching by using a three stage DC breaker. Again, a very dumb analogy, but the idea is rather than force a freight train to stop on a dime by slamming on the brakes (1 stage breaker), you throw in a steering wheel, kind of it flick one way (1st stage), then quickly turn the other (2nd stage), and full on jack-knife yourself while shifting into second as your engine is banging off the limiter (3rd stage) and you come to a calm collected stop facing the other direction, parallel parked between a Fiat Campagnola and a Porsche 944 staked out front of the Olive Garden. If you're running booze illegally this is called a bootlegger's turn. If you're running a gigawatt of energy it's called a VSC-HVDC Netzentwicklungsplan and it takes 10ms.</p>
<p>That ABB figured out how to switch HVDC shouldn't have happened. (This was a couple of years ago in 2012 with some whispers in 2006) ABB gets such an epic scoop on GE, announces the Hybrid HVDC is production ready (something GE experts thought wouldn't wouldn't happen until 2030) and we are still reeling from the implications. Suddenly the unit economics of 100 year old grid have a whole new floor on long distance transmission cost. It's like ABB is Burt Reynolds and just perfected the handbrake turn in his 5.0L Trans Am while simultaneously lashed to Snowball in his eighteen wheeler and 352 eighteen wheelers behind it and GE is just standing there like Buford T. Justice gawfawing and jumping on his hat.</p>
<p>We can use solar from North Africa, wind farms in the Baltic, geo-thermal in Iceland to power the entire continent. The prevalence of large bodies of water makes 'right of way' pretty simple - you essentially couple the local AC grids to high voltage DC lines running under the Mediterranean or the Black or the North Seas. You can dam and fill up fjords using solar power connected during the day, and drain them to generate hydro at night. The idea that one alternative energy is going to win out suddenly doesn't need to be true for the technology to scale.</p>
<p>When we grid these grids we call them Supergrids. (Kind of like how we call a network of networks an internetwork or internet for short.)</p>
<p>The advent of supergrids means nations can trade on energy like brokers trade on stocks. That it simultaneously smooths demands, guarantees new income, and lets Europe backoff from their current largest supplier of energy and aggressor (Russia) guarantees it will be funded.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer but don't forget high voltage DC... we use that to move power over long distances.</p>
<p>Also, small example. I'm in AZ and have a 5.6kw solar system on my house. The system only reaches that in the afternoon and even then it is only around 4.5kw. The second a cloud goes over my house it drops considerably. I have seen it drop all the way down to 280w in the middle of the afternoon with rain clouds! So not only do we need enough production to run the homes during the day and enough production to simultaneously charge batteries to supply loads at night but we also need enough storage to make up for these massive power swings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's tricky to explain without a small grasp on the difference between AC and DC:</p>
<p>DC (direct current) is current a flow of electrons in a single direction (electrons, which are negatively charged, flow to the positive due to attraction). </p>
<p>AC (alternating current) is current that has electrons flowing essentially back and forward.</p>
<p>Solar cells generate electricity by allowing photons to collide with electrons, &quot;energizing&quot; them. This means that light will hit an electron and &quot;knock it loose&quot; (as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_solar_cells" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> says). This electron has to go somewhere, and since it's negatively charged it flows to positive, i.e. in a direct direction. Hence direct current (DC) is generated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AC is an oscillation. To produce AC you need something that moves back and forth in a cycle. This usually means something that is spinning, which is why generators produce AC.</p>
<p>The sun isn't spinning (at least not 60 times per second, from the point of view of your roof)*, and it's certainly never &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;backwards&quot; or &quot;opposite&quot;, at least not in a useful sense. It's either shining or it isn't. Therefore, photovoltaic panels produce DC current. We can convert DC to AC with electronics, but that incurs losses.</p>
<p>Other sources of DC have the same lack of reciprocation or movement. Batteries, RTGs (nuclear batteries), etc. It's also worth noting that converting AC to DC is easier than converting DC to AC.</p>
<p>Thermal solar plants convert solar radiation to heat and then use that to boil water and spin a turbine. Those do produce AC. It's the turbine that mechanically converts the linear motion of the steam into the rotating motion of the shaft. Most every other form of electricity production uses spinning turbines of some sort, and hence makes it easy to generate AC.</p>
<p>* Technically, if you arranged PV panels in a loop around the equator, corrected in three segments in a particular configuration, then yes, you could turn the Earth into a giant photovoltaic solar AC generator running at 0.000012Hz. Needless to say, this is neither practical nor useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People like to say solar isn't viable because the battery tech isn't there yet; while battery tech does has to catch up, batteries aren't the only way to store energy. Solar can be coupled to pumping stations to fill hyrdo-electric dams, which drain at night or during periods of peek use. Focusing on a single storage solution as a barrier is disingenuous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DC transmission efficiency increases with voltage. The longest transmission lines are typically DC lines with huge inverter/converters on either end. It's cheaper because it's as efficient or more efficient, plus it takes fewer conductors to transmit 3 phase power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that HVDC is much more cost effective due to efficiency on the lines, but these huge inverters are currently so pricey that it almost makes it as expensive as an AC transmission line. Another issue is that these HVDC systems don't have reliable circuit breakers yet that won't arc and wear down quickly causing faults and unplanned outages. This is why it isn't as widely used. While I agree that it is possible we just aren't there yet with the technology.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Whereas it is true that converter stations are hellishly expensive, HVDC has advantages at AC simply can't match.  As the distance goes up, the capacitive losses on AC lines will literally leak all the power to ground.  If the run is underwater or underground then the distance AC can work is much shorter due to the increased capacitance.</p></div>		</li>
