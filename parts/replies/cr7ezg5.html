			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes developers accidentally use filenames/URLs that set off Adblocker, like &quot;advertisement.js&quot; for &quot;notifications/warnings/news&quot; (&quot;advertissement&quot; is French) and then their website inexplicably breaks for Adblock users :\</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I ran into that at my last job - we changed some of our URL params and it took me about half an hour of swearing and trying to trouble shoot my local instance of our app before I figured out that I needed to turn adblock off. Maddening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me at an old job as well. I was pretty happy when I did finally figure it out, because it was as simple as not calling it an ad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I did that. We had a bit of the site called &quot;Assessment Design Tool&quot; that I shortened to ADTool. Oops.</p>
<p>Luckily I use uBlock, so I caught it before we deployed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is exactly how most of those tools work. To add to that, what I haven't seen anyone mention yet is that Adblock blocks per CSS class and frame dimensions too. For example if a frame is 300px wide and 250px high, it will get blocked as well as elements with classes like '300x250-frame'. What these anti-Adblock tools do is add baiting classes to the site, if any of them aren't loaded, it means they are being blocked.</p></div>		</li>
