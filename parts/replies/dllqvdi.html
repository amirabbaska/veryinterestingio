			<div class="markdown"><p>Exciting!!  Which one?  HBO  or Fuertes?  Both are still being used!  HBO is used for astronomy/physics majors to learn about operating telescopes and Fuertes is used by the undergraduate Cornell Astronomy Society and hosts many outreach events for the general public!  -Thea</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry it took me so long to reply.  It was Fuertes.  One of the finer experiences of my life.  I was generally the only person there, so had plenty of time to experiment and search for various objects, such as the Ring nebula, Horsehead, etc.  </p></div>		</li>
