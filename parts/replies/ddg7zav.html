<p>Music is basically either s smooth curve (nice clean tones) or a big mess (think distorted electric guitars).</p>
<p>On a CD, there's 44100 samples per second (per channel).</p>
<p>Of one sample is wrong in s &quot;messy&quot;, it doesn't matter. Nobody will ever notice.</p>
<p>If one sample is missing in a smooth part, you can just interpolate it. Assume it's right in the middle between the previous sample and the next sample. Nobody will ever notice.</p>
<p>This is why computer data needs more error correction than audio, which is why an audio cd has more storage than a data cd.</p>
<p>One frame on an audio CD is 1/75 second. At 44100 samples, 2 channels, 2 bytes (16 bits) per sample, one frame of audio is 44100<em>2</em>2/75 = 2352 bytes. One frame of data is 2048 bytes, the rest is error correction.</p>
<p>2048/2352 ~= 650/750</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More that the error correction can notice an error and either fix it or guess close enough that we can't register the difference.</p>
<p>Actually missing the data is usually audible, as it completely changes the numbers, or leaves a blank hole. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is specific to burned CDs (pressed CDs do not have dye), and ignores error checking and correction, which is the real answer (and applies to all discs).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and to clarify further, pressed CDs work on the same general principle of areas that reflect the laser light or not, but on a pressed CD the ones and zeros are represented by indentations (or lack thereof) called pits and lands stamped into the aluminum layer, rather than by marks burned into a dye.  This makes pressed CDs more durable than home-burned one.</p></div>		</li>
