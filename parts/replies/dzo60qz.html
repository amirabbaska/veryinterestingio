			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pledge of Allegiance was written much later, and was adopted during World War II.  The only religious phrase in it, &quot;under God&quot;, was added in the 1950s as part of an effort to re-emphasize Christianity in America as a counter to Communist atheism.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pledge of Allegiance did not exist during the time of our nation's founding. It was not formally adopted by Congress until 1942, and was written some time during the civil war.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the founding fathers would be appalled to hear the pledge of allegiance and its use in our society, since they were &quot;enlightened&quot; philosophers and thinkers first and foremost. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Some were, some weren't.  Thomas Paine definitely was definitely a deist, Samuel Adams appears to have been a very conservative Christian, many of the others were somewhere in between.</p>
