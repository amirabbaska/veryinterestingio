			<div class="markdown"><p>1)As a med student I've been taught that ketone bodies can be used by the brain.
2) Your premise for rapid brain death in deprivation of oxygen is mistaken. It's a fact that the brain has hardly/no energy stores and hence rely on blood oxygen and glucose normally. However, when suddenly deprived of oxygen, the brain cannot keep up with energy demand as there is simply no other way for it to produce.
To understand better, deprivation of oxygen should be seen as a sudden loss of energy with an inability to switch to other sources.
Ketone bodies are produced in long-term starvation state by the liver and can be used in the brain via  conversion into acetyl-CoA to feed the Krebs cycle.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I think I was under the false impression that because the brain can't do any anaerobic respiration I forgot there isn't any reason it should've be able to use ketones as it's not an anaerobic form, just a different fuel source for producing nadh fadh2 for ETS.  Thanks for the clarification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No &quot;usable&quot; energy stores, right? Since a lot of the brain is actually made up of saturated fat... Maybe that's where the danger lies regarding ketosis</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the brain is fatty due to the large amounts of myelin made and these cannot be used for energy. Danger of ketosis is mainly due to it causing acidosis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm surprised that you were taught that the brain cannot use ketones, as this is standard knowledge in the very early stages of medical training.  I didn't realize it was a controversial topic, I thought these pathways had been known for decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I thought that the effect of a low carb diet was a pretty well known, the body uses ketones instead of glucose for energy, including brain functions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more that the brain can't use any anaerobic forms, relies entirely on ETS that I've been taught, often simplified as fully dependent on glucose.  It's been a while since neurophys (8years) and this is just from mamphys, so prof just generalized.  Not a controversial topic, just making sure I have my facts straight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is just a jumping off point, but the small amount of research we have thus far (relatively speaking) indicates that ketone bodies can fuel the majority of brain activity, and there is some evidence to suggest it might be more efficient and promote higher mental acuity than using glucose as fuel. Happy reading!</p></div>		</li>
