			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctors and the pharmaceutical industry have statistics about the quality of life improvements while a cancer treatment, but you will never find a doctor that will say &quot;quality of life&quot; in conjunction with a cancer treatment like chemotherapy or radiation therapy. That are internal- and educational-only statistics, not for normal patients. </p>
<p>The very most patients are shocked after a cancer diagnosis and don't ask about the 5-year survival-forecast and the qol improvements while a therapy in the last 20 years, they just want to be &quot;healed&quot; with few side effects as possible.</p></div>		</li>
