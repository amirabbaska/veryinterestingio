			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to bash your analysis of the scene, I find it fascinating, but is there any evidence to suggest all of the things you infer were actually planned/intended by Welles ?</p>
<p>There's just so much in one short scene that I wonder how much of what you describe was planned and how much seems intentional but wasn't.</p>
<p>Forgive my ignorance, but how much of a genius was Welles ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it really isn't my own analysis.  I just regurgitated what people have been saying about that shot for the past 60+ years.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeQOJZ-QzBk" target="_blank">Even Donald Trump has made similar observations about the movie.</a> </p>
<p>What exactly do you mean by &quot;evidence&quot;?  There isn't like a notebook of his or something that maps out his thought process.  But if you look at all of his films you will start to notice a pattern with how he works, and it becomes clear that it's not a coincidence that he was the director of so many masterpieces.  Even within Citizen Kane, literally every scene is filled with rich layers of theme and meaning like this.  </p>
<p>Welles was also a big deal before he even started directing films.  He was very successful in theater and co-founding the Mercury Theatre (which many of the actors in Citizen Kane came from, including Joseph Cotton).  It's pretty hard to argue the guy wasn't a genius.   (Fun fact, he made Citizen Kane when he was 24)</p>
<p>Yes, there is so much in one shot, but there is a lot more that I didn't go into.  The things I pointed out where just basic film theory - the film form and Mise-en-sc√®ne - and not in depth with the narrative and philosophical components.  I point this out only because it is very easy to assume this was all planned and whatnot because this sort of film form is somewhat easy for an average audience to digest, if that makes sense.  For example, <a href="http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/15400000/Nosferatu-nosferatu-1921-15461267-700-552.jpg" target="_blank">low angles are often used to make a figure appear intimidating, etc.</a>  Welles of course worked very closely with the actors and his cinematographer, Gregg Toland, to create the final film, but he was still the man calling the shots (pun?).  </p>
<p><a href="https://mindreels.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/citizen-kane-940x403.jpg" target="_blank">Just take a look at this shot.</a>  That shot is actually two separate shots that were put together in post.  One shot is the closeup of Orson Welles as Kane, and the other is the a wide of Joseph Cotton.  Why did they do this?  Because it would have been impossible to have both characters in focus otherwise.  You don't go to all that trouble unless you're intending to convey something. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts.</p></div>		</li>
