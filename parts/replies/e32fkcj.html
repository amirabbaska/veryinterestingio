			<div class="markdown"><p>Once a massive black hole forms, it can grow by accretion of gas, stars or merging with other black holes. The formation of the progenitors or &quot;seeds&quot; of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies, however, is still an ongoing research. But for sure when we have a super massive black hole it will sink to the center of the Galaxy, which is minimum of the gravitational field. That's why we have massive black holes in the center of the galaxies. </p>
<p>How the black holes form in the first place is also not 100% clear. The more conservative explanation is that they formed from the collapse of the first massive stars (hundreds of solar masses) in dense stellar clusters, but there are other explanations such as large gas clouds (&quot;quasi-stars&quot;) or primordial black holes that started growing right after the Big Bang. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the information. I felt like the original question was more about the “why” rather than the “how”. Are there any thoughts about what the purpose of a black hole is? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It ultimately comes down to &quot;what is gravity&quot; and &quot;what is the purpose of gravity&quot;.  I think it is a fair categorization (of gravity) that a black hole is a magnitude higher than a star which is a magnitude higher of a planet and so on.  So what purpose does a star play or a planet play - in that which is our universe.  At this point, it is philosophical.</p>
<p>IMO: it helps make things move.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How could it have a purpose? We can't visit a black hole, so it has no use to us.</p></div>		</li>
