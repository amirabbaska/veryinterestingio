			<div class="markdown"><p>A shame that hard drive manufacturers don’t follow this principle. To them 1 gigabyte is 1000 megabytes. Hence why a 320 gigabyte drive formatted only has something like 290 useable gigabytes </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this definition was adopted after the HDD manufacturers lobbied the ISO and IEC. The manufacturers lost some lawsuits prior to this so it was in their commercial interest to get the standards changed.</p>
<p>Originally : KB = 2^10 byte, MB = 2^20 byte, GB = 2^30 byte, TB = 2^40 byte. after the redefinition those values are named KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB. while KB 10^3, MB 10^6, GB 10^9, TB 10^12 are supposedly the new values of the original units.</p>
<p>interestingly the HDD manufacturers marketing departments seem to have only changed their definition of GB (10^9 byte) as they currently sell 1000 GB (931 GiB) drives not 1TB (909 GiB) drives even though they are labelled as TB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct!  Which has always amused me as “back in the day” of early computing, the OS - pre Microsoft - used multiples of 1024 kilobytes to make a megabyte </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, because selling a 320GB drive for price X when your competitor hasn't done the same mathematical gymnastics and so for the same price X, they are selling the exact same amount of bits but marketing the drive as 312GB. Which HD will you buy? Especially if you don't know any better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is worth adding that they use binary because they function by looking for features that (roughly) have two states, e.g., on or off, high or low, positive or negative, and all these things can be abstracted as zero or one, which can then be used to encode numbers as binary digits. </p></div>		</li>
