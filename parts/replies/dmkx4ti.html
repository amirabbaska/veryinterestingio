<p>when loans were used for production rather than consumption as had been the case in the past</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very elegant explanation of the distinction, though it occurs to me now that a mortgage is more of a consumption loan than a production loan. o_O</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mortgages are production because they provide a long-term cost benefit, in that otherwise you would continue to pay rent indefinitely.</p>
<p>It's like how if I take a business loan and buy new machinery, that's not directly more productive, but it could reduce my long-term overheads for repair, energy used etc. It might have a minor effect on productivity directly but over time be cost effective over maintaining an older unit, making it a productive purchase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mortgages are a completely different matter, because when banks create loans this is actually new money entering the economy</p>
<p>They don't take the money from someone else's savings, they actually create money de novo
Business loans created by banks are the same</p>
<p>Loans between people or nonbank companies are a completely different matter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Niall Ferguson's <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/ascentofmoney/" target="_blank">The Ascent of Money</a> is pretty accessible (plainly written and argued) and provides a great exploration of how interest came to be, if not how it become socially acceptable. (At least his book does, not sure about the video.)</p>
<p>E: flipped parens and brackets. (Thx! Always get them mixed up.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this; this is the actual purpose of loans. They are supposed to be a win for everyone except in the worst case. The problem is the loans people take for  themselves for various reasons (child support, drug abuse, etc) which have only worst case possibilities.</p></div>		</li>
