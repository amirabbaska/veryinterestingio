			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in fact when we buy short bits of DNA (oligonucleotides) they often are sent through the mail dry, in what looks like an empty tube, with instructions for adding water. It turns back into DNA almost instantly.</p>
<p>Note that DNA can break so you probably can't send a whole chromosome that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Addition of cations is pretty much necessary to efficiently precipitate DNA.</p>
<p>Contrary to lab lore, just about any small cation will do just fine. Sodium is just the easiest to deal with in downstream applications because it tends not to much with enzymatic reactions as readily as something like Mg2+.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on if you are trying to precipitate plasmids or oligomers.</p>
<p>Small oligomers require larger cations and sometimes carrier polymers to get reasonable recovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Linear polyacrylamide for the win!</p>
<p>Although, I've found high [NaCl] and 85% EtOH gives me about 75% recovery as well for precipitating 30-mer oligos that were enzymatically modified. </p>
<p>Not that the new methods are bad, but I get the feeling that a lot of molecular biologists know very little real nucleic acid chemistry. There are a lot of tricks developed way back in the 80s buried in old NAR papers  that still work.</p>
<p>A while back I was flat out told that precipitating T7 RNA pol synthesize RNA probes for In Situ hybridization with sodium acetate as impossible because the convention is to use LiCl. My recovery was in the 90% range... I don't think that people realize that the LiCl precipitation of RNA is used because it was originally developed to help fractionate out ribosomal RNA from genomic DNA. If you've already DNAse I digested your RNA template, what reason do you have for needing to selectively precipitate RNA from DNA?</p></div>		</li>
