			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't remember who said it where, nor the exact words. The original poster's idea was that our subconscious constantly weights risk and reward as a background process. So it takes the burden of rearing a child and compares it with the rewards. If found lacking, babies are automatically placed in the &quot;disagreeable&quot; pile of things in our mind. It does the same for the puppy and when either idea comes up, it gets compared with other related liked/disliked stuff and selects the one more preferable to the other.</p>
<p>In other words, babies come with more responsibilities and personal loss than you wish to experience, while puppies don't. Therefore, you find babies to be annoying and puppies to be cute.</p>
<p>Now i'm not sure how accurate this idea is and do not care enough to verify it further for you. Perhaps one day your desires and needs will change and babies will become your most important goal, but then again perhaps not. Either way, happy new year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting idea. I find babies to be quite stressful because they're so helpless I worry about them. If someone asks me if I want to hold a baby I'm like God no, I'm not taking that responsibility. I've dropped loads of things in my life, what if I drop him/her!? Happy new year to you as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you dealt with a puppy while raising it? Or are all your memories of someone else taking care of the dog? I realized I was like this because I'd had a large amount of negative baby experiences in the past (planes/public transport/public anything) but almost all negative puppy experiences are in private. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had two dogs, both of whom I had since they were pups and I never really got annoyed. When they did poop on the rug I always understood they were doing their best so I understood. Never had to look after a baby and they still bore me. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I have no real explanation for this, but I feel the same way. </p></div>		</li>
