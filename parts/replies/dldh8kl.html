			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really right. It just depends on the point of reference. His prediction was 25% lower than actual, and the actual was 33% higher than his prediction. There is no single right formula, it just depends on the point of reference and how you phrase it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the standard definition. Yes, you can semantically construct a situation in which it's appropriate to say &quot;33%&quot; but that would represent a deviation from the standard method of calculation. Generally, you would resolve such ambiguities by adopting the standard formula, and reserve the non-standard formula for specific semantic constructions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>or if you want to go by the standard, go by whats taught in stats. Hes off by 25%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When talking about a <em>predicition</em>, such as &quot;percent growth&quot;, you use starting values:</p>
<p>| (final - initial)| / initial</p>
<p>|(4-3)|/3 = 1/3 = 33%</p>
<p>Absolute value isn't <em>necessarily</em> required, as the sign of the result tells if you under- or overestimated.</p>
<p>So, -33% = underestimated by 1/3; % error in the estimation was 25%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This formula works in a scientific setting where the actual value (sometimes called the theoretical value) is the value that has been established by previous research. The experimental value (sometimes called the measured value) is the measured value obtained in an experiment. </p>
<p>Since there is no previous research to establish the theoretical value (because the GDP was measured in the future and no previous research on the GDP of that year could have existed), there is no actual value in this particular scenario. The 4% is in fact the experimental value, because it was measured not already established. </p>
<p>The percent error is completely relative to the wording of the question. </p></div>		</li>
