			<div class="markdown"><p>Toughness is the property of being resistant to the propagation of a crack, the opposite of brittle. Rubber is extremely tough. </p>
<p>Resistance to shear force is material strength, a metal probably tops the list. Maybe a high carbon steel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Toughness is the amount of energy required to propagate a crack relative to the size of the crack. Whilst most rubbers are incredibly ductile and can deform significantly before fracture since they aren't particularly strong they aren't as tough as metals such as copper and some steels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was guessing it would be amorphous steel but <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/7752/" target="_blank">it looks like  I'm totally wrong</a>. It's still an amazing material <a href="http://www.stainless-steel-world.net/mobile/blogs/271/amorphous-steel-alloy-breaks-records-for-strength.html" target="_blank">in terms of strength</a> though. </p></div>		</li>
