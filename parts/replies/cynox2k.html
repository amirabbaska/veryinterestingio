			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought P.metallica was an autocorrect mistake for 'pet tarantula' before I realized it was taxonomic haha</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poecilotheria_metallica" target="_blank">Poecilotheria metallica</a> is a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Poecilotheria_metallica.JPG" target="_blank">beautiful creature</a> by the way. Some facts from the wiki article:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Indigenous to the state of Andhra Pradesh in central southern India</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characterized by fractal patterns down its back and colorful metallic blue legs, similar to other members of its genus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no recorded human deaths from their venom, though their bite is considered medically significant with symptoms including intense pain, increased heart rate, and minor discomfort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First discovered in a town called Gooty, earning it the common name of Gooty sapphire ornamental tree spider, Gooty sapphire, and Gooty tarantula, among others.</p>
</li>
<li>Considered critically endangered due to natural habitat degradation, manmade logging, collection for the pet trade, and amplified by its small habitat range. </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: Corrected info on venom. Thanks /u/Salvatio!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apologies, I should have read it more closely. The intense pain is typical of the venom in other species of the same genus, so it <em>may</em> cause intense pain. However, the minor discomforts are listed towards the end of the article's Venom section and here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Venom effects consist of a small heart rate increase followed by sweating, headache, stinging, cramping and swelling. Effects can last for up to a week.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain and discomfort can be different things. Eg, pain can feel like you're being stabbed, while discomfort can feel like you're not comfortable. Like that feeling of sleeping in a slightly off position. It's not painful, but so obviously WRONG.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to correct the last statement as well, they aren't in danger due to the pet trade, 99% of all that species in the hobby is captive bred. In the beginning ,yes, they were collected for the pet trade but they have been captive bred regularly for the past decade. The rest of the statement is correct as the people of India are allowed to kill the animal on sight but biologists are not allowed to &quot;harass&quot; them or take them out of the country. Fortunately their captive population is very strong so when the species does go extinct in the wild (and it will unless there is drastic change) it will still be enjoyed by future generations. The genus is generally grey and black with yellow markings, this species is blue for a while but as the females get older they turn black and white, still makes for a striking spider though. </p></div>		</li>
