			<div class="markdown"><p>You're describing the 3-strip Technicolor process. The B&amp;W separations weren't dyed and then assembled. They were used to make printing masters. The masters, called &quot;matrix prints&quot; were essentially long, flexible printing plates. Much like how a color offset paper print is made today, each matrix was treated with a colored dye and then a blank filmstrip with the soundtrack pre-printed onto it was brought into contact with each matrix film in turn, building up a full-color image. The matrices were reused over and over to make new prints.</p>
<p>The last Technicolor process that involved cementing prints together was the second generation in the 1920s, which was only red/green color. Process Three was optically identical, but used the matrix print/dye imbibition method to eliminate the need to stack color layers by printing both colors onto a single film. By the time full-color Process Four three-strip Technicolor arrived, matrix printing was the only method used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Aviator actually uses this in its color grading. The first 30 minutes or so look like 2-strip technicolor, then it changes to 3-strip once the movie gets to the year 1934, the same year the 3-strip process started to be implemented. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting how much work is done to make an image mimic an old 20th Century film process when 90 to 95% of the audience won't know or care about that. That, to me, is where the artistry becomes impressive, when most people may only be aware of the similarity to older films in a vague way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for pointing this out! We watched this movie like 6 months ago, and I thought something was wrong with my TV. Then I tried another show and it looked fine so I thought there was just something wrong with how they coded the film in Netflix. Turns out it was deliberate and I had no idea!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wizard of Oz is oversaturated as hell.  Artistically, it makes Oz look like a fantasy land, contrasting with the black and white of the Kansas reality.  I think what actually happened is some studio exec said &quot;we're paying a lot for this new color thing, and it's going to be in COLOR, goddammit.&quot;  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are quite right, at least based on one in-film alteration.</p>
<p>The Wicked Witch of the East (currently in an epic face-sitting session with Dorothy's house) had silver shoes in the book. They became ruby colored when they wanted to show off COLOR FILM even moreso than the amazing B&amp;W changes into Color thing that happened literally seconds ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True fact: the opening scenes of The Wizard of Oz aren't &quot;black and white&quot;. They're actually sepia-tinted, which is more of an amber/brown.  When MGM gave a print to CBS for TV broadcast in the 1950s, the opening scenes were incorrectly in B&amp;W, until the last &quot;transition&quot; shot where Dorothy walks out of the house and into Oz, which was properly sepia (because that shot is actually in color, with the house and Judy Garland's stand-in painted and costumed to look like sepia).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It cost a lot of money to make those movies in color, and it didn't become cheap enough until later.</p></div>		</li>
