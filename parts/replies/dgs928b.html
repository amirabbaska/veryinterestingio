			<div class="markdown"><p>The formula -GMm/r is the potential energy of a system of two masses m and M. The formula I used -1/2Gm^2 /r is the total potential energy of a gravitating shell of matter. Like a ball, but with all the matter compressed in the boundary. A derivation for a uniform sphere is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_binding_energy" target="_blank">wikipedia</a></p>
<p>But I guess your formula makes sense too, but you're neglecting the gravitational &quot;self-energy&quot; of both masses (and the rest-mass of the larger mass). Still, it shows that you cannot get a mass to have a total negative mass-energy without entering a black hole.</p></div>		</li>
