<p>The only reason I know about it is in the early 2000s I was one of the people in the marines selected to update the study.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hmm. Cite source on this part? I seriously doubt it. I barely even recognize my voice when I hear it played back, and it definitely doesn't match my 'inner dialog', which isn't auditory so it isn't in any voice at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>while the inner dialog isn't auditory, i assume it's exciting parts of the brain similar to when you're talking. people will associate their inner monologue with themselves. </p></div>		</li>
