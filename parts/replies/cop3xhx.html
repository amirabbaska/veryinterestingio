			<p>Does this mean that you wouldn't have to throw a ceramic pot very hard at a car window to break it?</p>		</li>

			<p>Since you need to damage the structure of the glass to break the pane, you would need something with as small a surface area as possible, using something like a plant pot the contact point would be quite large and would spread the force across a larger area which would probably not work (although it would be better than many other things) After you have thrown the plant pot at the window, the plant pot will shatter, then pick up a couple of shards of plant pot and throw those instead, Also the ceramic structure in most plant pots is not idea, often filled with imperfections etc, you might have to throw them a little harder than shards of sparkplugs to get the same results.</p>		</li>

			<p>Tell me if I'm grasping this right, I'm imagining having a piece or rubber being pulled taught by two ends. You can rub you fingers across it just fine without damaging the surface, but a knife, with a surface area much smaller than your finger, can slice into the rubber allowing for tension to be released along the new surface area. This is in the form of a single tear in the rubber due to rubber's latent properties and a bidirectional tension. I'm also imagining  the &quot;dice&quot;ing pattern is similar in cause to the cracks in mud which is drying in the desert. Eh?</p>		</li>

			<p>Some very similar analogues. Except imagine taking the sheet of rubber under tension, and pouring wet cement on the side of it then holding the sheet taught while it sets and bonds to the sheet. While the rubber is under tension, the cement is in its new &quot;natural&quot; compressed position. After the rubber sheet is broken, the cement will naturally crack along all points at once. </p>		</li>
