			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say that. I'm from Slovenia, we have 2,000,000 people and about 50 wolves (1 wolf for every 40,000 people) and 500 brown bears (1 bear for every 4,000 people). </p>
<p>For comparison, the US has 325 million people and about 30,000 brown bears (1 bear for every 11,000 people) and about 15,000 wolves (1 wolf for every 21,000 people). </p>
<p>In short, we have more than twice the amount of brown bears per person compared to the US :D If you also count black bears the picture is drastically different (none live in Europe, and there are nearly a million in the US), but my point is - not all Europe is the same :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brown bears are not as fearsome as the only ones that managed to survive are those that are tame and afraid of humans. All others have been hunted down over centuries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rabbits should be at the top of that list. Specifically, the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog. I learned about this vicious beast in a documentary about some knights who were in a quest to find the Holy Grail. Many were slaughtered by the rabbit until they managed to kill it with the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.</p></div>		</li>
