<p>and they have no way of tying the information they do collect back to an individual's real life identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a rather naive and wrong assumption.</p>
<p>You can buy bulk data of that kind and it’s been shown and proven multiple times that it’s easy to tie this collected information to individuals or small groups of people potentially tied to this information.</p>
<p>The problem is that anonymization of the collected data fails all the time or is simply impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but that assumption isn't really required - as long as you're not collecting any those 6 particular things (A-F) or actually tying the collected data with any personal information you might have from elsewhere (the G part), it's not prohibited.</p>
<p>If someone else might deanonymize that data, well, that's on them, this law prohibits them to do so - it's okay to gather and store everything else about you except these particular items.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given a person's personal information and their anonymized web data, researchers could match the web data with the personal information. But there's no way for Facebook to take just the data they collect and say &quot;this belongs to Suzy Smith at 1234 Main St&quot; without collecting the data that Suzy Smith lives at 1234 Main St from somewhere else. That's what makes this not a violation of COPPA.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, there was a news a article involving targeting specific political ads to very specific groups of people.</p>
<p>It might be hard but it isn't impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, Equifax collects from elsewhere but leaks via a website, so they're not subject to COPPA? Seems like it should cover inputs and outputs.</p></div>		</li>
