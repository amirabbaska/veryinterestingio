			<div class="markdown"><p>You can actually have self supporting 100nm aluminium foils, and over a significant aperture, not sunglass sized, but a cm^2 is achievable, and you can certainly see though 100nm. We use very thin Al filters (and other metals) for XUV filters. Of course, if you so much as breath near them they break, and if you put your finger on them you've just got yourself an aluminium coated finger tip. But they can self support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I just replaced a couple of xuv-filters in our setup, the procedure of putting them carefully in the filter wheel is on the level of brain surgery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good distinction. The question asks about a sheet, which seems to imply self-supporting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If bigger layers were self- supporting, could I strange a person with invisible metal sheet? (Wrap it around somebody face when he is aspleep)
Or the pressure made by inhaling lunges break it apart?</p></div>		</li>
