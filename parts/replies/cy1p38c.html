<p>Use some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflector" target="_blank">retroreflective</a> material.  Sends light waves back where they came from, which is perfect to destroy the person targeting you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A simple mirror isn't 100% reflective.
If the laser is strong enough you're still doomed.</p></div>		</li>

In addition, if it could penetrate, you could have a thick enough plasma such that you let the plasma absorb the energy by letting the EM wave dissipate its energy into wakefields..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When someone says linear you can generally assume that they are using a basic model with assumptions that simplify the math to give an approximate answer. </p>
<p>Change the assumptions (like really high energy densities) and the model is too simple to give a good answer; small effects that you previously discounted now become very relevant and important. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As in if you draw a graph of what happens as you increase the intensity of the lasers, the effects will increase in some proportion to the intensity - these effects are the linear effects. What he was talking about above is the idea that at very high intensities some factors which were too insignificant at lower intensities become huge, breaking the trend. Think of it like the limit of proportionality experienced by a Hookeian spring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the actual defense is ablative material. since it's pretty easy to know the frequencies one would likely be shining a laser at you, you just pick something that doesn't burn well or absorb energy at that frequency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you point to a laser weapon which has high enough peak intensities where nonlinear effectso dominate?  These weapons work over long ranges,  so they can't be tightly focused.  I've worked with high power systems that needed actively chilled mirrors,  but they were still building heat via linear processes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking into it, I don't think there are any existing weaponized laser that would have the sort of energy densities where nonlinear effects become anything other than a disadvantage, especially being used in air.  Ah well, thermal destruction it is, then. :)</p></div>		</li>
