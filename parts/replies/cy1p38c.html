			<p>&gt; If you're afraid of someone attacking you with lasers, if you cover yourself in shiny material, then instead of absorbing the photons you reflect them away from you.<br><br>Use some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflector" target="_blank">retroreflective</a> material.  Sends light waves back where they came from, which is perfect to destroy the person targeting you.</p>		</li>

			<p>Adding to this, I help build ion tube lasers as my job. I was really confused that they don't use &quot;mirrors&quot; but instead special glass optics with coatings on it. Depending on the wavelength you desire, the coating might be visually transparent but highly reflective in the UV (for example). Also, we have mirrors to check if the beam is perfectly aligned and those mirrors will burn if we use them on the wrong wave length. A UV laser will absolutely destroy a visible light mirror if held there for more than a brief moment. </p>		</li>

			<p>What we use is essentially glass with a special coating designed to reflect back certain frequencies. These (I'd imagine) are pretty tough since they are designed for it (some lasers we have have UV wavelengths too). Regular mirrors (like in the bathroom) aren't designed for something that powerful and can be utterly destroyed because it will also absorb some instead of reflecting 100%. </p>		</li>

			<p>Plasmas. If you have a dense enough plasma, your EM wave won't penetrate. In addition, if it could penetrate, you could have a thick enough plasma such that you let the plasma absorb the energy by letting the EM wave dissipate its energy into wakefields..</p>		</li>

			<p>Reflection doesn't work very well as a defense against high-energy lasers.  Non-linear effects become important at high energy densities, so your shiny material just rapidly vaporizes.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think they're comparing the ball to the mirror. If the force applied to ball is strong enough (with the help of the ground in this case) it will break and not bounce like it normally would. With the mirror, if the laser has too much energy, the mirror will break instead of reflecting like it normally would. Ball is to the mirror, as throwing into the ground is to the laser.<br><br>If I'm wrong or it doesn't make sense, I guess I need to keep reading haha ... And sorry for jumping in so late.

			<p>When someone says linear you can generally assume that they are using a basic model with assumptions that simplify the math to give an approximate answer. <br><br>Change the assumptions (like really high energy densities) and the model is too simple to give a good answer; small effects that you previously discounted now become very relevant and important. </p>		</li>

			<p>As in if you draw a graph of what happens as you increase the intensity of the lasers, the effects will increase in some proportion to the intensity - these effects are the linear effects. What he was talking about above is the idea that at very high intensities some factors which were too insignificant at lower intensities become huge, breaking the trend. Think of it like the limit of proportionality experienced by a Hookeian spring.</p>		</li>

			<p>Can you point to a laser weapon which has high enough peak intensities where nonlinear effectso dominate?  These weapons work over long ranges,  so they can't be tightly focused.  I've worked with high power systems that needed actively chilled mirrors,  but they were still building heat via linear processes. </p>		</li>

			<p>Looking into it, I don't think there are any existing weaponized laser that would have the sort of energy densities where nonlinear effects become anything other than a disadvantage, especially being used in air.  Ah well, thermal destruction it is, then. :)</p>		</li>

			<p>I believe the actual defense is ablative material. since it's pretty easy to know the frequencies one would likely be shining a laser at you, you just pick something that doesn't burn well or absorb energy at that frequency. </p>		</li>
