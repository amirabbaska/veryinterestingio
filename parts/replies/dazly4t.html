			<div class="markdown"><p>Now, I'm not saying I'm positively right, but I believe I've heard we can outrun other animals not due to leg strength or anything like that but because we sweat, which allows for the endurance for the most part, since other animals don't sweat and have to regulate overheating in less efficient ways, like panting.</p>
<p>edit: OP didn't say humans had strong legs and that's the reason we're so speedy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sweat is a major part of it, yes.  But our long legs and upright stature are part of it as well.  They greatly decrease our sprinting speed (think how fast a dog can run), but are much more efficient for long-distance running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard this as well. It was on an episode of the Colbert report. The guest said that quadrupeds can't sweat so they have to pant, which they can't do while running. He said prehistoric humans essentially chased their prey until they were exhausted enough to be easily killed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but oc isn't entirely wrong. More muscle = more weight.</p>
<p>It's also inefficient from a metabolic perspective. </p>
<p>We also pile on fat, instead of muscle, by default in a surplus. Some animals pile on muscle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And that's why in stuff like UFC, the big, super buff guys rarely win if they can't take their opponent out quickly. It takes a lot of energy to keep pushing oxygen to all of those muscles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually some animals that can outrun humans forever. The most obvious is the ostrich, which has the same benefits of bipedalism that humans do, plus their legs are like giant springs that allow them to exert very little energy. They can sprint at 60mph (the fastest human ever was still less than 30mph) and can maintain a speed of 30mph for many hours, and of course run at slower speeds for even longer. Basically, an ostrich could run 1.5 marathons at continuous speeds faster than a human has ever sprinted, and their walking speed is like a human's light jog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Marathons don't even scratch the distance over which humans have the advantage. Humans are not fast at all but we have the advantage of good cooling systems, on the fly refuelling and recovery. It's not so much a running race as a moving timebomb, for the human to win they basically just have to keep going day in day out till the other animal dies.</p>
<p>The human evolutionary advantage is inevitability, we are horribly mediocre in every athletic category except (if trained for it) we can literally <del>run</del> shuffle for a week with no sleep. Ultra runners refuel on the move and will microsleep on their feet. We can't outrun an Ostrich but we can jog at it till it can't be fucked living anymore.</p>
<p>By we I obviously mean the tiny group of people who actually can still do this.  </p>
<p>It's like &quot;It Follows&quot; or that episode of the last airbender. From the animal's perspective there's just this slow skinny thing with a pointy stick that doesn't rest or eat or drink and will never give up.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A marathon might be around the practical upper limit on &quot;run till your prey drops&quot; hunting. Highly trained runners will be pretty gassed after running 26 miles, even if they're not racing. This is also a tremendous amount of distance to run in the hot sun. Any animal that can outlast a human chasing it for that distance probably isn't a good candidate for hunting with this method, You can probably find a TON of other animals that a person could run down in less than 10 miles. Of course the hunter then has to trek 10 miles back with the added weight of the kill, which is where the other traits come in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The marathon example was just for perspective, they can run much much longer than that at slower speeds. And they're so much faster and more efficient than humans that they could literally run for a couple hours and have a couple hours to just chill out before the humans even got close to them. There is no distance that a human can outrun an ostrich.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We hunted through chasing stuff down, and not from raw speed.</p>
<p>Take a horse. It either trots,  canters or gallops. 3 speeds.  Obviously the faster it is, the hotter they get and more energy they expend.</p>
<p>Those 3 things are now as 'gaits'. Each 'gait' has its own style of movement.  Like when you break into a run,  your legs start moving differently compared to a brisk walk. That's a different gait.</p>
<p>Changing gait requires energy, in humans much less than other animals.</p>
<p>We basically used to walk up to animals,  then briefly sprint to make them change gait. Each time we do that, we use less energy.</p>
<p>Also, we sweat so the heat from moving so fast isn't an issue for us (especially as running creates a lot of wind flow).</p>
<p>So yes it does have disadvantages, but our style of hunting with tools allowed us to fairly efficiently catch other animals. So the befits outweighed the losses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put it like this-A cheetah has one chance to catch a gazelle. They have to time their attacks carefully so that they can get the jump on the gazelle because they can only run that fast for so long before they overheat and risk dying. As a human, we can run after that fucking gazelle for MILES. MILES, i said. The gazelle can be as fast as it wants to be and can even get a 10 second head start if it wants. But unless that motherfucker can grow wings, he WILL end up being cooked by the time the day is over. <em>That</em> is the advantage of being a human. We are the most savage of all animals, not by physical strength or agility, but by sheer evolutionary dominance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like a horror movie.  There's this creature that follows you wherever you go.  You can sprint away... But he'll find you.  It has some mystical power to look at the ground and know which way you've gone.  And it never stops.  You get away... 5 minutes later it's there.  You escape again... It's only a few more minutes of freedom.  It just won't stop coming!  And eventually you lay down exhausted, with no strength to even resist...</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>  Zombies are just basically how humans appear to animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forget if it was natives or wolves that did this, but trailing behind herds of caribou and buffalo for miles n miles was an old hunting method. As the stalker began to close the distance, slowly, the prey would become aware of them. They'd start moving away, continuing on. They'd prioritize running away over rest and feeding. Over time they'd be hungry, dehydrating, exhausted and in a panic. Easy prey. </p></div>		</li>
