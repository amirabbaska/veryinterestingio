			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the metal hull is just aluminum. If it wasn't protected by 10 cm (Almost 4 in) of &quot;bullet proof&quot; armor, impacts would be a huge(er) issue. The ISS has over 100 configurations of armor in use, depending on what that armor is trying to protect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, because the other answer wasn't quite correct: The windows are actually stronger than the metal hull. The ISS skin is aluminum. The station is basically a bunch of soda cans joined together in space. The entire thing (except windows) is covered in thick (10 cm/4 in) armor. This armor is a thermal shield for heat, as well as Kevlar/Ceramic fiber &quot;bullet proof&quot; armor. It uses Whipple shields which &quot;catch&quot; the incoming projectile and spread the energy out along the armor instead of into the hull. Because you can't really make windows out of Kevlar/Ceramic fibers, they need to be very strong and very thick. Each window has four panes of &quot;glass&quot; ranging from about 1/2' to 1 1/4&quot; thick. The Cupola, for example, has an outer meteoriod/debris pane at 0.37 in (0.93 cm) thick, followed by two inner panes (The redundant and the primary pressure pane) at 1 in (2.54 cm) thick, and finally an inner scratch pane at 0.45 in (1.14 cm) thick for a total thickness (including gaps) of 5.625 in (14.3 cm). For comparison, most homes on Earth have two panes at 1/16&quot; thick, though I believe 1/8 in is the new standard and not all homes have double pane. Even then, when not in use, all windows have a shielded cover that gets put over them for extra protection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for the answer, but don't you mean heat sink? Why would they want to protect against heat up there? Isn't the greater problem to disperse heat away from ISS?</p></div>		</li>
