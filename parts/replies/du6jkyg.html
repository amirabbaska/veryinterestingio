			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know. Could be interesting to explore if it happens more to one sex than another. I’m female, and it happens to me CONSTANTLY. I notice my children doing it (one girl, two boys), but I’ve never caught my husband doing it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure. I'm a woman and I do this at least once a day. It's a running joke with my husband and extended family since I will do it even in a crowded room. I also have some sensory sensitivity, so I wonder if it is related in a way? I find it incredibly soothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine it's more of a personality trait than specifically a gendered issue. I'm female and have this issue <em>a lot</em> - I can't stop myself from zoning out and I do this several times a day. </p>
<p>To take a flying stab at it, I'd assume that people high in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_prone_personality" target="_blank">fantasy-proneness</a> would experience this the most often, but it happens to everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Me too, and this is something I do constantly. In school I was deemed ‘spacey’ by way of constantly zoning out into a blank stare - during which my expression apparently looks like slack-jawed confusion - anyways, I’ve taken medication for about 3 years, and don’t really zone out like this while they are in effect. I can get into a meditative state during this time, but it’s different, and instead of staring at nothing and thinking about anything and everything, I’ll have spent 2 hours zeroed in on something specific, but feel a greater sense of vigilance in other senses. It’s less free-flowing for sure. </p>
<p>As a creative person, I had a wild imagination growing up, read all the time, and was very thoughtful, to a point of being less-social. I wonder if there is a connection to the way a person thinks, not attributed to outright intelligence, where thoughts and ideas are interconnected in a way that the mind develops higher potential to zone out. </p></div>		</li>
