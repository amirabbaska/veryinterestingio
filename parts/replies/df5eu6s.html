<p><strong>1. Concord was a commercial failure due to her limited routes and everyone hated her noise so she must have lost loads of money!</strong></p>
<p>Well Concord was never the dream she was supposed to be. Because of her noise and restrictions to her routes, she was never allowed to fly anywhere and everywhere. Also any plans to have a larger fleet of Concords never got off the ground (In truth there was never any likelihood of there being a larger fleet of them anyway, the whole project was merely a willy waving exercise).</p>
<p>So she never made the extensive profits her creators dreamed for her BUT in the limited capacity that BA/AF operated the Concord, she did turn a profit, she just didn't generate the profits she could have if there had been more airframes and/or more routes.</p>
<p>There was also never any scope to run an aircraft such as Concord at a loss, it's just not good business. No company in their right mind is going to take a massive hit on their profits just to keep a plane flying in the air. And if they do, someone somewhere is subsidising it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Are you trying to say it was the pilots fault that the AF Concord crashed?</strong></p>
<p>Noooo. The crew of the Concord that crashed where dealt the most shittiest situation ever. A &quot;Damned if you do, damned if you don't&quot; scenario. The fact they stalled into the ground wasn't a mistake or fault (Though others believe it was) on the part of the pilots but a combination of shitty events. They did the best they could with a totally fucked up situation that meant they where pretty much doomed from the moment they passed V1 or the point of no return for take off.</p>
<p>And just to be clear, when I say &quot;Had it remained on the ground and come to a stop&quot; I'm talking about a hypothetical situation that assumes the pilots had not passed V1 to illustrate that the wing fire was not what destroyed the aircraft. The pilots had absolutely no chance of aborting the take off. They had passed V1 and would have likely run off the end of the runway and tipped over and blown up anyway.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why didn't they keep one or two Concords flying for air shows and things like that in the same way they do for Spitfires, the Vulcan, and other old aircraft.</strong></p>
<p>It partly comes down to a combination of reasons 1 and 5. BA wanted the prestige of Concord all to itself. To have given her away to someone would have allowed another entity to partly share in her mythos and legacy, even if it was an altrustic organization dedicated to preserving a flying model. Another reason is the cost. Concord is huge and extremely complex in comparison to a Spitfire and maintaining her cycle life was only going to get more and more in depth (Expensive). It was going to cost someone real money to keep one going and BA certainly had no interest in doing so, times are tough for airlines, they don't have that sort of cash hanging round to squander on a plane that gets trotted out for an airshow. </p>
<p>Giving it to an altruistic organization who wants to keep one flying is all well and fine, but where does the money and spare parts come from? Keeping her in the air was a problem for a huge airline and an aircraft design and maintenance company when she was <em>operational and generating an income</em>, can you imagine how difficult it would be for an organization who is doing it altruistically and begging for cash/parts?</p>
<p>The other big factor was the engines. Compared to the airframe, engines have a very short life on an aircraft and have to be rebuilt/replaced regularly. The Vulcan project recently had to stop flying and permanently ground it's former RAF Vulcan after it's engines ran out of operational hours. With no spares or other engines for a rebuild, it doesn't matter how much life the airframe has in it. Thrust or bust! Replacing/servicing and rebuilding the engines for Concord would likely be the first big hurdle any conservation orientated organization would struggle with after a few years. Now sure, you could argue that you could cannibalize the other aircraft to keep one flying. The problem with this is that it has got a whole raft of problems in itself, from problems re-using and re-certifying certain parts to storing them. Also who decides which ones get cut up? Some people might argue that destroying 4 to preserve 1 flying example is not the best way to maintain their memory!</p>
<p><strong>4. Were you a Concord pilot? Did you ever fly on her?</strong></p>
<p>No I fly smaller aircraft. Think Learjet, Dash-eights, things like that (These days I mostly stick to my own light aircraft as I have a lot of commitments to the military reserve and a flight school). I did not fly on Concord but my parents did. My mother was unknowingly in the early stages of pregnancy with me at the time so it could be argued I did in a way! :-p</p>
<p><strong>5. Do you think there will be a replacement for Concord?</strong></p>
<p>Almost certainly but not any time soon in the commercial aviation sector. And I don't think it will be a commercial type airliner, I think it will likely be in the small business commuter industry (Think Learjet) that finds a nice balance between operational costs, usage and total cost of ownership in a smaller and more fuel efficient aircraft. <a href="http://boomsupersonic.com/" target="_blank">These chaps seem to be giving it a good go</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say almost certainly.</p>
<p>Newer advances in materials and composites, much more efficient engines (That do not require reheat) and advanced avionics and control systems (Think fly by wire) would mean it would almost certainly have benefits over the 60's era technology of the Concord.</p>
<p>That being said, the envelope of flight can only be neutered so far and when your talking about breaking the sound barrier, your inherent risk goes up. It would be safer. It would never be completely safe.</p>
<p>Let's not forget people are working on it at the moment. Including airbus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concorde's engines were actually extremely efficient. While they did have afterburners, these were only used to increase thrust for takeoff and climb out. The plane supercruised in its normal operation. While new engines could indeed be more efficient, it wouldn't be an extremely substantial improvement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're working on it but who knows if anyone will want to pay for the cost of the flight to make it worth operating. If I'm paying tens of thousands of dollars for a flight, I'm not sitting in coach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No question it would be.</p>
<p>The Concorde's original engines burned 1.195 lb of fuel per (lbfÂ·h) at  cruise.  (This measure of efficiency is called TSFC, Thrust-Specific Fuel Consumption).  The supercruise-capable engine in the F-22 burns around .89 lbs (best estimate I could find -- the real number is classified).</p>
<p>Meaning a Concorde with modern engines would save ~25% in fuel.</p>
<p>Modern advances in composites, avionics, control systems, aerodynamics, etc. would further reduce weight and drag, leading to more fuel savings.</p>
<p>Also, the original Concordes were built almost as one-offs.  Design changes were made during the production run, many parts don't interchange -- that's what happens when you combine very limited rate production, bleeding-edge technology, and pencil-and-paper engineering.  Modern design could drastically reduce maintenance costs too.</p>
<p>A modern SST could probably run at around half the cost of the original Concorde.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A others already said, cheaper and safer, yes. Cheap (and to a lesser extent safe) enough to run? That's another question though.</p>
<p>Ignoring everything else, breaking the soundbarrier will consume more fuel (With fuel-cost being bigger factor now, than it was back then) and cause additional stress to the airplane. </p>
<p>So, one question is, how much more are people willing to pay for a few hours of saved time.</p>
<p>And the second, somewhat related, question: How many are willing to pay that price.</p>
<p>The Concord was unique and had no competition. But considering how insanely expensive it is to develop a new plane, no manufacturer can afford to do that only to sell a few dozen or hundred planes to a handful of customers.</p>
<p>So, basically, it comes down to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No airline can afford to order a plane like that only for themselves, because of the development cost. There were 20 Concords built total and only 14 of them run commercially. If you compare that with the development cost of the A380 of US$15 B for example, that would mean 1 billion $ per plane in development cost alone. For perspective: An A380 costs ~US$400 million, a Dreamliner (Boeing 787) between US$200-300 million. So a airline would probably have to (at least) pay 3-4 times the building cost for exclusivity.</p>
</li>
<li>And no airline can afford flying a plane like that if they don't (due to competition). So, it will be either to expensive to buy or to run.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is in a normal competition driven market. If (maybe some of the state owned airlines in Asia) decides to buy a plane like that for PR reasons that's probably more likely. But I doubt that it's possible to run a supersonic plane with profit nowadays. The margins are just too narrow.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nailed it. A few additional points from someone who worked on Concorde toward the end of its life.</p>
<p>Airbus wanted out of the maintenance of Concorde because of the fear of it overshadowing the up coming a380. BAe systems were happy to take over maintenance for Concorde but airbus would not allow it. </p>
<p>Virgin did want to take the aircraft over but would have had the same issues with certification and British Airways didn't want to retire Concorde anyway. Cynics said that Virgin just wanted to fly them for a few months so they retired to museums in virgin colours..</p></div>		</li>
