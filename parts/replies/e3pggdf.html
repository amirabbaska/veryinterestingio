			<div class="markdown"><p>Bows have a much more efficient design, a #120 bow can deliver about the same energy to the target as a #800-1000 crossbow (traditional, that is). The absurdly high draw weights of crossbows weren't an advantage, they were a necessity to compensate for the incredibly inefficient design of a crossbow (short, thick limbs; thick and heavy string and a very short powerstroke). Bows have the additional benefit of range, as long, slender arrows fly much more stable than short and stout bolts.
Crossbows however were really easy to use, most anyone could be trained to use one effectively in probably less than a week. Training to shoot a #120 bow takes years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The longest shot with a trad bow is 1336 yards the longest shot with a handheld crossbow is 2047 yards. The benefits of a trad bow aren't enough to make up for the mechanical benefits of a crossbow. The trad bow comes into its own in rate of fire but other than that I think the crossbow bests it all the way around but a crossbow takes alot of the challenges of bowhunting away also which alot of hunters don't like. They like the challenge of getting in close </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the record for a compound crossbow. You can't compare a modern crossbow with traditional weapons. </p></div>		</li>
