			<div class="markdown"><p>This is Becca- Open access has been important since the beginning of the Rising Star Expedition.  The initial call (and the later one for the analysis team) went out over social media instead of through a more closed network of individuals.  The excavations were tweeted and blogged in real time.  Now, the articles have been published in a high-quality peer reviewed journal and are available without a paywall.  And, many 3D scans of the fossils are available for free as well.  (they're very cool- <a href="http://morphosource.org/index.php/Detail/ProjectDetail/Show/project_id/124" target="_blank">http://morphosource.org/index.php/Detail/ProjectDetail/Show/project_id/124</a>)  This model of open access is unusual in paleoanthropology and is very exciting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Open access is frustratingly unusual indeed. Hopefully the paradigm of closed networks in science will shift as unlike years past there are now so many electronic means of access that it seems keeping networks closed would require much active effort to restrict access rather than the status-quo of passively requiring end-users to actively seek access.</p>
<p>Excellent work by the way. A dear friend (still working on her never-ending PhD) has long lamented being forced to focus almost exclusively on lab work when the exciting things are in the field. Your team has given her a much-needed boost just as she was almost considering Mastering out ABD. Thanks for keeping her in the game!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>eLife is an entirely open-access journal.  The science submitted there is open to the public, very much unlike other high-prestige journals like Nature, Science, Cell, etc.  Further, it still wants to represent the highest quality science, so all articles are peer reviewed. And lastly, articles are reviewed and accepted/rejected within a very short period of time compared to other journals which is actually a big win for everyone.</p>
<p>The one issue is that it has only been around for a year or so, so it has not developed an 'impact factor' that many institutions and people blindly follow as a quantitative metric for good science.</p>
<p>So as a researcher or student, submitting to eLife is a bit of a gamble career-wise. You have to rely on your peers actually paying attention to the science, and not just blindly saying 'good journal = good scientist, unknown journal = bad scientist'.  But you do get your science into the public domain, and you get it there quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>eLife was started partially as a response to the use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor#Validity_as_a_measure_of_importance" target="_blank">Impact Factor</a> to gauge the 'quality' of a journal, and as a showcase for how Open Access and a great peer review system can work to promote access to the best science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, that's the cynical way to look at it, yea. eLife is obstensibly about open access, publishing important results rather than focusing on what is trendy and will get lots of citations, and improving the peer review process. </p>
<p>Though yea, I am quite curious why they chose eLife, too. Maybe the group just really wants to support open access science. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the criteria for bad and good based on the peer review process or factors regarding novelty or positive results? It seems to me that more quality journals are necessarily a good thing, but so many of them are started on the &quot;resentment and a coffee pot&quot; principle that I worry about the <em>quality</em> criterion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard an interview on NPR where they said they had initially planned to publish in Nature. According to the interview, the submission process for that huge number of fossils would have taken years. It was much faster to publish on eLife. </p></div>		</li>
