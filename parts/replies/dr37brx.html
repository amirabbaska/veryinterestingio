			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the shape and size of the scar.  The smaller and narrower the wound is, the more it can interact with neighboring cells.  However, from what I understand this is unlikely for wounds larger than a minor cut.  It is far more likely that the scar is still there, but it is just very hard to see.  Over time as the scar matures, the collagen fibers begin to align more properly, causing the scar to &quot;fade&quot; or &quot;soften&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
