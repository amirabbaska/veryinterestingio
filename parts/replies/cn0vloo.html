			<p>I'm willing to be the mouthpiece and the figurehead, but I'd need support, and it's hard ask people &quot;hey, I can help you, please help me survive with a $3,000/month salary so I can focus my efforts on it&quot;.  That alone is difficult, but then I'd need an entire support network made up of people that are going to have their own needs as well.  <br><br>Suppose then that I were to make a video and that somehow people coming to watch this video netted enough ad revenue to achieve that $3,000/month mark which would allow me freedom of use with my time.  Imagine even that those who were drawn to visions of the world were able to bring their own varied skill sets to assist in my rise to power.<br><br>More butter and less guns, end all combat operations for which there is not a declared war and clear objectives, classify the Blue Code Brotherhood as a domestic terrorist group, challenge the Fed.<br><br>I would do my utmost to ensure that we hold true to our basic tenants, that all of the race of Man are created equal, and that none are above the law.<br><br>I'll be the face, but if I only show myself with something as small as a stupid youtube video asking for help, would you support me anyways?  I figure once I get started, people will gravitate towards me, especially after we end the Midwest drought, though that may take a couple years even with significant resources.</p>		</li>
