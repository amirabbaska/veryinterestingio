<p>Interestingly, we're not <em>just</em> orbiting the black hole. Galaxies have a lot of mass, and actually work without a supermassive black hole in the middle. You just orbit around the galaxy's center of mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But my understanding is that all galaxies we've found have a black hole at the center...am I wrong or is that the case? And if it's the latter, does that mean it's possible for us to find one that functions without one as you describe? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, in science you never know anything 100%. It's all &quot;We have 99.9995% confidence&quot;, like we have math to determine exactly how confident we are. The question of whether something is real or just a really supported theory is answered that NOTHING is real beyond just being a <em>very</em> well supported theory. </p>
<p>The nature of black holes means that they're both really hard to see and really far away. So it's not like we can just go look and see one. But we do know that there are objects with immense gravity (which we can measure by how objects orbit them) which are not luminescent like stars are. We also know that these objects are left behind when a giant star dies. </p>
<p>Also, the math behind them has an inescapable sort of logic: We know how escape velocities work, the speed you have to go to get away from an object of a certain density. So, if you take all the mass of a star, and compress it down small enough, you could make something with an escape velocity faster than the speed of light, and nothing can possibly go that fast. </p>
<p>So, lots of details about black holes are still hazy and unknown, like what happens to matter that falls into them, what do they actually look like inside, how would the barrier of it, the &quot;event horizon&quot; behave? But the term &quot;Black Hole&quot; refers to a <em>type</em> of object which we definitely know exists,</p></div>		</li>
