<blockquote>
<p>You only use a little bit of the O2 you breathe in.  </p>
<p>Normal air is 0.035% (350ppm) CO2.  8% (80,000ppm) is dangerously high.  Human exhaust around 4-5% (40,000ppm-50,000ppm).  Sure, that's 100x more than normal air, but not a dangerous amount.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a separate note, we are normally at 405ppm CO2 as of<a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide" target="_blank">2017,</a> which actually makes your next point more accurate.</p></div>		</li>
