			<div class="markdown"><p>I am going to thank you here. I am a CRPS sufferer and on quite a few drugs to combat the pain. Plus I have surgery next month and will have two more added. Plus a vitamin K injection so it seems. This has explained a lot of the restrictions I am on. Thanks for asking this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're on Warfarin, usually you're told to limit vitamin K intake because you're effectively inhibiting the drug so you need a larger dose. Warfarin is literally a vitamin k analog so it clogs up clotting factors (specifically serine proteases), which require the vitamin to function properly. Fewer working clotting factors, less chance of blood clot. If you decide to have a kale salad one day, you've added more vitamin k to the mix which will compete with warfarin and make those clotting factors functional again.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if someone on Warfarin decided to go on a strict diet with tons of leafy greens, they could die of thrombosis or stroke.</p></div>		</li>
