			<div class="markdown"><p>In essence, yes. Animal cruelty, in particular, is associated with a much higher degree of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FAlan_Felthous%2Fpublication%2F11269072_Animal_cruelty_and_psychiatric_disorders%2Flinks%2F00463527013ca5477a000000.pdf&amp;ei=rWEMVcrtAcbYgwTdpoP4CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHqAPIIYY5Lkx8nGHWJcvWDPDRj3A&amp;sig2=tvhY0N2uLPGKrepeBTsavg" target="_blank">Antisocial Personality Disorder and Polysubstance abuse.</a> </p>
<p>Regarding enuresis (bedwetting), a great deal of research seems to indicate that bed wetting is actually a more <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1112738/" target="_blank">likely sign of sexual abuse or parental abuse/neglect,</a> especially when accompanied by other behavioral markers (i.e. acting out, violent behavior).</p>
<p>Basically, the more &quot;modern&quot; view on the trifecta is that it's a clear sign that there's some serious disturbances in a child's life, whether abuse, sexual assault, neglect, or a mental disorder. And with these negative factors often comes a later diagnosis of a personality disorder such as Antisocial Personality Disorder.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm going to hijack my own comment here to add a description of the difference between Psychopathy (which the Macdonald triad was referring to) and Antisocial Personality Disorder. Psychopathy is a term used to describe a grouping of personality traits that includes such things as impulsive behavior, lack of regard for others, lack of a normal range of emotional responsiveness and frequent deception or manipulation of others. We DO NOT use this term for formal diagnosis in the DSM-V, which is our diagnostic manual. </p>
<p>Instead, we formally diagnose people with Anti-Social Personality Disorder, which is <strong>similar but not the same</strong> as psychopathy. In my description above, I'm talking more about Anti-Social Personality Disorder rather than psychopathy, which is more associated with serial killers.
<a href="http://www.elementsbehavioralhealth.com/mental-health/psychopathy-vs-antisocial-personality-disorder/" target="_blank">This is a good summary of the difference between the two</a> </p>
<p>Hope this helps clear up confusion!</p>
<p>Edit #2: Fixed the broken link!</p>
<p>Edit #3: People seem to assume I meant that ALL bed-wetting is a sign of abuse. Let me clarify: Bed-wetting is merely one warning sign that we look for in therapy. I would be looking for a wide variety of other warning signs along with bed-wetting, including nightmares, strong fear reactions, fear of physical touch, inappropriate sexual boundaries, physical aggression, etc. etc. There are a HUGE number of medical causes for bed-wetting that we need to also consider, which include: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bladder issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor sleep/bedtime patterns (i.e. drinking lots of water right as you're falling asleep).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SUPER deep sleep patterns, which means you don't wake up when you have to pee</p>
</li>
<li>Hormone imbalances</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this clears things up some more!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the paper linked by /u/stjep 4 serial killers are analysed without control group so it is hard to say much. But only one of them did both fire setting and animal cruelty as a kid. He also was the only one to wet his bed. So for this guy the triad is great, the other not so much...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair call. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/law/18/4/577/" target="_blank">This review</a> suggests that childhood environment risk factors are not a great predictor of psychopathy when other factors are accounted for in a community sample of offenders. It's going to be a very difficult job to establish what causes psychopathy and, more so, what causes the pop-culture type of serial killer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From the bit of information on Wikipedia it says these three behaviors are usually signs of abuse and/or neglect, which lead to psychopathy, rather than indicators of some kind of born-in psychopathy. I'm not sure if that makes a difference, though?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those traits signal a child who is in need of psychiatric care and a household unfit to raise them. Use of those identifying traits could improve our allocation of social services and child protection services, resulting in better mental health outcomes in abused children and a reduction in violent criminals. For that to happen, though, we would have to have a much better system than we do to care for abuse victims.</p>
<p>Other things wound be done for biologically determined psychopaths.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Conversely, I would imagine that there is a great deal of selection bias wherever you try to study psychopaths, because they have to have been previously diagnosed as such to make it into the study.  Surely, there are plenty of people that fit the bill from a neuro-cognitive standpoint, but have not engaged in antisocial behavior to the extent that they end up with a diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I wonder is if there has been any studies of normal functioning adults who admit to having these behavioral problems as children but have grown up to not have psychopathological traits in adulthood. Well, if there are any (there have to be, right?). Also, to what extent the mental abuse/neglect they suffered affects them, since they don't have an...outlet like, for example, a serial killer does. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a very small sample (N=4) and no control group so I find it hard to draw much conclusions from this paper. For example I find it not very predictive to read that all 4 persons were masturbating. It would be more interesting to see how rare the numbers are compared with a random selection of non serial killers....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be surprised if there was a correlation between masturbation and psychopathy. As I understand it, a degree of masturbation is quite normal, if not expected, in young children. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point exactly. To draw any conclusions from the factors in the paper one has to compare to some other group than the 4 serial killers. From this paper if you cherry pick masturbation you can &quot;prove&quot; that masturbators are serial killers. I don't have a good source, but I think I read that around 90% of humans masturbate.</p></div>		</li>
