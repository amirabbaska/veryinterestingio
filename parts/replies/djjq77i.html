			<div class="markdown"><p>For those of us who work a desk, I'd attribute it more to sitting down all day and barely moving, with a nice helping of boredom.  Between logging off and driving home, I perk right up and suddenly have all the energy in the world as if I hadn't already been awake for 10+ hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thoroughly recommend running. Like it doesn't have to be distance, but literally sprinting as fast and as far as you can. It'll allow you to sleep better. Obviously a more dedicated fitness plan is better, but at minimum running every day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true if you stay awake late into the night. But normally I think it's the dopamine and adrenaline we get when we can do what we want. At work during the day most of us have to do boring stuff that doesn't give the same stimuli.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not sleep hygiene. Every sleep hygiene article is completely full of shit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't do anything except sleep and have sex in your bed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes no sense that the place you literally never, ever sleep would make you sleepy, while the place you spend 95% of your time asleep would make you wide-awake, because you accidentally spent 5% of your time in bed awake watching tv or whatever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't look at screens after 8pm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stare directly into two giant LCD monitors at work for 8 hours straight, and the 30 seconds away from them that I get are spent being blinded by overhead florescent lights. If light exposure was a significant factor then I wouldn't be sleepy at work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try to wake up and go to sleep at the exact same time every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everybody already does that and is still miserable in the morning and wide-awake at night.</p></div>		</li>
