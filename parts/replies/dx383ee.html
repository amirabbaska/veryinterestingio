			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people think of video games as being a waste of time precisely <em>because</em> they are so stimulating, the idea being that if you're going to put in energy and focus into something, then it should be something constructive like learning a new skill (playing the guitar, carpentry, whatever) instead of just consuming media. By contrast, since TV is mostly a mindless activity, these same people see it as a totally valid way of &quot;winding down&quot; after a long day at work.</p>
<p>This doesn't really answer the original question, since OP is placing TV and video games on equal footing, but I know quite a few people who look down on video games but are fine with TV. And, to an extent (and as explained above), I get where they're coming from: TV lets you relax, while video games make you waste energy that would be better spent doing something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the idea behind video games being wasteful isn't so much that they don't provide stimulation, but they can provide too much of it with little long-term gain.  They can suck you in and cause countless hours and money spending, and unlike other hobbies such as reading and knitting there is a lot less to be gained in the form of cultural knowledge or physical possessions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also depends on your intended purpose of doing such hobby. Are you reading a book for the knowledge it can pass on, or for pure entertainment value. Same can be said about Film. Looking at video games, you can go in with the intention of just passing the time and being entertained. Or for the purpose of constantly improving at said game (MOBAs come to mind). I feel like alot of people get caught up chasing the latter... which there's nothing inherently wrong with, but when that becomes an obsession / large part of your life, unless you're seeing significant financial return (which is probably less than .01% of people playing) that is when video games start to hold back your life. </p></div>		</li>

<p>As someone who has lost entire weekends to Civilization (III-VI), I completely agree.</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry I only meant to quote the “sucking time” part.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>While I agree that most games can provide less cultural knowledge than books (depends on which books ofc) I think I actually learned a lot from games.</p>
<p>For example I probably would've never known about the Boxer Rebellion or the Wounded Knee Massacre without Bioshock Infinite. I know of the Painted Ladies in San Francisco because I have been there in a game (Watch Dogs 2).</p>
<p>*Edit: Boxer Rebellion not Revolution. Really making my case here, ey? xD Seriously though, I thought about Unity and the French Revolution as I wrote this, so I think that caused my brain fart here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of my standpoint. I really couldn’t care less how people spend their time, and I like playing some video games sometimes, but people reeeeally get absorbed in them, and I think that’s unhealthy mentally/socially.</p>
<p>I won’t act like I’ve never spent a whole day in my pajamas watching a movie marathon, but it’s a rare occasion. Some people play video games at every single opportunity. That is unhealthy in my mind simply because it makes you lose diversity in your daily activities and probably relationships. I don’t know anyone who gets that obsessive over TV, reading, knitting, etc. A hobby is supposed to be a pastime for when you’ve got nothing else to do or you want to wind down, it shouldn’t be all you want to do all the time rather than interacting with the world.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would vehemently disagree with this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with what you said about unhealthy video game habits I think a part is missing. </p>
<p>I know quite a few people who knit, watch TV or movies, or maintain other habits near the obsessive levels of some video gamers. But no other &quot;group&quot; of hobbies is as large as video games. It is a billion dollar plus industry, maybe more. And it's relatively young. While Atari and other older games have existed since the 60s-70s, they have only really taken off since the 90s with the advent of things like the NES then og playstation and following into the original XBox. </p>
<p>There is no billion dollar knitting industry or company, nor anything that has come into existence as recently or quickly as video games. As such, it's a much bigger target to talk about, with much more publicity and global application. One hobby might be large in a certain country or region, but nothing is as widespread as video games. At this point I'm fairly certain it's a bigger industry than any individual sport, even soccer/football or cricket. That's going to create more widespread criticism than a few people who are obsessive over much smaller hobbies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes you think video games isn’t interacting with the world or forming relationships? My roommate is an avid gamer; he’s nearly always on his computer with some game or other when he’s not working. Every one of those games is played with countless other people while chatting via headset. He plays with our friend that lives three hours away from us and we rarely get to see, he plays with friends he has in other states and NEVER gets to see (including his mother and little brother who recently moved to the other side of the country), he plays with strangers and makes new friends...</p>
<p>I’d say he’s interacting with the world more than most people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand your point. Although I find my gaming skills infinitely more useful than my guitar playing skills, both socially and mentally.  It's nowadays as much of a skill as anything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You linked, as a <em>source</em>, an article that provides no sources, and begins the first sentence with &quot;According to a report.&quot;  </p>
<p>This is made worse by me checking myself and seeing that you copied the source of <a href="http://www.healthwiz.in/you-burn-more-calories-sleeping-than-you-do-watching-television/" target="_blank">this</a> shady website that comes up when searching <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=Calories+burnt+watching+tv+vs+sleeping&amp;oq=Calories+burnt+watching+tv+vs+sleeping&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.8769j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">this</a> on google, which uses your cited article as its source as well, to which again, still provides no source.  </p>
<p>Edit:  It's fucked up that you have that many upvotes for an op piece.  People accept way too much information without fact checking.</p></div>		</li>
