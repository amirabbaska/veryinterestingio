			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay how did our ancestral fishes' brain know that water is transparent in only visible spectrum? I've always thought about it when considering evolution. How does it know things like gravity, magnetism, etc. Which are outside the body</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't &quot;know&quot;. Evolution isn't design and things that develop don't do so because they chose to do so. They develop by chance mutation and, if beneficial, may give the creature with the mutation a better chance of survival - or more specifically a better chance of passing on their genes to offspring. Iteration after iteration then leads to something that looks like design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution can't know anything, or have an end goal. It's all survival of the fittest. A creature with the ability to see in the visible spectrum has an advantage over other creatures without this random mutation, so it is more likely to survive and pass on its genes.</p>
<p>As for gravity and magnetism, I have no idea what you mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks that does answer it. Also, I mean birds being aware of magnetic field of the earth or algae figuring out which exact chemicals you need in the cell for photosynthesis. </p></div>		</li>
