<p>I know, at least one of those test sites allows some limited number of visitors to wander up and look at the big glass formations made under ground zero of some tests.</p>

<p>There appears to be plants and animals there.  That makes sense.  It was a long time ago, and it wasn't intended to irradiate the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but I don't think in the movie he was really arguing that humans are <em>inherently</em> bad. He was just arguing that Gotham is too rich, too decadent, and must be destroyed. He wasn't saying that <em>all</em> cities need to be immediately destroyed, just that he and the League of Shadows will intervene whenever a society becomes too decadent. And I don't think he really made any reference to the environment at all. All he really said was along the lines of: &quot;Gotham is a den of vipers and must be purged.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic definition of &quot;environmentalism&quot; is &quot;stopping human change to the environment.&quot;  So, yeah, anything that kills humans is enviromentalist; the more you kill, the more enviromentalist you are.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to cause an apocalypse that do less damage to the world than a nuclear war though.  Maybe a plague?</p>
<p>(Alternately, there might be ways to stop humans from destroying the enviroment without killing them off, if you really wanted to for some reason.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mentioned this to a friend and he said &quot;Well what about just reducing the population a ton?&quot; But with a very small population, it would just explode again since there wouldn't really be much in the way of contraceptive production.</p></div>		</li>
