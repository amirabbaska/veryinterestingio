<p>I know, at least one of those test sites allows some limited number of visitors to wander up and look at the big glass formations made under ground zero of some tests.</p>

<p>There appears to be plants and animals there.  That makes sense.  It was a long time ago, and it wasn't intended to irradiate the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic definition of &quot;environmentalism&quot; is &quot;stopping human change to the environment.&quot;  So, yeah, anything that kills humans is enviromentalist; the more you kill, the more enviromentalist you are.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to cause an apocalypse that do less damage to the world than a nuclear war though.  Maybe a plague?</p>
<p>(Alternately, there might be ways to stop humans from destroying the enviroment without killing them off, if you really wanted to for some reason.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mentioned this to a friend and he said &quot;Well what about just reducing the population a ton?&quot; But with a very small population, it would just explode again since there wouldn't really be much in the way of contraceptive production.</p></div>		</li>
