			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! I don't know! Based on this research, we only know that there is an effect, we don't know what level or duration of light exposure stops being additionally effective at aiding eye development and suppressing myopia. All we can say for sure is that outdoor light has a dramatic effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not from anything I've read. The exposure to light just slows down the growth of the eye.</p>
<p>When we are young, our eyes grow axially. This causes them to become more an more myopic. In a well lit environment, the cells get stimulated enough for the signal to say &quot;Okay we're good, stop growing now.&quot; Less light or hyperopic (far-sighted) defocus cause this signal to not occur due to lack of light hitting the retina correctly.</p>
<p>At least that's the current understanding.</p>
<p>At a certain point, your eyes will just kind of stop growing. So trying to get it to grow more wouldn't work (at least with modern methods) but also trying to reverse the trend if becoming myopic wouldn't work because the eye can't just shrink back up.</p></div>		</li>
