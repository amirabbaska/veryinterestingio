			<div class="markdown"><p>Another one that comes to mind is the description of Leah's eyes. We get the translation that Leah's eyes were &quot;weak&quot;. </p>
<p>However, the adjective in question at one point described the character of wet ground. Eventually that essentially meant &quot;not suitable to build on&quot;, and later that meaning of structural weakness diffused to mean &quot;weak&quot; in a more general sense.</p>
<p>However, consider the original image of wet ground to people who were nomadic herdsmen in the desert. Wet ground is where plants grow. Wet ground is where your family stops for several days and has a ridiculous amount of water. Wet ground is where you find the only fruit you ever eat. The adjective is something that's desperately beautiful.</p>
<p>Now consider how women likely dressed. They were likely covered except for their eyes. <em>That's</em> why Jacob was so easily convinced to marry Leah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'inn' we commonly think of when reading about the birth of Jesus in Luke probably wasn't an inn.  The word could also mean 'guest room'. The only other time the author of Luke uses that word is in reference to a spare room(during the Last Supper), and when he references an inn during the Good Samaritan, he uses a different word.  Bethlehem wasn't even big enough at the time to have a proper hotel.  The most likely scenario is that when Mary and Joseph showed up, they tried to stay with family, and the guest room was already full, or unusable due to the ritual purity laws involving childbirth, so they had to make do with the cave out back where the animals were kept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't &quot;virgin&quot; a slight mistranslation of a word meaning &quot;young woman&quot;?  And &quot;camel&quot; was a mistranslation of &quot;rope&quot; which makes a lot more sense as something that would not fit through the eye of a needle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Camel is the right word. It's just that we've lost an old meaning of &quot;needle&quot;. The text is not referring to a sewing tool.</p>
<p>Walled cities were commonly constructed with large gates that were closed and secured overnight. This prevented the neighbors from storming in with spears and clubs, because they don't like the way you say shibboleth.</p>
<p>But, the city was not completely closed. There were tiny gates in the wall, too small to enter on horseback, too small to enter more than single file. So, people could <em>enter and exit</em> the city, they simply couldn't <em>invade</em> the city.</p>
<p>These tiny one-person gates are called needles. </p>
<p>Regarding larger needles, one could conceivably completely unload a camel, and with great effort, squeeze it in. But, it has to be completely unpacked first.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Sea of Reeds translation, however, is in the New International version. See Footnote E <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+14%3A1-15%3A21&amp;version=ESV;NIV" target="_blank">here</a> under the NIV column.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a little more digging, and it seems there's still a lot of debate on it today. Either one of us could be right because there's evidence for both. This was actually really interesting though because without you, I wouldn't have started learning about all of this. </p>
<p>It just seems to be something that's been lost in the history of translations. Some of the older versions do mention it clearly as the Red Sea, even before the King James, so there's a lot of contradictions. </p></div>		</li>

<p>although here, &quot;cornerstone&quot; may actually read &quot;head of the arch,&quot;</p>

<p>i.e. keystone or capstone. Substitution of that would still be understandable I suspect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Greek is literally a concatenation of &quot;head&quot; and either &quot;corner&quot; or &quot;curve&quot;. In this sense, it's very hard to differentiate between &quot;cornerstone&quot; and &quot;capstone&quot;. The translators were from a culture with some degree of fixation on cornerstone, whereas a first century builder in Roman-occupied Palestine likely would have seen capstones as more significant.</p></div>		</li>
