			<div class="markdown"><p>I can imagine as competition in the fabric industry grew, clothing that had greater complexity was more of a luxury and more desirable and as cost went down the cloak was phased out entirely. There is only so much you can do to improve the design of a cloak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've wondered this myself. I went a couple of years without a winter coat because the cloak I made was more than warm enough (Midwest US). And I still wear it at every opportunity, including indoors (my house is cold because we're too cheap to pay for heat), despite not being allowed to wear it at work. It's warm, comfy, has sleeves (one of them, anyway), and doesn't get in the way when I drive. It's a bug wearable blanket with a hood. What's not to love? (Answer: the lack of pockets. Wearing my bags underneath doesn't bother me one bit. Keeps the rain off the backpack.)</p></div>		</li>
