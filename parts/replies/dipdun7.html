<p>Very cool stuff!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how AlphaGo was able to beat the highest ranked Go players in the world, watching a ton of games and then playing against itself millions of times. But this was only really necessary because the best moves in Go can't be calculated nearly as easily as the best moves in chess. There are way more possible moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol" target="_blank">GO computer beating 18-time world-champion</a> learned playing the game. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>AlphaGo is most significantly different from previous AI efforts in that it applies neural networks, in which evaluation heuristics are not hard-coded by human beings, but instead to a large extent learned by the program itself, through tens of millions of past Go matches as well as its own matches with itself. Not even AlphaGo's developer team are able to point out how AlphaGo evaluates the game position and picks its next move.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it depends on the game. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go is a complex board game that requires intuition, creative and strategic thinking.[8][9] It has long been considered a difficult challenge in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and is considerably more difficult[10] to solve than chess.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting video.<br />
Are the decisions instant and is the pause purely for watchability, or do the engines actually need to 'think' for a while sometimes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The game is saved as a text file (&quot;move 1: pawn to D4â€¦&quot;) and he's playing it back using a chess programme. </p>
<p>EDIT: I realise you meant when it's first played. There is thinking time, even when you play against a computer as a human.</p></div>		</li>

<p>edit: also how much is calculated during the game and how much is just computed ahead of time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the very beginning, decisions are largely instant, much like in real high level chess.  As matches go on, computing times increase.  How long that takes depends entirely on the hardware running the program.  In the 90s, chess programs could take an excruciatingly long time to make a move once the game had sufficiently progressed.</p></div>		</li>
