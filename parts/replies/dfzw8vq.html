			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately not because internet history, especially as a culture, I don't think is well studied and its hard to make any good judgements about what it is and what it has become or even how it influences the world today.</p>
<p>My theory here is well rooted in the belief that internet culture has influenced America today the most and this is just a time line of what I have observed over time and how I've made sense of it. It is by no means any kind of fact but I present it as food for thought. Maybe someone has a better idea of what is going on and this would be a thought springboard for looking more into it. I have my own plans to get down to seriously researching this because I feel like seeing how culture on the internet and its communities is seriously changing the world for better and worse is important stuff to get looking into. </p>
<p>Imagine this, I'm an IT person so this is kind of the filter I see in regards to the internet. We have millions of devices connected to the internet. By conceptual extension, we have millions of people on the net. If we define the internet as its own world, we have made a virtual earth where everyone in the world is able to exist at the same time regardless of distance. The world shrunk, literally, and we now have a huge mixing of all kinds of ideologies that I think would have otherwise been divided by geological distance.</p>
<p>I'd have to have all my hypothesis' challenged to really know if they're right or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also contributing to the problem is an element of postmodernism that has a strong influence in third wave feminism. Truth is often seen in terms of power, so debates are reduced to power conflicts. You can't let the other person speak, because western ideas about rationality and truth just re-enforce the oppression of marginalized people</p></div>		</li>
