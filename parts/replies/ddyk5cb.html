			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of dermatological research that strongly supports (basically proves) a variety of beneficial applications of several vitamins, particularly different forms of vitamin C. Their effectiveness towards any marketing claim is determined by exactly which molecule is included and whether or not the product is compatible with the vitamins. For example,  some moisturizers have the wrong pH and react with vitamins, preventing them from helping your skin. Your skin is highly absorbent, and vitamins are just chemicals like anything else that could hurt or help skin. I don't know much about hair but it's nonliving material, not living cells, so it's probably not as dramatic a benefit in any case. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just reread your comment and considered that you meant soap wouldn't allow your skin to absorb vitamins. If you're washing your hair or skin for a few seconds, no, that's not enough time for your skin to properly absorb anything, and then you rinse it off. You'd probably need at least 20 minutes of sustained contact to absorb vitamins. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal, but when I use a certain shampoo, the next day when I wake up, my hair looks fine, just maybe a little greasy.  If I use cheap shampoo, the next day when I wake up, my hair looks like birds nested in it.  I'm a dude, but I have longer hair than the average dude.  It's not super long, but longer than normal.  </p></div>		</li>
