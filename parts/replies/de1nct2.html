			<div class="markdown"><p>Question:</p>
<p>I recently had blood work done for the first time, and it was the first time I've ever had blood drawn. I would really like to donate blood, but being pricked by the needle and having my blood taken makes me <strong>extremely</strong> nauseous. Do you have any tips for getting past this? I'd hate to let this little hang up keep me from donating potentially life saving blood :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As with most things, you'll get used to it. It's extremely normal to have an aversion to needles, so they're really used to it and will be very kind to you if you go to donate. The first time I donated I physically shook during the process. Now, it's no big deal. I still don't like it, but having done it before makes me remember that it goes fine and helps me stay calm.</p>
<p>I would suggest picking a day to go with a friend or family member to a local hospital on a weekday and let the staff know you're nervous. Even if you need to bail last minute, nobody will hold it against you. Give it a try, and you might find it's not the worst. Try again, and it won't be bad. Try again and you might enjoy doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt this will help you but my experience with blood donation while have such a fear of needles is this. My only thought going in is of those it could save and include those in my family saved by it. I distract myself as much as possible, reading all material, phone, whatever. When it comes to the needle going in and while in I count roof tiles of the room I'm in, there are thousands so makes quite a game, anything that takes my mind off it while never looking. For me at least there's a sensation in your arm as it's taking blood, my mind tricks me into thinking it's something bad but try to keep my mind off it as much as I can. You tend to find the staff very helpful and if you are having a problem you can call them over. If you really think is going to be a problem with being nauseous I suggest not going, if you where to vomit it could prevent others from donating or cause other problems. It's really a mind over matter problem and only you can decide what you can do, I know many who would like to donate but are scared, it's not there fault at all. They call me brave for doing it, I'm not I'm just trying to do something good that hundreds of thousands people do while trying not to pass out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fortunately, it's not that kind of nauseous. It's not &quot;sick to my stomach oh shit i'ma hurl,&quot; it's more like &quot;wow my head is really light and I feel like i'm going to pass out.&quot; That's my biggest concern, really. Don't want to pass out in the middle of giving blood and potentially hurt myself or a staff member/another patient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that when I donate if I'm not almost EXCESSIVELY hydrated beforehand I get insta-nauseous as soon as I see the needle. Not sure why, and that may or may not help you but it couldn't hurt? </p></div>		</li>
