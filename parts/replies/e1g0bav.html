			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick Trip is everywhere over the South East now too. I don't know where they got a huge cash injection but they've been expanding almost non-stop through this area for the last couple of years. Not quite Spinx level yet, but almost as common it seems like. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that there was an agreement between Spinx and QuikTrip that Spinx would stay out of GA and QT would stay out of SC. Spinx put locations in GA so QuikTrip came to SC which is why there’s a QT everywhere here now, and there’s on near every Spinx it seems like. Probably not a true story, but QT is fucking awesome anyways. Way better than Spinx.</p></div>		</li>
