			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at your phone, or tablet, or book. Being a 3D object, there are 3 axis (axes? axises?) that it can rotate upon. Or rather, 3 imaginary lines you could draw through it that would go through &quot;the middle.&quot;</p>
<p>Holding your phone flat, face up, turn it right over left (like the page of a book) so that it is now face down. The axis that it turned upon runs from the top to bottom of the phone, and is the long axis. </p>
<p>Now turn your phone from top toward you (like a wave on a beach). The axis it's turning on runs east/west on your phone's face. It's a shorter distance than the N/S one we saw, so it is the intermediate axis. </p>
<p>Now turn your phone as if it were a clock. The axis it turns on runs face to back, and is very short (only the thickness of your phone). Naturally, the is the short axis. </p>
<p>An object spinning on one of its primary axis, long or short,  will do so in a stable manor. But to get it to spin on its intermediate axis is unstable. The slightest force on any other axis or vector will cause it to run that way as well.</p>
<p>You also have 3 axis. Spin like a ballerina, and you're turning on your long axis (head to toe.) Do a front flip, and you're turning on your intermediate (left to right, like a playground bar. Your least stable). Do a cartwheel, and you're turning on your short axis (bellybutton to back).</p>
<p>Edit: This is not my field of expertise. The last time I took physics was in high school, 15 years ago. If I'm incorrect, I take no credit for anything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also vector math at play here...</p>
<p>In a 3 dimensional object, the rotation along each axis is related using pythagoras, eg. i^2 +j^2=k^2
The axis are relative of course to the geometry of the object.</p>
<p>By spinning an object along its purely i axis, it will spin relatively stable, same in the j axis.  But the moment you spin it on its k axis, the rotation will consist of components of i and j rotation.  The end  result is the object will tumble as it attempts to spin in 3 axis at once.
Of course this only works for objects which have differing geometry along its 3 primary spin axis. </p>
<p>A ball for example will just rotate as its mass is evenly distributed about its centroid (we assume).  A book or tennis racquet has a very clear &quot;long&quot; axis, a very clear &quot;short&quot; axis, and a &quot;somewhere in the middle&quot; axis, therefore these objects will experience the above phenomena.</p>
<p>Tldr; when you try to spin an object on its &quot;middle of the road&quot; axis, things tend to get all flippity floppity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Euler's equations weren't taught in my Math department until Junior year (Math 335, IIRC).  </p>
<p>There are uses for it in the applied sciences, and I agree are likely introduced earlier.  However, using an equation vs. understanding it are much different things.</p></div>		</li>
