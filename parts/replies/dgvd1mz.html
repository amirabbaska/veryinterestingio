			<div class="markdown"><p>Originally yes, without doubt. But after Reagan's massive win in 1984, Bill Clinton had the Democrats adopt the GOP &quot;law and order&quot; platform for themselves.</p>
<p>Black mass incarceration has had broad bipartisan support in the US for a quarter century. Clinton and Obama are more guilty than Bush 43, so it shouldn't be called Republican anymore. There is a reason this has been labeled &quot;the New Jim Crow,&quot; and we haven't even started to deal with it. It is the major American issue of our lifetimes and it is being ignored. Future generations will look at us as backwards racists for not stopping this. They will ask &quot;how could people let that happen?&quot; just like we ask about segregation. It is different from segregation, but for many people, especially black men, it results in legal disenfranchisement, job and housing discrimination. Is that better or worse than segregation for them?</p>
<p>In short, people of different races use and sell drugs at very similar rates, but black men are the ones targeted for it. And we let it happen because we've accepted the image of black men as criminals.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone to read The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander, and if you can't make the time for that, watch 13th by Ava DuVernay on Netflix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd definitely recommend 13th. Two of my friends worked on the post-production team, but even if you don't know anyone who was involved, you have friends and family members who could be arrested and turned into a felon at a moment's notice. And we need to stop turning good Americans into criminals just because they've made choices that haven't hurt anyone, save for the profits of politicians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stop and frisk policies targeting black communities here in NYC always amaze me, because my white middle class friends are using more hard drugs than anyone else I know. The police are shaking down 16 year old black kids for dime bags, while my white friends and I walk past with ounces of pot, adderall, percocets, coke, and heroin. What makes it really shocking is some of those same friends will see the kid being frisked and say, &quot;Black teenagers, man.. committing all the crime.&quot;</p>
<p>There's something deeply wrong happening in our society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;potential Democrat voters&quot;. Drug users are unlikely to vote anyway, so that's why you have to preface it with &quot;potential&quot;. But besides all of that, Trump won the addicts www.pennlive.com/articles/19804668/high_drug_addiction_rates_corr.amp (of course he's not a real Republican but be that as it may, he won areas with major addiction problems)</p>
<p>None of what you say has anything to do with answering the question. The war on drugs is considered unsuccessful because the potency and purity of drugs has increased while the price has decreased. If it was successful the exact opposite would happen as supply would be restricted. </p></div>		</li>
