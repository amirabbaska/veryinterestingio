			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get tremor also with caffeine or other substances.   I'd say the &quot;aura&quot;  or vision issues are worse than tremor unless it's seizure quality tremor.  And let me assure you the dry mouth is so horrible that I truly feel insurance SHOULD cover dental caries.    Most meds do have dry mouth issues but I find it worst with Prozac.   It's the little things in the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I first started fluoxetine, I had tremors for a month and they finally ended up passing. Then I was super busy at work for awhile and ended up not taking it for about six months after being on it for a year. Towards the end of the six months, I started getting what felt like mini electric shocks passing through my body, almost dropping me. Once I started taking it again, it stopped. Think I'm stuck taking this stuff for life lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's scary. I started having tremors moving to 200 mg venlaflaxine but backed down to 150 and augmented bupropion and they stopped. Glad that didn't continue.</p></div>		</li>
