			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting thing is, during chants, in the ages before sheet music, the monks would memorize music on their hands. This method was known as the guidonian hand, it used each of the knuckles as a note, with the first (do) being G. However the major scales had not been invented yet so they would actually change modes throughout the piece. It's really wild stuff and not at all related to the question, I just like talking about music theory.</p></div>		</li>
