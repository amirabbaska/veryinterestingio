			<div class="markdown"><p>Question from a recording engineer: Is it still standard practice for you to export your final tracks to DDP format? I sometimes have artists ask me for their WAV tracks organized in DDP, presumably to have them ready for the duplication service and include time stamp, track order, CD text, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, also getting a DDP as the final deliverable has number of benefits for the end client:
i) Quickly send straight to the manufacturer for their CD production
ii) DDP has an MD5 checksum file so if any corruption occurs at any point during transfer the zip simply won't open and you'll know to try again (this personally has never happened to me).
iii) The artist can bounce their digital track copies from the DDP </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, The Red Book CD standard still ensures a good playing experience across all types of players even today, on both crappy and high quality players. Similar to web design you want to maintain user accessibility through compatibility with varying kinds of browser. </p>
<p>It's just CD tech improved fairly quickly and a 2 second pre gap is not as essential today. You could probably get away with little to no pre gap at all on a decent player today but I'd still at the very least leave some amount space between. </p></div>		</li>
