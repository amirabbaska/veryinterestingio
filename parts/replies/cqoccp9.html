			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you could but you would have to derive an equation to describe the note for that specific bottles at specific volumes. This equation would rely on factors that change depending on the bottle. This is far too impractical and has no real application so nobody is going to do it. </p>
<p>Edit: Also Engineering student who just applied signal processing concepts to hillbilly jug music. Am I relevant now ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For most liquids, no. In general liquids are several times less &quot;compressible&quot; than gases so pressure waves in the air see the liquid surface as essentially a rigid wall.</p>
<p>The pitch will vary with the volume of air and the length of the &quot;standing wave&quot; that forms in the vessel. The purity of the tone, the overtones, come from the shape of the vessel and the resonance of the vessel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the density of the liquid has no effect. Liquid is incompressible, so to the gas, it would look as solid as the glass bottle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some real-world applications to listening to a range of tones to determine some other characteristics. For example, there are sensors in aircraft engines that pick up sound to determine any potential problems. But yeah, not too practical in this case.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what if the shape was consistent? Don't think of it like, that note came from a half full coors light. Think of it like, i know you're drinking a blue moon, by the pitch of that note, you've had half of it. So with a consistent design would it be possible to tell the volume of the liquid content from the pitch? </p></div>		</li>
