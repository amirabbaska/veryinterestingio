<p>Watch this video from 1953: <a href="https://youtu.be/dflLFFZcZ0w" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/dflLFFZcZ0w</a></p>
<p>This film gives an exceptional view of the shockwave hitting the ground and reflecting back up. When the reflected wave bounces back up, it begins to propogate outward and up. The outward propogating reflected shockwave will actually move faster than the initial shockwave until it meets the initial wave and forms what is called a mach stem, effectively doubling the overpressure from the explosion.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It leaves out the most terrible thing about nuclear attacks. Most scenarios involve many individual nuclear detonations, not just a single one.</p>
<p>So to destroy a city you'd in fact detonate a couple dozen nuclear weapons and of course that means you factor in how one blast affects the next, so as to cause maximum destruction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so lets say you wanted to nuke a huge high population city like London for example, what would be the best at killing the most people? at the ground to maximize fallout? high to maximize thermal radiation? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That touches on a lot of things that really aren't that well known, or at least aren't available in public sources. You might be interested in trying out <a href="http://www.nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/" target="_blank">NukeMap</a>, made by /u/restricteddata, which has casualty estimates from immediate effects. I'm not aware of any good way to estimate casualties from fallout effects. I suppose it would depend a lot on exactly where the detonation was, what the winds were like that day, what the response of the authorities was like, etc.</p>
<p>I will say this though - if you're looking to maximize casualties in a large urban area, you probably want to use multiple devices. The real limiting factor on any nation's nuclear capabilities is the capability to produce fissionable plutonium and uranium. If you build the bombs more powerful, you tend to run into diminishing returns, where it takes so much more fissionables to increase the yield, plus the device gets bigger and harder to deliver, yet the area destroyed doesn't increase as fast. Better to put your extra fissionable material into more bombs, and detonate them far enough away from each other that they don't hit too much of the same ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nukes targeted at urban centers aren't really intended to kill population. They're intended to wipe out industrial and other infrastructure useful for perpetuating war. Which is a part of why they're done as air blasts instead of ground blasts. You're really just trying to wipe out buildings, and I suppose EMP as much as you can. Air blasts give you a larger zone of destruction than ground blasts. </p>
<p>Ground blasts would probably be more effective at wiping out population in the long run because they would send a lot more irradiated particles into the sky to come back down as fallout. But most ground blast nukes would target rural areas, because they would be intended to take out our nuclear missile silos and other military infrastructure which can often be found underground in rural areas. </p>
<p>Contrary to how it's depicted in fiction, rural areas would probably get hit harder by radioactive fallout than urban areas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with fallout is that is out of control.</p>
<p>You're detonating 2 bombs in London and most of the fallout could be in France and other parts of Europe.</p>
<p>Two weeks later it's moved by atmosphere in the entire world.</p>

<p>That's basically it, and why those planning attacks generally try to minimize fallout. It's hard to predict exactly where it'll go, and tends to linger long after conflicts have been resolved.</p>

<p>Well that's a political and game-theory question, not so easy to resolve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the reverse blast wind. You get a huge pressure increase with the blast but as the fireball rises and the air at ground level starts to cool, you get a drop of pressure at ground level causing a longer duration wind back towards the bomb.
