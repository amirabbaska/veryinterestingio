			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure why, but that seems weird. Perhaps it's just the image in my head, of a grown man trying to contort his feet into the sink before bed. Even though that's probably not even remotely close to the actual process. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. It never used to bother me much, but lately it's been driving me crazy because I've been traveling a lot and forced to sleep in many different locations that I'm not familiar with. And since they all tend to have very different blanket, sheet &amp; cover sets, it results in my feet having no idea how to handle the situation properly. I end up waking up repeatedly, whether it be to cover my feet back up, or to kick the entire blanket completely off the bed. </p>
<p>I cannot count how many times I've been woken up by a slap across the head with my lady saying, &quot;Quit straddling the entire sheet! and why the hell is the bedspread way over by the door?!&quot; </p></div>		</li>
