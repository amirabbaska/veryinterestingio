			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best non technical answer.</p>
<p>The only thing missing is that the &quot;pump&quot; actually gets its energy from letting some of the water from the &quot;charger&quot; tank flow out on the ground through a water wheel..... So, not <em>all</em> of the &quot;water&quot; from the charger tank ends up in the phone tank. About 10 percent gets spilled out along the way to pump the rest in.  </p></div>		</li>
