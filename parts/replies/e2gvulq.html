			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no clear overarching strategy to it, if that's what you're asking. It's just your body reacting to a very unexpected stimulus (or lack thereof). </p>
<p>There are many systems that rely on sunlight as a timing cue, and in a very generalized sense, without sunlight most of those systems <em>wait</em> (you can think of it as fail-close instead of fail-open).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Actually, it's been measured to be equal to 24 hours 11 minutes, or almost exactly 87.0 kiloseconds (instead of the 86.4 ks / 24 h that a &quot;day&quot; is), at least for an average person. Earlier studies suggested it expanded to 25 hours with some going all the way to even 36, but were not done in optimal environments. The study to measure this though was done much more recently than the 60s/70s - in fact, it was done around the turn of this century:</p>
<p><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/07/human-biological-clock-set-back-an-hour/" target="_blank"><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/07/human-biological-clock-set-back-an-hour/" target="_blank">https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/07/human-biological-clock-set-back-an-hour/</a></a></p>
<p>And the variance is +/-16 min, or about 1 ks, so 85.0 - 88.0 ks for the majority of the bell curve, and this is apparently typical of many other species' natural rhythms as well (at least those that evolved in a day/night environment).</p>
<p>However, it is also possible to train the rhythm to match somewhat smaller or longer times with suitably timed use of bright lights, but there is a natural rhythm close to, but a bit longer than, 1 day, which should not be surprising given that a normal day of 86.4 ks is shorter than the rhythm period. This has been verified to extend to at least about 90 ks (25 h), and definitely Mars' days, 88.775 ks (24 h 39 min 35 s), and the study examining this I believe was aimed specifically toward this purpose for informing future Mars colonization efforts. (It's possible it could go further, and the authors suggested that staged use of bright lights to gradually extend it might work, but this was not tested. So I'd say 84-90 ks is the near-verified (not sure if they did the short end, thus &quot;near&quot;) range of adaptability/modifiability, while 86-88 the range of natural variation in the baseline rhythm.)</p>
<p>FWIW, regarding the topic matter of the original post, within one period of the rhythm there are also different &quot;phases&quot; including where one is most active, and this varies between individuals from early to late in the rhythm period. I suspect OP is one whose phase setup may run a bit late.</p></div>		</li>
