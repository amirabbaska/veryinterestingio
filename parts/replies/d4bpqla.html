<p>Skin cancer left me with a huge hole under my eye. It was too close to the eyelid and too big to stitch up. So for a good while it was an open wound. </p>
<p>I took care of it pretty well so the scar now doesn't look that bad but I do often notice kids noticing it. I don't mind that. I like to have fun with it like telling them I didn't eat my vegetables. </p>
<p>It's the adults that get to me. It's rare but every now and then someone will say something like &quot;who punched you&quot;. The look of regret on their face when I say Skin Cancer usually makes me feel a little better. </p>
<p>With women it's 50/50. I've had a bunch of very stressful things happen in the past few years that have left my face look rugged. Some girls love that. Others not so much. The combination of stress and cancer has aged my face about 15 years more than the last 10 should have. </p>
<p>Edit. Nsfl? image of 1 day after surgery. It's not too bad but if you're squeamish don't click ;) <a href="http://m.imgur.com/kBdPn6x" target="_blank">http://m.imgur.com/kBdPn6x</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually pretty awesome. If it isn't too much to ask would you consider posting something current? I'm super interested at how it healed being in such a crappy spot. Good on you though that the cancer didn't get into your eye.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a bit washed out but it's healed pretty well. </p>
<p>In fairness to the adults it does kind look like I got punched though. On the bright side less people fuck with me now :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a dude at a local strip mall whose face looked like Deadpool's face was supposed to look, like his head's skin had been ripped off or something. It was so bad that I couldn't force myself to look at him and give him a courtesy nod.</p>
<p>Most oddly, he had a huge smile on his face. Maybe that's the only expression he can make. But the juxtaposition of his plight and his bright attitude was brain-breaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this isn't the same thing as looking melted, but I was super sad and pissed in high school because I had huge painful cystic acne. Still have scars from it.</p>
<p>But senior year I saw a guy who didn't have huge painful bumps, but had so many tiny zits that they seemed to outnumber the remaining portions of regular skin.</p>
<p>Thing is, he was always smiling, never a jerk, walked confidently and even had a decent looking girlfriend.</p>
<p>It blew me away because I figured me being infected and unattractive was just something I had to chalk up as a loss, at least for that early stage of life. And here he made the attitude portion look like a choice. And it was. He didn't care that 99% of girls would pick non zitty over zitty. His not letting it get to him meant that 1% didn't care, which to him was functionally the same as 100% success because she was cute and he adored her.</p>
<p>Ever since I've tried to concentrate on not being weighed down by my self image. Ugly people, deformed people, mentally handicapped people, abusive jerks, everything that's supposed to be bad or make it more difficult to find love? I've seen dozens if not hundreds of examples of it still people possible.</p>
<p>Granted, hasn't happened for me once, and not being attractive still doesn't help, and my attitude has vastly improved, but I no longer dictate my moods or potential success based on how I feel about my looks, and I don't make requirements or expectations about how others feel about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take orders at a fast food place. One day a guy came in literally without a nose. Like he had a bandage and a hole where his nose should be. You could see inside his face basically, I think there was some bone showing. He also smelled like that hospital/doctor's office smell. I don't know what kind of thing would cause that, but it was a shame.</p>
<p>Dealing with customers for a long time though sort of numbs your reactions I guess. Most of the time I glare right into their eyes, usually because they're being rude pieces of shit. That kind of carried over to everyone and regardless of what they look like I tend to just be able to look in their eyes and not show an expression. Observing some people's reactions to that is strange. Sometimes the person with some kind of scar, or extremely overweight, or even the crazy hot woman with a low cut shirt comes in, you pay attention to their eyes and not what draws other people's attention, and they seem caught off guard, or surprised. Some crack a smile if they didn't come in with one. It's pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time I went to a Walmart and saw a whole family who seemed to be burn victims. Like, really bad burns. The three kids were all completely fucked up and had bandages all over and the skin on their faces was pale, warped and stretched tight. But they were all laughing and having a good time browsing the toy section. I felt bad for staring but I couldn't help it for a while, it was just so heartbreaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you're here, too!</p>
<p>From what I've noticed regarding friends with an anomaly like a facial scar or large birthmark or whatever, once someone gets to know you, it sort of &quot;disappears.&quot; That doesn't really help with first impressions though, which is the pits. </p>
<p>I think dressing nicely and your overall presentation help immensely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My fiancee has a cleft lip as well. Admittedly, when we first me I noticed straight away, though I didn't know what a cleft was at the time. Nowadays, I only notice it once in a while. Obviously I can see the scar, but I'm usually focusing more on the face of the woman I'm about to marry.</p>
<p>Reading CancerFaceEww's story makes me wonder if she's gotten the same microexpressions from people. There have been times when people have outright stared at her, sometimes kids, sometimes adults (especially when we've travelled to countries where the etiquette is different). I can't imagine what its like having people looking at you different because of something that's out of your control. But I'm sure I've also been the person caught staring rudely.</p></div>		</li>
