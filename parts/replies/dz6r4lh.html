			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when some big French politician got accused of assaulting his maid in NYC. The French press threw a shitstorm because the American press took and published pictures of the politician being lead away in handcuffs.  Such stuff is outlawed in France because the sight of someone handcuffed would prejudice the public against them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a professional in this field so I really don’t know, but if I had to guess I’d say no. That’s because if in your county/city/state (which ever is the arresting agency) if they have your mugshot as public record then unless all mugshots are removed from public record via a new law, your mugshot can’t be an exception unless there are some very unique circumstances behind it. Again, that’s just my unprofessional assessment and if it’s something you’re really looking to get changed then I encourage you to take the steps to change it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Virginia, at least Henrico county, your mugshot is on the internet with the charge immediately. The first thing that pops up on a google search. It costs significant money to get it removed. A private firm removes it by seo, I believe. Really is damaging to your reputation for jobs etc. One would think the damaged reputation overshadows the need to keep police honest. Sucks for me as someone who has had this happen to them.</p></div>		</li>
