			<div class="markdown"><p>So now I'm wondering if the only people who would survive such an event would be people who happened to by flying at the time. However, would a regular passenger jet survive an extra 1000MPH of airspeed? I somehow doubt it. So then the only people who would survive would be fighter jet pilots whose planes were not already at max speed...right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pilot's response:</p>
<p>If the ground suddenly stopped, the airspeed of an aircraft would not jump 1000mph. The groundspeed however would jump 1000mph. Same thing would happen to a hot air balloon.
Say an aircraft is flying 600mph at a moderate latitude where the earth spins at the same speed. If flying West, your movement through the air would be equal to the air's movement over the ground (wind). This 600mph headwind would give you a groundspeed of 0. Alternatively, if flying East, your groundspeed will double to 1200mph. This would have no bearing on the aircraft until it tried to land, airspeed is still 600mph.</p>
<p>90% of the mass of the atmosphere (pressure) is below 40,000 feet. Essentially, an airliner cruising at 40,000 feet automatically evades 90% of the effects of inertia. Even if all the air stopped with the earth, the most this aircraft would see is a 100mph temporary jump or drop in airspeed, survivable.</p>
<p>The real issue here is wind shear. Imagine instant 10x hurricane force winds covering the surface of the globe. It will take a while for 1000mph winds to die down, all that energy has to be spent as friction against the surface. The lowest couple thousand feet near the surface regularly see slower wind speeds and wind directions due to friction and disturbances on the surface, trees, buildings, mountains. Eventually the lowest altitude winds would begin to match the surface while a few thousand feet away the air continues to move hundreds of miles an hour. So while the upper atmosphere continues zipping along at 1000 mph the surface air is slowing. If we assume a constant wind gradient, you would see an additional 25mph headwind or tailwind for every 1,000 feet you descend.  Realistically, wind shear would be more pronounced and uneven near the surface. A normal rate of decent could easily lose enough airspeed to cause a stall. A very slow rate of decent would be most ideal but there may not be enough fuel to wait out the crazy weather. If a stall was experienced, altitude could be traded to regain airspeed to escape a stall but of course the fast descent rate would introduce you to even more wind shear very quickly. You could stall all the way to the ground. Wind shear of this speed is extremely dangerous. In order to fly slow enough to avoid overstressing the aircraft you also risk flying slow enough to easily stall. Best bet is to stay at 40,000 feet until the atmosphere slows down with you assuming you have enough fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're flying and suddenly the earth stops spinning, the air will not instantaneously stop due it's momentum. (it would slow down slowly-ish) So anyone on a plane would survive unless they later crash into something. <del>They may not even notice anything unless they observed what's going on at ground level.</del> They would still realise something is wrong because they wouldn't be able to communicate with air traffic controllers etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If everything gets projected 1000 miles an hour equally through momentum, isn't there nothing left to collide with each other since they are all moving at the same speed? </p>
<p>At least until air friction slows the larger objects, I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ground will have stopped moving, so anything physically connected to the ground would be forced to stop with it, ripping buildings’ foundations out from underneath them. Anything else in contact with the ground would experience a huge amount of friction.</p>
<p>But yeah anything not attached to the ground would just appear to be thrown forwards at a ridiculous speed along with everything else, probably being destroyed by the massive frictional heating and deceleration from air resistance. 1000mph is greater than the speed of sound.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except some stuff is stuck in the ground. Plus, you'd probably hit the ground itself pretty quickly. The drop off of the ground due to moving in a tangent to the surface of the curved surface won't be greater at 1000mph than accelerating towards the Earth due to gravity, so you don't gain altitude, just slide along the ground, generally. </p></div>		</li>
