			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example of non-European culture recognizing multiple seasons is China, which historically recognized 24 distinct periods roughly analogous to &quot;seasons.&quot; Japan further refined each of these 24 into 3 periods each, leading to a historical system of <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/features/h00124/" target="_blank">72 total &quot;microseasons.&quot; </a> These have been largely abandoned in favour of a European four season system, or in some places, a simple two season &quot;wet/dry season.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to argue with that.</p>
<p>We Chinese don't recognize 24 seasons, it's still just 4 seasons which is Spring 春, Summer 夏, Autumn 秋, and Winter 冬. Those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_term" target="_blank">节气 or Solar term in English</a> are not seasons.</p>
<p>For example, one of the Solar Term is 立秋. It means Autumn has arrived. Then there's 秋分, which mean by this time of Autumn, the Day and Night are at the same length. They are happening in Autumn, and not other seasons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can see how weather conditions could be used to name general trends to subdivide seasons, but those can't be defined by constants like astronomical arrangements. Would the official designation of a season depend on interannual variation in the timing of the recognized weather event? If winter begins the first time it snows, it could vary by two months from one year to the next.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about somewhere like Singapore, on the equator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>February is the hottest month in Singapore with an average temperature of 27°C (81°F) and the coldest is January at 26°C (79°F) with the most daily sunshine hours at 9 in September. The wettest month is December with an average of 269mm of rain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The temperate four season model simply doesn't apply. I live a bit further north but still in the tropics, most of the tropics have really hot, rainy/monsoon and slightly less hot seasons. On the equator it pretty much mushes together, you can see the difference in temperature between the hottest and coldest month (which are adjacent) is all of 1 degree. They are usually wet all year as well, they have &quot;more wet&quot; and &quot;less wet&quot;.</p>
<p>We don't have winter, we don't have summer (if you were comparing to a temperate climates, we have summer year round), we don't have autumn/fall, and we don't have spring. We have hot and wet, hot and dry, and really hot and dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The boundaries are concrete astronomical events, yes. They're the solstices (when the axis of tilt of the earth is aligned with the direction of the sun) and equinoxes (when that axis is orthogonal to the same). </p>
<p>The weather phenomena associated with the time between those boundaries are a product of local climate, and climate is not only a product of the angle of the sun in the sky, jetstream and ocean currents matter just as much if not more. </p>
<p>So the 4-season model doesn't necessarily stick for every place. Obviously the hottest and coldest parts of the year are roughly opposite in the northern and southern hemisphere, but there are sometimes good reasons to make different breakdowns altogether. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Notably, even in temperate &quot;4 season&quot; places the actual timing of the associated weather can vary with distance from the equator. Where I grew up, the official &quot;first day of summer&quot; based on the solstice was really nearly a month into the warm season, and the &quot;first day of spring&quot; usually meant there was still snow on the ground and we could expect major snow storms for the next month or so. </p>
<p>We did have traditional spring, summer, autumn, and winter weather that was pretty distinct and segregated on the calendar, it just didn't really match up with the solstices and equinoxes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small side note:  while some consider the solstices to be “boundaries”, others consider them to be “peak season”.  There’s a good deal of confusion about this.  Is the winter solstice the beginning or the epitome of winter (“as winter as it gets”)?  Americans claim the former and say in mid-December “it’s winter now”.  Europeans consider November to be winter.  And clearly, when Shakespeare wrote “Midsummer Nights Dream” he was not referring to August 1.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not necessarily. Here in Australia, for example, our seasons are aligned with calendar months: Summer starts on 1st December (not the Summer solstice), Autumn starts on 1st March (not the Vernal equinox), and so on. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, neither the astronomical seasons nor the calendrical seasons actually correspond with the weather in certain parts of the country. For instance, even though Summer officially ends on 28th February, the hot weather associated with Summer continues through until March and even April in most places. The calendar is just an arbitrary device which doesn't match reality. </p>

<p>While the Sun's movement through the sky is certainly of interest to astronomers and other sky-watchers, that doesn't necessarily correlate with the annual changes of weather conditions in your location. The ancient Babylonians - who were inveterate sky-watchers - happen to have chosen to create 4 divisions of the year based on the equinoxes and solstices, and we've carried on a tradition of aligning our weather changes to those astronomical movements. </p>
<p>One could say there are two separate and unrelated concepts here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Equinoxes and solstices.</p>
</li>
<li>Annual weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>For historical reasons, we mark both these concepts as &quot;seasons&quot;, but it would be more accurate to separate them and give them different names. </p></div>		</li>
