			<div class="markdown"><p>Make sure you call in advance to find out the deal. The library I work at only has a small supply, and we're giving them out first-come-first-serve at the event. No reservations or freebies for home use. Unfortunately it was reported in the media that we &quot;had eclipse glasses&quot; so I hope it doesn't turn into an absolute madhouse the day of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a library too! And should definitely have been more clear. The media reported that you could just walk in to any library and get free glasses, and although some are set up that way, many only have glasses available at their program (because we don't have enough to just hand them out all will nilly!), Or don't have glasses at all.</p></div>		</li>
