			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you implied that a bigger temperature difference means a faster transfer maybe you can answer a question:
I heard some time ago that on the coldest place on Earth water will freeze before touching the ground when you throw it up (not massively, like maybe 2 meters at max) but only if it's hot because it cools faster. What I wonder is how it works, I understand that it will cool from 90°C to 70°C pretty fast but at some point it will reach a lower temperature like 20°C and then it will cool down just as fast as room temperature water</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Warm water will take longer to freeze than cooler water. The warm water will lose heat at a faster rate at first, but the rate will slow down as it gets closer to ambient temperature.</p>
<p>Maybe you're thinking about how warm water put in a freezer will freeze faster? That happens because it causes the freezer to cycle on, which obviously doesn't happen outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's simply untrue. Cold water freezes faster than hot water.</p>
<p>Like you said, 90 degree water has to reach 20 degrees first and then cool down to 0. Obviously that takes more time than 20 degree water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the trick of throwing boiling water into very cold air works because hot water breaks up into smaller particles when tossed into air which in turn allows it to freeze before hitting the ground.  </p>

<p>It depends on the conditions.  Warmer water can freeze sooner than cool water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would significantly less people on the planet help with the climate change problem we currently have?</p>
<p>It seems as thought through biological processes that the climate is being warmed unnaturally, it's only unnatural due to the fact that fossil fuels have created an unnatural ability for the Planet to sustain the life that it currently does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really related to the original question... But considering that CO2 emissions caused by human actions are very likely the main driver between the current climate change, having less people around would help.</p>
<p>However, this has nothing to do with the amount of heat a human body produces by itself, which is very small compared to everything else going on.</p></div>		</li>
