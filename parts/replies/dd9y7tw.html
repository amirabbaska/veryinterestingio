<p>It means they could not prove you did it which means you're not guilty</p>

<p>Technically correct, the verdict should actually be &quot;not proven guilty&quot;. Guilt is wether or not you commited the offence or crime, the guilty verdict is the case when the court manages to prove it...</p></div>		</li>

<p>The court can't render a verdict that changes reality, only the defendant's relationship to the law.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases.  In this example, during deliberation the jurors would discuss the evidence and testimony presented to the court.  They would take into consideration and determine the credibility of the witnesses testimony.  The law does not state beyond any doubt--just a reasonable doubt.  I would argue to Sciass550 that Tom was a credible witness; he seemed honest, trustworthy and the testimony presented to the court indicated that Tom doesn't even like Oreo cookies.  Either another juror sways me into thinking that it is reasonable or I sway them--if each person maintains their position, you get a hung jury.  </p>
<p>After the criminal case is over, Bob is sued in civil court for restitution.  The standard of proof is not beyond a reasonable doubt, but more likely than not.  Bob is found guilty and has to pay the plaintiff.</p></div>		</li>
