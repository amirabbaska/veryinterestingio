			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the speed at which he's referring to of 2/3c is the speed at which the wave travels, but an individual electron in a wire moves actually very slowly. We're talking about ~10nm/s. The only reason your light turns on is because electrons in front of it are already really close to the bulb and get 'pushed' by electrons behind it.</p>
<p>Also, unrelated to previous comment, supercooled materials can become superconductors, where the resistance goes to 0. Not almost 0, but true 0. I can't say for certain how this affects the speed of the wave or the speed of the electrons. Hopefully someone smarter than me can fill you in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wave equations in superconductors complicate beyond my understanding, but I believe in real terms the propagation wave slows down quite a bit, and I'm certain the drift does. Maybe I'll ask around at work and find out; we have a lot of superconductors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The quantum effect that leads to superconductivity is called Bose-Einstein condensation. The best way to think of it is that the superconducting electrons (which are not actually all the electrons!) become locked together and start to move as one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are mistaken. The electrons don't really move. This is a misunderstanding. The wave, as you mention, is the one actually carrying the energy in an electric circuit, at essentially the speed of light. So, when you flip a switch, the wave propagates incredibly fast to the light bulb. It does travel that distance, but is essentially instantaneous.</p>
<p>The &quot;electrons moving&quot; description, electrons bumping and pushing their way inside a tube filled with other electrons is just a way to understand the concept, but it is not really true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons in a conductor will drift in the direction of an applied electric field. You're totally right, it's mostly irrelevant for understanding how electrical signals propagate down a wire, but nonetheless drift does occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is extremely interesting. Could you expound upon why the permittivity of the surrounding material is used? And if you always use the surrounding material, would a signal propagate through a copper wire in a vacuum at nearly 1.0c?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first answer is, that the electromagnetic field cannot travel through the metal wire. (Hence why we use metals for shielding electromagnetic radiation) The elemagnetic wave traels surrounding the wire, influencing and being influenced by the electrons inside the wire.</p>
<p>For the second question Im not 100% sure but i think the answer is yes, the wave should travel at c (almost since air is close but not excactly vacuum)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Well it is not that it <em>cannot</em>, it just doesn't <em>need</em> to. </p>
<p>Copper strangely enough has essentially the same mag permeability as air and vacuum. Steel/iron is much greater. </p>
<p>Here are some numbers:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_%28electromagnetism%29#Values_for_some_common_materials" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_%28electromagnetism%29#Values_for_some_common_materials</a></p>
<p>A mag field can exist in copper. You can have a thin copper wire surrounded by a mile thick copper sheath, separated by an infinitely small gap. The mag field will be in the copper sheath. If you closed the gap, the electron movement will be distributed through the mile thick copper sheath, and the mag field will be outside of that. But if the sheath is isolated, it will contain the field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! People always mention that electricity is &quot;moving electrons in a conductor&quot;, but this is false. Electrons do move. But this movement is irrelevant. What moves or propagates is the electromagnetic energy in wave form. This wave travels at the speed of light for all purposes. So, really, &quot;electricity&quot; travels at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Thinking of electrons as solid balls that bump into each other is only a way to understand the phenomena, but is not actually what happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic field is flowing 90 degrees in relation to the electron flow of current in a conductor. As a magnetic field, it's observable around the conductor so this field is passing through the medium surrounding the conductor.  </p>
<p>At higher frequencies, current actually begins to spiral out across the conductor externally rather than internally (skin effect) which is why cables such as coaxial lines have to be properly dielectrically shielded.  </p>
<p>At RF even non conductive plastics or rubber insulation on an inductor can affect the Quality of the coil. This wouldn't be the case unless that insulation externally being there wasn't making a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, its really the transfer of the electromagnetic field that needs to be the focus. Too many people assume it's the motion of the electrons (I used to be one of them) themselves, when they barely move (DC , as in a battery) or not really at all (AC).</p>
<p>I really do need to spend more time really fleshing out my understanding of the concepts you're describing.</p></div>		</li>
