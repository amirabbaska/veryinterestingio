			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to clear this up... there is little &quot;molten rock&quot; beneath the crust. The mantle is largely solid, consisting of various mafic phases. The layer immediately below the crust is thought to be &lt;1% molten, due to density differences detected via seismic wave analysis, but it's solid enough to transmit s-waves (unlike the outer core, which does not transmit s-waves and is interpreted as being liquid) (source: any first year Geology textbook). I won't disagree with your comment - there does seem to be ample water in the mantle (and may be water when you actually get to the liquid core), but much of it seems to be locked up in hydrous mineral phases (see <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171121121441.htm" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171121121441.htm" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171121121441.htm</a></a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That definitely makes sense. So would it be safer to say that it will be &quot;wet&quot; except for pockets of molten rock?</p>
<p>My knowledge is mostly random physics stuff, so I can only apply what I know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small point - you say &quot;until you meet molten rock&quot;, implying that you will at some point meet molten rock. This is a poor assumption because only a tiny proportion of the Earth's silicate mantle is molten, and the Earth's outer core is metallic so isn't really rock. The only places on Earth where you would be likely to ever meet magma are around mid-ocean ridges and in volcanic regions.</p></div>		</li>
