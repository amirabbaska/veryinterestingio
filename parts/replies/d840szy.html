			<div class="markdown"><p>To add some details to your answer. The leakage tolerance for a microwave oven is 5.0 mW/cm2. (Canadian standard, measured 5cm from the exterior with no load) So a typically oven could emit several watts of energy at 2.4Ghz. Compared to the measly 0.1W your router outputs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What do you mean &quot;with no load&quot; there? With it turned off?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you placed water near a leaky part of the microwave and gave it enough time, it should produce a measurable rise. But you're going to need an accurate, sensitive thermometer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An incoming phone call would cause an instant wall of packet loss (most noticeable when in a multiplayer game) on a 56K modem connection if the phone line had call waiting (otherwise the caller would just have gotten the busy tone). If you unplugged the modem in time, the phone would then ring and the call could be answered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Standard 4-wire telephone cable has 4 wires.  In the way old days (the 1960s) when everyone had a landline and just one landline, two apartments were frequently wired off the same wire.  I used to live in a typical two story California apartment complex and my neighbor and I shared such a wire.  In the late 80s, when I got a modem, my computer would pick up the fact that he was getting a call.  It would drop my modem signal, and the telnet program would display &quot;RING RING.&quot;  I ended up getting a second line put in for my modem.  PacBell ran another wire up the side of the building, stapling it all along the way, and into my bedroom.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To add to that:  No, your microwave, nor your wifi router will give you cancer.  Ever.</p>
<p>There's a bit of 'wifi radiation' coming from the gigantic fusion reaction we're near.  Living underneath it for that long, you've seen probably hundreds, if not thousands of times that much radiation in the 2.4ghz spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there's no harm in it.</p>
<p>The discussion to replace the microwave is a financial one.  You're using something that's not properly shielded, so some of the 'work' is just going out as 'waste'.</p>
<p>Say someone is heating up their lunch.  If the microwave oven was 'perfect', it would take 55 seconds to heat up their food.  There's no such thing as perfect, so a good, properly working microwave will take 60 seconds.  Yours takes 70 seconds to heat up the same food.</p>
<p>That's 10 seconds extra it's on, sucking watt and after watt to do the same work as a new one.  Over the course of a day, that's, say, an extra 3 minutes of time the microwave has to be on.  Every day.  365 days a year.  That's 18 hours of the microwave doing nothing every year.</p>
<p>That microwave sucks a ton of wattage.  That's a lot of energy costs for no good reason.  Never mind that Debbie has to heat up her coffee twice because it didn't work well enough the first time, so it takes her longer to get back to her job.  Wasted wages.</p>
<p>From a financial standpoint, proper working equipment, no matter how simple, is essential.  It saves you money over time.  People who 'force' employees to waste money on non- or poorly-functioning equipment are idiots who like to waste company time and funds.</p></div>		</li>
