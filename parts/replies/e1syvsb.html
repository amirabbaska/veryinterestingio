			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty natural for your body to excrete anything you eat that it won't be able to digest in a reasonable amount of time. It's similar to seeing whole pieces of corn in there. Competitive eaters just take it to the extreme. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's to avoid food actually rotting in your digestive system right? I heard that can happen to amimals with slow digestive systems (sloths I think) although I don't know if thats bull.</p>
<p>So in theory if you were constipated food could actually rot in your gut? Could that cause problems?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the bread would be digested pretty easily from the gastric juices and stuff, it's probably just the processed sausage part that comes out in chunks and pieces if it's not properly mushed by your teeth. Never tried it though, just guessing based on how fast bread soaks up liquids, especially stomach acids. </p></div>		</li>
