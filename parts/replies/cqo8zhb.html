			<div class="markdown"><p>You didn't mention how Valve:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Does not check whether mod quality is correspondent with it's price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not make sure mods are compatible with the current game version or other mods (So if they break in the future tough fucking luck)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Valve does not provide any kind of support for mods gone wrong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if there is a refund, you only have 24 hours AND funds never leave Valve HQ, you will have them in your steam wallet, but you will never recieve that money again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is rampant theft of mods going on, people posting work that isn't theirs for profit, preventing the real authors from uploading the work (Afaik).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free versions of mods have started to include advertisements already, Midas magic has a 4% chance to pesk you to buy the full version if you cast one of the spells it adds to the game.</p>
</li>
<li>Valve came to BE thanks to free modding, team fortress, natural selection, counter strike all started as mods.</li>
</ol>
<p>I ain't using any of those paid mods now, I ain't buying any of those mods now and I sure as hell am seeding the fuck out of them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's hard to mod for Skyrim even with the wealth of information available. Serious, gameplay-level modding requires technical know-how and understanding that mere mortals simply can't comprehend. When your gameplay mod is making you money, why would you teach others how to make something like that?</p>
<p>Plenty of outstanding gameplay mods start out with &quot;inspired by xxx mod&quot; and have &quot;thanks to yyy for making xxx mod, this mod can't happen without it&quot;. That's possible because everybody wants to help everybody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the monetization aspect shifts the balance of modding from cooperative to competitive.</p>
<p>Imagine there being five different types of Sky UI used in five different mods because each paid mod doesn't want their version usable by other paid mods and the free version guys don't want any paid mods using theirs.  (Copyright, licenses, etc.)  Now imagine five types of FNIS.  Five types of every tool.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This entire monetization scheme reeks of the old guard of corporate suits refusing to adapt to the way this type of market works.</p>
<p>Modding works similarly to Twitch and Youtube content creators in that people go out of their way and work hard creating videos/content that people might enjoy but ultimately creating content that the content creator themselves wanted to do. Sure, they might desire compensation for it, and that is entirely the reason Patreon/Donations/Subs exist. The consumer gets to try and product free of charge and there is a large risk of massive leeches never paying to consume said products. But this protects the consumer and enforces the notion that the content creator will try their hardest to create quality products that do garner those desired subs.</p>
<p>Yet, this old-hat corporate nonsense refused to adapt to such a model and just stuck a DLC type monetary model in a market that is completely adverse to it. They felt that by throwing money at it they could create some vibrant, bastard child of DLC as if they were contracting random people to create content for their game. As if the lack of funds in the modding community was a hindrance to its development. Laughable, if not insulting to the modding community at large.</p>
<p>&quot;Let the free market decide what happens LOL&quot; is the response gamers have received from Valve/Bethesda in the way this was set up, and it is such a lazy and irresponsible way to handle this transition which offers no support for gamers nor for the modders which they enticed to take part in this nonsense. If they actually had listened to the &quot;free market&quot; then they would have followed a model similar to Twitch/Youtube.</p>
<p>Modding was a bastion for gamers to be unique, away from the corporate mentality that pervades nearly every other facet of life. Modding shifting from cooperative to competitive effectively kills it, as the community will tear itself apart by crucifying those who participate in this paid system (ex: Chesko) and many other modders will forever feel uncomfortable moving forward with collaborative projects or even their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my biggest concern. Now that mods are paid, what about mod tools?<br />
What if TES5Edit decides that you cant use their tools for free because paid modders use them too? Were does it stop?</p>
<p>Or imagine someone like SKSE decides to be paid, but some mods like SkyUI already ships it. What if they just pick a licence that forbids placing them inside paid mods?</p>
<p>This will be the end of modding as we know it. There will be some separate mods but no compatibility with each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine that mod tools would work just as general purpose development tools do (eg, Blender or Photoshop). The tool can be paid for, yet anything created with it is your IP and you can opt to price it anyway you want. The cost for the tools applies only to the developer.</p>
<p>For something like SKSE, presumably once you paid for it, you could use anything that depends on it. Developers would have to pay for it too, but just like a regular user. So you'd be paying access to a service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you, there's a really great community in the mods for Bethesda's games. I'm in agreement with your post, but technical programming is only 10% of the &quot;market&quot; here. I am an amateur 3d modeler, and something that would be obscenely easy for me is to simply reskin an existing game asset  or alter an existing free mod to an unrecognizable point and then charge people for it. I fully support a donate button next to the download button but I wouldn't even do that knowing Valve and Bethesda would take a combined 75% from my donation. I've already bought the game, damnit. Let me fucking play it without taking more of my money.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Valve is criticized to take a huge cut (75%). In reality most of this probably goes to the developer/publisher, but regardless, the modder only takes 25% in the case of Skyrim</p>

<p>It's been confirmed that Valve only gets 30%.  The remaining 45% goes to Bethesda.</p>
<p>I've heard some people say that the Publisher gets to decide the split, but I don't know if this has been confirmed.  If this is true it could be that Bethesda is the reason modders get so little.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it hasn't been confirmed because I'm sitting in front of the agreement saying Valve gets 5%.</p>
<p>&quot;6.3.2 Sharing of Revenues from Workshop Contribution Sales. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, and notwithstanding Section 6.1, Valve will pay Company a share of Adjusted Gross Revenues derived from any sales of Workshop Contributions that occur on a Workshop page specific to a Company Application or within a Company Application. Unless a different revenue-sharing arrangement is agreed to by the parties, Company’s revenue share shall be equal to seventy percent (70%) of Adjusted Gross Revenues, less a percentage to be paid to the contributor(s) that submitted the Workshop Contribution (“Contributor”). Valve may provide Company with the means to set or change the percentage paid to Contributors, and/or the allocation of the contributor percentage amongst contributors in cases of bundled item sales. If no percentage is specified by Company, the default percentage shall be twenty-five percent (25%) of Adjusted Gross Revenues.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's saying that Valve takes 30% and gives 70% to the developer (Bethesda). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Valve may provide Company with the means to set or change the percentage paid to Contributors, and/or the allocation of the contributor percentage amongst contributors in cases of bundled item sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the developer decides how much, if any, of that 70% goes to the contributor (content creator). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If no percentage is specified by Company, the default percentage shall be twenty-five percent (25%)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they do not make a decision on how much goes to the contributor, then a default of 25% is chosen for them.</p>
<p>Valve does not only get 5%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are correct. Essentially Valve gets a commission on the sales while Bethesda gets the lion's share. While it's true that Valve gets 30% of revenue off game sales, they get a fraction of that on microtransactions. Mods are microtransactions, not games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like retailers get more than creators do in, you know, pretty much every other single retailer in existence. </p>
<p>Valve provides a platform (one, I might add, that is <em>not</em> free to maintain) that gives a <strong>massive</strong> amount of exposure to someone who normally wouldn't, just like getting stocked at Wal Mart is going to sell more units than if you sold your product out of the back of a van. Valve has spent a HUGE amount of time, effort, and money to expand their platform so it can give that exposure...why is it unreasonable that they also get some of the benefit?</p>
<p>If you are a writer or a board game designer or, yes, a video game designer and you partner with a major distribution network, getting under 10% of the final retail price is not only normal but pretty justified. Anyone who says otherwise has no idea what they are talking about.</p></div>		</li>
