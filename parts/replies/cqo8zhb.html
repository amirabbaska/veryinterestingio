			<p>Okay, so I have 2 questions. <br><br>1: Because the system is set up now for people to pay for the mods that anyone with the time and the energy can make, does that mean there's no more infrastructure (wrong word I'm guessing but first word that comes to mind) for people to just make mods and give them away for free?<br><br>2: How likely is it that this business model will get picked up by other game developing companies? And does this make it more like a &quot;Hey come play this game, we're not going to try to fuck you for playing the game the way you want to?&quot; appeal for other companies to try out?</p>		</li>

			<p>People can still make mods and distribute them manually. At the end of the day all you have to do is download some files and place them in a folder. There's also some programs like Nexus iirc  that make that easier. Also, Steam does seem to allow you to put your mods up for free as well.<br><br>Something worth considering, though, is that as far as I know, currently, modding Skyrim is technically against their ToS if the modder doesn't have explicit consent. So they're on legal shaky grounds already. If Bethesda wanted to capitalize on this, they could try to go after the people that are releasing their mods outside of Steam. But I'm no lawyer so I can't saw how effective that would be, and of course it'd be a PR disaster for them.</p>		</li>

			<p>It should also be noted that the MAJORITY of noteworthy modders within the community are against this move at the moment, and one of the main modders, Chesko who led the steam campaign already tried to withdraw his mods but could not because Valve acquired the rights to them as soon as he uploaded. Another, wet and cold, has had a legal action taken against it as of this morning.<br><br>Lastly one of the creators of the most popular mod for skyrim SkyUI has spoken out against the community. That being said Nexus is trying to make a better donation system for modders so they can get more profits and have more incentive to finish work. That being said apparently Nexus, the other provider, gets a cut from the workshop as well (according to Chesko before he went dark) so the whole thing is messy.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Chesko who led the steam campaign already tried to withdraw his mods but could not because Valve acquired the rights to them as soon as he uploaded.<br><br>Valve maintains the right to store a copy on their servers for paid customers, as is normal for any online distribution platform. They have taken the mod off sale and hidden it from anyone that hasn't already paid for it, and unless it's a really bad contract Chesko will now have the right to reupload elsewhere with maybe a short (1week - 6month) non-compete period.<br><br>Online platforms have to work that way because if they don't people who have paid real money for the mod become unable to reacquire it at a later date though no fault of their own, something Steam guarantees you will always be able to do in their terms and conditions of sale.</p>		</li>

			<p>If I read the legal stuff right Valve can now include it in mod compilations without his consent.</p>		</li>

			<p>Can you post the source for that please? It was my understanding that once 'removed from sale' Valve could no longer distribute the mod beyond people who already had it, but I'm open to anything that suggests otherwise.</p>		</li>

			<p>Content <em>can</em> be removed, they just won't do it.<br><br>Look at the <em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em> patch that removed songs and made the game shittier.<br><br>Speaking of which, I gotta find a patch that reverses that because fuck if I'm letting someone take away shit I paid for.</p>		</li>
