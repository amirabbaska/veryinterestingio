			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does the ignition temperature decrease?
I thought it just burns because dust heats up much quicker than a very dense substance, so the dust reches its ignition temp much quicker, in fact almost instantly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't remember why exactly, most likely due to increased surface energy. But the ignition temperature definitely decreases. A good example is Thermite. It typically has an ignition temp of 3000 F, however, if you make the particles of Al and iron oxide small enough, you can decrease the ignition temp down to 900 F.</p></div>		</li>
