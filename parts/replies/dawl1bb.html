<p>Assuming some probably-impossible situation where a solar mass of uranium existed in one place, would a stable star powered by fission be possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fission would be perfectly possible, but the stable part wouldn't, I don't believe. A solar mass of hydrogen is unlikely to fuse any two given atoms at any given time, so that the reactions can continue for a long time. </p>
<p>The uranium would fission very rapidly, and amount to more of a giant nuclear bomb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fusion has a feedback loop which keeps it stable - higher fusion power expands and cools the core, which reduces fusion power. Fission doesn't have that feedback loop as the temperature does not have an influence. If it does not explode directly, radioactive decays could keep it alive for a while (in a quite unstable state - still no self-regulation), afterwards it would collapse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had a gass of uranium ions and you heated that gas through the energy dumped into it by fission, would that not expand the gas, thereby reducing the cross section and the rate of reaction? Which would allow the gas to cool and contract, and so on, generating the very feedback loop which stabilizes the fusion reaction in stars?</p>
<p>I agree that terrestrial fission sources do not have a feedback mechanism which is why we have to create one for it, but we're talking about a very different situation.</p>
<p>We can create uncontrolled fusion reactions, as we do in thermonuclear devices (H-bombs), so there is nothing about fusion which is inherently stable. Rather, it's the environment in which the fusion occurs which allows it to be stable. I don't see how you can categorically state that there is no set of conditions which can be generated which would allow a fission reaction to be self-regulating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure.  Uranium in it's normal isotope distribution won't form a critical mass not matter how large a volume of it you assemble in one place because the majority U238 won't produce neutrons capable of causing more fission when it is split.  You still have the energy produced by natural decay and the occasional secondary reaction from a flying neutron so a certain amount of energy would be produced.  I'm not sure how that would compare to the energy density of the sun either by volume or by mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting note: in the field of astrophysics, every element besides hydrogen and helium is considered a metal. Tin is a metal, iron is a metal, fluorine is a metal, radon is a metal...</p>
<p>As to your question, look back up at the binding energy chart: hydrogen fuses to helium because helium is much more stable. It does this (mostly) through a series of reactions called the proton-proton chain. However, helium is muuuch harder to fuse than hydrogen. It's almost four times as massive! In fact, for many less massive stars, the helium fusion never really gets going. </p>
<p>Once much of the hydrogen has been fused, the star starts to contract due to gravity, compressing the otherwise inert helium at the core. If there's enough mass, the pressure may get high enough for a &quot;helium flash&quot; which starts the fusion of helium into carbon through something called the triple alpha process (it's the next most stable nucleus), and even then it's possible due to quantum tunnelling effects. If the pressure and temperature does get high enough, it will only be in the very center. There will still be hydrogen at the outside that didn't get hot enough to even fuse to helium.</p>
<p>This process can continue, making oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements up to iron, but leaving shells of unfused lighter elements around a core still undergoing fusion. </p>
<p>So: could we have a star made of lithium? No, not really. For one thing, element-producing stars are decidedly inhomogeneous anyway. For another, lithium is not produced in this standard chain of elements being cooked up in the cores of very massive stars; it is produced a little bit in younger brown and orange stars, and it is one of the three elements produced in the Big Bang, but it is extremely unstable and so often gets broken into helium. This happens especially in large stars where it gets broken by the pressure inside.</p>
<p>TL;DR no</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer, I'm not very familiar with very high-temperature fusion in very massive stars, so in the case that that is exactly what you meant, I'm sorry - but I felt a point of clarification in general would be nice.</p>
<p>Lithium <em>is</em> produced inside of stars, but as previously stated, it is highly unstable and is broken apart in favor of fusing into Helium. Helium is incredibly stable and &quot;balanced&quot;, if you will. All of the 1s shells are full (2proton, 2 neutron, 2 electron - if we even consider it when it is not ionized) and it is tightly bound. Lithium is not so tightly bound and the amount of collisions and conditions inside of a star make it's lifetime inside of a star incredibly small, hence the particularly tiny amount of Lithium we see in universe as a whole. But it <em>is</em> formed in fusion processes, and our Sun definitely does produce it - but only for very brief periods before it is converted into a stable Helium during a &quot;Lithium Burning&quot; process of fusion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not a star, but a very lithium-rich planet is one of the central plot points in the novel &quot;A Case of Conscience&quot; by James Blish. The local fauna evolves in very different ways, with an intelligent species there that has unusual technology and very unusual morality. It's a good book that raises some quite important questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is probably a pretty stupid question, but if stars don't fuse anything past iron then where do all the other elements come from? I always thought that all the elements came from stars. I feel like I'm forgetting something completely obvious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't fuse anything beyond a certain point (which is way before iron) in the &quot;normal mode of operation&quot;.</p>
<p>But when a supernova finally blows up, the energy released fuses about anything in the blast, ending with a whole spectrum of randomly generated elements. A lot of the heavier ones will deteriorate quite quickly, and whatever radioactive element survived into our times is either a small leftover of the original amount, or a decay product of another radioactive reaction.</p></div>		</li>
