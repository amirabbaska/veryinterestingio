<p>The EU and NATO want to expand eastward, the US supports both (and it makes sense strategically from their own perspectives). Russia views the encroaching of those organisations as threats. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that NaTO wouldn't be necessary if it wasn't for Russia. Countries elect to join NaTO because they are afraid of Russia. Baltics for example, asked to join NaTO not the other way around. </p>
<p>EU expanding shouldn't worry Russia since its mostly an economic union. Unless Russia is completely opposed to Western way of life, what would EU do to them? </p></div>		</li>

<p>It kind of is. There's stark differences to the culture and morals in particular. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's also problematic to Russia's economic and strategic interests. Russia is trying to create an opposing economic union of it's own in response, though it's not amounted to much yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right thats my point. Russia inherently wants to work against EU economically instead of joining it. Similar to the US actually. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There is also the view Russia is threatened, acting like a cornered animal and the west fucked up. That second one is rarely repeated even though it is a serious position held in academic circles. Why is it not repeated? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would add to your reasons: Russia doesn't subscribe to the theory that they are a cornered animal either.<br />
Both the US and Russia are interested in painting Russia as strong.</p>
<p>That touches a part I haven't seen in answers here yet: Putin's unique position. He is a dictator in a crumbling country. He is looking for external enemies to consolidate his power. Which leads to actions that are sometimes not very rational and positive for his country - but necessary for him personally. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So there are still many, many people who have ingrained in their beliefs that Russia is an enemy. It's become a cultural thing in some respects to continue to view them as an enemy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's more than just a cultural thing. Your friends generally don't have 7,000 nuclear missiles pointed at you waiting to be launched at the slightest provocation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But according to the top comment in this post the US under Obama has withdrawn Eastern European missile defenses and reduced the nuclear arsenal well below treaty limits. While, concurrently, Russia has increased theirs. (Just parroting the first post, not sure if actually true.)</p>
<p>If it was a true countermeasure to the US, shouldn't we see a following of suit by Russia?</p></div>		</li>
