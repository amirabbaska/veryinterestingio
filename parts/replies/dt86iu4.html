			<div class="markdown"><p>What this guy said.</p>
<p>In more messy situations, like a bunch of guys pillaging a nearby village, it was as simple as looking at who was fighting with you, who was fighting against you, and who was running for their life.  You and your pillagers may dress about the same as the villagers, but even then, you were dressed for pillaging, not a quiet morning of plowing the fields and milking cows.  As one could imagine, this kind of fighting was really... icky, and cases of mistaken identity were somewhat common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to that, most pillaging squads were maybe 10 guys. You probably at least recognized faces you came over with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All it takes is one guy to attack the wrong person and then this system falls apart though. It seems like it would be extraordinarily easy for it to just turn into a frenzy where everybody is running around beating everybody's ass they see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because at that stage you would be standing with a group of your own soldiers with a different shield device. It would be difficult to quickly find enough shields for your unit and not be spotted doing a change over. It is certainly probable that a number of fleeing or retreating soldiers could have tried to pass themselves off as the enemy, but that would be more for self preservation than anything else. Whilst a quick change of shield might pass in the chaos of a battle, after it the differences in clothing footwear etc. could easily give you away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I was thinking more self preservation than a whole unit.  You’d have to sneak away after somehow for the reason you mentioned at the end.  I imagine that’d be tough.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>The biggest way they could tell each other apart was that they lined up on opposite ends of a field and ran at each other.
The general idea was just kill whoever is on the opposite side of the field from you and if you reach the far end of the field you win.</p></div>		</li>
