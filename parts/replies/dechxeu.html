			<div class="markdown"><p>Anaesthetist here.</p>
<p>It's not strictly true that 'natural' sleep prevents the perception of pain entirely. Sleeping individuals will constantly move, to reduce pressure on bony prominences - or even areas which aren't receiving an adequate blood supply, due to compression of their perfusing vasculature, often at a capillary level. </p>
<p>It's perhaps more accurate to say that the threshold for conscious perception is raised during sleep, so a greater stimulus is required. Constant small adjustments in position may be subconscious, however.</p>
<p>In contrast, anaesthetised patients genuinely won't
move, and we become responsible for preventing tissue damage. Thus, we spend a lot of time carefully positioning patients before the start of surgery.</p>
<p>ELI5 Edit: there are degrees of consciousness and alertness - like when we are 'lightly asleep' or 'deeply asleep'. </p>
<p>If someone's only lightly sleeping, they might feel a pinch. In the same way, bits of their brain will recognise that their arm is starting to go numb, and move it.</p>
<p>If someone's deeply sleeping, they may only feel a prod. In the same way, their brain may not register that their arm is starting to go numb. When they wake up, it'll be sore.</p>
<p>If someone has had an anaesthetic, they may only feel the most painful of surgical stimuli - like someone cutting their stomach open. Their brain won't recognise that the nerve in their arm is being crushed. When they wake up, it may be paralysed.</p>
<p>This is because, in each example, a stronger 'signal' is needed to achieve the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a paraplegic, I want to upvote this a bunch more.</p>
<p>Because of the loss of use of my lower limbs, changing positions in my sleep is pretty much impossible. It's amazing how much of your legs you use to unconsciously change positions while asleep.  Thus, I am &quot;woken up&quot; 3-5 times a night because of discomfort/need to change positions. Need to take extra care of leg positioning while asleep. Those &quot;bony prominences&quot; are a real pain in my ass, figuratively speaking, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the difference between &quot;anaesthetist&quot; and &quot;anesthesiologist&quot; - or are they just different terms for the same thing?</p>
<p>Also, thanks for the additional info you posted above!</p></div>		</li>

<p>And, in addition, they are finding out that a mere 15 minutes on a backboard can begin pressure ulcers in patients that show up hours later in hospitals. Therefore, many of the hospital-acquired skin break down actually happens in the field, but they are just finally understanding the connection... so, Mr, Anaesthetist, I apologize for all those poor little old ladies that you get from the field... we're learning that backboarding can actually be severely detrimental to the patients!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But... I don't wake up in the same position I fell asleep in? I know I shift around at night. And sometimes if I'm feeling pain, like from being nausious or something, it will affect my sleep. I'll have dreams that percieve that pain and translate it in a way in my dreams as imagery and I'll wake up more frequently. Sooooooo... I know I don't percieve things AS much but it does seem like on some small level I do? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny how the dreams can react to pain you suffer, too.</p>
<p>I had a cramp happen on my inner thigh, and it was REALLY painful, but in the dream, that pain turned into a serial killer CHAIN SAWING MY FUCKING LEG OFF.</p>
<p>I woke up and realized what had happened, but damn.</p></div>		</li>
