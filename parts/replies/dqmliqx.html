			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In between you have a superposition, and you can do experiments with these states that wouldn't work with classical physics (i.e. with probabilities that a change happened). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetically_induced_transparency" target="_blank">Electromagnetic induced transparency</a> is one of many examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I'm missing something, but wouldn't the results of experiments on this intermediate superposition be the same as if the state changed instantaneously at a probabilistic time? For example let's say there's a system that transitions gradually between state 1 and state 2 over 10 seconds, in a linear way so that at t = 5s it's a superposition of the two states such that there's a 50% chance of it being measured in either. Can we distinguish this from a system that transitions &quot;instantaneously&quot; but with the same probability - i.e. at t = 5s there's a 50% chance that it has transitioned into state 2?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that the probability of finding the particle in the excited state decays exponentially with time, however I believe OP's question is more nuanced than that. I read OP's question something like: &quot;when a particle changes from its high energy state to a lower energy state, how quickly do the wavefunction and spatial probability function change?&quot; I believe the answer is that it is faster than anything we can measure, but I would like confirmation on this.</p>
<p>To expand a bit on what /u/robusetceleritas is describing with exponentially decaying excited states: if you have 1000 identical particles in excited states, you can trace the number of excited states as decaying exponentially in time. However, each individual transition from the high energy state to low energy state will happen at an unpredictable time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The probability explanation makes sense on the collective, describing how often transitions occur over time. But I believe OP is wondering exactly how these transitions occur for individual electrons on individual particles. When an individual particle finally does transition from one state to another, does it instantaneously snap into its new wavefunction? As far as I know, the answer is yes. </p>
<p>In electron transfer dynamics, for example, probabilistic electron transfer rates simply describe the time-likelihood of the transfer occurring. The transfer process itself is instantaneous, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, so the imaginary time method for numeric calculation of energy levels does have some physical meaning after all!</p>
<p><em>edit:</em> Oh, I just noticed that you have Ð“ instead of E itself as the power. Well then, that actually makes me like the imaginary time algorithm more!</p>
<p>(btw, you can find any state, not just ground state, by subtracting the projection on the states you already calculated at every step).</p></div>		</li>
