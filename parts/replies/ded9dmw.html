<p>unless you were a man dying in battle, a king or a woman dying in childbirth</p>

<p>I feel like it is easy for this to be read negatively toward women, and for the peanut gallery I just want to point out that it is not.</p>
<p>Spartan women actually carried quite a bit of civil respect, and by many accounts Spartan society was the most egalitarian of the Greek States.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hmm, i've never seen that claim made about sparta before. What about all the helots? or do you mean egalitarian only in the narrower sense of gender relations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something worth to note is that much of what have survived regarding Sparta came from other city states, just as some Romans were viewed in a negative way and has horrible reputation because of Christianity becoming the supported religion. You could even go so far as to say Nationalsocalist Germany was likely not as bad as they are portrayed by us.</p></div>		</li>
