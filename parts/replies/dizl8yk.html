			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, the $43M wasn't even shown as a jackpot amount.  The lady in the story was printing her cash-out receipt to retrieve the $2 she still had in the machine, and it showed the $43M amount on-screen in error.  There was no jackpot-winning spin at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a lot of the idea of site reliability engineering. humans have a wide error range for tasks - for any complex task, you can expect 60 - 80% error rates over any significant time.</p>
<p>If you build a machine to handle 90% of the cases right, and handle the remaining 10% probably right, the system and the machine will be correct in most cases. And for the remaining &lt; 10% of all the cases, we have audit logs. </p>
<p>it takes time to establish this level of trust into skynet. But once skynet reaches the critical success rate, skynet becomes our godfather. </p></div>		</li>
