			<div class="markdown"><p>There are studies that show that millennials just value different things. They value phones more than cars. They value urban environments over suburban. They prefer transit solutions like rail over car ownership. </p>
<p>These are conscious desires of a majority of millennials and why they are moving back to city cores. I for one am one of them... I have no desire to own a house, or even a car if I can help it, unless it's in a much more cost effective and urban context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may have something to do with GenY and Millennials getting married and having children later in life than previous generations. Less of a need to settle to the suburbs early on, and instead pursue personal interests, travel etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats weird because even among my own age bracket public transit is usually viewed negatively. But then again I dont live in a city big enough for a developed rail system. The bus is alright, but its not very fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, definitely not entirely. I'm sure it does have an impact, but it is much more related to different perspective.</p>
<p>We live in an era of increasingly urbanizing society. More people live in cities than ever before, and that number is rising rapidly. Young people aspire to move to the city than stay in a smaller town. Why? Because that's where jobs, money, and (with caveats) opportunities.</p>
<p>For example, when more and more people are living in cities, more and more people need transportation. As anyone who has lived in a city or even just visited for business will tell you, it is all but impossible to have a well functioning city built entirely on car transit. The costs become astronomical, while the benefits from economies of scale for public transit rapidly rise. It becomes cheaper and makes more sense.</p>
<p>So, in that context, why buy a car at all? If your whole life is oriented within the city, and public transit can take you almost anywhere, why bother? The same is true for home ownership. It is seriously expensive, and people move around much more often for a variety of reasons. So why limit yourself to one place, whether that's in a city or somewhere in a country at large - or even in any one country?</p>
<p>As a society we have a different understanding of things, and our collective perspective has shifted. Just between the generations there are drastic differences in perspective from our upbringings.</p>
<p>EDIT: Coincidentally, just found this article via /r/Futurology that explains my point nicely - including how some of the shifts may have been spurred by necessity, but have taken on a life of their own: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2pv86d/the_cheapest_generation_why_millennials_arent/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2pv86d/the_cheapest_generation_why_millennials_arent/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many young people today are moving to cities where housing prices are high.  They're also going out to eat a lot, so I hesitate to say the reprioritization is due to necessity.</p>
<p>Move to the midwest or the rust belt and a mortgage is a few hundred bucks per month cheaper than renting.</p>
<p>My mortgage is ~$630.  I put only a couple thousand dollars down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I mean really, do you WANT what your parents and grandparents had? They'd grow up in some town in the middle of nowhere, marry the girl they went to prom with, pop out babies, buy a house while working some middle class factory job for 40 years, then die. Is that the life we really want? I can speak to people all over the world. I can travel to the other side of the planet for a weeks wages in 24 hours. I can do amazing things that my parents never dreamed of, and as a result, I really don't give a shit that I don't own a house. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do.</p>
<p>My grandparents had it rough for a few years - the depression and my grandfathers both fought WWII, but after that, life was good. They lived in big cities, could afford new cars every few years, could have a large house for their large family. My maternal grandparents afforded to send 3 daughters to college, and one of them to law school. They retired when they turned about 60, moved to Florida and my grandfather lived another 20 years, and my grandmother is still around. My dad's parents were able to live on their sailboat for 5 years and cruise the world.</p>
<p>My parents aren't as rich, but still are doing OK. They sold their big house for a lot of money, and moved in to a smaller house to have more available money for retirement. They've owned new cars less often than my grandparents, but still every 5 years or so. They sent two kids to college. They're going to be fine in retirement. My wife's parents? Even better. They all travel somewhat as they want - my parents are planning a Paris trip next year. My inlaws have done Mexico and the East Coast of the US quite a few times.</p>
<p>My wife and I, and our sisters are all in our late 20s/early 30s, and it's tough. We're all college educated, and some even with law degrees and masters degrees, yet none of us own a house yet but want to. We're still trying to deal with having degreed careers, but not being paid enough to buy houses where we want to live. We certainly don't travel often - in fact my work bonus this year went to our first out of state vacation in 5 years.</p>
<p>This is totally coming from an upper class perspective, and I totally understand that. We're really privileged, and have been given a lot of opportunities in life - however just comparing generationally, we're all more educated and had more help from our parents' generations than the one before, yet we're doing worse - less money in retirement funds, fewer land/homeowners, less time and money for travel and leisure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't own it then you don't have any rights. That's the problem with this &quot;I'll just rent it&quot; society we are hurtling toward. At the end of the day the owners can (and will) tell you what to do.
Personally, I'd rather be an owner of my car and home (paid in full) than some guy in his 50s who partied it up in 2014 but owns nothing in 2044. Now excuse me while I crank my stereo up and build a fort in my back yard because I OWN it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We, as millennials, have it extremely good. We (as a generation) just feel extremely entitled. Go check any psychoanalysis of millennials. We're selfish and entitled assholes. </p>
<p>Owning a house is overrated anyways. Great, I get to take out a 30 year loan (meaning I'm stuck for <strong>30 YEARS</strong>) to be able to say I &quot;own&quot; something that would be cheaper to rent. Great deal!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd be fine with renting as long as I was able to afford rent alone and not have to deal with a stupid roommate and share a bathroom with them. Gross. Possible <em>Single White Female</em> scenario too.</p></div>		</li>
