			<p>Many young people today are moving to cities where housing prices are high.  They're also going out to eat a lot, so I hesitate to say the reprioritization is due to necessity.<br><br>Move to the midwest or the rust belt and a mortgage is a few hundred bucks per month cheaper than renting.<br><br>My mortgage is ~$630.  I put only a couple thousand dollars down.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Before the gender role hate arrives<br><br>It's not even a gender thing.  It used to be normal for both women AND men to move out of the house on their own and manage to feed themselves without resorting to take out or a drive thru 7 days a week.  My husband was on his own from 16, and it was several years into our marriage before I did much of any cooking, because he was simply better at it.<br><br>Not so coincidentally, it also used to be normal for everyone, male and female, to get at least one quarter of home-ec in school, which covered the bare basics of cooking and sewing - how to boil water, how to sew on a button.  I'm not talking the 50's, either, this was the 80's and 90's.  Now we're too busy teaching to tests to spare 3 months to teach people how to make a pizza that doesn't say Tombstone on it.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, definitely not entirely. I'm sure it does have an impact, but it is much more related to different perspective.<br><br>We live in an era of increasingly urbanizing society. More people live in cities than ever before, and that number is rising rapidly. Young people aspire to move to the city than stay in a smaller town. Why? Because that's where jobs, money, and (with caveats) opportunities.<br><br>For example, when more and more people are living in cities, more and more people need transportation. As anyone who has lived in a city or even just visited for business will tell you, it is all but impossible to have a well functioning city built entirely on car transit. The costs become astronomical, while the benefits from economies of scale for public transit rapidly rise. It becomes cheaper and makes more sense.<br><br>So, in that context, why buy a car at all? If your whole life is oriented within the city, and public transit can take you almost anywhere, why bother? The same is true for home ownership. It is seriously expensive, and people move around much more often for a variety of reasons. So why limit yourself to one place, whether that's in a city or somewhere in a country at large - or even in any one country?<br><br>As a society we have a different understanding of things, and our collective perspective has shifted. Just between the generations there are drastic differences in perspective from our upbringings.<br><br>EDIT: Coincidentally, just found this article via /r/Futurology that explains my point nicely - including how some of the shifts may have been spurred by necessity, but have taken on a life of their own: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2pv86d/the_cheapest_generation_why_millennials_arent/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2pv86d/the_cheapest_generation_why_millennials_arent/</a></p>		</li>

			<p>I can only provide an anecdote.<br><br>I can't afford to buy a home in the neighborhood that I rent. I could buy a home in the part of town that has many issues with crime, drugs, etc, but then, why would I subject myself to that again? (I used to rent there) I could also buy a home in another city, but then I wouldn't be living in a place that makes me happy.<br><br>If I plot the long term cost of renting + investing vs home ownership in my current neighborhood, an interesting thing happens. Rent + investing my saved money elsewhere makes me more money than buying a home. The issue is the cost of home ownership where I live is insane. I think it's due for a big crash. The home I rent is estimated to be worth about 4/5th the price of what they paid for it in 2005. I saw as low as 2/3rds about a year ago.</p>		</li>

			<p>There are studies that show that millennials just value different things. They value phones more than cars. They value urban environments over suburban. They prefer transit solutions like rail over car ownership. <br><br>These are conscious desires of a majority of millennials and why they are moving back to city cores. I for one am one of them... I have no desire to own a house, or even a car if I can help it, unless it's in a much more cost effective and urban context.</p>		</li>

			<p>Im 26. Most people I talk to ranging from 18-30 seem to have a negative view of transit. But as I said our transit system is sorta meh. I do not drive and the only advantage of the bus is how cheap it is. Its not very fast, and they dont really run as late or early as one would like.<br><br>EDIT: Examples- Used to work on the weekends at 7am. From where I was living at the time I had zero options to get to work on time. Id be a half hour late every weekend. Or if you are the partying type you'd either have to arrange a ride home, or take a cab because after around midnight the bus service in my area drops. By 1am there are no buses within a few KM of my home.</p>		</li>

			<p>Many of these studies are phrased to see if millennial's actually want this lifestyle or are forced into it. Results are pretty indicative this is the lifestyle the majority of them WANT; they prefer spending money on experiences and  urban environments over former status symbols such as car and home ownership.<br><br>You could argue that's cognitive dissonance; they actually do want those things but since they can't have them they say they want the opposite anyway. I would disagree with such an assessment.</p>		</li>

			<p>I agree. I mean really, do you WANT what your parents and grandparents had? They'd grow up in some town in the middle of nowhere, marry the girl they went to prom with, pop out babies, buy a house while working some middle class factory job for 40 years, then die. Is that the life we really want? I can speak to people all over the world. I can travel to the other side of the planet for a weeks wages in 24 hours. I can do amazing things that my parents never dreamed of, and as a result, I really don't give a shit that I don't own a house. </p>		</li>

			<p>I do.<br><br>My grandparents had it rough for a few years - the depression and my grandfathers both fought WWII, but after that, life was good. They lived in big cities, could afford new cars every few years, could have a large house for their large family. My maternal grandparents afforded to send 3 daughters to college, and one of them to law school. They retired when they turned about 60, moved to Florida and my grandfather lived another 20 years, and my grandmother is still around. My dad's parents were able to live on their sailboat for 5 years and cruise the world.<br><br>My parents aren't as rich, but still are doing OK. They sold their big house for a lot of money, and moved in to a smaller house to have more available money for retirement. They've owned new cars less often than my grandparents, but still every 5 years or so. They sent two kids to college. They're going to be fine in retirement. My wife's parents? Even better. They all travel somewhat as they want - my parents are planning a Paris trip next year. My inlaws have done Mexico and the East Coast of the US quite a few times.<br><br>My wife and I, and our sisters are all in our late 20s/early 30s, and it's tough. We're all college educated, and some even with law degrees and masters degrees, yet none of us own a house yet but want to. We're still trying to deal with having degreed careers, but not being paid enough to buy houses where we want to live. We certainly don't travel often - in fact my work bonus this year went to our first out of state vacation in 5 years.<br><br>This is totally coming from an upper class perspective, and I totally understand that. We're really privileged, and have been given a lot of opportunities in life - however just comparing generationally, we're all more educated and had more help from our parents' generations than the one before, yet we're doing worse - less money in retirement funds, fewer land/homeowners, less time and money for travel and leisure.</p>		</li>

			<p>That doesn't seem anything close to the norm though. <br><br>Anyways, it doesn't even matter.

			<p>All of it?<br><br>Obviously some millennials feel entitled, though that was more really the calling card of Gen-Xers in my opinion.<br><br>In terms of home ownership, I've heard good arguments both for and against it, and wither it's cost-effective can be very situational.  30 year loans are unusual unless you're stretching the hell out of your ability to pay, and regardless it's no requirement you actually stay there 30 years.  Most of the time you can sell after 5 or so.  There are artificial tax benefits to ownership and plenty of real life benefits as well.<br><br>When you're talking about this &quot;generation&quot; keep in mind that the current trend is to lump approximately 30 years worth of births together.  The snotty 16 year old with the iPhone has a very different outlook right now compared to someone in their early 30s.</p>		</li>
