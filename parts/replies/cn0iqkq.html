			<p>Don't you think this &quot;reprioritisation&quot; is caused entirely by necessity? I for one would love to own a house and a car if I had the money to do so.</p>		</li>

			<p>Many young people today are moving to cities where housing prices are high.  They're also going out to eat a lot, so I hesitate to say the reprioritization is due to necessity.<br><br>Move to the midwest or the rust belt and a mortgage is a few hundred bucks per month cheaper than renting.<br><br>My mortgage is ~$630.  I put only a couple thousand dollars down.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Before the gender role hate arrives<br><br>It's not even a gender thing.  It used to be normal for both women AND men to move out of the house on their own and manage to feed themselves without resorting to take out or a drive thru 7 days a week.  My husband was on his own from 16, and it was several years into our marriage before I did much of any cooking, because he was simply better at it.<br><br>Not so coincidentally, it also used to be normal for everyone, male and female, to get at least one quarter of home-ec in school, which covered the bare basics of cooking and sewing - how to boil water, how to sew on a button.  I'm not talking the 50's, either, this was the 80's and 90's.  Now we're too busy teaching to tests to spare 3 months to teach people how to make a pizza that doesn't say Tombstone on it.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, definitely not entirely. I'm sure it does have an impact, but it is much more related to different perspective.<br><br>We live in an era of increasingly urbanizing society. More people live in cities than ever before, and that number is rising rapidly. Young people aspire to move to the city than stay in a smaller town. Why? Because that's where jobs, money, and (with caveats) opportunities.<br><br>For example, when more and more people are living in cities, more and more people need transportation. As anyone who has lived in a city or even just visited for business will tell you, it is all but impossible to have a well functioning city built entirely on car transit. The costs become astronomical, while the benefits from economies of scale for public transit rapidly rise. It becomes cheaper and makes more sense.<br><br>So, in that context, why buy a car at all? If your whole life is oriented within the city, and public transit can take you almost anywhere, why bother? The same is true for home ownership. It is seriously expensive, and people move around much more often for a variety of reasons. So why limit yourself to one place, whether that's in a city or somewhere in a country at large - or even in any one country?<br><br>As a society we have a different understanding of things, and our collective perspective has shifted. Just between the generations there are drastic differences in perspective from our upbringings.<br><br>EDIT: Coincidentally, just found this article via /r/Futurology that explains my point nicely - including how some of the shifts may have been spurred by necessity, but have taken on a life of their own: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2pv86d/the_cheapest_generation_why_millennials_arent/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2pv86d/the_cheapest_generation_why_millennials_arent/</a></p>		</li>

			<p>I can only provide an anecdote.<br><br>I can't afford to buy a home in the neighborhood that I rent. I could buy a home in the part of town that has many issues with crime, drugs, etc, but then, why would I subject myself to that again? (I used to rent there) I could also buy a home in another city, but then I wouldn't be living in a place that makes me happy.<br><br>If I plot the long term cost of renting + investing vs home ownership in my current neighborhood, an interesting thing happens. Rent + investing my saved money elsewhere makes me more money than buying a home. The issue is the cost of home ownership where I live is insane. I think it's due for a big crash. The home I rent is estimated to be worth about 4/5th the price of what they paid for it in 2005. I saw as low as 2/3rds about a year ago.</p>		</li>

			<p>No public transit. Car. Has to be a car because I hate sitting with people.<br><br>I'd be fine with renting as long as I was able to afford rent alone and not have to deal with a stupid roommate and share a bathroom with them. Gross. Possible <em>Single White Female</em> scenario too.</p>		</li>

			<p>At the same time, spending your life paying for things you'll never own is basically feudalism. In an age of abundance, we really should be owning more than before, not less.</p>		</li>

			<p>Freedom and control. And the ability to use something without having to continually pay the owner.<br><br>My point is more that, in an age of abundance, our ownership options should be expanding, not shrinking. Instead, it's becoming harder and harder to afford a house and car with a job straight out of school.</p>		</li>
