<p>No. Obviously the relation is </p>
<p>m_rocket_dry+ m_gas = m_rocket_wet. </p>
<p>Hence </p>
<p>m_rocket_wet / m_rocket_dry = 1 + (m_gas/m_rocket_dry).</p>
<p>I used the second expression, the first is more commonly used. So yeah, I used the dry mass.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, although I would argue it is far simpler (and much more useful) to consider the rocket frame as opposed to the CoM frame. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Um... Are you actually serious? I thought a physicist would know better, but integral expressions, whilst sums over infinitesimal variables, do produce real quantities. </p>
<p>It doesn't assume that the mass of the exhaust gas is infinitesimal, it assumes the mass expelled in time dt is dm producing a velocity change dt.</p>
<p>Once you integrate over these you reach the rocket equation, which is pretty damn accurate in for an idealised engine.</p>
<p>In my original comment I was wrong to say that the problem with your equation is the mass of the fuel is negligible compared to the rocket. It would have been more accurate to say that it assumes all the gas is released instantaneously.  </p></div>		</li>
