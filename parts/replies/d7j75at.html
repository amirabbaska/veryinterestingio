<p>But yeah, obviously WF was/is being super shitty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny thing is, that even if you busted your balls, cheated customers, and <em>did</em> make the sales goals, you were only eligible to make an extra $900 every 3 months. And that factors in the branch's customer surveys, which are scaled on bullshit, so more realistically, you would take home an extra $600 every 3 months. And Wells Fargo only pays its employees between $11.50 to $14 an hour. </p></div>		</li>

<p>don't shop online with your main checking account, it might get hacked. Open this extra checking account and simply transfer money into it when you want to shop online and make purchases from that.</p>

<p>WF spun me this exact same thing last month when opening my account with them. I couldn't understand why you would want to split your money up like this. I mean if I had a substantial amount of money lying around I would rather put it in a better investment than just leaving it in a savings or checking account. Also won't the bank reverse or refund any charges that are fraudulent in the event my card is &quot;hacked&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For debit card purchases you have less protection than for credit card purchases.</p>
<p>And if the purchase was via PayPal or ACH there's even less protection.</p>
<p>It's actually not bad advice but most recommend using different banks because if someone freezes one account they can freeze others at the same bank as well. </p></div>		</li>
