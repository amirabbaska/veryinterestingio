			<div class="markdown"><p>When the immune system responds to an infection, it does so by secreting signaling substances (cytokines and chemokines) to attract various kinds of white blood cells to the site of the infection.  These cytokines also activate the white blood cells, causing them to churn out more signaling molecules or to attack the infection directly.</p>
<p>In some cases, those direct attacks can be harmful.  T cells, NK cells, neutrophils, and some other kinds of white blood cells can release toxic contents to kill invading bacteria, but they can cause local damage as well.</p>
<p>The bigger risk comes from the additional signals put out by these activated white blood cells.  Some of them can induce fever; while a little fever may help you fight the infection, too much will kill you.  Other signals cause some cell types to die, through various kinds of programmed cell death.  Normally, this is used to destroy virus-infected cells or to trim down the number of white blood cells when the infection has been taken care of; too much, obviously, will cause damage to the body.  Other signal types have a variety of effects that can lower blood pressure or make blood vessels leaky or initiate clotting, and all of these things can result in multiple organ failure.</p>
<p>Even the presence of the white blood cells can be a problem.  Some organs, like the lungs, have a delicate structure that can be disrupted by too many white blood cells coming in.  If that happens, you drown in your own fluids.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is just what happens when the immune system is too stimulated.  Lower levels of stimulation will clear out an infection without killing you.</p></div>		</li>
