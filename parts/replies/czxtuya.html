			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't sting the way it does for humans, for instance some (1/1000) humans can stand in a tear-gas chamber completely unaffected, when my brother was in the army they had three of those bastards inside a container filled with tear gas which just stood there joking and laughing while everyone else was throwing up or loosing their breath. </p>
<p>That said, sprayed directly at them with the extreme dosages that come with that, I wouldn't count on that being completely harmless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider also that the dispersal vectors for some fruits have gone extinct. The avocado is a good example of a fruit whose seed is to large to be swallowed and excreted by any extant species; it probably co evolved with species of giant sloth that have only recently gone extinct. But we like them, so good for the avocado tree.</p></div>		</li>
