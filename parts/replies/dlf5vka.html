			<div class="markdown"><p>This...sorry I was distracted posting that I should've elaborated </p>
<p>Via a quick googling:</p>
<p>&quot;Onions contain an ingredient called thiosulphate which is toxic to cats and dogs. The ingestion of onions causes a condition called hemolytic anemia, which is characterized by damage to the red blood cells. Onion toxicity can cause the red blood cells circulating through your pet's body to burst.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
