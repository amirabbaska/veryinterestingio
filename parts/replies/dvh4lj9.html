			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, I like the analogy as well. However, I’m getting bogged down on the idea that if I’m in a train and I’m moving in the same direction gives me the more speed than someone who’s sitting still on the train. It makes sense, just never thought about it deeply enough. Where I’m getting confused is the aspect of your point on, the faster we move the more pronounced this effect is. Can you clarify further on that please?
And how does that relate to the speed of light being our max speed? As far as I’m aware when photons are dashing around at the speed of light, there’s only just their speed and not an invisible train moving with them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Physics be mad crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rest of the universe would also still see you taking very very long to travel. The universe would still expand and die over that time, and from your point of view you'd see the death of the universe in fast-forward.</p>
<p>But your view would also be hugely distorted from relativistic effects so it's not like you'd be able to get out some popcorn and watch it.</p>
<p>You could speed out for a little while, and from your perspective the universe would run fast. Then speed back for a while, and when you get back home you'll have &quot;travelled&quot; lifetimes into the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question about this. If I’m on a photon heading one direction and there is another photon heading in the exact opposite direction, both going at the speed of light, why would that second photon not be traveling at 2c relative to my position?</p>
<p>Or similarly, if I’m on a train going c and I walk from the back car to the front car, how am I not going c+2mph relative to the tracks?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because that's the way that physics works. It's weird, but it's like that.</p>
<p>Instead, what happens is length contraction and time dilation. The universe becomes shorter and the speed of time changes, so that even that even  though the speeds don't add up constant, everything remains fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the thing is, you think about it like this: one observer sees two particles going the opposite way at 0.75c. To get how the world looks like from particle A's perspective, you add its speed to other particles, multiplied by -1. So particle B travels at 1.5c, right?</p>
<p>And turns out, nope. It seems to work that way at low speeds, but actually you can't do just that to change your perspective. In reality from particle A's perspective, particle B would only move at 0.9c or something.</p></div>		</li>
