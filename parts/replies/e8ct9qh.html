			<div class="markdown"><p>There's about a 1 in a billion chance that your ticket will win and be unique. If you look at all the tickets, there's a 36% chance that <em>someone</em> will win and their ticket will be unique. That's just adding up the probabilities - we've got 378 million tickets, each with a (slightly less than) 1 in a billion chance of being a unique winner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh ok. That’s interesting. Does this assume everyone buys one ticket? Or because you are summing all the tickets does it mean if you bought two tickets youd just have a 2 out of a billion chance? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the random selection bit, I’ve seen other lotteries say that they see a far higher instance of numbers between 1 and 31 being selected than would be expected if selection were random. The reason being, they suggested, that people like to chose meaningful numbers and therefore pick birthdays. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm not OP but for your probabalistic pleasure...</p>
<p>I'm not going to go in depth with the math, but I can if you're curious</p>
<p>Basically the chances of getting the 0 of the 5 numbers is around 68%, and the probability of not getting the mega ball is 96% (24/25), so the probability of not getting either is (.68)(.96)= .65</p>
<p>Since you got 5 tickets, the probability of getting 5 to match is (.65)^5 which is about 12.07%.</p>
<p>So the probability of not getting a single match in 5 tickets is 12.07%.</p>
<p>P.S. Not that you specifically asked, but don't play the lottery. The odds are never in your favor.</p></div>		</li>
