			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! We used potassium hydroxide and methanol to produce potassium methoxide which was then combined with various triglycerides, mainly Lauric Acid. </p>
<p>Once the methoxide starts separating out the glycerine it's actually a competing reaction to produce methyl esters (fuel) and soap, as any leftover hydroxide salts will combine with the glycerine and form soap. I used to wash out my soaps by bubbling the reactants through water afterwards. Different ratios of potassium hydroxide to methanol produced different amounts of soap, presumably due to different amounts of hydroxide remaining in the methoxide that are allowed to react with the separated glycerine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tallow is fat from beef or mutton. Fat has to be rendered then combined with lye (sodium or potassium hydroxide) and mixed together to create soap through a process called saponification. Most types of fat can be used, you can make lard or tallow soap. You could also use vegetable oils. </p></div>		</li>
