<p>Methanol is turned into formaldehyde (embalming fluid) in your body.  It can cause blindness and death.  More potent than isopropyl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally the cure for drinking methanol is to drink ethanol. This keeps your liver from trying to metabolize the methanol and your body tires to flush it out since it prefers to metabolize ethanol. <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1174890-treatment" target="_blank">http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1174890-treatment</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember my first day of chemistry class in undergrad... the teacher (who was normally a fairly upbeat and bubbly woman) said in a very serious tone &quot;some of you will think it'd be a good 'joke' to take sips of the alcohol we use in the lab. Don't. you'll go blind or die, it has happened.&quot; </p>
<p>Interesting side note. I believe the treatment for ingesting some of these alcohols is to actually drink the alcohol we normally drink (ethanol), as it takes priority in the digestion phase. so if you drink enough of it the bad stuff won't get broken down into the shit that kills you anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that ethanol in hygiene/beauty products is usually denatured to prevent it from being taxed as alcohol. Usually that means adding a bitterant or methanol so that you won't drink it. So even if that product uses ethanol it may smell much different for that reason alone.</p></div>		</li>

They've had to replace all the hand sanitizer with a kind that is safe to drink, because patients were just ripping it out of the dispenser and drinking it, so they had to make it so patients wouldn't die from it.</p></div>		</li>
