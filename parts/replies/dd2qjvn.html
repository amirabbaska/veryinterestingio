			<div class="markdown"><p>We are genetically modifying bees,  by killing them with chemicals. That way only the bees resistant to chemicals survive. But that results in killing a whole bunch of non immune bees. If you want bees to be resistant to chemicals you have to kill the ones that aren't. It's difficult to do it in a lab because something like this can take years and huge amounts of work to genetically modify bees for a specific trait.</p></div>		</li>
