			<div class="markdown"><p>So I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was like 11, and it is pretty apparent that I possess this disorder. However, I still did quite well throughout my school career. My stronger subjects were maths and science related, but I never did badly in the rest.</p>
<p>One thing I can say about the disorder is that interest and passion for a subject is enhanced through ADHD in the same way that disinterest and lack of passion is. When I liked doing something, I did it well. When I didn't like doing something or got bored, I got distracted easily and paid very little attention to it. Throughout my undergraduate university career my marks were a reflection on this. The difficulty of the subject didn't matter, but rather my interest for it and how much I felt it challenged me.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is that a learning disability can work for you as well as against you. Luckily my passion lay in mathematics and problem solving, so it made my schooling career easier. This could have been a result of my IQ, but it was also a result of my parents challenging me constantly when I was young. I never got bored and as a result flourished (I also realise this is not at all related to your point, but I wanted to tell someone).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really need to thank you for writing out this well-thought out comment. One problem I had with the OP's question was how one would define a person who is &quot;stupid/slow/dumb&quot;. Like you said, there are just so many different factors to consider.</p>
<p>I also learned something new! Out of curiosity, how did you get diagnosed with dysgraphia? I've not heard of the disability before, but I can relate in some ways to how you described it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I doubt OP had bad intents, this kind of issue is easy to lump together thoughtlessly.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with it in Kindergarten. I was coming in from a low-socioeconomic background so I was lagging behind some of the other kids developmentally. I was in a special class for part of the day that helped me understand grammar, spelling and reading. I went to through extra classes right up until 8th grade, and to be honest I was really lucky that my school district was rich enough to fund those kinds of programs.</p>
<p>I'm still learning about it though. Up until last semester I didn't know that dysgraphia included issues with information processing. Learning that helped me a ton and I had to change a lot of habits I have while studying or in class.</p>
<p>If you're concerned you might have it and you're still in school, get in contact with your counselor or your campus's disability services. For me, Dysgraphia affects my ability physically write (my hands will get sore after writing or typing too much, I will sometimes write down wrong letters or even entire words without realizing I've done something wrong, writing more than about 3 sentences makes my handwriting almost illegible) and processing information while I'm writing it (imagine taking notes in class, and when you leave realizing you have no idea what just happened in front of you).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a really good picture showing what functions are affected by having dysgraphia.  Each learning difference percolates through many different academic actions. <a href="http://tutoringduluth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dysgraphia-mind-map.jpg" target="_blank">http://tutoringduluth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dysgraphia-mind-map.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So true. &quot;Just stupid&quot; <em>is</em> a disability in itself. </p>
<p>People act like these disabilities are like bugs or computer viruses corrupting a perfect brain when they are very often more like descriptions of function level and/or symptoms commonly occurring together.</p>
<p>If the bar was set arbitrary higher &quot;normal&quot; people would suddenly have disabilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it may be more useful to refocus someone's understand from being stupid, to just having a lack of aptitude. People have different aptitudes for different things, there's nothing wrong with that. Stupid on the other hand carries a value judgement with it, that if someone's not as good or understanding of something they're, well, stupid.</p></div>		</li>
