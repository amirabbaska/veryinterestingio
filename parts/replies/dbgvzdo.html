<p>Amazon is a volume business. Its profit margin is roughly 1.5% which means it sees very little profit from each item or service that is sold. </p>

<p>This isn't quite accurate. Amazon is a very profitable company, but they intentionally reinvest <em>all</em> profits into growing into a bigger company (even more volume!), but individual segments of the company themselves still earn healthy margins. Amazon makes a lot of money just selling products, and also with Amazon Web Services. Amazon loses a lot of money on mistakes such as the Fire Phone. The net of this is a profit margin that is carefully managed to be as close to zero as possible, but this is only even possible because their established offerings are already profitable.</p></div>		</li>
