			<div class="markdown"><p>That's rarely true. Water rights, or paid-for future access, is quite common for the waters of the U.S. Water rights-holders go back over 100 years, and often times all of the water that a river might hold (that is, water that comes from spring snowmelt, rain, etc.) is allocated far in advance of the water's actual use (that is, diversion out of the river for private or municipal purposes).</p>
<p>The state of Colorado has a long-standing precedent that all of the water that enters or is formed in the state is for its residences' use. The state judiciary has affirmed many times that no state downhill from us has any legal right to the water that passes through Colorado until after it passes beyond the border.</p>
<p>Simce the rights to use water have been sold (or acquired) since long before any particular drop formed or fell, there has been a lot of debate over how to handle water that falls on a landowner's property. A few years ago the Colorado legislature made it legal for homeowners to capture water that fell on their land. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With plenty of restriction. Residential properties with 4 or fewer units can collect rainwater, but at a maximum capacity of 110 gallons (2 55-gallon barrels) at any given time. If you wanted to live off the grid with your own cistern for all water needs, this wouldn't really cut it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this makes sense... where else is it going to go??</p>
<p>Won't that water get used nearby anyway and find it's way back into the water table / nearby streams?   It's not like someone can hoard several years of water...</p>
<p>^maybe ^they ^can?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can use that argument for the little feeder streams though too. I can divert a feeder stream to flow into a small depression on my property making a pond. Once my pond is full water will continue to flow downstream.  Ultimately the water table will continue to function. </p>
<p>What happens to the farmer downstream from me when I do that?  Did they have a right to the water from that stream?  Did they have a right to it being unimpeded for the 3 weeks it took to fill my “pond”?</p>
<p>Ultimately that’s what cones into play here. Who has the rights to the water?  Do I completely own the water when it comes on to my land or does someone downstream have equal rights to that water. Rain, technically, is just another way for water to “flow”. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little confused by this. Why does the farmer downstream have more of a right to the water than you do? Presumably he is diverting the water for his crops and thus whoever is downstream of him doesn't get it. It seems like using that logic no one could ever use any of the water. </p>
<p>What am I missing here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easiest to understand this if you look at it in terms of scale.  What happens if the entire state of Colorado magically put up a dam that stopped all water flowing out of it?</p>
<p>Ignoring how utterly impractical as this is, you'd have problems like the Hoover Dam flat out drying up.  You'd have issues like some southwestern states flat out no longer being habitable due to lack of water that flows out of those regions.  It's entirely hyperbolic, but that's the scenario that causes people to think &quot;We need water access rights.&quot;  The act of allowing even 1 person to hoard water means you must assume everyone will hoard water.  And if everyone can hoard water, anyone who might need it downstream effectively is being denied that water.</p>
<p>You can see what happens when 100% of a water supply is tapped.  The Colorado River, despite feeding The Hoover Dam and having a pretty sizable flow to it, literally almost never actually reaches an ocean despite historically flowing into the ocean.  It is sucked dry of all its water before it can get to the ocean most of the time.</p>
<p>If it's being sucked dry, then that water is being used, and if someone upstream takes more water, someone downstream effectively isn't getting any water anymore.</p>
<p>This isn't that serious a problem when you're closer to the source, as you're almost literally inundated with water.  However, if you're closer to the end, all of a sudden someone taking that water is a very serious problem as you no longer have it.</p>
<p>As such, the water that does fall is decided where it can go because water is a limited, vital resource.  If you want to collect water that falls on your property, you basically need to file to claim that water because you're not the only person who can use that water if it's not collected.  And in some cases, that person can literally be a thousand miles away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how can you gather so much rain water that it affects the flow of rivers downstream? It would take insanely huge and complex equipment and it would not be worth it. Either this doesn't make any fucking sense or I'm missing info. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can and have. I'll go try and find you a source because the story was interesting. Basically someone who owned a lot of land decided the rainfall was theirs to keep, the government disagreed. </p></div>		</li>
