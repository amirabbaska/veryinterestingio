			<p>Obviously not Dr. Leinen, but one thing I find most people don't realize is that the Earth's atmosphere and oceans comprise a single system that constantly interact and reflect one another. </p>		</li>

			<p>I am not knowledgeable about this topic so do you mind explaining how this is significant or means anything?</p>		</li>

			<p>It's just that the ocean and atmosphere are much more representative of a single entity than separate ones. If you warm up/cool down one of them to a certain extent, the other will follow suit. If you change the chemical composition of one (dissolved gases, etc), there will eventually be exchange and this will be reflected in the other. There is no inherent dichotomy between the two despite common human perspective <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>They are both fluid bodies, and they're in contact with each other over a massive amount of surface area. Much of the atmosphere and ocean are dissolved into each other, in forms like water vapor. Important environmental cycles, like the water cycle, essentially just move stuff back and forth between the ocean and the atmosphere. And the portion of Earth's atmospheric oxygen which is generated in the ocean is in proportion with the portion of Earth's surface which is covered by the ocean- about 70%.</p>		</li>

			<p>Just expanding on what you said, every chemical has a residence time in the ocean and the atmosphere (which is how long a certain substance remains part of a solution). This is why CO2 while only making up .04% of the atmosphere is still so harmful to the oceans. Because not only does CO2 trap infrared light heating up the oceans, but excess suspended CO2 ends up finding it's way into sea water which creates carbonic acid leading to ocean acidification. Which is extremely harmful to any sort of calcifying species and bad for the ocean in general.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not OP, but I like telling people that the majority of the oxygen in our atmosphere comes from phytoplankton.<br><br>You always hear people talking about how we are doomed without trees that produce oxygen. While that might be true they tend to forget that phytoplankton plays the biggest role...</p>		</li>
