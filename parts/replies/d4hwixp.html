			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just that the ocean and atmosphere are much more representative of a single entity than separate ones. If you warm up/cool down one of them to a certain extent, the other will follow suit. If you change the chemical composition of one (dissolved gases, etc), there will eventually be exchange and this will be reflected in the other. There is no inherent dichotomy between the two despite common human perspective </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are both fluid bodies, and they're in contact with each other over a massive amount of surface area. Much of the atmosphere and ocean are dissolved into each other, in forms like water vapor. Important environmental cycles, like the water cycle, essentially just move stuff back and forth between the ocean and the atmosphere. And the portion of Earth's atmospheric oxygen which is generated in the ocean is in proportion with the portion of Earth's surface which is covered by the ocean- about 70%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I like telling people that the majority of the oxygen in our atmosphere comes from phytoplankton.</p>
<p>You always hear people talking about how we are doomed without trees that produce oxygen. While that might be true they tend to forget that phytoplankton plays the biggest role...</p></div>		</li>
