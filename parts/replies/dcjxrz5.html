			<div class="markdown"><p>I once got a transcript in a case (that I was supposed to read) that was filled with errors. The thing looked like someone had plugged stenographic notes into Google Court Reporter. There were so many words transcribed as nonsense syllables, like it would just say stuff like: &quot;encom mo hen dia&quot; in the transcript. There are usually some errors, but this was bad enough to be unreadable.</p>
<p>I have always wondered what could cause this to happen, since I'm pretty sure Google Translate does not, in fact, have a version for court reporters.</p></div>		</li>
