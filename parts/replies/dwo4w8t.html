			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body doesn't shed vitamins at a huge rate, and it's not like a week without the right vitamins will cause a deficiency, your body is quite efficient in that regard.</p>
<p>Also you take in vitamins from so many daily sources, ranging from the sun in the sky to the food you eat and everything in between. So you'd have to live in the basement on a water-only diet to start flushing your system of vitamins completely.</p>
<p>The recommended daily dose is still a recommendation for the 'optimal' amount of vitamins. But at the same time, there's a huge gap between optimal and deficient, and in general people in the west are more than fine as long as you have a balanced and spread out diet.</p>
<p>If you look at those fizzy tablets you can buy, there's plenty of vitamins in there that are over hundred, i've seen cases of 300% of a water soluble vitamin in a single dose. And as people have mentioned, you pee out any excesses.</p>
<p>tl;dr - Don't worry if you're an ordinary baseline person living in the developed world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all vitamins can be peed out. Some are fat soluble rather than water soluble, and get stored in the body for very long time periods (B12, for example). That's one of the reasons eating polar bear liver can kill you - they store massive amounts of vitamin A, and because humans don't just pee excessive vitamin A out, you can get a lethal dose of it from the liver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clarification, are you saying B12 is a fat soluble vitamin or water soluble?</p>
<p>Generally my understanding is A, D, E, and K are the primary fat soluble vitamins while vitamin C and B vitamins are all water soluble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd have to eat A LOT of it. Some drugs like isotretinoin have dozen times the amount of it and you get through the course without hypervitaminosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like the problem is primarily lack of electrolytes. IIRC, “vitamin” is a misnomer, since it was originally an abbreviation of “vital amines” but the discovery was applied broadly to other compounds needed by the body to function beyond simply getting enough calories from food, such as elements.  Originally, it was in regards to specific amino acids the body couldn’t make itself, hence the name. But the discovery of those soon led to other organic compounds and elements needed. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But what about that other well-known source, the sun in the oceans???</p>
<p>No but seriously, this is a good point. Also, many of our vitamins are lipophilic, meaning they dissolve into your fat and then slowly dissolve out again as the fat is burnt. Vitamin C is one such example - you store about 30-40 days' worth of vitamin C in your body at any given time that can be released as needed, which is why even on a fairly low vitamin C diet you won't suffer the effects of scurvy for some time after you've changed diets. This is why it took so long to discover that it was lack of fresh plant foods that caused scurvy - after more than a MONTH before getting sick, it wasn't the most obvious cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It partly depends on if the vitamin is water soluble or not. Water solubles are flushed out of the body very quickly, where non solubles stick around for much longer. The body doesn’t store any of the excess vitamins you eat so it is important to eat a varied diet. Also because non solubles stay in the body longer it is possible for the amount of them in the body to become toxic, though really the only risk is with vitamin A</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't urinate out ADEK, it's fat soluble. You will urinate out excess B, C though. There are sub categories which don't obey this rule though. That said, the effects of vitamins can last several days it depends on the concentration, form it's in, and the form it's taken in. </p>
<p>If you've seen prescription B12 shots (cyanocobalamin) it's done monthly.</p>
<p>You don't need to spread out your multivitamin or the vitamin rich meals unless it's pretty much all you're eating, and it's rich in A, D, E and K. </p></div>		</li>
