			<div class="markdown"><p>They <em>don't</em> do what OP asked for though. They only show slices, rather than a projection. What you'd need is a projection of 4D space into 3D space. It'd be like a photo or a drawing done by 4D creatures and it'd have similar visual artefacts as a photo or drawing has when projecting 3D to 2D - distances, sizes and angles become hard to judge, optical illusions follow. </p>
<p>This would probably work pretty well in VR (and really not well on a computer monitor as you lose an entire other dimension) but 4D toys, at least based on that video, does not do this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, all I have been able to find is what a 4D object would look like in a 3D space. It’s like what the 3D guy looked like when he first arrived in Flatland. Just slices. It’s a 3D representation but not a 4D illustration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you’re looking at a drawing of a cube on a piece of paper, all you’re seeing is the cube’s “shadow” as it were, there isn’t actually a 3D cube on the 2d surface, you’re brain just knows what a cube is and can put 2 and 2 together so your brain thinks the drawing is a cube.</p>
<p>You can do the same thing in 3D but you end up with a 3D “shadow” of the hyper cube just, a 4d person would probably look at it and think about it in 4d in a similar way we think about the drawing of the cube and it can elaborate up but since we only have 3D brains we can’t do that and all we can comprehend is the shadow</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a 4d object would look like this when you change the characteristics of a 3d object it changes every linked 3 objects (within the 4d object) instantly with the same changes. Like a spooky action at a distance. :p</p>
<p>The only thing you see in 3d space would be a 4d cross section that manifests has a 3d shape but is not the full picture. </p>
<p>If you want to represent a 4d illustration, do a 3d representation of a fractal function (it's a 4d cross section).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can you really illustrate 4D space into 3D space, for example a 2D being in a 2D Space won't be able to see any 'shapes' only lines which form the outline of shapes like circle square etc. but they cannot see the whole 'circle' like we can see a circle on a piece of paper because we have 3D vision onto the 2D Plane. So to see the 4D shape we need to go into the 4th dimension space which we cannot do right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, and part of the problem that I'm trying to wrap my brain around is that our species is literally &quot;designed&quot; to perceive and exist in a 3 Dimensional world so EVERYTHING will be ultimately perceived in 3D.  To ME it seems like the OP doesn't seem to realize that a 4D illustration would require you to be able to perceive 4D, which we cannot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This exact video, plus reading flat land is what led me to wanting to ask this question and get the most basic answer, but I think you’re right; you really can’t just get it without a little mind bending. Even in the toy box video, we are looking at it as we would percieve it in a 3D world, not seeing it as it would be in a 4D world, which I suppose is just impossible to really “see.” It really vexes me though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the problem lies with the idea that the 3-dimensional objects aren't really adequately represented in 2-dimensional space, either - but our brains interpret it like a symbol and sort of ... translate that into something that makes &quot;sense&quot;. You can add a rotation animation or create the illusion of depth using two images to represent a single perspective shot, but that's still just cheating our perception rather than creating a truly accurate representation of that 3rd dimension. </p>
<p>On that note, while it may be possible to represent a 4-dimensional object in 3-dimensions in a similar way, we don't have the familiarity with 4 dimensions that we do with 3, so our brains often wouldn't recognize it, and wouldn't be able to recognize it as a symbol of that dimensionality. It would be .... harder to represent without a pre-existing understanding of 4 dimensional space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're exactly right- if it were easy to simulate 3d objects accurately on a 2d surface, then VR wouldn't be a big deal.  But it is, because that second viewpoint adds depth perception.</p></div>		</li>

Jan 2018 articles. <a href="http://bigthink.com/philip-perry/hints-of-the-4th-dimension-have-been-detected-by-physicists" target="_blank">http://bigthink.com/philip-perry/hints-of-the-4th-dimension-have-been-detected-by-physicists</a></p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2018/01/10/studies-find-evidence-of-a-fourth-dimension/" target="_blank">https://nypost.com/2018/01/10/studies-find-evidence-of-a-fourth-dimension/</a></p>
<p>Our world exists in three spatial dimensions (as well as the dimension of time, but that’s not something you can see). What these newest studies are looking for is the effects of a fourth spatial dimension that can be detected within our three-dimensional world. We’d have no idea what it looks like or what kind of a reality a fourth dimension would offer, but if it does exist in the hidden background of our three-dimensional existence, science might be able to prove it’s there.</p>
<p>In one of the experiments, scientists studied the behavior of light particles moving through specially made glass that bounces light back and forth between its edges. By simulating the effects of an electrical charge via physical input, the team observed how the light behaved, watching for irregularities that could only be made possible if a fourth dimension was working behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The other experiment used supercooled atoms held in place on a grid made of lasers. Scientists call this setup a “charge pump,” and they use it test the flow of an electrical charge while monitoring how the atoms respond.</p>
<p>Both of the experiments yielded results that suggest that a fourth dimension really is all around us, even if we can’t see it. Science isn’t any closer to tapping into this hidden dimension, but knowing that it’s there is an important step toward painting a more complete picture of physics, and you can bet these won’t be the last experiments that toy with the idea.</p></div>		</li>
