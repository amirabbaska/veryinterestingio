			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Instead of a nitrogen cartridge, a small hollow plastic sphere called a widget is placed in the can, then the can is filled with beer, sealed and pressurized normally with nitrogen gas. The widget has a small pin point hole (or two) in it so under canning pressure the beer fills the inside of the widget. When the can is opened, the sudden depressurization converts the dissolved nitrogen into tiny nitrogen gas bubbles. The consolidating gas inside the widget forces beer out through the pinpoint holes like punctate beer jets inside the can, further disturbing the beer and generating the characteristic nitrogenation &quot;foam&quot; we associate with Guinness (and all other nitro beers). The tiny nitrogen bubbles also give the characteristically silky-smooth mouthfeel of nitro beers.</p>
<p>Regarding bubbles &quot;falling,&quot; N2 bubbles do start a convection-like procession in the beer glass, rising up the middle, pushing out to the circumference of the container and then cascading down the inside of the glass.</p>
<p>Pretty cool what can be done by simply changing the gas with which a beer is canned/bottled!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just bubble size and mouth feel.  CO2 in solution forms carbonic acid, which changes the flavor of the beer.  N2 is inert and does not react with the beer and allows the more subtle flavors to come through. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are slightly off. CO2 is soluble in water/beer while nitrogen is not. Nitrogen Poured beer is trying to simulate pouring a beer out of a cask with a sprinkler which created a thick foam and smooth mouth feel. Casks go bad quickly though due to exposure to oxygen. With modern nitro kegs, they last much longer. You get the small bubbles you mention by forcing the beer through a restricter plate in the faucet. This requires high pressures to work (~40psi on my system as opposed to ~25psi for regular taps). If you used straight CO2 the beer would quickly overcarbonate and be unusable. By using a high percentage of nitrogen (remember nonsoluble) in the dispensing gas, you can turn the pressure up without worrying about over carbonation. All the bubbles in a nitro beer are still CO2, its just carbonated at a lower amount for mouthfeel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. CO2 is what causes the bite. The nitrogen is used to create the mouthfeel of nitro beers, and in cases of very long lines, to  create the right pressures to pour beer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if you ever inhale straight CO2 (I've done it, but I don't really recommend it) the air seems carbonated.  Slightly painful in the way carbonation is and with the distinctive seltzer taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CO^(2) is really the 6th flavor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweet</li>
<li>Sour</li>
<li>Salty</li>
<li>Bitter</li>
<li>Umami</li>
<li>Carbonic</li>
</ul>
<p>I imagine it is an evolutionary advantage to be able to taste (not just smell) spoiled liquids. Since the need to breathe is already driven by sensing CO^(2) in your lungs, it wasn't difficult genetically to detect it in your mouth and throat too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this is separate from the fizz. Try drinking lemon juice or something else acidic - sure it has that sharp taste, but it's not fizzy. Beer typically isn't that sour, i.e. doesn't have that much acid in, but you can feel the bubbles on your tongue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well carbonic acid is special among most acids, in atmospheric pressures carbonic acid decomposes into liquid water and CO2 gas. The reason you don't really taste it in coke for example is because there is so much sugar and other flavors, and you cant really taste it with beer unless you have something to compare it to. <a href="https://www.morebeer.com/articles/checkingph" target="_blank">Also beer is quite acidic</a> the reason you don't get all of that acidic taste along with it is because the hops balance it out.</p></div>		</li>
