			<div class="markdown"><p>You get a continuous potential difference but not a continuous current flow - you can't get an LED to emit light that way. To do that you have to heat the negatively charged wire to emit the electrons to space, make a rotating coil, or do similar tricks to make a closed circuit out of the setup (a return wire moving at the same speed doesn't help).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I wasn't really clear, I'll make a note. I was just thinking about what it would take to get a voltage difference over the LED greater than its voltage drop, causing at least a few electrons to be able to hop over the gap. There'd be a tiny tiny spike of current, but after that it wouldn't do anything unless you used the much more sensical coil setup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't the magnetic field have to be changing though? Is this what you mean by &quot;optimal direction&quot;? Does a satellite have any hope of doing that? Would one in low earth equatorial orbit be in the <em>least optimal</em> direction, passing mostly through equal field?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of satellites aren't in equatorial orbit, like the ISS.  I'd think over the course of an orbit,  it would change, no?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Orbital period would make the voltage change quite slow. I doubt it can generate much current back and forth the wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there are a few different things. If you're thinking about magnetic induction, then you're thinking of maxwell's equations, <em>curl(E) = -∂B/∂t</em>. A changing magnetic field causes a gradient in the electric field. This is the most useful form when you're talking about things like inductors and transformers, since the magnetic field is always changing and the conductor isn't moving.</p>
<p>But you can also look at the Lorentz force, which says (for the magnetic part) <em>F = cross(qv, B)</em>. A charge moving through a static magnetic field feels a force. I think you can prove that these two equations are equivalent? In any case, that's the one that I'm thinking of when we're talking about moving a conductor through the Earth's magnetic field. Either the magnetic field has to change, or the charge has to be moving.</p>
<p>The optimal direction in this case refers to that cross product. The lorentz force pushes charges perpendicular to both their direction of motion, and the ambient magnetic field. So that's the direction you'd need your wire oriented to have it get the best potential difference across it.</p></div>		</li>
