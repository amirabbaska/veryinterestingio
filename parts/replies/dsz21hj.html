			<div class="markdown"><p>MEOS doesn't have any effect on how drunk you would be at a specific BAC, just how fast it's metabolized.  The reason for the ability to function more normally comes from the mechanisms through which the brain compensates for an out on balance GABA system, which someone explained quite well in a response to the current top comment.  MEOS isn't unimportant but it's playing a different role than preventing alcohol from impairing neural functioning (which is how alcohol poisoning usually kills via shutting down breathing reflexes and reflexes to keep us from inhaling our own vomit).  I think you mean to say how alcoholics can survive drinking an amount that would kill a non tolerant person.  Because of MEOS the alcoholic wouldn't reach as high a BAC and it wouldn't stay as high as long.</p></div>		</li>
