			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the moisture content of the wood and materials that make up a house is usually very low, where as in a campfire the moisture content is much higher. Good seasoned firewood has a moisture content of around 20% while most building materials are kiln dried and have almost no moisture. </p></div>		</li>

The immense heat from a house fire causes wood and other products to off gas volatiles that are flammable and increase the combustion.  That's the whole back draft thing.  </p></div>		</li>
