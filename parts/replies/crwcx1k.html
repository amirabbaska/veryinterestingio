			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of animals do something similar where one half of the brain sleeps while the other is 'awake' (ducks, iguanas, etc) to guard against predation.</p>
<p>I believe what makes the dolphins unique is that the blow hole is a voluntary sphincter so they must keep part of their brain awake to prevent them from inhaling water.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regardless, this is very interesting because many mammals have both eyes input to both hemispheres, which means the sleeping hemisphere would still be getting input from the ipsilateral eye.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although, most of us luckily don't live in environments where this adaptation would be of much usefulness. </p></div>		</li>
