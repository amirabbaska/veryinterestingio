			<div class="markdown"><p>Related to this, the apparent colour of a black body is described by something called the Planckian locus. It turns out that as the temperature tends to infinity the percieved colour tends towards a blueish white, rather than &quot;running away&quot; to the shortest-wavelength violet you can see.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh that is kind of a surprise for me...I thought that it would tend to violet (so to the shortest wavelengths) because it sounds logical to me. And there I get again a surprise....thanks for the post! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That describes their emission spectrum. Is it meaningful to ask about their reflectivity? i.e. If you were to shine a spotlight on that cooled neutron star, what would it look like? Presumably it would be extremely smooth - so a perfect mirror finish? Reddish from the shift? Or inky black?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not too sure. Neutron stars have a thin atmosphere, and go from near vacuum to many tons per cubic centimeter in a matter of a few meters. Plenty of people do a lot of work to model other, more immediately relevant parameters of the atmosphere (for the purpose of understanding observations), but I don't think anyone has sat down to calculate what the reflectivity of a neutron star in the far future would be... Perhaps someone with a good understanding of atmospheres can make a decent order of magnitude estimate.</p>
<p>While they are quite round, I'm not sure there's any real reason to believe they should appear 'polished.' Light isn't necessarily going to be reflected from a specific surface at a fixed depth...</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Don't forget the blueshift when they are coming in as well. The effects should more or less average out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so since we are talking about hypotheticals: imagine you are somehow magically standing on a cold neutron star and you have a flashlight or a candle or something (or there is a &quot;yellow&quot; star nearby), what color is the ground?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My upper division E&amp;M isn't good enough to help you with reflectivity.  Although it is very smooth,  its absorption is calculable. It's like saying that no matter how polished wood is,  it won't be as reflective as metal.  It has to do with the conductivity of the materials.  I also do not know the conductivity around a neutron star</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they'll likely the last stable source of useful electromagnetic radiation, though other dwarfs may give them a run for their money. I don't know the exact cooling timescales for heat death.</p>
<p>That, or if you're okay with a black hole you can extract energy from via the Penrose Process. But that's not all that practical for a variety of reasons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Heh, but you're implying a Dyson sphere around a neutron star a trillion years in the future <em>is</em> practical? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Penrose Process.</p>

<p>TIL what that is. That's incredibly fascinating. Thanks for that. So now we're heading down a bit of a rabbit hole. Sorry. From the wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and the infalling piece has negative mass-energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of this weird and unusual coordinate swap, the energy of the particle can assume both positive and negative values as measured by an observer at infinity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the major failings of the Alcubierre Drive is that (IIRC) it requires negative mass particles. Could this be a workaround? Meaning would it be theoretically possible to capture the infalling piece and use it to fuel an Alcubierre Drive?</p>
<p>Edit: I should probably just take an astrophysics and theoretical physics course... </p></div>		</li>
