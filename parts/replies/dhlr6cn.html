			<div class="markdown"><p>Peanut butter!
No seriously!!
Peanut butter is high in protein and fat, and a little can go a long way. A teaspoon, then two later in the day. Add some water. Increase the amount of peanut butter then add more to the meal. It's a very slow process, extreme malnourishment can take a few to several months to even start to get healthy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I can't say for certain since I've never been in that kind of situation, but probably very slow supplementation. Without being able to check the electrolyte balance of the person, the only option is to try to introduce them slowly enough so that they can correct their own imbalance. There's no sort of set treatment regimen or anything - it's really a case by case basis :/</p></div>		</li>
