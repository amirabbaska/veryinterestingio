			<div class="markdown"><p>You flatter me :P short version: F-theory is a type of string theory. Phenomenology refers to using it to study things that might happen in experiments like the LHC. R-Parity is a symmetry seen in a lot of &quot;grand unified theories&quot; to prevent the models from having proton decay. R-Parity violation is when a model has partial or full violation of that rule, which leads to cool/exotic processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question - are you saying tap/drinking water has a lot of K in it as well, or the runners should have added salt to their water to balance out the K from the bananas? </p>
<p>Edit: must be in the water, right? Because K doesn’t balance out with salt in the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having any sort of potassium imbalance would be difficult from diet alone. There are usually underlying reasons for having a potassium imbalance. Some common medications, such as lisinopril, losartartan, or spironolactone can cause high potassium. Some other medications such as hydrochlorothiazide can cause low potassium. Because having a certain potassium level is so important, patients on these medications will usually have to go in routinely for blood tests to make sure their doses are appropriate. Otherwise conditions such as renal failure or refeeding syndrome (eating a lot after a long period of malnution) can cause life-threatening potassium imbalances.</p></div>		</li>
