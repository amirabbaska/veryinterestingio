			<div class="markdown"><p>Since when have you been afraid of clowns? As you slowly lose grey matter, your memory reverts to a &quot;previous save&quot;/when you were younger. If you've been afraid of clowns since you were a baby, tough. If it happened when you saw a movie in your 40s, then bye bye fear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youre looking at this from a limited viewpoint if you think SSRI's give long term positive effects for depression. They are more anti-emotion than anti-depression. </p>
<p>As well, they have shown to have no long term beneficial effect on depression.</p>
<p>Also, rats cloned to not have specific serotonin receptors did not show the expected depressed state.</p>
<p>Depression seems much more environmental than neurochemical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is neurochemicals. Figuring out the process is the job of neuroscience, and it's this case it's a shitty understanding. Depression is much more complicated than SSRIs, it's just an easy example for most people to understand. There's not a solid understanding of depression rn, so the treatment isn't solid. </p>
<p>Saying its more environmental than neurochemicals is like saying nothing natural can kill you - its wrong and ignores chemistry. Your environment is interpreted by neurons that communicate using chemicals. </p>
<p>Sorry if you're unhappy with SSRIs :P</p></div>		</li>
