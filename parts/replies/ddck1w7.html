It all depends on if it's a friend or foe that's nearby when you cry out. But a trait like this that's sometimes good and sometimes bad should be voluntary, shouldn't it? I mean, let's say I'm in the jungle, climbing a tree, and I fall and break both my legs. I'm going to cry out in pain completely involuntarily, no matter if I'm in friendly or dangerous territory. </p></div>		</li>
