			<div class="markdown"><p>True true. The original purpose of negative emotions is a warning sign that something is wrong. I guess it's how we handle these emotions initially that will predict how they will affect us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are no negative emotions. There is simply being. Learning that there is a time and place for every emotion, and when to influence them to be more appropriate and purposeful, is a key to mindfulness. Merely trying to treat anger or sadness as &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; is exactly how people end up repressing these emotions in the first place, and being unable to use them effectively for what is necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are dozens of meditative styles across dozens of religions and arts. Many of them are more involved than sitting and thinking about one's self; for example walking the labyrinth in Catholicism is one style, as is the diligent practice of katas in Japanese karate. The book, &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; deals with some aspects of this while speaking to larger societal principles that result from our artificial separation of rational thought and purposeful actions. </p>
<p>Ultimately the goal of all of these acts appears to be placing your executive mental function in a place where it understands and anticipates many of the autonomic functions that we take for granted - breathing, eatting, being emotive. They all share in common the use of repetition to build that awareness of self, and channeling that awareness towards a state that many of them call &quot;centering&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meditation is a gold mine and there's tons of stuff about it online. It helped me a lot to read up first, as opposed to just trying to sit and focus which is tough. Try searching around on vipassana meditation to start. There's also transcendental meditati on which I come across a lot but know very little about. And much much more, good luck :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Lamrim&quot; or &quot;Lojong&quot; Buddhist teachings, commonly translated as &quot;mind training.&quot; It's good stuff, even if you're not Buddhist. Thubten Chodron recorded them as MP3 files in her book &quot;Guided Meditations on the Stages of the Path.&quot; It might be a bit heavy on the Tibetan Buddhist religious side, but there are plenty of meditation recordings you can skip around through to get a taste. Your library might have it, or be able to get it for you through Interlibrary Loan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See my response just above yours! Also maybe read &quot;Destructive Emotions &amp; How we can overcome them&quot; by...Daniel (?) Golman I think. He teamed up with the Dalai Lama and a bunch of scientists and psychologists to write it.</p></div>		</li>
