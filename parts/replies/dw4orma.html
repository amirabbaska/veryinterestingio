			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the kind of top-level comment I was looking for, to add this speculation: Because otherwise, alcohol poisoning rates would go up by 5%. Similar reason to why people take drinks like Four Loko seriously as a risk to kids - if the taste isn't enough to keep people drinking responsibly (like, the flavor of liquor being difficult to enjoy &amp; so people drink slower &amp; with lots of mixer ie, less-strong drinks) then it's a danger to kids who might get excited by the fruity stuff.</p>
<p>I can see in the thread it has to do with the chemical abilities of the liquor and the flavoring but I wouldn't be surprised if there were regulations, in addition to this one you've named, regarding the marketing of the drinks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As if no one can figure out to mix liquor and red bull...</p>
