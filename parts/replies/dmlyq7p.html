			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of the <code>if(table(is.na...</code> line, you can just do <code>if(all(is.na(deck[,2])))</code>.  That's easier to understand.  </p>
<p>Also, instead of having a &quot;marker&quot; column in a data frame in which you flag hits, it would be a little more efficient to just use a vector of 1:52 and index into it to set NAs:</p>
<pre><code>deck &lt;- 1:52
...
deck[t.card] &lt;- NA
...
if (all(is.na(deck))) return(n)
...</code></pre></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at my computer right now, but I seem to remember the distribution being heavy tailed - right skew. This would be consistent with the median being lower than the mean. </p></div>		</li>
