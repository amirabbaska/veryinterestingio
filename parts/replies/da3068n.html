			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it was just politics. I remember all the dual signage in the 70's and 80's, the &quot;think metric&quot; campaigns, textbooks and news articles expressing units in both metric and English, but I think they did it backwards. The old units were always shown first, and metric next to it and usually deemphasized, so there was no reason to use the less visible numbers and thus start to &quot;think&quot; in terms of that. Speed limit signs were still in MPH then a smaller KPH shown underneath. Car speedometers had big white lettering for MPH and smaller blue lettering (for example) for the equivalent KPH. Your eye naturally sees the bigger and more prominent display. </p>
<p>Likewise, news articles and textbooks would show distance in feet, then equivalent meters in parentheses. I think they should have displayed everything in reverse, with the older units deemphasized and the metric value the most prominent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That probably would have done the trick. When Europe went to the Euro, I think they went all-in, and listed prices like you said. Euro was the main unit, and somewhere you might be able to find the conversion to the outdated currency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even then, the time from when physical money was issued at the start of 2002 to when the older currencies were no longer legal tender was pretty fast. I think the longest it was anywhere was only four or five months and some places did it way faster.</p>
<p>The euro had existed electronically and on the market for longer though, but even then that was only 1999. People knew it was coming for longer than that, I suppose. But even then, the change over was pretty fast. It wasn't years and years and years like the US tried to change people over to metric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't this more like step one, just getting people kind of familiar with the units? I suspect the next step then would be to make the new number big and the old smaller, and then even smaller, and then very small on the back, to then nowhere at all.</p></div>		</li>
