<blockquote>
<p>gamma rays are on the other end (with a wavelength of about 10-12 meters)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately almost all the information you've linked to is incorrect as an explanation of why different materials are opaque or transparent to different frequencies of EM radiation. I'm on a mobile at the moment so can't type a lengthy answer, but I'm hoping someone else can point out the flaws in those answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate more on &quot;EM waves interact with matter on their own scale of size and time&quot;?<br />
You mentioned that gamma rays are too small and fast but what's small is its wavelength and what's fast is its frequency. How do I interpret this physically?<br />
What exactly is the EM wave that &quot;just pass through the space between and within atoms and molecules&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

Long wavelengths like radio can only absorb when you have a &quot;sea of electrons&quot; (typically a metal) with a <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/149607/what-is-the-relationship-between-faraday-cage-mesh-size-and-attenuation-of-cell" target="_blank">feature size roughly half the wavelength or smaller</a>. See the screen on a microwave oven door. High energy (short wavelength) like X-Ray and Gamma mostly interact with the nucleus of atoms. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.mwit.ac.th/~physicslab/hbase/mod4.html" target="_blank">Transparency of a material at a given wavelength occurs because that photon does not interact with that kind of matter.</a> Because nuclei have a small cross-section, high-energy photons tend to pass through most low-atomic-weight materials (like humans). You need either high density materials (like lead) or a greater depth of material (like the Earth's atmosphere) to attenuate them.</p></div>		</li>
