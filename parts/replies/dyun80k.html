			<div class="markdown"><p>For example, I was diagnosed with melanoma a few months ago on my ear and my surgeon said that not that many years ago I would’ve had to lose my ear to get rid of that cancer. But now there’s a new procedure called the MOHS procedure. Although not the death sentence example you gave, but research to come up with this procedure allowed me to keep my ear. I’m 30, losing my ear at this age would have been devastating to me (not that it’s not to anyone at any age)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was diagnosed with melanoma (stage 1b) as well when I was 28. Not a tanner, but very fair skinned and burn so easily. All it takes is a few good burns. It was on the outside of my left arm, right at the shoulder bend, so healing from the surgeries was fun (very tight area). It's been 5 years and I'm still NED, but I know it can rear its ugly head at any time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask, how did you know? This is a fear of mine. I'm fair skin. Almost always wear sunblock but still manage to get burned. I have a lot of freckles and some mole-beauty mark things. And I just know I'll probably get skin cancer one day because my mom had it like 3 times. Was it found during a routine check up?</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for all the replies everyone  :)  I appreciate it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can you try and get it through my head how important it is to deal with this early? I am 30, haven't been to a doctor since I was about 12, but i just noticed a nearly dime sized mole/freckle/thingy on my back that was never there before, but I have no desire to do anything about it because I'm ignorant and stubborn and numb to emotions, including fear of dying. but if I'm making a huge mistake I probably won't find out any other way/time than now. I am an idiot, I know this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course that depends on when they catch it and a million other factors. They told my best friend (would have been 30 this month) his 3c melanoma was rough, but immunotherapy would have him right as rain in no time. It did not. Surgery, chemo, tons of weed (sorry r/trees it's not magic) and virtually no effect.</p>
<p>Not to bring you down, just wanted to point out that even the most &quot;cured&quot; cancers aren't completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lost a very good friend at the prime of his life to the same. He had just settled down with his soul mate and was a great parent to her kids. Their whole life in front of them and found a bump on his skin. Went through the same procedures. Attributed to the years of being outside without sunscreen. </p>
<p>He was gone in six months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always got the impression that the things I saw online where people were claiming it cured cancer were trolls. Do people seriously claim it does anything on that level? It helps me with pain, nausea, joint inflammation (it's a fairly good anti-inflammatory and vasodilator). I've heard of it helping with seizures. But curing cancer? How would that even work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. </p>
<p>It's also somewhat more complicated given the fact that cancer cells are your own rogue cells, making it often difficult to target them. For bacterial infections, you can just send in an antibiotic in most cases, but cancer treatments need to be able to target tumor cells that may only be slightly off from your own. This is also why it's difficult for your own immune system to take care of it. </p>
<p>Which, as the comment above pointed out, gets much much harder if you don't necessarily know what causes the cancer. There are many different genes that could be mutated to cause the cells to go rogue, and each and every one of them may require a different cure. This is why some cancer treatments in the past have, for instance, been 100% effective on 50% of the patients but completely ineffective for the others, even though on the outside it appeared to be in the same area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right? It's not like we're trying to end a species of animals. These are your own cells that start misbehaving.   When conspiracy theorists say we could have cured cancer if we REALLY wanted to it drives me friggin nuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;true&quot; conspiracy is that many cancer treatment drugs rushed to market are unproven, astronomically expensive (100s of thousands a year) and probably do more harm than good.</p>
<p>For many terminally ill, uncurable patients, not getting any chemotherapy and instead opting for end-of-life care would likely extend their remaining life span and give much better quality of life than getting killed by poisonous treatment.</p>
<p>It's a market where terminally ill people are getting tortured and poisoned to death without any real benefit so that the hospitals, doctors and drug companies could rack in profits.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are working treatments for some cancers now which would be a death sentence just 20 - 30 years ago. And it's impossible to figure out the best working treatment procedure (which is more than just a drug being administered) without applying it on wide enough scale for long enough time to work out the best approach.</p>
<p>In other words, it's complicated.</p></div>		</li>
