			<div class="markdown"><p>So when movies use a nuke in space, ie to break an asteroid or fight against aliens, nukes don't really work like we think they do on earth. Being space as a vacuum, the nuke wouldn't expoled or at least not cause damage? Obviously, movies are for entertainment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear weapons work in space, just a lot differently. Without an atmosphere most of the energy from a nuke would be released as x-rays (in an atmospheric explosion  the x-rays get absorbed by the atmosphere and form the fireball). From what I've read, a nuclear bomb detonating in (deep) space would look like a brief flash of light; no fireball or anything. Anything close enough would still receive enough radiation to heat up really quickly and would get damaged by the resulting shockwaves passing back and forth through it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nukes would still explode, since the nuclear reaction, fission or fusion, would still occur without the presence of any gasses. However, the effect of the explosions would fall off very dramatically unless it's a direct hit, as there would be no medium to propagate the energy towards to target. The nukes could be designed to carry physical shrapnel, but I'm not sure how effective that may be since any components near the bomb would just be vaporized anyway. Maybe the nuclear bombs would need to be designed with enough surrounding material such that when it detonates, it creates its own medium to carry forward the energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just finished reading a science fiction series (the Three Body Problem), where at one point there is discussion about using nuclear weapons in space as a defense against an alien attack.  But the problem was, as you suggest, that a nuclear blast in space doesn't have any concussive effect. There still would be the radiation, but no physical force unless the bomb was physically attached to the target ship. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it's how bombs work in general. It's not a fireball that kills you like the pyrotechnic explosions in movies, but the shockwave and shrapnel (if it's included). A lot of IEDs have stuff like nails and ball bearings to supplement the pressure wave.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A tiny amount, maybe. But for one there's usually <em>a lot</em> of bedrock in the way. In a nuclear power plant you have a few metres of concrete to contain the radiation. Here you have at least hundreds of metres, often thousands. So nothing can get out directly. The only danger is that water down there is contaminated and than makes it way up. That however takes time. Most of the fallout from a nuclear explosion has too short a half-life to be a danger after. So once it's up it's likely not much of a danger anymore. After all there's almost always bit of uranium in normal tap water anyway</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US Government estimated that all the Cold War era nuclear testing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/01/research.medicalscience" target="_blank">caused approximately 80,000 cancers and 15,000 deaths</a> in the US. </p>
<p>I'd say that's a pretty big deal and it's a really good thing that most of the world has stopped testing nuclear weapons. </p></div>		</li>
