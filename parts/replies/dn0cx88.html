			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed that the low amplitude cycles just prior to the vaccine seemed to correlate roughly with the end of the &quot;Baby Boom&quot; in the US, and sure enough, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db60_fig1.png" target="_blank">graphs of US birth rate</a> show a precipitous decline in birth rate over the 5 years from 1959-1960 (the first low amplitude measles cycle and just a year or two past peak birth rate), to ~1964 when the vaccine came out, nearly 30% from the looks of it. Would the sudden reduction of newly available (newly born) hosts have contributed to the steadying of the infection rate, in addition to the public health involvement and community awareness mentioned elsewhere as the main factors? Or is this just a coincidence? </p>
<p>I can imagine that the real cause of the decline in both birth rates and measle infections might more broadly be attributed to improved health care, higher living standards, and lower poverty rates, and the whole causation/correlation puzzle would come into play.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Discussion further down the page also suggests the possibility that <em>reported</em> measles cases before the vaccine may have been more likely to be very young children, when the virus is more dangerous, and there is greater medical supervision. That unequal representation could support the hypothesis that declining birth rate led to a rapid decline in <em>reported</em> cases in boom years in particular, even if overall infection rate didn't drop as precipitously prior to the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The data also seems to be less noisy, there is a trend down but the year to year incidence seems to be more consistent. I wonder if they changed how they reported cases prior to introducing the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, when you see a &quot;tightening&quot; of data points, you should consider that it's not a decrease from the former peaks, but an improvement in accuracy of the measurement. Notice that the appearance of a decrease lies about in the middle of the points seen over the 10 years prior, but the reporting for the previous period seems to have extremely high variation, swinging wildly.</p>
<p>Decreasing variability in the data like this is more likely a change in the accuracy of measurement, not a change in the phenomenon itself, as evidenced by the lack of similar wild variability in every year after around 1960. Without knowing exactly how the data were collected, it's hard to say for sure, but this is a distinct possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A wise man once shared his view with me on single variable graphs, with only a short time dimension over the X axis. I paraphrase because it was a long time ago! :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When considering the infinite amount of confounding variables in any nonlinear system, such a chart serves only to pin down one of them, for an infinitesimally small amount of time.</p>
<p>Like a tent in a storm, with only 1 peg in in the ground, the damn thing will just flap around all the more and someone is likely to lose an eye.</p>
