			<div class="markdown"><p>That is absolutely 100% true. In relativity papers, you will often see things like &quot;locally Minkowskian&quot; or &quot;locally flat&quot; referring to just this fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, as was noted, local triviality can only be achieved in symplectic geometry. Riemannian geometry is much more rigid and in no sense locally flat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. We call this &quot;Local Lorentz Invariance.&quot; It makes a lot of sense for simple reason that even though spacetime is curved, it is smooth, meaning that you can 'zoom in' on any point and you'll see something that looks locally flat (e.g. a tangent line is good enough approximation to any smooth curve at small enough distances). </p>
<p>In short, this means that spacetime is locally Minkowskian, and so you can take special relativity to be a decent description of your experiences on sufficiently short distance scales. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In GR, it is the <em>metric</em> tensor that tells you how objects move, how spacetime curves, etc. It turns out that you can always adapt your coordinates so that <em>at your location only</em>, the metric looks like that of flat spacetime plus correction terms that are <em>quadratic or higher</em> in your coordinates. (It's sort of like Taylor expanding the metric at your location and there's a theorem that shows you can always choose your coordinates so that the first-order terms vanish.) We call such coordinates <em>locally inertial</em>. At your location and within a small enough neighborhood of your location, you can approximate everything as just SR. (Strictly speaking, the metric is <em>not</em> flat, but there should be a small enough neighborhood where you can use a flat metric and the difference is within any tolerable error bounds.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when physicists talk about the speed of light being constant for every observer they mean for every observer at the same point in space? Why is the time a signal takes to arrive from mars to earth at all consistent with earth's lokal speed of light? Is it just that spacetime is sufficently flat at both location so as their respective speeds of light are essentially equal but not exactly? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially it is an experimental fact, based on hundreds of years of astronomic observations. Theorywise we have GR which tells us exactly how much the global distances change with gravity, and the sun's gravitational field is moderately weak with very minor effect on speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. In fact, the CIPM (International Committee for Weights and Measures) recommends that the current SI definition of meter be restricted to &quot;lengths which are sufficiently short for the effects predicted by general relativity to be negligible with respect to the uncertainties of realisation.&quot; In other words, the definition should explicitly take into account that the speed of light is invariant only for local observers.</p>

<p>Spacetime is not flat in our solar system, but it is nearly so so that some calculations (like estimating the time-of-flight delay for a light signal from Mars to Earth) can be done assuming spacetime is flat. If you wanted a more accurate calculation, then you would have to take into account the curvature. (For example, GPS satellites do this all the time to calculate your position.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that I think of it, it really doesn't matter since the only way to actually observe a distant signal travelling faster than my local c is to recieve photons from that event, which means as soon as they arrive at my location they will be moving at my local c again, making it impossible to measure any transgression directly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the tangent space at an event p is roughly the set of all velocity
vectors of curves through p.  Equivalently – but a little bit more
elegant – you can define them as directional derivatives acting on
functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are vector spaces. You start with a manifold (e.g., a 2-sphere). Then you give it a smooth structure (i.e., you define which maps on your manifold are differentiable). Then at each point we can define a vector space that consists of all tangent vectors of smooth paths that pass through that point. This is a vector space. But since each tangent space is a different vector space there is no way to directly compare (i.e., add or subtract) velocity vectors based at different points. You have to use parallel transport like I described or some other similar method.</p></div>		</li>
