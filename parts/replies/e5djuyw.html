			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my particular area of expertise. </p>
<p>There's a wide range of copper and stainless steel alloys with good corrosion resistance for ambient temp seawater. The biggest issue tends to be fouling from algae, barnacles, clams, and other marine life. Areas subject to rapid flow are less subject to this such as turbine inlets, guide vanes and blades. However, tidal stream type turbines operate at a fairly low speed. Fouling would potentially spoil the water flow around turbine blades, causing a loss of power.</p>
<p>Ships propellors and fittings for the same are typically aluminum-nickel-copper bronze. This is mainly because of the corrosion resistance and the fouling resistance of the copper due to it's moderate toxicity to organisms. This might be very expensive for a large stream type turbine though. Steel with a bronze or copper cladding might be the best option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool info, thanks! Still, those materials are rather expensive, are they not? So less &quot;maintenance&quot; and more &quot;up front&quot; cost, on top of the regular cleanings. </p>
<p>Do they do anything like this for the off-shore salt-water wind turbines? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would the extraction of energy through tidal generators affect the earth-moon gravitational system? Would the distance between them decrease?</p>
<p>Edit: I now realize that the energy of a 2 body system decreases with increasing distance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tides are a result of interaction between the earth, sun, and moon. Tides cause energy to be lost to the earth-sun-moon system, mainly by slowing down Earth's rotation and increasing the distance between the earth and moon over a geologic time scale. Incidentally the earth also in theory causes slight tidal effects on the surface of the sun but this would be very difficult to measure. </p>
<p>Normally the energy lost to the system via tides is dissipated in the form of turbulence and ultimately slight heating, which is then radiated off into space.</p>
<p>Tidal power simply redirect some of this energy to produce electricity instead.</p>
<p>But energy extracted from tides by humans is negligible compared to the total energy of the tides. </p>
<p>In the earth's past not only were tides much higher but the length of the day was shorter and the moon was closer.</p></div>		</li>
