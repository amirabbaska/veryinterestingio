			<div class="markdown"><p>One problem with this explanation is that diseases would wipe out single blood types. Sure it's good for the group, but it leaves a group with less variation. Current blood types have persisted for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if all of one phenotype was wiped out in an epidemic, I'm pretty sure all the genes to reproduce that phenotype would still be around, since O is recessive and A and B are co-dominant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how common blood types are (IE are they spread out evenly or are their more A's then B's) but I imagine in a group of people, if one person was sick and only adapted to B's then it wouldn't be able to spread fars because the A's and O's. So it's not really a problem, since we as a species are very much a herd. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that specific case, herd immunity wouldn’t apply. There are enough of any one type that a pathogen would spread. Except maybe if it was specific to AB. Regardless, a pathogen that’s targeting mechanism relies on blood type antigens is unlikely to occur. </p></div>		</li>
