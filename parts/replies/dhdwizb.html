			<div class="markdown"><p>You are completely right, just trying to fill in some details: The field strength of quadrupole magnets grows roughly proportional to the distance of the center, so an electron in a Y-focusing quad will be bent upwards slightly if it is lower than the &quot;ideal&quot; beam path. The gravitational influence on the electron trajectory indeed causes the mean beam path to be slightly &quot;lower&quot; than without gravity, but a rough calculation will show that the effect is super small (small fractions of nanometers at maximum). So small in fact, that this effect is not even taken into consideration during the design of an accelerator lattice. There are much larger uncontrollable effects that the lattice needs to be robust against anyway.</p></div>		</li>
