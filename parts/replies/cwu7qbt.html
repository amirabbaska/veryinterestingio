			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciated that the answer you pointed to included this fun fact: [when you look through] these partially transparent gold films[...], they would actually appear to have a blue/green tint - because gold is a yellowy colour, it transmits blue light better and reflects yellow/red light.</p>
<p>You can actually see that effect not only with a gold film deposited on glass, but with a simple gold leaf sheet.</p>
