			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the role of L-T in solar system formation, my back-of-the-envelope estimation is that it is about 6 to 12 orders of magnitude too weak to have a significant effect in the few million years it took for the solar system to collapse into a disk and planets to coalesce. But eh, I based it on the measured orbital deflection of the LAGEOS II satellite and extrapolated from there, not on first-class sources (which would be the GR equations first derived by Lense and Thirring). </p></div>		</li>

<p>One thing I've been curious about.  The rings of Saturn, Jupiter, even Uranus, all of their moons and the moons of Mars, even the bulk of the satellites we throw up, they all orbit their primary at a fixed angle to the primary's equator.  Why doesn't our Moon?  Why is its orbit tied at a fixed angle to the ecliptic instead?  What makes our Moon unique in all the Solar System?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently doing a bachelor's in physics with an astrophysics module, so don't take this as the de facto explanation, but off the top of my head:</p>
<p>Moons forming at the same time as their planet are analogous to planets forming around their star, the same conservation of angular momentum argument holds. However, our moon is thought to have been formed by a collision with another large (mars-sized?) body. Different mechanism,  different restrictions. </p></div>		</li>
