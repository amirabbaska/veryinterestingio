			<div class="markdown"><p>I know about sig figs and how to do them, but it really never made much sense to me when you think about it. 5 is 1 sig fig as it could be anything from [4.5 , 5.5), but if we do 4.5x4.5 = 20.25 and 5.5x5.5=30.25, it would make more sense to say the answer is the average, 25.25.  </p>
<p>I get that it's decent for larger sig figs, such as 152489.32 x 1.38264 = 210,837.8334048, the sig figs answer is 210,838, whereas the numbers could be as low as 152489.315x1.382635 (210837.064045) to as high as 152489.325x1.382645 (210838.602765, I know ending in 5 rounds up, but it's a continuous interval, so I cheated a little).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a better way of thinking about significant digits is to consider what the number actually means, not what you would round to get there.  </p>
<p>When a measurement is 5, that means it is 5 plus or minus 1.  When the measurement is 5.0, it is 5.0 plus or minus 0.1. </p>
<p>If you are calculating 5 x 5 = 30, you are saying it is 30 plus or minus 10.  </p>
<p>If you are calculating 5.0 x 5.0, you are saying it is 25 plus or minus 1.  </p>
<p>Example:  Lets say that you need to time someone in the mile run.  All you have with you is a clock that shows the hour and minute.</p>
<p>The run starts at 4:30 and ends at 4:38.  You know then that the mile time is 8 minutes plus or minus one minute.  It would be incorrect to say it is 8 minutes and 0 seconds since you don't technically know that.</p>
<p>Your friend is using his iPhone's stop watch to time the mile run.  This goes to the hundredth of a second.  He times the mile at 7 minutes and 34.12 seconds</p>
<p>Now lets say that you want to know how many seconds it took for the mile run.  </p>
<p>For your measurement, you multiply 8 minutes x 60 seconds in a minute =  480 seconds.  but this has 2 significant figures, not 1.  This implies that the mile time is between 470 and 490 seconds, which is NOT correct (as seen by the iPhone measurement of 454.12 seconds).  You would need to reduce to 1 significant figure, which is 500 seconds.  This means that the mile time is 500 seconds plus or minus 100 seconds, which IS correct.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>No. The significance of trailing zeroes without decimal points can be ambiguous. There are some conventions to indicate significance but context is mostly used to determine it. </p>
<p>5x5=30 without any context is a terrible, terrible example to illustrate significant figures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why would it be +/- 1 and not +/- 0.5? Either way, the average of 16 &amp; 36 is 26, so 30 it's still an overestimation. I'm guessing it just isn't suited for 1-2 sig figs, but higher degrees of accuracy.</p></div>		</li>
