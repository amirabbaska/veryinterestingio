			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, I think looking at the state of the DNA is a misguided way to determine what is and is not a life form. Most people don't regard viruses as life forms, because they are just DNA inside a protein capsid. They are biologically inert outside of a host cell but they do change, evolve, and mutate. They have DNA but are totally non-life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, most viruses that infect us are RNA, not DNA. And, it's not correct to say they're &quot;totally non life&quot;. I mean, it's nonsense but it's also more of a philosophical distinction and still argued. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well during gametogenesis there is a certain degree &quot;crossover&quot; that occur between chromosomes where analogous regions switch places. Therefore a certain chromosome you pass on might be mostly similar to your maternal chromosome of the same number but with certain regions that are from your paternal one. </p>
<p>In addition to switching within the chromosome there's recombinant sorting among chromosomes. So a certain sex cell you produce might have some paternal and maternal chromosomes in it. This is all to keep up genetic diversity, and why you aren't your parents clone. </p>
<p>On top of that there is this whole newer field called epigenetics. This doesn't involve the DNA sequence itself, but changes to the physical structure itself like methylation that change how much a gene is expressed. This is also heritable.</p></div>		</li>
