			<div class="markdown"><p>The density part basically means that for every (continuous) function there is an undifferentiable function that is really really similar to that function. Which is pretty logical if you think about it, because you can find such a function by making your original one really wiggly until it is not differentiable any more.</p>
<p>Also, dense doesn't have to mean large. Take rational numbers: they are dense in the set of all numbers  (you can find one infinitely close to any number), but the amount of rational numbers is infinitely more small than the amount of irrational numbers.</p>
<p>Infinites can be weird like that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well a Brownian motion has paths that are almost everywhere non-differentiable but continuous. </p>
<p>The construction of BMs gives you a procedure to show that almost surely you will never generate a path that has a derivative in at least one point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the lebesgue integral is 0. simply put, lebesgue integration sums the measure of the sets such that f(x)=a for all numbers a. </p>
<p>a very simple example: you have the following bills in USD. 1 5 2 2 5 10 20 10 20 5 1 1.
you want to know how much money you have. riemann integration sums it as 1+5+2+2+5+10+20+10+20+5+1+1 = 82</p>
<p>lebesgue integration sums it as (1)(3)+(2)(2)+(5)(3)+(10)(2)+(20)(2) =82</p>
<p>the function we are integrating here is actually a step function where f(x)=1 on (0,1) , 5 on (1,2), etc. </p>
<p>it is the sum of the value of the function times the measure of the set on which the function takes on that value. </p>
<p>Does this help/make sense?</p>
<p>In general, if a function is riemann integrable then it is lebesgue integral and the integrals are the same. however, if a function is lebesgue integrable, it need not be riemann integrable and the original function we talked about is a counterexample. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is 0. Alternatively, if f is the characteristic function of the irrational numbers (i.e. 1 if x is irrational, 0 otherwise), the Lebesgue integral from 0 to 1 is 1.</p>
<p>The basic idea of Lebesgue integrals is that you can systematically ignore &quot;null sets&quot;. Since the rational numbers are countable, they have Lebesgue measure 0 (there are uncountable sets with measure 0 as well, but every countable set has measure 0), and the values of f on sets of measure 0 don't contribute to the integral.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking you calculate the Lebesgue integral by taking an increasing sequence of functions that approximate f by multiplying a finite number of values by the measure of the sets on which f is between that value and the previous one. Intuitively, if Riemann integration approximates functions with vertical rectangles, Lebesgue integration does so with horizontal ones.</p>
<p>Practically, of f is Riemann integrable than it is Lebesgue integrable and the integrals are the same. If a function is Riemann integrable except on a zero set then it is Lebesgue integrable and the integral is what the Riemann integral would be. Measure theory in general isn't really about practical / computational stuff. It's about finding the completion of spaces of continuous functions and things like that.</p></div>		</li>
