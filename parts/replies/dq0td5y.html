			<div class="markdown"><p>There is likely going to be overlap.  Functional is just about how much you drink, but how well you can adapt you regular life to it.  A bartender is going to be able to get away with drinking more than an air traffic controller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be amazed at how long you can actually keep shit together while drinking very, very heavily. I pickled myself for many years and the thing that usually gave it away to others was the smell - you can't mask it. I always smelled like sweat and rum mixed with stale beer. </p>
<p>I could drink in a few hours what my friends could drink in a week. I thought I was tough. I thought I was a big man. But what I really was, was someone who was so disturbed that he would do anything not to have to face his own thoughts. And for a long time, alcohol worked perfectly. </p>
<p>I got a degree, had a full time job and did what everyone else did, except I was pissed all the time. Not just sometimes, ALL the time - without exception. </p>
<p>But eventually I became belligerent and violent toward others. Lost my job, got caught DUI and ended up basically on the street, before my parents took me back. You know you're fucked, but all you can do is drink even more - until you run out of funds and suffer withdrawals. The withdrawals start within 12 hours or so. It's like every hangover you ever had heaped into one - and then it gets worse. I was very close to being taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>What starts off as harmless fun ends up ruining everything you are and everything around you. And it happens surprisingly quickly.</p></div>		</li>
