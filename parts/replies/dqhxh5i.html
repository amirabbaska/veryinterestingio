			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body feels heat through differences between ambient and core (37C) or ambient and shell/peripheral/surface of skin (&lt;37C) temperature. That's why when you're in a hot shower, the water feels warm in your mouth and not hot. </p>
<p>Room temperature water is 21C, which is lower than 37C that's in your mouth. Because menthol binding to these receptors causes sensitisation (increased reactivity), when that cold water hits your mouth, instead of 10 receptors firing (in reality much more), its more like 50 now (or each of the 10 permit greater electrical activity by allowing it to act for longer). Your brain receives this extra firing as greater sensation of coolness compared to normal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body doesn't feel temperature in the extremities relative to core temperature - hence the common experiment where you warm up one hand and cool down another, then place both into the same bowl of room temperature water and they feel it as different temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible to do damage to your nerves by chewing gum and chugging ice water? I've drank ice water after chewing gum and it starts to hurt really quick. Can you just push through the pain and be fine afterwards? I imagine it would be similar to eating something ridiculously spicy and being fine afterwards.</p></div>		</li>
