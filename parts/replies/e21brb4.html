			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this response, really enjoy the inside industry take on the question. I assumed there was a lot that goes into it from all levels of the process. </p>
<p>For sure assumed that there were unqualified, non motivated, and may not have a passion for the craft; therefor beginning the poor work and it only works it way of the chain of command.</p>
<p>Not that anyone specific is to blame but just wanted an insider view on where it might come from; without even factoring in the the many different types of audio systems and just how to try to make a great product that is also universal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's honestly a big spot for improvement in TV + Film outside of A-list studios. I'm in the Music industry now and it became very apparent how inadequately trained some of our  &quot;good&quot; editors were in terms of audio, while I was in TV, etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s hard to hear but also understand working in fields that I see the same thing just more relevant to some of the work we do, but yes thank you for your view and insight and hopefully it’s working it way to hiring qualified and motivated people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think what your taking away from this is accurate. I'm an editor for Reality TV and while I admit my expertise is mostly in video and I only do a cursory &quot;acceptable&quot; pass on the audio, that only because I'm just getting it approved by the producers. Once my video and temp audio is approved its all sent to an audio expert for a real mix using audio only software that I don't know how to use. The same is true for the color and a lot of the effects. It's all temp and sent to the pros in those fields once my edit is locked.</p>
<p>This has been the case with even the smallest budget shows I've done. Whatever you're hearing in the mix isn't because of some lazy or unprofessional editor. It's intentional and likely mostly due 5.1 being moved down to stereo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup not accurate at all. The editor only works until picture lock and then the project is turned over to the sound designer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they not remix the sound track for dvd, streaming, tv?  Seems that would help the issue but guessing it's a cost thing if they don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel that every movie I’ve watched at home with a Dolby Atmos track has been spot on. Perhaps those able to get the Atmos label are better at making a better audio mix?</p></div>		</li>
