			<div class="markdown"><p>It might not only be about beating increased demand. As much crap as they get, they really are at the forefront of tech companies looking out for (or even caring at all about) the welfare of the employees in their supply chain. And Cobalt mining is nasty and very dangerous.</p>
<p>You can scoff at the notion that Apple would be doing it for the miners in addition to purely business reasons, but before you do, consider this: Apple buying directly from mines/miners is going to shine a huge spotlight on those mines and the conditions of the workers. Apple already knows, surely, that people will point fingers at them and ask how they could allow that in their supply chain (I mean, the conditions for Foxconn employees are luxurious in comparison). So, even if it’s not the <em>primary</em> reason Apple would make a move like this, improving those conditions is probably at the very least being considered as a cost of doing business, and that’s going to be a net positive for the mines and miners they work with.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buying the cobalt mine won't improve miner conditions. Making a ruckus about Apple's indifference to miner suffering may make them improve conditions to better their press.</p>
<p>Corporations are amoral entities. They will never willingly do something unless it improves their profit (unless they're an irrational corporation). We need to change their environment so that their profit goal aligns with our moral goals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If deep sea mining becomes a thing then that won't be an issue. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese_nodule" target="_blank">Manganese Crust</a> which forms in the deep ocean is pretty abundant in cobalt. I think maximum deposition happens around 2000m deep so it won't be easy and the environmental impact on deep sea life might be catastrophic, but SMD in England has <a href="https://www.smd.co.uk/smd-deliver-deep-sea-mining-vehicles/" target="_blank">already built machines</a> to do it and will start testing it out soon if they haven't already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I first read about deep sea manganese nodules and their high profitability were they be mined... back in the late 80s. So far I haven't seen any progress on that field, and somehow I doubt it will happen in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>Which is pretty baffling considering how people are now talking about mining asteroids but absolutely nobody is considering those pellets of valuable ore just sitting down there.</p></div>		</li>
