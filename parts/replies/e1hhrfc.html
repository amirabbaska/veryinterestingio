			<div class="markdown"><p>Hormones, kind of like menopause gives hot flashes, and more body fat (and there's stuff like increased blood volume that might have an effect, although that one definitely goes away after the larval human hatches). Not sure how your wife did on the body mass during and after the pregnancy, but I do believe that hormones can absolutely be out of whack for a while, especially with extended nursing. With my pregnancies I had two really awesome effects that were like a glimpse into a different life: not being cold, and not being sick all the time (second pregnancy did leave me with asthma). I had annoying night sweats for quite a while afterwards. Now that the gained weight (and then some) is gone, and the hormones aren't crazy, I'm back to sick and cold all the fucking time, and I could probably lend my services as a beer cooler because I have ice blocks for hands.</p>
<p>One of the things that people who lose a lot weight notice, how they feel cold a lot more (another is how sitting on hard chairs becomes a lot more uncomfortable). Anecdotally I notice that my skinny af husband is cold like I am a lot, and my rather larger dudefriends are always overheating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that comes from the property of fat. It keeps you warm like a cosy underskin blanket. A friend of mine is obese but safes 200 bucks each winter on clothes. Cos even at - 20 degrees Celsius he still only needs a pullover and 3/4 pants.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean that she expressed feeling cold more often, or that she was physically cold to the touch? Where did you touch her? Her arms? Her head? Her belly?</p>
<p>If pregnancy caused her body to pull more heat into her torso and left less for her extremities, you should expect her arms and legs to be colder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically during a woman’s cycle, after she ovulates her body releases the hormone progesterone and it causes her body temperature to spike. Temperature tends to drop once menstruation begins. But if she gets pregnant, her body temperature remains high throughout the pregnancy.</p>
<p>No idea why she’s still warmer six years later, though. Like another user said, it could be her hormones were out of whack, or she gained more body fat.</p></div>		</li>
