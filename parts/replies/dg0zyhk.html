			<div class="markdown"><p>This is X linked traits, which is kinda different than codominance, which is why traits from both parents show up. The fact that calico cats' colour is X linked isn't relevant to the mixing of the colors, because there are two forms of the X gene where both are dominant. For example X^B and X^R where X^B is for black fur and X^R for red fur. When a cat's genotype is X^B X^R it results in a calico cat. If it has a Y chromosome, making it a male, it cannot have this combination. But the fact that it is an X linked trait only leads to the fact that the cat's always female, not the fact that it shows both parent's traits. Its because X^B and X^R are both dominant (shown by capital B and R) that they both appear in the offspring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The X-linkage is key to the patchiness. In some cell lines, the female's maternal X becomes inactivated, in other cell lines, the female's paternal X becomes inactivated. This leads to the distinct patches of different colour. It is only the X's that are inactivated in this way, not the autosomes, because it is a specific dosage compensation adaptation. (Interestingly, in fruit flies, the same dosage problem is instead solved by the male's one X being transcribed at twice the normal rate.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is due to the two dominant but different X traits, not because of an X-linked trait. The inactivated chromosomes are irrelevant because they're still used in development, it's just shut off after all the traits are defined, all the cells still follow the instructions from both chromosomes. The reason there are patches are because of the two different dominant X chromosome's alleles, which, when are both in the genotype, cause codominance. I suggest you do a bit more research first.</p></div>		</li>
