			<div class="markdown"><p>Spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, but they don't use it to contract.  To put it another way, the 'power stroke' against the ground is muscle-powered</p>
<p>Edit: I should also say that insects DO in fact use hydraulic pressure in their bodies, just not for movement.  Without a proper circulatory system as we think of it, insects often use &quot;pumping&quot; of their abdomen to shift around their hemolymph, to help circulate nutrients or cool the body.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which means that as they dry out, the extensor muscles tighten, and are the only remaining force on the leg joints. This causes the typical strong curve toward the bottom of the spider that you see in dead spider legs. </p>
<p>Also, caterpillars do use hydraulic pressure for movement, if I'm recalling correctly, but they're definitely an exception. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can someone explain (or link) this hydraulic pressure system? Never though about animals using hydraulic means for power.</p>
<p>Do humans have any hydraulic pressure systems, being 70-ish% water?</p></div>		</li>
