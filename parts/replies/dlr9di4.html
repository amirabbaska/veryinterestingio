			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of reflexes too. If you touch something hot or sharp, your body's reflex is to pull away the hurt hand and push away the object with the other. </p>
<p>Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, I'll reference my text book later. </p>
<p>Edit: Checked my book. <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/P559z" target="_blank">Reciprocal inhibition </a> is a feature of the withdrawal reflex. In the picture, the flexor muscles (biceps) pull the injured arm away while the extensor muscles (tricep) EXTEND and move your other hand to combat the pin. </p>
<p>Followed up cuz nobody understood
EDIT again for source
From the text book &quot;Exercise Physiology&quot; 8th ed. By Powers and Howley </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure if rubbing is a reflex or learned behavior.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose this also explains why bandages or clothing can lessen the sensation of pain, even for something as small as a mosquito bite.</p>
<p>As for the evolutionary why, can we speculate that touching the spot protects it? The presence of these fibers is not obvious after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain exists to inform us that something is harming us or will harm us, right? So I would imagine that if we are actively acknowledging that pain by rubbing it (or something equivalent), it would be evolutionarily advantageous to dull that pain (albeit maybe slightly) in order for us to more easily deal with it. Pure speculation on my part, though.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a self-referential argument. If less pain by itself would have been evolutionarily advantageous, why not have less of it in the first place? I think there are some corollary benefits to touching the spot of pain, such as potentially removing the source of pain. This can be shooing away a small animal, dislodging an object, or just providing more tissue to distribute or &quot;soak up&quot; the damage (damage from either physical pressure or extreme heat would be mitigated by this).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say beta fibers evolved as a way to encourage touching, and thus protecting, wounds. More likely they became prevalent because those with them had a superior touch sense and helped in natural selection some way. </p>
<p>I'm gonna &quot;not science&quot; and say someone missing those fibers might have a different sensation in regards to sex. Which could lead to less offspring etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read in some spy fiction thriller how secret agents / special ops are trained to overcome this instinctive response and instead grab for their weapon when they get hurt. Sounded pretty cool to me, but I wonder if you know if that's true?</p></div>		</li>
