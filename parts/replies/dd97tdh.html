			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for this answer! I'm guessing that's why housefires and breathing in smoke are so dangerous then. Once again thank you. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, breathing in smoke causes another severe issue, especially in housefires. Fire needs oxigen, which makes the smoke a CO instead of CO2. CO or carbon monoxide can cause poisoning, it can be fatal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firefighter here, also the other products of combustion are hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen disulfide among other things which are toxic. Exposure to products of combustion and soot either in the airways, neck, skin, etc. repeatedly over long periods of time are why we run higher risks of lung cancer, throat cancer, skin cancer, stomach cancer, and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why we are becoming so proactive about limiting exposure and wearing breathing apparatus during foreground operations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon monoxide overrides the oxygen in your lungs. You don't get a poisoning, you suffocate since your lungs are filled with CO which wont get easily replaced by pure oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Asbestos can cause fibrosis and mesothelioma by irritating and scarring the lung tissue. Nano carbon tubes can actually pierce cells and damage the DNA.</p>
<p>So far the long term health risks with carbon tubes are still unknown, but a lot of early research suggests there are exposure risks.</p></div>		</li>
