			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, human perception of time can also be altered with changing light cycles. Living in places near the pole, like Alaska, where the day or night can be 20 hours long depending on season really messed with people's sense of time passing. Similarly, people kept in dark environments will eventually lose track of time as well. We're not quite as easy to manipulate, but light and dark play a huge role in our sense of time passing. </p>
<p>The other thing we're seeing is that electronics keep humans awake because to our brain blue light means daytime which suppresses melatonin production. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All good points, I should probably have said it in terms of ease. A coyote, for example, can be convinced it's nighttime by just putting it in darkness. No waiting, no extended exposure. The world goes dark, coyote thinks it's night and gets active. Whereas you turn the lights on, and it'll return to it's hiding spot, figuring it's daytime. </p>
<p>Humans can also alter their circadian rhythm (fairly sure that's the one) to control their sleep patterns, whereas animals aren't aware or may not have this rhythm, and sleep when it's nighttime or efficient (in the case of cats and some other species).</p>
<p>I believe humans are also able to adapt to changing light easier, as you can grow accustomed to the light cycles in remote places like Alaska. Placing an animal used to one day/night cycle into another will confuse it, and possibly lead to it's death by not knowing food sources, hide spots, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting!  </p>
<p>Humans may not be as directly susceptible to changes in light because we can consciously override the urge to sleep, but light still does play an important role.  For example, there's a growing body of evidence that the light emitted by certain electronics like tablets and laptops is similar enough to early morning light, and causes one to stay awake.  There's programs like F.Lux which will adjust your color temperature at sunset to remove some of that light.  </p></div>		</li>
