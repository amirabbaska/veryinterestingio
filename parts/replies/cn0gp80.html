			<p>I wrote an article at Salon with my<a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/05/04/how_the_rich_stole_our_money_and_made_us_think_they_were_doing_us_a_favor/" target="_blank"> answer to this question</a>. Here's a snippet:<br><br>Simply put, starting in the 1980s policymaking elites in the Western world were scared to death of oil shortages, inflationary spirals and the impact of jobs being shipped to lower-wage nations or made obsolete by increasingly powerful machines and computers. Something had to be done. Even as foreign policy became explicitly focused on securing access to oil, domestic policy became focused on quashing inflation while disguising wage stagnation. Either countries needed to move sharply to the left through increased worker protections and redistribution of incomes, or to the right by substituting an asset-based economy for the old wage-based economy. Most chose to go right — an understandable move at the time given that state Communism was still a threat to capitalist economies, but also a spent and discredited ideology. Ronald Reagan best made the case for the new economic model in a speech from 1975: <br><br>Roughly 94 percent of the people in capitalist America make their living from wage or salary. Only 6 percent are true capitalists in the sense of deriving income from ownership of the means of production …We can win the argument once and for all by simply making more of our people Capitalists.<br><br>One of the chief ways that American and British policymakers put this vision into reality was by crippling organized labor. But while that certainly placed downward pressure on wages in the U.S. and Britain, labor was not so similarly affected in most of the rest of the developed world. Organized labor remains a powerful force throughout most of Europe, yet growing wealth inequality and a declining middle class are present trends there as well. The health of organized labor abroad has helped stem the tide, but has not managed to stop it. The less noticed but potentially more consequential way that policymakers across the industrialized world set about accomplishing this goal was to push their middle classes to invest their wealth into assets, especially stocks and real estate, then use the levers of public policy to inflate the values of those assets in order to disguise the inevitable declines in wages. There was also a concerted effort to hide wage losses by lowering the prices of non-perishable goods — even if doing so meant domestic job losses. These goals were accomplished in several ways:<br><br>1) Push people away from defined-benefit pensions and into stocks and 401(k)s. Believe it or not, there used to be a time when the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indices were little-noticed figures in the business section of the newspaper. That’s because most people’s retirements weren’t tied to the stock market. The switch from pensions to market-based 401(k)s helped change all that. Moving employees into 401(k)s did more than just reduce the obligated burden on corporate bottom lines. It also helped goose the growth of the financial sector upon which the ultra-wealthy depend for their passive incomes. This was not an accident. Combined with the Reagan-era excesses and the explosion of the tech bubble, suddenly Wall Street was hot popular culture, and the nation watched breathlessly as the health of the Dow Jones was commonly equated with the health of the overall economy. The share of GDP taken by the financial sector grew from 2.8 percent in 1950 to 8.4 percent and rising as of 2006, and financial sector profits account for nearly a third of all corporate profits in America. As a broader sector of Americans watched their meager stock portfolios rise, they weren’t as concerned with the slow growth of their regular wages. Only lately has the damage done to retirement security by moving from defined benefits to uncertain stock markets started to become more widely known.<br><br>2) Push more people into buying real estate, and increase home prices by all means possible. Rates of homeownership increased most dramatically in the 1940s to 1960s, creating the first major bump in housing prices. However, the period between 1960 and 1975 saw home prices decline slightly when adjusted for inflation. The government used the levers of public policy to encourage greater homeownership and reduce interest rates. Big business and wealthy interests pushed through Wall Street deregulation during the Reagan and Clinton eras, which not only boosted the stock market but also allowed large banks to make unprecedented money off of home loans. The end result was that wealthy landlords and asset owners got much richer while rents increased and wages declined, but most Americans didn’t feel the pinch because rising home values made them feel rich on paper until the Great Recession. After the financial crisis, policymakers have done everything in their power to boost both stock and home prices through quantitative easing, 0 percent interest rates, and increased homeowner incentive programs. <br><br>3) Democratize consumer debt, especially through credit cards. Americans born after 1975 don’t remember a world before the widespread use of credit cards. But it used to be that if a regular member of the public couldn’t pay his or her bills, debt wasn’t usually an option.  But that wasn’t usually a huge problem, either: Because jobs were plentiful and wages had more buying power against the cost of living, most Americans didn’t need credit cards. Revolving credit used to be the province of capitalists, not of wage earners. <br><br>Though Diner’s Club cards originated in the 1950s, the charge cards as we know them today were truly born and popularized in the mid-1970s and early 1980s – not coincidentally the same time as Wall Street deregulation, 401(k) transitions and the birth pangs of the real estate boom. The boom in popular credit had two major effects: to enrich the same financial services companies whose success disproportionately benefits the wealthy, and to disguise and soften the effects of stagnant wages. <br><br>4) Reduce the cost of goods through free trade policies. The same decades that produced the previous trends also saw the implementation of free trade agreements like NAFTA. It is commonly understood today that these treaties benefit wealthy stockholders while reducing jobs in developed nations. But their less-discussed effect was also to reduce the price of many consumer goods made overseas, which in turn helped to disguise wage stagnation. <br><br>All of these moves toward increasing the value of assets do directly benefit the wealthy. But more important, they have served to create a more purely capitalist society, hide the decline of the middle class and mitigate public discontent over stagnant wages. There are many problems with this, of course. The first is that the vast preponderance of wealth will accrue to the very top incomes in an economy where assets inflate while wages deflate. The second is that a purely asset-based economy is bubble-prone, deeply unstable and given to sharp and painful boom-bust cycles. The story of the last half-decade is in part the removal of the blindfold that has been hiding wage losses over the last half-century. Housing prices have skyrocketed beyond the ability of most people under 40 to afford, even as household debt nears record highs. Nearly half of Americans have no retirement savings at all, while much of the rest of the developed world faces a pension obligation crisis. <br><br>The tools policymakers have used to distract the public from the raw deal of low wages are no longer working. And that may more than anything else help usher in a new era of populist progressivism in the U.S. — if, that is, the Democratic Party can shift itself away from reinforcing the asset-based economy toward rebuilding a sustainable model that encourages wage growth and a strong labor market.</p>		</li>

			<p>basically, when countries either can't compete with foreign labor, or fear inflation that comes with rising wages, or get corrupted by wealthy corporations--or some combination of all of these--they start to substitute making people feel rich by increasing the value of assets, instead of actually being rich by increasing wages. Elites don't want a previously prosperous middle class to feel poorer not only out of good will, but also because that's how revolutions happen. So they have to disguise the decline of the middle class, or try to compensate for it.<br><br>Assets include things you buy and hold onto like stocks or houses.<br><br>The problem is that most people don't have assets--or not enough assets to compensate for their stagnant wages. Also, sometimes assets crash.<br><br>Since part of the challenge is that globalization made 3rd world labor much cheaper than labor in industrialized democracies, one way to disguise wage stagnation was to make a lot of products cheaper. <br><br>Finally, you add personal debt into the mix to allow people to float by in a way they couldn't before.<br><br>So maybe you're a baby boomer who works longer hours now at a crappier job and you get paid overtime anymore, but that's OK: you bought a house and it tripled in value, and you bought into mutual funds at Dow 11,000 and now the Dow is at 17,000, and hey that flashy new flat screen TV made in China is super cheap, and if you can't make ends meet that's OK just throw it on the credit card.<br><br>Thing is, that worked for the boomers, mostly. But now you're in a situation where Millennials can't afford the homes that floated the boomers against their stagnant wages, the stock market is gonna tank eventually, tuitions are astronomical, and the wage/job market stinks. Meanwhile, the Fed is doing everything it can to keep the stock and housing markets roaring because what else are they gonna do?<br><br>So Millennials are screwed, and we have a divided congress where even trying to get people healthcare subsidies with private insurance is considered a socialist plot--to say nothing of, say, debt reform or student loan forgiveness or rent control or affordable housing or higher taxes on wall street.</p>		</li>

			<p>Excellent book. Have read most of it, not the whole thing.<br><br>His main point is not quite the same, but it's related: the accumulation of capital naturally exceeds the rate of growth, and the period from 1940 to 1975 was an aberration against that trend caused by unique post-war factors. And that ultimately capitalism is facing crises on multiple fronts.<br><br>His analysis is spot-on. And it's not just capital accumulation. Climate change and other environmental issues also present challenges to the existing order.</p>		</li>

			<p>From the thirties to the late 1960's, increases in productivity moved parallel with wage increases.  But in the 1980s, for some reason, wages flattened out, while GDP continued to rise. So while GDP has roughly tripled since 1970, the portion of the national income going to wages has remained at 1970s levels.  <br><br>It's worth considering what happens when productivity improves.  Lower costs will lead to higher profits, which of course first arrive in the accounts of the owners of the business. Where does that money then go?  The owners keep it, of course. Even if total income is increasing through productivity gains, the owners of a business are under no obligation to share that increase with anyone.  <br><br>And why would they?  <br><br>From a eagle's view, it would seem pretty obvious.  Owners of businesses are first in line to keep any money that comes their way.  Why should they be expected to share the proceeds of increased productivity?  Out of the goodness of their hearts?<br><br>It seems that the period when wages rose along with productivity was  a historical accident.  Unions, for a while, gave workers the power to extract some of the proceeds of productivity from owners.  But owners took steps to correct this through the political process, and have been highly successful in eliminating unions.<br><br>There is every reason to expect that the share of national income that does not go to capital will continue to fall.  Looking at the very long term, aside from that brief period ending in 1970, this seems like the natural order of things.<br><br>An ELI5 way of explaining it would be to say that business owners will continue to keep as much of their money as they can.  Without unions, they can.  And who would expect them to behave any other way?<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Theres a downside of unions too of course, leveraging their power to demand more and more money/benefits/protection for poor workers until the company is uncompetitive/not profitable/has to be propped up by subsidies. The balance of who gets the profits seems to go one way or the other...sounds crappy, but when it goes to the employers, the company sticks around, when it goes to the union, it goes the way of the dodo.</p>		</li>

			<p>correct. Though I would hasten to add that most countries with strong labor unions have still been ravaged by rampant growth in inequality. Hobbling of labor is certainly a factor, but it's not the only thing.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, that depends on who you ask. Globalization and technology haven't helped, to be sure. A globalized economy means wages are competing with China and India, and better technology means many sectors of job - especially in manufacturing - simply no longer exist. People live longer and retire older, and thus take up space in the job market for a longer period.<br><br>There was also artificial boosting going on in the 50s and 60s courtesy of the G.I. bill, which allowed many veterans to go to college essentially for free.</p>		</li>

			<p>Also, globalization leads to innovation. The U.S. used to innovate on a disruptive scale on a cycle that would facilitate entry into the workforce of Americans at several skill levels by the time said innovation was fully integrated into the economy. As we further innovate, it takes more time between cycles unless we are augmenting the speed of this cycle in some fashion (say, recruiting intelligent minds globally to educate themselves here, THEN ALLOWING THEM TO STAY and develop their innovations here).  This keeps America a more desirable place to be and should theoretically lead to a more fully employed labor force. <br>Oh, and undergrads like shiny objects, so universities have inflated tuition add more gleam... </p>		</li>
