			<p>I wrote an article at Salon with my<a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/05/04/how_the_rich_stole_our_money_and_made_us_think_they_were_doing_us_a_favor/" target="_blank"> answer to this question</a>. Here's a snippet:<br><br>Simply put, starting in the 1980s policymaking elites in the Western world were scared to death of oil shortages, inflationary spirals and the impact of jobs being shipped to lower-wage nations or made obsolete by increasingly powerful machines and computers. Something had to be done. Even as foreign policy became explicitly focused on securing access to oil, domestic policy became focused on quashing inflation while disguising wage stagnation. Either countries needed to move sharply to the left through increased worker protections and redistribution of incomes, or to the right by substituting an asset-based economy for the old wage-based economy. Most chose to go right — an understandable move at the time given that state Communism was still a threat to capitalist economies, but also a spent and discredited ideology. Ronald Reagan best made the case for the new economic model in a speech from 1975: <br><br>Roughly 94 percent of the people in capitalist America make their living from wage or salary. Only 6 percent are true capitalists in the sense of deriving income from ownership of the means of production …We can win the argument once and for all by simply making more of our people Capitalists.<br><br>One of the chief ways that American and British policymakers put this vision into reality was by crippling organized labor. But while that certainly placed downward pressure on wages in the U.S. and Britain, labor was not so similarly affected in most of the rest of the developed world. Organized labor remains a powerful force throughout most of Europe, yet growing wealth inequality and a declining middle class are present trends there as well. The health of organized labor abroad has helped stem the tide, but has not managed to stop it. The less noticed but potentially more consequential way that policymakers across the industrialized world set about accomplishing this goal was to push their middle classes to invest their wealth into assets, especially stocks and real estate, then use the levers of public policy to inflate the values of those assets in order to disguise the inevitable declines in wages. There was also a concerted effort to hide wage losses by lowering the prices of non-perishable goods — even if doing so meant domestic job losses. These goals were accomplished in several ways:<br><br>1) Push people away from defined-benefit pensions and into stocks and 401(k)s. Believe it or not, there used to be a time when the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indices were little-noticed figures in the business section of the newspaper. That’s because most people’s retirements weren’t tied to the stock market. The switch from pensions to market-based 401(k)s helped change all that. Moving employees into 401(k)s did more than just reduce the obligated burden on corporate bottom lines. It also helped goose the growth of the financial sector upon which the ultra-wealthy depend for their passive incomes. This was not an accident. Combined with the Reagan-era excesses and the explosion of the tech bubble, suddenly Wall Street was hot popular culture, and the nation watched breathlessly as the health of the Dow Jones was commonly equated with the health of the overall economy. The share of GDP taken by the financial sector grew from 2.8 percent in 1950 to 8.4 percent and rising as of 2006, and financial sector profits account for nearly a third of all corporate profits in America. As a broader sector of Americans watched their meager stock portfolios rise, they weren’t as concerned with the slow growth of their regular wages. Only lately has the damage done to retirement security by moving from defined benefits to uncertain stock markets started to become more widely known.<br><br>2) Push more people into buying real estate, and increase home prices by all means possible. Rates of homeownership increased most dramatically in the 1940s to 1960s, creating the first major bump in housing prices. However, the period between 1960 and 1975 saw home prices decline slightly when adjusted for inflation. The government used the levers of public policy to encourage greater homeownership and reduce interest rates. Big business and wealthy interests pushed through Wall Street deregulation during the Reagan and Clinton eras, which not only boosted the stock market but also allowed large banks to make unprecedented money off of home loans. The end result was that wealthy landlords and asset owners got much richer while rents increased and wages declined, but most Americans didn’t feel the pinch because rising home values made them feel rich on paper until the Great Recession. After the financial crisis, policymakers have done everything in their power to boost both stock and home prices through quantitative easing, 0 percent interest rates, and increased homeowner incentive programs. <br><br>3) Democratize consumer debt, especially through credit cards. Americans born after 1975 don’t remember a world before the widespread use of credit cards. But it used to be that if a regular member of the public couldn’t pay his or her bills, debt wasn’t usually an option.  But that wasn’t usually a huge problem, either: Because jobs were plentiful and wages had more buying power against the cost of living, most Americans didn’t need credit cards. Revolving credit used to be the province of capitalists, not of wage earners. <br><br>Though Diner’s Club cards originated in the 1950s, the charge cards as we know them today were truly born and popularized in the mid-1970s and early 1980s – not coincidentally the same time as Wall Street deregulation, 401(k) transitions and the birth pangs of the real estate boom. The boom in popular credit had two major effects: to enrich the same financial services companies whose success disproportionately benefits the wealthy, and to disguise and soften the effects of stagnant wages. <br><br>4) Reduce the cost of goods through free trade policies. The same decades that produced the previous trends also saw the implementation of free trade agreements like NAFTA. It is commonly understood today that these treaties benefit wealthy stockholders while reducing jobs in developed nations. But their less-discussed effect was also to reduce the price of many consumer goods made overseas, which in turn helped to disguise wage stagnation. <br><br>All of these moves toward increasing the value of assets do directly benefit the wealthy. But more important, they have served to create a more purely capitalist society, hide the decline of the middle class and mitigate public discontent over stagnant wages. There are many problems with this, of course. The first is that the vast preponderance of wealth will accrue to the very top incomes in an economy where assets inflate while wages deflate. The second is that a purely asset-based economy is bubble-prone, deeply unstable and given to sharp and painful boom-bust cycles. The story of the last half-decade is in part the removal of the blindfold that has been hiding wage losses over the last half-century. Housing prices have skyrocketed beyond the ability of most people under 40 to afford, even as household debt nears record highs. Nearly half of Americans have no retirement savings at all, while much of the rest of the developed world faces a pension obligation crisis. <br><br>The tools policymakers have used to distract the public from the raw deal of low wages are no longer working. And that may more than anything else help usher in a new era of populist progressivism in the U.S. — if, that is, the Democratic Party can shift itself away from reinforcing the asset-based economy toward rebuilding a sustainable model that encourages wage growth and a strong labor market.</p>		</li>

			<p>basically, when countries either can't compete with foreign labor, or fear inflation that comes with rising wages, or get corrupted by wealthy corporations--or some combination of all of these--they start to substitute making people feel rich by increasing the value of assets, instead of actually being rich by increasing wages. Elites don't want a previously prosperous middle class to feel poorer not only out of good will, but also because that's how revolutions happen. So they have to disguise the decline of the middle class, or try to compensate for it.<br><br>Assets include things you buy and hold onto like stocks or houses.<br><br>The problem is that most people don't have assets--or not enough assets to compensate for their stagnant wages. Also, sometimes assets crash.<br><br>Since part of the challenge is that globalization made 3rd world labor much cheaper than labor in industrialized democracies, one way to disguise wage stagnation was to make a lot of products cheaper. <br><br>Finally, you add personal debt into the mix to allow people to float by in a way they couldn't before.<br><br>So maybe you're a baby boomer who works longer hours now at a crappier job and you get paid overtime anymore, but that's OK: you bought a house and it tripled in value, and you bought into mutual funds at Dow 11,000 and now the Dow is at 17,000, and hey that flashy new flat screen TV made in China is super cheap, and if you can't make ends meet that's OK just throw it on the credit card.<br><br>Thing is, that worked for the boomers, mostly. But now you're in a situation where Millennials can't afford the homes that floated the boomers against their stagnant wages, the stock market is gonna tank eventually, tuitions are astronomical, and the wage/job market stinks. Meanwhile, the Fed is doing everything it can to keep the stock and housing markets roaring because what else are they gonna do?<br><br>So Millennials are screwed, and we have a divided congress where even trying to get people healthcare subsidies with private insurance is considered a socialist plot--to say nothing of, say, debt reform or student loan forgiveness or rent control or affordable housing or higher taxes on wall street.</p>		</li>

			<p>Excellent book. Have read most of it, not the whole thing.<br><br>His main point is not quite the same, but it's related: the accumulation of capital naturally exceeds the rate of growth, and the period from 1940 to 1975 was an aberration against that trend caused by unique post-war factors. And that ultimately capitalism is facing crises on multiple fronts.<br><br>His analysis is spot-on. And it's not just capital accumulation. Climate change and other environmental issues also present challenges to the existing order.</p>		</li>

			<p>This all retrospectively makes sense, but as interesting as it is to read, it sounds vaguely conspiracy-theory-ish; it seems like all of this would have required large scale organisation to implement so effectively. Is there open evidence of legislation or policy being implemented that enabled those 4 goals to be achieved? E.g.

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dorestes" target="_blank">dorestes</a>
			<p>It's no conspiracy, it's just policymakers taking the easy way out.<br><br>It's a lot harder to fight multinational corporations and try to implement international solutions to these very difficult problems that sometimes challenge the sustainability of capitalism itself, than it is to do what the big money wants by implementing credit relaxation, free trade agreements, and policies designed to boost housing and stocks.<br><br>To stop that natural downhill flow you need a really strong populist movement, and that hasn't existed on the economic left for quite a while in most industrialized democracies.</p>		</li>

Unless you've paid off your mortgage you don't own your house similarly if you buy a car or t.v. on credit you don't actually own them and they have a negative net worth to you, you bought it with credit and owe that money back with interest. You have things (and, strangely, the ability to buy things) but no real money.<br><br>I feel /u/dorestes phrasing is off though, it's simpler to say &quot;the American labour market went from a wage based model to one based off credit and being tied to financial derivatives.&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>a lot of different possibilities, but they all start with breaking the power of Wall Street. It's a complex problem, because so many mutual funds and retirement packages and what not are all invested in the stock market. So in a perverted sense, if you increase wages while decreasing the bottom lines of companies, stocks go down and then pension funds and 401Ks get hurt.<br><br>That said, you have to do it. You also have to create liveable housing. Now, maybe bringing house prices down causes too much economic damage. But then you really need rent control and affordable housing in a big way. And you have to punish companies that outsource jobs. <br><br>Another thing would be a half-penny tax on each stock transaction. That would discourage a lot of the front-running on the market and rampant speculation, and encourage more long-term and growth-driven investing.<br><br>Also, of course, increasing the power of labor in the market, including organized labor. And increasing taxes on the ridiculously wealthy to discourage what essentially amounts to wealth hoarding by the rich.</p>		</li>

			<p>By half-penny, do you mean a tax of .5%, or a flat tax of 0.005 dollars per transaction? I do like the idea of discouraging day-trading, but I'm not sure a half-cent per transaction would be enough, given the size of the transactions. Could be completely wrong though.<br><br>I've never quite understood the mentality of the super-rich. At a certain point, additional wealth has absolutely no meaning - you can already have anything you want. I could understand, say, building wealth and then using the appreciation of that asset to accomplish philanthropic goals - but, as you say, wealth hoarding? Just makes no sense to me.</p>		</li>

			<p>Oh my God. I just watched that interview; the woman from the Clinton administration - Laura Tyson - was delusional. She claimed that opening up foreign markets would result in more employment in the US, and would not result in more companies moving their production overseas, because companies move their production overseas due to the trade barriers. She claimed that once the trade barriers were reduced, the companies would move their production back to the USA.<br><br>She said: <br><br>&gt; they choose to produce abroad not to lower their cost, by going to cheaper wage locations, which is what is being suggested here. No, they mostly go abroad in order to sell in foreign markets. And when you say &quot;why are you producing abroad, why not produce in the USA and export to the foreign market, they will say &quot;the foreign market is shut off, the tariffs are too high, the regulations are too high, we get no intellectual property protection abroad.&quot; The Uruguay Round will open up those markets and American producers can stay here, hire American workers, and sell all around the world<br><br>Goldsmith replied by saying &quot;this is just totally contradictory to the facts...&quot;. He was right.<br><br>She seemed to be relying on what business surveys were stating. She did not seem to comprehend the fact that people lie on such surveys.</p>		</li>

			<p>From the thirties to the late 1960's, increases in productivity moved parallel with wage increases.  But in the 1980s, for some reason, wages flattened out, while GDP continued to rise. So while GDP has roughly tripled since 1970, the portion of the national income going to wages has remained at 1970s levels.  <br><br>It's worth considering what happens when productivity improves.  Lower costs will lead to higher profits, which of course first arrive in the accounts of the owners of the business. Where does that money then go?  The owners keep it, of course. Even if total income is increasing through productivity gains, the owners of a business are under no obligation to share that increase with anyone.  <br><br>And why would they?  <br><br>From a eagle's view, it would seem pretty obvious.  Owners of businesses are first in line to keep any money that comes their way.  Why should they be expected to share the proceeds of increased productivity?  Out of the goodness of their hearts?<br><br>It seems that the period when wages rose along with productivity was  a historical accident.  Unions, for a while, gave workers the power to extract some of the proceeds of productivity from owners.  But owners took steps to correct this through the political process, and have been highly successful in eliminating unions.<br><br>There is every reason to expect that the share of national income that does not go to capital will continue to fall.  Looking at the very long term, aside from that brief period ending in 1970, this seems like the natural order of things.<br><br>An ELI5 way of explaining it would be to say that business owners will continue to keep as much of their money as they can.  Without unions, they can.  And who would expect them to behave any other way?<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Theres a downside of unions too of course, leveraging their power to demand more and more money/benefits/protection for poor workers until the company is uncompetitive/not profitable/has to be propped up by subsidies. The balance of who gets the profits seems to go one way or the other...sounds crappy, but when it goes to the employers, the company sticks around, when it goes to the union, it goes the way of the dodo.</p>		</li>

			<p>I generally would agree, but replace &quot;Owners&quot; with corporations, and you are closer to the problem. Corporations are required by law to maximise profits for their shareholders. But they are short-sighted in the sense that they avoid &quot;externalities&quot; like the cost of pollution, road building, schools, hospitals etc even though they depend on them or are affected by environmental damage themselves. </p>		</li>

			<p>They are referring to a fiduciary duty, but it isn't quite as cut and dry as &quot;not maximizing profits is illegal&quot;. A corporation has a legal requirement to act in the shareholder's best interest, and mostly today this is interpreted as maximizing profits. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well, that depends on who you ask. Globalization and technology haven't helped, to be sure. A globalized economy means wages are competing with China and India, and better technology means many sectors of job - especially in manufacturing - simply no longer exist. People live longer and retire older, and thus take up space in the job market for a longer period.<br><br>There was also artificial boosting going on in the 50s and 60s courtesy of the G.I. bill, which allowed many veterans to go to college essentially for free.</p>		</li>

			<p>Also, globalization leads to innovation. The U.S. used to innovate on a disruptive scale on a cycle that would facilitate entry into the workforce of Americans at several skill levels by the time said innovation was fully integrated into the economy. As we further innovate, it takes more time between cycles unless we are augmenting the speed of this cycle in some fashion (say, recruiting intelligent minds globally to educate themselves here, THEN ALLOWING THEM TO STAY and develop their innovations here).  This keeps America a more desirable place to be and should theoretically lead to a more fully employed labor force. <br>Oh, and undergrads like shiny objects, so universities have inflated tuition add more gleam... </p>		</li>

			<p>Globalization and Technology are great for the WORLD economy. The simple fact is that there are two forces driving the difficulty millenials like myself are facing. <br><br>The first is that the United States is losing its glorified place in the World Economy. Following the agreements of the Breton-Woods System (Post WWII) the United States was able to, and this is a crude simplification, trade money for stuff with other countries. When you can trade paper for computer parts and manufactured goods, of course your economy will thrive. <br><br>Secondly, because of the success of the previous generation, promises were made. Social Security &amp; Medicare are sacred cows which will never be cut despite the fact that they were promised during the unrepeatable good times of the Breton-Woods Era. Now we have a government that is going to continue the unsustainable Social Security &amp; Medicare programs while still trying to send everybody to college. Wages cannot keep up with inflation, and millenials end up with thousands in debt they should have never had access to. </p>		</li>

			<p>This is exactly right.  When people on the other side of the world are working for a FRACTION of the pay we make here, everything gets outsourced.

Machines can build most things more cheaply and efficiently than people can, plus they don't form unions, they don't keep hours, and they don't file lawsuits when they break down.<br><br>In short, technology is great.  And yes, these fields open new job opportunities for people willing to work them.  But the ratios are off.  As technology advances, we'll be in diminishing demand.  Our salaries will be slashed as our jobs can be done by automation, or by others telecommuting from countries where making $15 a day is fucking awesome.<br><br>It's time to wake up and realize what we're doing.

			<p>For Joe Shmoe middle class American, 80% of the middle class wealth was in the housing market. When people starting buying houses in 2001 at increasingly bubble prices on the assumption that housing prices would continue to rise 15-23% per year, then the it all went south.

			<p>In terms of the effect on homes, you also have to consider that we're not just competing in the marketplace and industry with ourselves, we're competing with those people who earned during the better years.<br><br>When it comes to very limited resources like land and homes, millenials have to outbid a generation of people who got their degree for $5k in today's dollars and started making $80k-equivalent their first day out of college.<br><br>Those people are still around. They still have their money, they still own the land, they still dominate the market, and they expect to get a return on their investments. Meanwhile millenials are coming in with the average person holding $50k in debt from college and earning $50k a year if they're lucky.<br><br>You end up where the entrenched boomer can't afford to lose money by selling low, but the everyday millennial is just priced right out of the market. They end up taking on even more crushing debt trying to keep up with someone whose earnings are from a different era, or else the land ends up going to a bank who also needs to make a buck, and locks the millennials out by keeping the price steady.<br><br>Eventually I think that things will improve. As land sits on the market and boomers pass away and redistribute their wealth to their heirs (sorry, sounds cold, but their piles of wealth are part of the problem) the prices on land will fall to come into alignment with the average person's ability to pay. The banks that own large chunks of land will have to eat a loss to get it off their books (there's an ongoing cost to sitting on unused land) and assuming things don't get even worse, it will return to a point where most people can afford a home once again.</p>		</li>

			<p>That makes it tough, because when our economy was based more in our own country, you might have to relocate to another state for a good job. Now that we have more of a global economy, global relocation is technically the answer, but that's difficult for obvious reasons. The large cultural differences don't make it easy. For example, you don't want to move to South Africa with your fiance or Girlfriend/Boyfriend. Living together when you're not married is so highly frowned upon down there that my buddy passed on a six figure job he was offered which he'd have to move from the US to South Africa for, because his fiance and him were not yet married and he seriously feared for her life.

			<p>The unions completely dropped the ball on not expanding to white collar jobs. IT especially should be unionized along many sectors, but the industry carefully crafted a strong anti-union frat bro culture to really undermine worker rights and bare minimum standards of labor. Just the fact that 40 hour work weeks are considered paltry says everything. Combined that with the completely illegal wage fixing and blackballing employees cartel by the biggest companies shows that the industry needs some heavy duty labor organization and pushback.</p>		</li>

			<p>Unions are moving and changing to accommodate those changes, albeit a little too late. Lots of unions are merging and we're seeing the rise of international unions to counteract the globalized companies. Even some IT sectors are slowly organizing (here in Canada), which is a good thing. IT workers have been gouged for too long. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;Unions are great if you're in them. They're terrible if you have to work around them.<br><br>Isn't that kind of the point? Unions might seem inefficient when you're trying to maximize productivity or output, but most of their regulations and roadblocks are there to safeguard worker security and ensure a decent quality of life. The very not-unionized video game industry, for example, is notorious for grueling crunch times that consume coders' personal lives and leave them with few benefits or job security when the project is done. A union might protract the development process, but would also improve wages and make hours more reasonable, which would arguably make for better games.</p>		</li>

			<p>I would say that is a larger problem indicative of the system rather that a union only issue.  (I think you would be hard pressed to find a campaign run solely on union contributions as you make it sound)<br><br>If corporations were only allowed to &quot;publicly endorse&quot; politicians I might agree. <br><br>The union is a democratic entity, you as a member have the right to vote, and even run if you so choose. Every member can influence the policy- even more-so than politics. If you don't want your Union contributing politically then seek a change of policy- your union vote most certainly means more than your general election/state votes in that it actually carries weight. <br><br>While you might not agree with everything your union dues go towards, I would bet you are better off because of it. Further, union dues are tax deductible, so it doesn't &quot;cost&quot; you as much as your total dues show. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>It's not just about pensions and benefits, it's about creating a political installation with the resources to politically compete with corporations and private interests on a federal level. It's no coincidence that wages started stagnating and the middle class started shrinking right about the time Reagan started demolishing the country's unions. <br><br>Yes, there have absolutely been issues in the past with unions being used as fronts for organized crime, but I don't think that's any worse than banks like HSBC literally laundering money for drug cartels and Islamist extremists, then being punished with a slap on the wrist and no jail time for any executives. No one can claim the moral high ground here, and claiming that workers shouldn't collectively bargain because of unions being controlled by organized crime is just as absurd as saying corporations shouldn't exist because they break laws. There's a balance of power between the middle class and private wealth that needs to be maintained or else private interests are simply going to take everything from us. Without organized labor, there's nothing to stop them.</p>		</li>

			<p>i wouldn't say it's so much that, but for a good while there american cars weren't competing with foreign cars. it wasn't just a cost issue, they just weren't as good of a product. so why would people pay more for a lesser product?</p>		</li>

			<p>From what I see in my area (South East) people are more concerned with saving a nickle on an item rather than be concerned with quality or jobs.  Somewhere along the way goods became disposable rather than solid built, repairable, maintainable products.  I wonder if the big push for college education over apprenticeship/skilled trades played a roll?  I'm astounded at the number of guys my age (mid 30's) that lack the ability to perform even the most simple mechanical repairs.  I suppose that is an advantage of growing up in a blue collar household.  Beyond that I am all but positive that we did this to ourselves by competing with our neighbors for luxury goods which led to the two-paycheck household becoming a standard.  The &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; lifestyle lends itself to disposable goods since we have to replace everything with bigger and better every year or two.  That coupled with EPA regulations forced a lot of manufacturing overseas which doesn't actually do anything positive for us in the long run.  The pollution is still taking it's toll on the planet.  Sure my lakes are clean and air is clear, but the damage is still being done and will catch up with everybody sooner or later.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I don't care where on earth my goods are made. I care whether people making them live/work in good conditions,  and that the goods are made efficiently. <br><br>For the former,  I don't think I can possibly be informed enough to make sure that this happens.  Government is in a good position to do so,  though,  as they can delegate it: make minimum wage laws apply globally.  Eg: you can't sell a product locally unless <em>everyone</em> in the chain makes at least minimum wage. If you fail to do so, the chain is fined equally and the workers are paid the difference in back wages from the fine. This keeps business local where it makes sense from two sides: first, there is less reason to outsource,  as labour costs at least as much. Second, liability for the chain doesn't cross borders,  so outsourcing 50 percent of your business to another country means you accept the liability for any wage problems. Similar could be put in place for worker safety, though it would have less of a direct / simple thing to check for. <br><br><br><br><br>For the latter, I want things to be cheap. Cheap and efficient are the same thing, if worker conditions are equal everywhere. </p>		</li>

			<p>Not that hard to understand - people care how much they have to pay for something. The less it costs for you, the more you can get. Why would I pay for something thats 10x more expensive but made here when I can get the same thing made in China for 10x less. Thats the mindset.</p>		</li>

			<p>The mindset can change though. Just look at Fair Trade products or the growing demand for local farmers' markets. This is counter-intuitive for global efficiency but people are willing to pay more for these kinds of goods. Consumption isn't limitless volume-wise after all. Just like people pay more for brands (even though it's basically the same as a knock-off save for the logo) the same principle can be applied to sustainability &quot;brands&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>People do care where their goods come from, but for many things there isn't a choice for alternatives. <br><br>Eating ethically produced food is prohibitively expensive for lower income people, and trying to find a modern phone or computer that isn't made under essentially slave labor conditions is nearly impossible.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'd probably be incredibly bored with all that time on my hands. I don't have or want friends because I think a lot of that group activity stuff, meeting for coffee chats, etc. is a lot of wasted time and pointless bullshit. I don't date and don't have any substance-related vices, i.e. smoking, going to bars for alcohol, drugs, even coffee (and no, I'm not a Mormon). Most likely I'd end up just sleeping the extra time because I'd have nothing else to do.<br><br>I was asked this question the other day, what would I do with the money if I won the lottery or a game show prize? I said I honestly couldn't think of anything and would probably just keep enough to live on and give the rest away. I don't really want &quot;stuff,&quot; I don't care about having a boat or going on vacation or anything. I guess I'm really kind of a dull person who would in all honesty have no purpose in life if I didn't have some primary occupation taking up my time. Right now it's school, and I hate being on Christmas break because it's boring; I don't believe in Christmas, have no one to shop for and don't care, and none of my family members even talk to each other anyway, which means there are no real &quot;get-togethers&quot; and I usually just end up on the computer eating PBJ. I have no idea what I'm going to do when I graduate in the summer. Working 20 hours a week would be awful for someone like me, because I'd go stir crazy with boredom.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, but over-regulation and strong unions, which in some cases are true, especially in Europe, are driving businesses away.

			<p>I'll bite. the good times created by pretty much every other great power's economic base getting destroyed in world war 2 gave us lots of excess profits which ended up enshrined in long term labor contracts especially evident in say cars/Detroit. when facts on the ground changed us auto companies/many large companies were competing with much nimbler cheaper operations which legacy costs dragged down on production decreasing market share and sending jobs overseas to cheaper places who also were not hamstrung by old contracts. <br><br>this evil argument of course only gets over regulation and unions as a secondary cause but it seems justified if you want to argue it's why our standards declined more than the should have relative to alt history baseline</p>		</li>

			<p>To be fair, during the 1950s, thousands of children died of poisoning from poorly made products that contained led, thalydamide and other chemicals.  Various large cities were so polluted that their rivers kept catching fire.  Large swaths of our atmosphere were being torn away by noxious gasses, thousands of species of animals were put to the brink of extinction by unregulated pesticide use, billions of gallons of waste was dumped (and still resides) in waterways and aquefers.<br><br>The 1940-1980 period was incurring a huge debt.  But it wasn't financial.  They were trading &quot;cheap goods and limited regulation&quot; for future costs in environmental damage, cleanup, etc.<br><br>There was a culture of &quot;externalizing&quot; costs, whether it was to dump waste into streams and hope that somewhere downstream it would clean itself up, or whether it was to avoid providing health care to workers, knowing that if they got sick/died there would be others to replace them, or any other number of issues.<br><br>Externalizing costs and incurring &quot;structural&quot; debts throughout society like this is not a sustainable policy.<br><br>The only thing that prevents externalizing costs and incurring these structural debts is regulation.   The 1960s may have been less regulated, but it resulted in unmeasurable damage and future costs.<br><br>Numerous studies have shown that in a number of industries for every $1 1960s companies could have spent on simple environmental solutions, we would save $10-$50 today on remediation and/or related costs to health or otherwise.<br><br>However, the time-value of money being what it is, no sane company would spend $1 in 1960 in order to avoid a $50 charge in 2010, ESPECIALLY if that charge were externalized onto all of society.<br><br>In the same vein, financial regulation has a tendency to decrease as there are no &quot;problems&quot;.  It declined after the civil war to a low-water mark in the 1920s, eventually resulting in the crash of 1929 and the great depression, at which point financial regulations were drastically tightened.  These restrictions remained in place until the 1980s and 1990s, when they were gradually removed, resulting in a much less stable economy, and ultimately the crash of 2007.  The response to that crash was to reduce interest rates to 0 and borrow more money, essentially putting fiberglass over the rust to cover it up.  <br><br>Drastically increased regulation of financial markets is a cure, not a disease.<br><br>The lack of regulation is a serious, serious problem of the 1960s, not a benefit.  </p>		</li>

High taxes, strict environmental controls, large government.<br><br>The &quot;ease of doing business&quot; has more to do with the burden placed on creating corporations, etc.  The US mandates that you show 3 forms of ID and requires that file separately in every state where you want to do business, and places the burden on you to determine what kind of business you should use and provides no support for understanding business taxation, and has extremely complex loopholes created over the years, for avoiding and controlling taxes, rebates, credits, etc.<br><br>The video you provided are all things that are cherry picked from specific locations.  It does, however, come from the fracturing of regulations.  In a place like Denmark, all business requirements and restrictions are made by the federal government.  That way there are a lot of restrictions but they are easy to understand, making them rank highly on a &quot;ease of doing business&quot; scale.<br><br>In your example, the #1 most &quot;free&quot; place (Singapore) restricts the sale of GUM like it's cigarettes.  <br><br>the ONLY complaint in that video that you made was that there are a completely fractured mess of restrictions put on by having different rules in different cities, counties, states and regions.<br><br>I could list all of the stuff that this video complains about and point out how almost all of it applies in Denmark or Singapore, which are both on the top of your &quot;freedom&quot; index that you just presented.<br><br>You need a license to do business, a license to sell chewing gum, an invesntory and documents to close a business, a license to operate a truck, a license to drive said truck, annual tax returns, paperwork to approve the sale of a company.<br><br>I don't see any issue here except the nightmarish fracturing of regulations from city to city in the US.<br><br>but I have a hard time with conservatives arguing that the US should start restricting local municipalities from making up regulations (like they do in Denmark and Singapore).<br></p>		</li>

			<p>What has really made globalization a problem for US workers is a strong dollar policy, that is, one dollar buys more in other currencies than it would with a weaker dollar.  This makes US workers more expensive compared to other countries' workers than a weaker dollar policy. In other words, it's a choice by the US govt.<br><br>Note that many workers are protected from competition. These tend to be very highly paid workers, such as doctors and lawyers, who are protected by licensing requirements. Again, a govt policy.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's the best analysis I've seen yet.  The world isn't getting poorer as a whole.  Yes, America seems to be doing worse off, but so many people in so many other countries are doing SO much better.  It is all a product of globalization.  The point about the real estate seems to be especially valid.  Rich foreigners earn their money abroad, yet spend their money in the U.S. on real estate.  The increased cost of housing drives the cost of every other product up within the U.S., but the cheap foreign manufacturing is entirely unaffected, resulting in American goods/services being even more expensive relative to the rest of the world.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;America seems to be doing worse off, but so many people in so many other countries are doing SO much better<br><br>Absolutely, this is such an important point.  It sucks if you're an American and comparing yourself to your parents' economic past, but from a global view, there are literally hundreds of millions of people out there who have been saved from destitution thanks to globalization.  An interesting effect this has had is that it has kept inflation and interest rates in the US low because 1.) cheap foreign manufactured products have made goods cheaper in the US, so lower inflation, and 2.) The USD that China earns from its manufactured goods are reinvested in US securities like US government bonds and stuff like that, which keeps interests rates in the US low.  Low inflation and interest rates mean that nominal interest rates for borrowing in the US are really low - and thus, Americans borrowed a lot of money to buy cars and houses and stuff.  Some say this was a big cause of the housing bubble we saw that led to the financial crisis.  But this is kind of a tangent to this discussion here.  <br><br>&gt; Rich foreigners earn their money abroad, yet spend their money in the U.S. on real estate. <br><br>This effect, while I believe it is a factor, I admit I don't know how big the effect is.  The un-affordability of housing to the new generation could be something more simple than super-rich foreigners buying up stuff.  Perhaps it's just that the baby-boomer generation are sitting on their nice houses and won't sell until they die.  Or it's simply a product of greater population in the US, so obviously, there are less houses to go around.  Others in the thread have proposed the creeping up of consumption (people decades back considered a small, rundown house a perfectly acceptable house, while today, when people think of buying their own house, they end up imagining some gorgeous, multi-bedroom, multi-garage thing or something).  <br><br>I think the effect of exporting &quot;lower-end&quot; jobs and thus depressing American wages is a much bigger effect than the importation of &quot;higher-end&quot; job seekers and rich foreigners buying up real estate.  I'm sure the data is out there (comparing wage growth, and then comparing real estate prices over time - did wage growth slow more than real estate prices picked up?)... </p>		</li>

			<p>You make some excellent points.  I definitely oversimplified with regard to real estate.  The changing technological and job market is certainly stirring thinks up faster than we can address.  Entire professions are quickly disappearing or being replaced.  I admit I don't have the data to perform a real analysis.  For sure though, wage growth can't keep up with increasing housing prices.

			<p>Bzzzt. False. That is the CATO &quot;truthy&quot; explanation for why we can't go back to the 1950's. Sounds plausible, but isn't true. We are exporting far more today than we exported when Europe was rebuilding. We're just importing a ton more. If we shifted that demand to internal producers, we'd be much better off.

			<p>It's a plausible story, but it doesn't play out.<br><br>If we were &quot;supplying the world&quot; due to the demise of Europe, then our exports post-war would be sky-high.

But by 1950, they had dropped to 4%. They were between 4-6% from 1950 to 1972 or so.

			<p>I'm not sure that I understand your point. Your graphs clearly show that U.S. exports have steadily increased (with some hiccups)  since 1929. In this time period, the wealth and population of countries all around the world has increased, so it makes sense that consumption has increased as well. Your second graph shows that both imports and exports in the U.S. have increased since the end of WWII with a big, short spike in exports right after the war. It also shows that since the 1980's imports have exceeded exports. None of these data contradict my point.   <br>It was in the 1980's that we started to see manufacturing come online in a big way in other countries, particularly Japan and Europe, led by Germany. More recently we also have major growth from other economies such as S. Korea and the BRIC countries (although Russia's growth was mainly in fossil fuels, not manufacturing, and they are currently in serious economic trouble). So now there are a lot more people around the world who can make things and a lot more people in the world who can buy things. So, two things have happened: the total amount of goods manufactured worldwide has continued to increase as consumption has increased. But in many of the countries that now have the infrastructure and technology to manufacture goods, the population started out at a much lower standard of living than had been enjoyed by people in the U.S. These are people who were (and, in many cases, still are) willing to work longer hours for less pay.    <br>U.S. consumers demand more and more goods, at lower and lower prices. U.S. manufacturers fuel this demand by making the goods as cheaply as possible. So, they move their factories overseas or outsource from overseas factories, because the costs of transporting the goods are much less than the amount of money they save by paying workers lower wages. This moves U.S. jobs overseas, so U.S. workers have less money to spend. These U.S. workers continue to demand goods, but put more and more downward price pressure on manufacturers, who find even lower-wage countries in which to build stuff. This creates a downward spiral in the U.S.   <br>But, at the same time, an upward spiral is being created elsewhere. In China and India and Brazil workers are making more money than they ever had before, even though they are earning much less per hour than U.S. workers. They are now buying more goods, so demand for goods is rising in their own countries and manufacturers in their own countries can shift some of their work to their own domestic markets. Also, these workers are starting to demand higher wages. Eventually, this process should result in a situation where it is just as expensive to pay foreign workers + ship goods overseas as it would be to manufacture goods here at home. A lot of U.S. companies are starting to get to this point. In addition, they know that having manufacturing facilities overseas has other, hidden costs: time delays, foreign government interference, cultural differences, etc. When this all evens out, it will make sense for U.S. to source more and more of their goods right here at home.     <br>This process, however, will take decades, because for the time being there are lots of places where people are still willing to work for less money than are Americans. If workers in China get too expensive, we can outsource to India, for example. When India gets too expensive, we might start building lots of things in parts of Africa. Some of these countries, such as India and China, have, between them, billions of people. It's going to be a long, long time before all of these people reach a high enough standard of living to demand significant wage hikes.    <br>Another part of the process, unfortunately, is for U.S. standards of living to drop to meet a global average. This is the economic pain that we are starting to feel across the country today. In Detroit, for example, auto assembly line workers who have been hired in recent years earn significantly less in wages and benefits than those hired before union concessions. Working in an auto factory used to provide pay that was good enough for a single individual, usually a man, to support an entire family in middle class style. Those days are long gone!    <br>Of course, there will never be a time when the U.S. manufactures all products for domestic consumption at home simply because of comparative advantage. For a number of factors: weather, availability of raw materials, culture, etc. it will still make sense to manufacture some goods in some places and not in others, even in a hypothetical situation where labor costs, infrastructure and technology were uniform across the globe.   <br>Globalization is complex and very, very slow. The ideal world where wages, technology and infrastructure are roughly equal across the globe is a long way off and probably impossible due to political factors such as wars, limitations in raw materials and energy, and changing technology. The winners in the long term will be the people who stay ahead of the curve in technology and who manage to harness and control new and, most likely, renewable sources of energy. </p>		</li>

			<p>Your point - which echoes the CATO talking point - is that the USA's Golden Era from 1940 to 1970 can never be replicated, because it was only due to Europe's economy being destroyed by war. The implication is that US stepped up and both supplied the rest of the world with goods, and also supplied Europe while they were rebuilding.<br><br>That does appear to have happened - from 1945 to 1950, as US Exports increased. Except that then, they dropped, and stayed low.<br><br>You also imply that the workers from 1945 to 1970 gained their prosperity by doing all this exporting. However we are exporting <strong>much more</strong> now and workers are far less prosperous. <br><br>So the premise - that we did really well while Europe was retooling -- doesn't hold up.<br><br>Unfettered rapid Globalization is a fool's game. Would you sell your job for $1 billion dollars to be distributed evenly across the planet, with me taking 1% of the cut? That would mean that every person would get 17 cents, I'd have $10 million, but you'd be permanently unemployed.  But that's a good trade, isn't it? Because it means there would be $1 billion more in wealth across the globe.<br><br>That is what we have done. We have traded our jobs away for marginal global growth and the enrichment of a few. The Clinton-era promises were lies. Clinton's top economic adviser stated that if only we opened up our markets, our companies would <em>bring the jobs back to the USA, because they only had moved them offshore to compete in those closed markets</em>. She also said that as our companies got more efficient, they would hire more US workers.<br><br>That isn't what happened. Our companies broke out of the USA and became global in nature. They chased the lowest labor, the fewest regulations, the most profit across the globe. In the process they have destroyed our economy. <br><br>If we hadn't gone down this path, true, the globe would have less wealth - but more people would be employed in the USA. Our economy would be stronger, our people would be happier. </p>		</li>

The more power there is to be had the more extreme the consequences of those without. <br><br>My fundamental complaint about this thread and, too often, reddit in general is that too many conflate power through choice vs power through force and those here that make some distinction between corporations and government are deluding themselves by thinking that the power of either derives from anywhere other than the rule of law that is enforced by the judiciary. <br><br>P.S. Robespierre had his head chopped off by the guillotine at the age of 36. Still ready to start off on the &quot;right&quot; side of the revolution??<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Well yeah, lots of innocent people died in the French revolutions. Robespierre was killed because although he spoke for the people he was still of higher class and maintained a luxurious estate. I guess the moral is, if you're gunna pick the right side go all in?</p>		</li>

			<p>The fuck? Religion isn't inconsequential here. The &quot;right&quot; for a dick company like Hobby Lobby or somesuch to deny health coverage for things that they think Jesus finds icky could mean life or death for a lot of people. Not just birth control and abortion, but AIDS treatment. Plenty of Talibangelicals still believe that AIDS is solely a &quot;gay disease&quot; and that if you have it, God has abandoned you and wants you to die. The Hobby Lobby ruling basically gave moron Jesus-freak business owners the right to say sorry, bub, you're a leper and I am not going to pay for your medication because it violates God's will and my right to adhere to God's will -- which is more important than your right to be alive. Sucks for you, homo, because now you're going to hell.<br><br>Religion has way too much pervasive influence in American public life and public policy. Democrats are the ones who <em>have to</em> fight the stupid social issues wars that Republicans, who belong smearing shit on the walls in a mental institution, continue to fan the flames about. They can't concentrate on economic things as long as Republicans are still trying to establish a theocracy. They gave up on the cafeteria Catholics a long time ago and have switched to concentrating on &quot;the base&quot; -- mentally deranged Southern Dominionists who want gays and &quot;loose women&quot; to be crucified, and who <em>demand</em> that we start WW3 in the Middle East because it'll hasten the day when Jesus comes home from college and kicks out the squatters with names like Achmed and Shmuel.<br><br>Don't think for a minute that the rabid Christians have really changed their tune about Jews. They right now are just security guards protecting the Holy Land from dirty Muslims until Jesus comes home. And the only way Jesus comes home is for us to nuke every last Muslim, at which point we can do the same to the Jews (and the Catholics) and voila, welcome home son, we kept the place nice for you.<br><br>Seriously, don't think for a second that religion isn't important in the 'States. Religion is hugely important to 'Muricans and is largely responsible for why we're currently ruled by a party of senile old farts who are certifiably insane.</p>		</li>

			<p>Food stamps are SUCH a pain in the ass. It's not worth it. When I needed them it took about 20 hours in total to register for them. I had no car at the time so I kept having to taking the bus there and back. I got $60/month for 2 months then I got 3 paychecks in one month because it was like the 1st, 15th, 31st. My foodstamps got cancelled and I supposedly owed them $80 for doing something wrong for the way my paychecks got distributed. Never again. Fuck that shit.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, a middle class acts as a buffer point for the poor. Its an achievable economic class. To be rich, there are too many variables that go into it. For middle class, its doable. <br><br>Programs like WICKED and Food Stamps feed the poor.

			<p>Rand Paul is an asshole. Don't forget what he has said over and over again -- including even in a speech at <em>Howard University,</em> of all places -- that government oversight of private business owners' &quot;right to discriminate&quot; should be declared unconstitutional. He has maintained his stance that a business owner should have the right to refuse business to anyone for any reason whatsoever, <em>including if the owner doesn't like the person's race.</em> Anything else is tantamount to socialist interference in the free market and contrary to American principles of individual sovereignty. Or some other crackpot libertarian shit.<br><br>My guess is that it would mean someone has the right to refuse service to Elizabeth Warren because they think she's a &quot;fake Indian.&quot; Just because he's anti-NSA and gave that big speech that a bunch of Hollywood people cheered for doesn't mean he's not a dick.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, actually it was also probably less of an outlier at that point in time - upward class mobility was just more likely before. They had a better social safety net, cheaper higher education costs, essentially guaranteed employment with education, wages even at the minimum that were much higher than ours when adjusting for inflation, and overall higher employment levels with less &quot;just in time&quot; employment at the bottom of the scale. It's no wonder there were so many people who could &quot;pull themselves up by the bootstraps&quot; from 1940-80 (and really through the 90s, compared to now). The government intervened for them. <br><br>And then they quickly forgot about all of those interventions, attributed all their success to personal attributes, and voted to screw our generation over miserably.

			<p>See, I think it's actually possible to work and pay for college on your own right now if you go to non-flagship public university. But I think the problem is that today's college courses are actually a lot more difficult than they used to be. I looked at some of my parents' textbooks and exams from the 1960's and 70's and the subject matter is much less rigorous than it it currently. Now you need to put a lot more time into going to school.<br><br>That and I think you waste more time with transportation and waiting for silly things/checking email, etc than you used to. </p>		</li>

			<p>If you live in the south and happen to be Hispanic and are willing to bust ass all day in the searing heat for $12 to $15 an hour with little to no benefits, then you too can have a job in construction with little to no training. <br><br>I was able to get my unemployed, slightly schizophrenic homeless brother-in-law a job putting up steal building just by asking a building site manager if there was something he could do. I bought him the tools he needed and made sure he got to work every day until we could find him a place to live close enough to work that he could walk there. The company had work trucks to bring him (the only white guy) and 6 to 10 Hispanics to the various job sites. He started out at $11 an hour and is now making $15 after 2 years and has no benefits, but he does have an apartment close to work and enough money to stay alive. He's 50 years old.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Went to college back in 1970's.  Relative to construction or most job wages, cost of college has increased enormously.  But also, fewer people expected to go to college back then.

You deserve a compassionate government that works for the people. It's your job to tear the whole thing down and build it again to be the nation you need and deserve.

People vote against their own interests because they still see America as the &quot;land of opportunity&quot; and believe that those who are currently wealthy must have earned their wealth and should keep it, and/or believe that they themselves will someday be rich and imagine that they're preserving their own future millions.  Either one of those is less likely to be true in the United States than in most other developed countries - we have a lot more inherited wealth and it's much harder to work your way up from the bottom.

			<p>Weirdly enough, one of the things holding back the formation of american aristocracy in the first place was the estate tax.  Since it was established, there has been a 100% deduction against the estate tax for charitable contributions.  (This is how many major private american universities were originally funded - through contributions of the wealthy who didn't want to pay the estate tax.)<br><br>Now, due to propaganda and misunderstandings (Many people hate the &quot;death tax&quot;, even though it only applies to multimillionaires), it's been neutered to the point where any smart person can plan to leave hundreds of millions of dollars to their idiot layabout kids/grandkids/great grandkids.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Aaron Sorkin- who is usually very left-leaning- actually wrote an episode where he strongly criticized the estate tax because it was established to prevent the American aristocracy, but there hasn't been any American aristocracy, so we should get rid of it. Essentially, since it worked to prevent that, we don't need to use it for prevention anymore! It was presented in a slightly less stupid way in the show, but the basic idea remained just as idiotic.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not exactly what Steinbeck said, but it's an eloquent way of stating it.  Not trying to be a stereotypical Redditor, no animus intended, but in case you were curious.<br><br>It probably propagated from a misquote from America &amp; Americans, 1966:<br>&gt;Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: ‘After the revolution even we will have more, won’t we, dear?’ Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property.<br><br>&gt;I guess the trouble was that we didn’t have any self-admitted proletarians. Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist. Maybe the Communists so closely questioned by the investigation committees were a danger to America, but the ones I knew—at least they claimed to be Communists—couldn’t have disrupted a Sunday-school picnic. Besides they were too busy fighting among themselves.</p>		</li>

			<p>So if you can't be a billionaire you don't bother to make a living?  Very few people are super wealthy. It's always been that way. If you work and make good decisions and don't believe the crap about how everything is designed to screw you and keep you down, you can live a comfortable life. <br><br>Saying that the US ranks low in upward mobility is kind of dumb. Of course it ranks low in &quot;upward mobility,&quot; but that's because so many have already moved upward. Guess what!  They won't live forever!  <br><br>I was making $32,000 a year out of college.  After sort of dicking around for a few years because I didn't know what I wanted to do, then spending a few years halfway going to grad school and mostly doing freelance work and staying home with my child, I made a total directional change. Now I make a lot more and love my work. It took a risk and some balls. If I had been listening to people like you, I never would've done it. <br><br>There are a million possibilities.

			<p>Well, I spent years working with kids in that situation, so I know it's not hopeless.  With a high school diploma or a GED, just about anyone can get admission to college or juco. And if they're poor, they can go for free <br>or damn near free.  From there all it takes is some stick-to-it-tiveness. It's still harder because a kid who hasn't had structure and good models of how to function might not know basic things, like how to deal with being on a schedule and meeting deadlines, or how to choose a major, get involved wth activities, and so forth. Most colleges have programs now that help them and hold them accountable if they will go sign up. There are offices on college and even some high school campuses that provide skills assessments, mentoring, etc., and it costs nothing. I'm not saying it's a cure all but there are resources. The biggest problem is that too many people feel defeated before they get to that point, and therefore don't try or don't take advantage of what's out there for them. I refuse to contribute to the lie that they can't live a successful, comfortable life and have some dignity. It's harder for some than others. But very few people-- almost none-- are truly just fucked. </p>		</li>

Got passed over for promotions multiple times (I know because we were applying for the same promotions, and I got passed over as well, I'm on number 3). Had to move to fucking Australia to find any job opportunities in our field. His last day was yesterday :(</p>		</li>

			<p>I agree with you. Its amazing to see how little emphasis the average American places on a good education. Parents don't give a shit. Studious kids are geeks and nerds and get made fun of, while the popular kids are the high school quarterback and his gang. Well guess what happens when graduation day comes around? The high school quarterback and most of his gang go to work at Walmart where ,unfortunately,he most likely will be stuck at for the rest of his life. The nerdy kid that worked his ass off in high school goes on to college and beyond, makes a kick ass salary and is pretty well set for the rest of his life. This once geeky kid will also lay a lot of emphasis on education for his kids, so they don't have to work minimum wage jobs.<br><br>Looks at Asian Americans,even a 100 years earlier they were among the poorest group of people in America. Today,they are easily the highest earning sub-group of people in America. They got there because of the emphasis the parents lay on a good education.<br><br>So folks instead of complaining,we need to start with step no.1 -laying heavy emphasis on early childhood education for our children.<br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>This person speaks the truth. Our culture assumes everyone will go on to higher education, but places no emphasis on it in the home. They just expect their kid to magically find the motivation to succeed, or assume the teachers will inspire them to do so.</p>		</li>

			<p>It seems almost random. Some streamers and Let's players make a decent living watching movies and games and then talking about them. Not wealthy, but better than a lot of graduates. Entertainment wins over utility today. The population is more entitled than ever in being told that what they have and one step above is wealth, and they are owed that psuedo wealth by everyone around them, especially those who are working when they decide they deserve something <em>right now</em>, healthcare,fast food or a tune up. They have people convinced that a big TV manufactured for pennies in China is worth 2 months pay and that it will make you happy, and that being truly wealthy means throwing cash at Bugatti's and mansions. Society is fucking backwards right now overall.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's fucked up how easy it is to slip into such a comfortable routine. I've decided to do online school recently because I noticed myself getting way too comfortable with 'getting by' (not really getting by, as my debts continue to stack up. I don't make enough money at my minimum wage job to make payments, nor even enough for collections to attach my wages). It just gets so intimidating thinking about the near future; my chances of success are pretty dismal, and though it's almost entirely my fault, I'm reminded often that my odds have been quite low from the beginning. Short of massive economic and social reform, I will probably be on HUD and food stamps until me and my shitty ankle both die.</p>		</li>

			<p>Just look at what life has become for most people these days. We live in the most connected and educated society of all time. Yet more than half of the worlds countries are dealing with rampant poverty, ignorance, violence, just general suffering. Theres enough food in the world yet there are people who starve to death. Because everything is about money and politics have been largely overtaken by big powerful entities. They serve mostly the interest of the few. Tax dollars being spent on largely senseless things. Humanity should be a lot better than it is now. I still believe humanity in the future will be past most of today's nonsense. We should be focusing on how to make society better as a whole. It'll happen unless a giant catastrophe occurs. But it'll be long after I'm gone.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is such bullshit. I grew up poor, went to a state college, got my MBA at night while working, and now i do pretty well ￼with about 25K in debt. I was able to start a small company and i have the sane(ish) chance of being successful that anyone else has. Would it have been easier had I been born into vast wealth and connections? Of course. But that hardly makes in the US a plutocracy. That's fucking ridiculous. if you're practical, work hard, and make good decisions early on you can still make a good life for yourself. It's not easy to do without specialized skills, so make a point to acquire specialized skills. You absolutely do not want to be an unskilled worker in a global economy. <br><br>Technological advancements and global competition are squeezing out the middle class. Not oligarchical overlords.<br><br>Edit: I don't know that I'll ever be part of that 1%. But I don't consider that a measure of success.</p>		</li>

			<p>No no no.

People not born into money always stayed put on the ladder, except for the random Bill Gates or Bill Hewlitt which were, are, and remain the exception).<br><br>So why did it seem easier for the middle class to move up in the past versus now?

			<p>&gt; At this point, if you weren't born into money it's not entirely likely that you will ever accumulate wealth<br><br>based ONLY on savings projections for the money i put into my 401k I will have a million dollars when i retire early. This is not including any money that i make from my job or other sources. Right now at age 20 im putting in just under $4000/yr  into my account. I will increase that to $10,000 at 25 until im 35 when i will stop putting money into the account. <br><br>Compound interest is free money that no one takes advantage of.</p>		</li>

Im also not good at managing money. I spent some time once actually setting up my bank account and long term money flow, now i do well by constantly telling myself that im poor even if i have a lot of money on hand so that i dont spend it and put it away instead.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually it happens some time before then, right after the scene where John Cleese is convincing Eric Idle (the mortician chanting &quot;bring out yer dead!&quot;) to take his &quot;almost-dead&quot; father.

			<p>No, you want freedom for racist restauranteurs to have the right to not serve black people. The freedom not to have to pay for people's expensive AIDS medications through health insurance, because <em>durr AIDS is a gay disease, gays are gross and my right to worship Jesus trumps their right to live.</em> The freedom for companies to fire people without even giving them a reason, or fire people for bullshit like what they put on their social media accounts -- even if it's not in poor taste. Like, a company with a bigoted boss that fires an employee who follows Ellen on Twitter, again because it violates his religion to have someone working there who thinks a gay person is human.<br><br>Keep your government away from my guns and my God seems to be the credo here. But it's perfectly acceptable for government to take ownership of women's bodies in the name of &quot;protecting the unborn,&quot; for government to arrest people and send them to Rikers for smoking a plant, for government to arrest people and send them to Rikers for downloading mp3 files, for government to put a chokehold on some guy who was competing with the cigarette store he stood in front of by selling individual smokes for pennies on the dollar -- unless, of course, that guy had a dearth of melanin in his complexion. Freedom of enforced morality and the right to be a racist, Red Pill jerk, but not freedom from it for everyone else. &quot;Might is right, and sucks for you that you got in my way&quot;? <br><br>What about the free market, huh? What about freedom of choice? Freedom from religion, freedom from guns, freedom from the vice police? Ayn Rand Paul and his ilk are loathe to support that. It's all about the freedom to be an asshole. Admit it. The libertarian movement is all about being a selfish dick without consequence and without regard for the well-being of one's fellow human. Freedom for Social Darwinism to run its course, aka the &quot;invisible hand of the free market.&quot; Which sounds a lot like predestination and divine rights. I would think someone who is truly in favor of freedom would want society to get out from under the thumb of that tyranny.<br><br>You're right, they're not crazy.

			<p>Ding ding ding! <br><br>Bull crap. <br><br>What believing that suggests is that large market participants in the US got together and decided &quot;we need to pay out people more so that they don't become communists&quot; and that after the end of the Cold War they got together and decided &quot;the Cold War is over so now we can pay our peoe shit and pay our CEO's the big bucks&quot;. <br><br>The problem with that is that companies do not generally work together at that level. <br><br>Boards if directors also want to please shareholders so the only way they would choose to increase CEO's salaries by such large increments is if they needed to do so to attract the talent they feel is necessary to successfully run large corporations. There is a cost benefit issue there and those with the experience and success in running large companies is few and they are in a competitive market place. <br><br>The rise of the middle class in America was largely due to the almost complete destruction of manufacturing capacity in Europe and Asia while it was completely built up in America after WWII. This meant a shit ton if jobs and more competition for labor. It also meant a strong dollar so imported goods were cheap. Demand as while was down if you think globally so there was a lack of demand pull inflation on a global scale which also helped to keep price indexes low. <br><br>As the rest if the world recovered, there was a downward pressure in American wages to keep production local and increased demand in global markets as economies recovered and grew therefore driving price indexes up. <br><br>The world it's economies are more complicated than rich people meeting in secret deciding on how to keep people committed to capitalism and fucking them over when they succeed. </p>		</li>

			<p>Not even remotely true. The middle class didn't just appear over night, it had been growing for a long time since the industrial revolution started.<br><br>It's no coincidence things were the best around the time of the red scare - half the world was locked behind communism and the rest was still recovering from the massive devastation of world war II. America had a huge advantage for a few decades.<br><br>Since then the world has recovered, communist countries have opened up and industrialized, and the manufacturing jobs that supported the American middle class are mostly gone.<br><br>Whereas a massive conspiracy to keep wages artificially high is just ridiculous. There is no evidence of such a thing at all.</p>		</li>

As capital markets have globalized, first-world workers are no longer (entirely) privileged against competition from third-world workers, and wages have begun to converge, mostly by third-world wages rising. Those who actually care about the poor should be celebrating this.<br><br>What we actually see is perfectly consistent with wages being determined by supply and demand, and demand being determined by marginal productivity.

			<p>People get what they <strong>fight</strong> for.  Average Americans won't even haggle at the grocer, let alone fight their boss over their income.  Unions used to ensure that wages would increase with inflation and cost of living, but the Unions have been effectively crushed in almost all industries.  I know you worked hard in school, but how hard do you fight for your wages?  No one will ever give you anything, you get what you can TAKE in this world, and believe me there is no shortage of corporate overlords FIGHTING TO TAKE everything they can from you.</p>		</li>

			<p>That will never happen.  I believe we are going to see a return of feudalism.  Land is becoming too valuable a commodity to be owned by  commoners.  You will instead see vast tracts of residential land owned by corporations and used as &quot;company housing&quot;.  Your heating fuel and electricity will be bought as wholesale rates by your employer and will be a &quot;perk&quot; of working for a company.  Your paycheck will shrink accordingly, of course, and a majority of the rest will go toward mandatory debt.  The amount remaining will be carefully engineered to allow you to afford a smart phone, a television, and certain types of food.<br><br><br>  </p>		</li>

			<p>Its kinda funny - I feel the exact opposite way. I feel that boosts in technology (3D printing, renewable energy/nuclear fusion, possibly eventually (like, in a century+) molecular printing/highly advanced nanotech), coupled with the fact that most developed countries have decreasing populations (basically all of Europe, for example, the US being more of an exception than a rule), should eventually bring us closer to a post-scarcity economy than causing regression.<br><br>Predictions of the future are such a fickle thing, it's really tough to tell whether something will end up being a temporary historical blip or a long standing trend. On a topic I'm semi-familiar with, people thought that the Russian population would drop by like 30-40% by 2050 as recently as the early-mid 2000's. Now, most estimates are guessing around a 15-20% drop (which is a massive, millions upon millions of people difference) because the 1990's/early 2000's were just a really fucked up, temporary crisis in Russian history. </p>		</li>

			<p>I think you're discussing two sides of the same coin. <br><br>The technologies to end scarcity are being developed in an economy that primarily serves the interests of those who already have money and want to preserve their position.  There will inevitably be tension as laws and policies create an underclass and the technology to fix that problem appears. There will be conflict, and that conflict is what will force changes in policy and move us toward that post-scarcity world. <br><br>A world with an ever-increasing amount of people, an ever-increasing amount of money, and a decreasing amount of jobs will inevitably have to move beyond a system that distributes money to people only through jobs. But it will take conflict to get that transition to finally happen. </p>		</li>

			<p>Fusion is astronomically difficult to generate energy with; I seriously doubt oil has delayed fusion significantly at this stage in the game (the people that thought we'd have fusion soon in the 50's seriously overestimated their engineering capabilities). <br><br>I definitely agree that society has become less equal over time - it started in the 70's and shows no signs of stopping. However, technology has the potential to bring us closer to post scarcity, at which point, inequality won't be that big a deal (and if it still is, revolution would definitely begin to become a viable option). There is the possibility of repression, but, IMO, that will always be circumventable, whether it be through encryption that would take the government weeks to brute force or just through replacing websites taken down by the government.</p>		</li>

			<p>In the 50's, no one could afford a computer except top universities and other institutes, but now nearly every household has at least one. Availability increases over time.<br><br>Also, with increased automation, I don't think the current system will be anywhere near sustainable - soon, we'll start to lose service jobs to robots and I believe that, within the next century, all but the most creative jobs will be automated. We're already at the point where computers can take a fast food order better than people, a system of computers run by one mathematician can make boatloads of money trading stock, and robots can produce cars/toys/other commodities cheaper, faster, and more effectively than people. IMO, employment will be pretty damn scarce if this keeps up, and it'll probably be tough to find a job unless you're in the pure sciences, engineering, design, or art.

So far, they've seriously increased human development, subsidized couples having multiple children, and increased immigration, but only managed to halve the decrease (which, IMO, is pretty decent actually, but it could have economic problems depending on how it's handled). </p>		</li>

			<p>To get some perspective, you need to look at things from the Russian point of view. I typed out a long ass drunk comment on a shitty vice article on Russia, I'll copy paste it here. I oversimplified some things a bit (ie saying &quot;under Moscow's control for hundreds of years&quot; when &quot;under Saint Petersburg's control and then Moscow's&quot;) and I totally come off looking like I have a massive boner for Putin, but generally speaking its more nuanced than what you'll typically read in a 100 word editorial in the Sunday paper. The first paragraph is a pretty good description of how the Ukraine issue looks to the Russian government (and thus, typically to the standard Russian given a lot of state controlled media), and the others are just be generally nitpicking at the article. <br><br>&quot;This is the stupidest fucking article I've ever read - anyone that's actually studied Russia and its unique situation would know that Putin actually seizing more territory makes 0 sense. Crimea was only seized because it never should have been under Ukrainian control - it was under Moscow's control for hundreds of years and was an autonomous region in the Ukraine. Russia was totally OK with that because 1) Yeltsin was a drunk bitch and 2) the Ukrainian government was stable, friendly, and allowed Russia to keep its military bases in the region. The Ukrainian protests/impeachment was a total disaster; the Ukraine is a highly polarized country, where, in the last real election, the east voted almost entirely for Yanukovich and the west for Tymoshenko. Yanukovich wasn't exactly the smartest guy on the planet (he imprisoned Tymoshenko - generally a bad idea), but he was playing both Russia and the EU for monetary assistance, and Russia clearly offered the better package. This led to the protests, which led to the 150/~400 parliament members fleeing Kiev, which then enabled the pro-West rump parliament to impeach Yanukovich. Overall, a total disaster. Additionally, the revolt in the Donetsk/Luhansh was definitely influenced by the seizure of Crimea, but Putin definitely won't annex it because it's historically been owned by the Ukraine and isn't autonomous (though, since so much of the population is ethnically Russian, it puts him in a position where he's expected to offer some support).<br><br>Additionally, calling Russia &quot;borderline developing&quot; is ignorant of the complex historical situation of Russia. If you compare Russia to the other BRICS, which are clearly developing, even the USSR in the 80's had high rates of urbanization and literacy. Additionally, over time, Russia's human development index has been catching up to Portugal, the least developed state in the original EU-15, and it clearly outpaces China in HDI and GDP per capita, despite not having higher overall GDP growth (which, again, is likely because Russia isn't really developing). Russia's growth more closely has matched Western Europe in recent years than the BRICS, again suggesting that Russia is more developed than some may have let on. Arguably Russia never truly belonged in the BRICS because it's growth surge in the 2000's was fueled by reclaiming lost capacity (industrial output in the former USSR dropped by over 50% in the 90's, which were basically just a total disaster)., rather than true development. On a side note, compared to other states with decent sized oil dependence, Russia lies closer to Norway than the petro states.<br><br>Overall, though, it will be interesting to see what happens in Russia economically in the next few years. Oil prices have the potential to really screw Russia (the government budget uses a 5 year average to estimate revenue, but a 5 year average doesn't help when you're at a 5 year low), but OPEC and other, more oil dependent states are betting on oil prices spiking back up as oil sands, shale etc. becomes too costly to keep producing. At the absolute worst, politically, Russia will face some flavor of president change (elections in Russia are pretty free according to independent polls, which match official figures pretty closely), but that president will end up being communist or very far-right, which are the only 2 parties that take more than 10% of the vote.<br><br>If anyone wants to actually learn about Russia, they should probably be reading academic articles and not Vice, but hell, I'm a bit fucked right now and had a good time writing this.&quot;<br><br><br>Also, in a handful of speeches, etc. Putin's basically said that he dislikes the current unipolar world. Basically, he believes that having multiple competing world groups (or just two in the case of the USSR) actually led to a more peaceful world, since those two+ groups won't actually ever go to war - it'd be a catastrophe. That's not to say he's trying to recreate the USSR - that'd be absolutely fucking stupid for him to even attempt. Russia's military has gotten a lot better since the 90's, but will likely never reach anywhere near parity with the US (in the 70's and 80's, Brezhnev basically drove the economy into the ground by over investing in the military to reach parity; the USSR wasn't large enough to feasibly reach parity, so the Russian Federation definitely isn't). <br><br>On a side note, just generally speaking, the US has also been a total dick to Russia over the past 20 years. First we bombed Kosovo in the 90's, basically wrecking one of Russia's last European allies without really even consulting them/caring about their opinion, then NATO moved into Eastern Europe. After Obama's &quot;Russian Reset&quot; in 2009, things still didn't go to well. My favorite case of the US screwing up our relations with Russia recently was the appointment of Michael McFaul as our ambassador to Russia. Based on his visiting Russian opposition groups over actual government officials, etc. he really seems like more of an anti-government activist than an ambassador, which just really seems silly. Ambassadors shouldn't undermine the government they're trying to form a relation with. <br><br>tldr; Russia comes off as a dick sometimes, but the Ukraine issue makes way more sense from their perspective, even if they sometimes over exaggerate some aspects of the what happened. Also, in general, our government has been a pretty big dick to Russia since the 90's because of neoliberal ideology n' shit. Also, Putin believes that he's the dick the world needs. </p>		</li>

			<p>I agree with you wholeheartedly. The problem is that for every one person who wouldn't take such a change sitting down, there are at least a thousand who would give up their freedom for relative comfort and security. Not to mention we live in the age of the extremist moderate, where no one wants to be seen as having a radical opinion that might be considered offensive or whatever the case may be.</p>		</li>

			<p>True enough. But I'm convinced that a violent revolution is the last thing that we need. We really need the people to take a legitimate stand against the conglomerates that control just about anything. Like what the Occupy movement started as before (shocker) some of the protesters turned violent.</p>		</li>

I just think that in the future you will be completely beholden to a particular employer and systematically prevented from owning anything of value.  Preventing the building of wealth makes a person more stable as a citizen and employee, and providing bread and circuses makes them content enough to accept such a system.

			<p>Regardless, how are people going to afford the basics in life? America in particular has made it clear: no one is their brother's keeper, and people who need help are just thieves and moochers expecting a handout, that you shouldn't give them because it's like feeding stray animals and making them dependent <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1233168/senate-candidate-compares-food-stamp-recipients-to-wild-animals/" target="_blank">(yes, Virginia, someone actually said this).</a> Human needs are not considered human rights, and the culture of &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; is too hard-wired in the American mindset to ever change.<br><br>So without people being able to afford things like shelter, clothing, food, etc. in the future, and government/society being unwilling to provide it for people, how exactly are people supposed to afford far-off luxury niche things like 3D printers and even computers to read Wikipedia? How does reading Wikipedia translate to being able to cultivate enough wealth to live on for even the basics? You can't watch YouTube videos if you don't have a computer, and with American society moving more and more in the direction of using tax monies on absolutely nothing but war and perks for politicians and &quot;government corporations,&quot; chances are libraries will get defunded and go by the wayside too. Not only that, but Internet access will likely become too expensive for most people to afford, thanks to the corrupt FCC being bought off by Comcast et. al. and shitting on net neutrality.<br><br>Besides all that, though, people still need a way to afford food, shelter, and clean toilets to take a shit.

			<p>&gt;To be fair, the slowness of Americas bicameral legislature is intentional to ensure passing factions don't shape our law. <br><br>Doesn't matter in the least if both sides of that legislature have been bought off by multinational corporations. Both Dems and Reps are the party of money. Dems are bought off by Hollywood and Big Media, while Reps are bought off by fossil fuel companies, defense contractors, gun manufacturers, the tobacco industry, and the usual snake oil televangelists with 52 kids, a megachurch, and a &quot;good Christian home&quot; the size of the Taj Mahal.<br><br>Some lobbies I would say buy off both, like pharmaceuticals and Silicon Valley, which have muddied the waters so much you could say they're apolitical. Silicon Valley is pissing off the right by demanding immigration reform and opening the doors to things the moralists don't like. But they're also pissing off the left with their refusal to capitulate to Hollywood and the focus on high-skilled tech immigrants with H1Bs from Asia and India, because low-skilled immigrants from South and Central America and Africa don't matter. They piss off the racist right by saying bring brown people in; then they piss off the labor left by discriminating against certain brown people over others. Then they piss off the moral-values right by enabling people to access porn; but they also piss off the content-industry left by enabling people to <em>pirate</em> it.<br><br>Either way, Congress only listens to billionaires. Even millionaires are being drowned out, which means of course that working-class people and the homeless have no voice at all.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, but generally speaking I think that as long as you have free elections, a productive legislature is a healthy one. In Canada, we have what is effectively a single-chamber government, so if the party in power has a majority, they can essentially write whatever they want. This doesn't mean that they <em>do</em>, however - because they know that it could all be wiped out next election cycle. So on the whole legislation tends to be more moderate, and parliament tends to try to build popular support before implementing major bills.</p>		</li>

			<p>while usa is well overdue for that, the civil unrest is in small pockets around the country and is really only being caused by people who have nothing better to do. realistically instead of crying about how they think usa should be a better place they could do that themselves by volunteering and such. i love how when you compare the protest site aftermaths there to places abroad, it looks like the ones involved haven't been civilized.

			<p>The only issue I have understanding this is, while I agree the middle class is shrinking, and thus the gap between the rich and the poor is growing, how does the standard of living continue to rise? At least from my observation it's growing exponentially faster as technology advances further.

			<p>I really don't see how we Americans can successfully achieve revolution through violence. Our police are kitting up with military hardware, the military complex brainwashes its soldiers for unthinking obedience, and civilians can't get close to the kind of weapons that would even be close to what the military uses. Fighter jets, tanks, long range missiles...I'm sure others know more about the crazy death machines out there than I do.<br><br>It was certainly different 100+ years ago when it was force of numbers and tactics that turned the tide of battle. The weaponry used was fairly ubiquitous and accessible to civilians, making revolution possible. Today you can't even get your hands on some kinds of ammunition, not to mention automatic weapons and the tech that would put us on even footing with the US military.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>you mentioned some of the problem. is that back then americans (and canadians) didn't NEED things (luxuries) like laptops and smart phones. Realistically, if people saved instead of stocking up on unnecessary luxuries then they'd have less debt on their way out of school. What's mind blowing is how so many students have the latest gear from the newest iPhone or macbook which they purchased with borrowed money and really the premium paid for being up to date with the latest stuff is unnecessary. why not use an older-gen smart phone and a refurb laptop through school then reward yourself with fresh stuff when you're working and banking money. not to mention they all have the freshest wardrobes, again, who are they trying to impress in college with all that stuff?

			<p>&gt;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?<br><br>* Friedrich Engels</p>		</li>

			<p>Obamacare is comatose now that Republicans control both houses of Congress. There is a very good chance that they will control the executive branch in 2016, at which point the GOP president would effectively &quot;pull the plug.&quot; I don't believe we have ever had a rubber-stamp Congress in modern times, if at all in the entire history of this country. Sadly, the only way we could get a Democrat in is if Hillary ekes out a win <em>and</em> Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders <em>don't</em> run as spoilers. It would divide the party between mainstream centrists (the majority) and the enthusiastic but powerless far-left that really do earnestly want us to become Denmark.<br><br>But we're never going to be Denmark, because we don't think of brown people, gays, and &quot;career women&quot; as &quot;real Americans&quot; and thus are unwilling to help out &quot;the other.&quot; Also, we believe as a culture that anything you have (or don't) is either your own fault or due to the fact that God hates you (which is also your own fault). Asking for help in any way, for anything, is a sign of weakness and something to be ashamed of. This, incidentally enough, is probably why we have one of the highest rates of mental illness in the entire world but one of the lowest rates of participation in treatment: there's not only a stigma in being &quot;crazy&quot; but a stigma in not being able to &quot;cure it&quot; by your own willpower (or &quot;faith&quot;). So, people avoid getting much-needed help because you're a failure, a loser, weak, sick, a sissy, etc. if you need someone to talk to about problems you're having.<br><br>America by itself should be a diagnosable mental disorder.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not everyone believes the flawed state is inevitable. The Russkies were a barbaric, illiterate bunch of peasant farmers when they had their revolution. They were easily swayed by those with power. And, really, the Russian people have always been more savage than other countries. Once the USSR became so powerful, any subsequent attempt at revolution was poisoned before it even had a chance. Not only that, but the capitalists who emphatically did NOT want to lose power, squeezed the communist countries so hard that any country, under any system, would fail.<br><br>Would the same thing happen today, in a civilized society?

			<p>Its also important to note that the countries that were transformed through violent-revolution were not the ones which Marx predicted too. Russia didn't have a fully developed Capitalist system at the time of the revolution, same goes for China. <br>Marx believed that only fully developed countries would see revolution, predicting Germany, Britain etc. to adopt socialism. <br><br>Also when Marx speaks of revolution, it isn't necessarily violent revolution that he means. The word has been given a violent connotation in modern times, but it simply means a paradigm shift. (Industrial Revolution etc.)</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;no communist government is flourishing<br><br>See, this is easily explained by the one failure of the Russians. Every &quot;communist&quot; revolution after that was either directly orchestrated by the USSR as a way to set up convenient puppet states, or poisoned through the comintern towards a similar goal. None of the states so produced ever had anything to do with communism, except as a convenient banner to get people to rally around. Even Stalin was not remotely communist. In fact, the first thing he did when he took power was kill off all the <em>actual</em> communists. If someone had walked into one of the Founding Fathers' meetings and killed them all, would capitalism in America have been successful?<br><br>We've only really tried communism once, and in some of the worst possible conditions.

			<p>Marxism fails to account for the corrupting influences of power. Power is the central problem of humanity, and societies who centralize it, inevitably fail, while those who distribute power have a better chance of succeeding. Marxism gives extreme amounts of power to government officials, and it is only a matter of time before that power is abused and used for selfish reasons. There has never been a successful Marxist state, and likely never will be.</p>		</li>

			<p>I've never heard this theory but am intrigued. Do you have any more sources or articles on this? I have a hard time believing that the economic elites came together for some sort of a mass conspiracy to keep wages high in order to deter communism. The middle class grew because our economy was booming after WWII and the GI Bill helped millions of veterans prosper in the post-war period. I believe it was far more to do with greed then a drop in fear over a communist take over in the 1960's. </p>		</li>

			<p>There are probably a few issues, none of which probably stem from some cabal of &quot;economic elites&quot;, but from cultural change, although the cultural influence of those elites is rather outsized.<br><br>1)  Taxes have been reduced for high earners, substantially.  Marginal rates are down from 90% to around 35% and <em>actual</em> rates are down from 45% to 28% for the top 1%.  The top 0.1% also pay much lower rates than anyone else in the top half of earners.<br><br>2)  Structural changes to the business landscape, such as increase globalization and automation take power and money from the line worker and weaken the middle class in favor of the upper class.  Some conservative economists argue that trade unions held and outsized sway over business during the 1945-1970 timeframe.  I think economic growth numbers during those periods may at least cast doubt on those claims, however.<br><br>3)  The western culture has had a rise of the &quot;pop star&quot; mentality, where small groups of individuals are treated larger than life.  In the 1960s there was a real belief that CEO was a job like any other that could be completed by any well educated and insightful businessman, of which there were thousands for every position.   Today, surrounded by the culture of celebrity, CEOs, and various other &quot;high profile&quot; positions are paid huge amounts, almost despite their performance.  There are many examples of CEOs floating from one golden parachute to another, leaving behind a trail of failed companies and bad policies, on only their name recognition alone.   Gone are the days that a CEO was usually promoted from within (and usually hand-picked by the guy who started the company).<br><br>4)  The global financial system has accelerated the pace of money changing, which has increased the importance and profitability of &quot;handling money&quot; (investment banking) by several orders of magnitude.  Investment firms and banks (instead of manufacturers and resource extraction) are now consistently the largest companies in the world.  This shift moves huge amounts of money and power to the elite, and away from the middle class.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>I'd be up for the challenge, except it wouldn't be much of a challenge for me as &quot;technology&quot; doesn't hold much interest for me in the first place. I'm not looking to upgrade, because I don't have anything to upgrade. At my house, we have the same 13&quot; picture tube TV that we bought at Radio Shack in 1997. I don't have, or want, a smart phone, and my parents don't really care to learn how to use a computer. We survive on one car: a 1996 Corolla with a broken tape deck that should have been put out to pasture years ago, but it's still running and who cares about useless bullshit like Sirius Radio anyway.<br><br>I still listen to cassette tapes. I have an iPod but it's a ten-year-old Classic that just plays music (and microscopic 320x240 videos). I'm not interested in apps or tablets or anything else that Jobs put on the assembly line after the last clear-plastic iMac became obsolete. I don't care about the new music that people are into and don't bother with streaming or Spotify or anything else like that. I don't tweet or Facebook. I don't watch HD videos; in fact, most of my video library is in VHS format, with DVDs only there to replace tapes that have worn out. No interest in Blu-Ray. I read print books and not e-books and will never, even with a gun to my head, waste money or bandwidth on the fan fiction garbage that Amazon Direct spits out.<br><br>I don't want &quot;nice things.&quot; I'm someone who's content with just a smidge more than the basics: a place to live that isn't infested, has working utilities, and enough space for me to keep my clothes and books. I really just need heat, electric, and running water; I certainly could live without television, and probably even the Internet as I really just use it right now for school and dicking about on Reddit. I don't need a &quot;new car&quot;; I'd be perfectly content with a &quot;clunker&quot; as long as it wasn't so clunky as to be patently useless and/or unsafe. I'm never going to get married or have children, so there'd be no point in the future when I would <em>need</em> an upgrade in living conditions.<br><br>But then, I'm probably in the minority. Most people -- they're out right now beating each other up at Best Buy in the spirit of Christmas -- want the latest and greatest &quot;new thing.&quot; I don't know why I'm immune to this stuff. Maybe because I don't have friends or date, and therefore have never been subject to peer (or sexual) pressure?</p>		</li>

			<p>In a true post-scarcity society it wouldn't matter who controlled the means of production. Economic systems break down with no scarcity. It doesn't matter if your economy is gift or currency based if products have no value. Capitalism, communism, etc. become nearly irrelevant words. </p>		</li>

			<p>The &quot;gift economy&quot; becomes more important because, in a world where everything is mass produced, the ability to make and gift something by hand makes it all the more special.<br><br>Though what you buy may, necessarily, be different.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's somewhat true. But consider in a post-scarcity world everyone will be 'unemployed'. Making 'handmade' items will be all that people produce, ergo worth <em>less</em> than they are today. If everyone makes wooden furniture by hand, hand made wooden furniture becomes a lot less valuable.<br><br>One of the reasons handmade items are worth as much as they are today is precisely because the scarcity of both human time and skill in order to make them. I don't doubt such items would be valued over mass-produced items, but I imagine that the value would go down even as the quality went up.<br><br>My guess is that experiences would be the highest valued gifts in a post-scarcity world.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think you misunderstand what I believe to be the valuable part of the handmade gifts. Generally, if I make a handmade gift, it will go to someone I know. That will give it some value right there. Furthermore, the specific uniqueness of its parts will further give it value.<br><br>Essentially, just because everyone does it, doesn't mean that they are competing. It's more like trading personally painted pictures. I might really like Picasso, but I'm not going to be a dick to nephew about his inability to paint. So if he still wanted something from me and was willing to trade his work for it, I might be inclined to agree where I might otherwise not.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think there is a distinction between gifts given on holidays versus gifts in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy" target="_blank">gift economy</a>.<br><br>Your argument applies very much to gift giving as it functions today. My original comment was regarding a hypothetical post-scarcity gift economy. If resource scarcity doesn't exist it functionally doesn't matter if you pay X amount of currency for an item or the item is given to you freely with the societal understanding that you give items freely as well. Or if needs are mass produced by post-singularity AIs or what-have-you. If you're into science fiction at all you may find the Culture series by Iain Banks fascinating due to the novels being based in a post-scarcity quasi anarcho-communist world.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think this is a large part of it. The wealthy (individuals and corporations) were afraid people would turn to something that would more than likely strip them of their wealth and power, not to mention the money that could be made from extracting resources, cheap labor, new customers, etc. world-wide. The fact that what was the biggest threat had its own version of power inequality internally didn't matter, what mattered was they would lose what they had and what they could acquire. <br><br>Governments just reflect the will of the most powerful, so during that time they did everything they could to make sure the west offered a much better quality of life. The Soviet Union is gone and China, though with a government that is still heavily involved in their economy, has become a crucial player in globalization. The remaining countries are too small for the wealthy to really be concerned about anymore. </p>		</li>

Employers think of internet degree recipients -- even if the degree comes from a credible, big-name school and not Phoenix or DeVry -- as being antisocial recluses who don't know how to be &quot;team players&quot; and do the networking bullshit.<br><br>It may be true in some cases; I know I'm painfully shy and have found that I get my work done much quicker and with less anxiety online, than when I'm in a classroom getting nervous that people are looking at and judging me based on my appearance or other factors. Being a mute in class is how I compensate for having to &quot;be there.&quot;<br><br>But overall, I think that a lot of people want to do online classes because of convenience, and especially cost. You don't have to spend money to live at school, or spend gas on commuting; basically you just pay for the class and the textbooks and be done with it. You don't have to schedule your life around your coursework like you would if you have an 8:00 class and can't do anything for that time block (doctor appointments, family time, especially kids).<br><br>But a lot of the stigma -- maybe not all of it? -- is because of this introvert/extrovert battle that the Internet has brought to the forefront. American society -- especially jobs and colleges -- values gregarious, obnoxious loudmouths who do nothing but make themselves seem important and play up how totally awesome they think they are, who get drunk at the office holiday party and are met with more respect than the teetotaler who doesn't even bother to go. Diligent, results-oriented people who can't/won't do the networking crap and have a physical presence in dumb activities clubs at their university are thrown away as being isolated nerds who can't relate at the water cooler. Regardless of whether it's true or not doesn't make it right.</p>		</li>

			<p>I know lots of Gen-Xers who got jobs in the early to mid 90s and they're doing fine.  None of the crap that's at the top of this thread is any different for them --- wages relative to inflation, GI bill.  Nothing.<br><br>What <strong>is</strong> different is a bad business environment causing industry to reduce hiring, absolutely terrible economic growth, exploding energy prices (despite this week in oil) and a whole lot of hidden inflation.  This has been the case 2007-2015.  <em>That</em> is what is killing the Millenials' launch into the American economy.<br><br>Some of it is just bad luck.  Some of it is the lingering hangover from the 2008 crash.  And some of it is bad public policy.

			<p>Don't forget (and I hate to say it, not because I actually hate to but because it's been repeated so many times before) the glut of Millennials who went to college for &quot;something&quot; because you &quot;had to&quot; get a minimum bachelor's just to be considered for jobs, or went and got degrees in bullshit that they found &quot;interesting&quot; and now can't get a job because nobody's hiring English majors. That in and of itself is the fault of their parents who felt that it was important for Junior to be educated in the &quot;life of the mind,&quot; so that he wouldn't have to get dirty and work with his hands like those &quot;dumb&quot; trades people. Who, by the way, are making bank as plumbers and carpenters while Junior bags groceries at Wally World with his worthless degree in philosophy. So much for all that Latin education bullshit.

			<p>The GI Bill's primary change was cultural. It completely minimized the trades and  implied all people should go to college. This led to a huge flow of people into the college system, which couldn't really be supported without huge investments in infrastructure (ie more buildings, equipment, etc). Huge investments require huge profits to fund them, and so tuition started moving up in order for colleges to have surplus capital to actually grab that expand enrollment. </p>		</li>

			<p>Not just manufacturing. <em>Everything.</em> Automated vehicles like drones and Google's self-driven car (a truly &quot;auto-&quot; automobile) threaten to make driving jobs obsolete. That's good if you think of how many accidents occur due to the plethora of human-driver fuckups -- everything from overworked Fedex drivers falling asleep at the wheel making deliveries on icy highways on Christmas Eve, to overzealous lead-foots who treat school zones like it's Daytona, to nonagenarians who treat highways like they're school zones, to DUI morons who really should have called a cab instead of taking a chance after five beers...<br><br>But it's terrible for jobs. Shit-wage jobs are right now all that a lot of people can get, and you're likely to see millions of Domino's delivery drivers and UPS guys out of work because of automation. Amazon is starting to use some robotics in their shipping centers, and of course both companies are known for their experimental drone delivery programs. Uber is a notoriously dick company where the CEO says he <em>wants</em> to cut out &quot;the other guy in the car&quot; by replacing drivers with Google cars, thus driving down the cost for consumers and eliminating jobs for cab drivers due to automation and lower prices (you don't have to pay tips to a machine).<br><br>We need, but will never have (because SOSHULISM!) a guaranteed minimum income that the rich dicks should <em>have</em> to take a pay cut in order to contribute to, because it's largely because of corporate anarchy and de-unionization that these things are being allowed to happen. Millennials are either desperate or delusional (or both) if they honestly think they're going to make a living wage in the &quot;sharing economy.&quot; News flash: nobody's buying your crap fanfic novel on Kindle Direct, and nobody's buying your anime drawings on DeviantArt. Sooner or later, nobody will pay you to drive them on Uber either. They'll pay a flat fee to get driven around in a Ford HAL-9000.<br><br>Really the only solution is for the rich to lose a big chunk of their dough and it to be given outright to people lest they starve.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is a bigger factor than most people really comprehend. In a capitalist society, the value of everything is determined by supply and demand. The more common something is, the less it is worth. This is true for labor as much as it is for material goods. Increased competition lowers prices.<br><br>You're right when you mention that we're now competing with workers on a global scale, lowering the value of labor, and against older workers who inflate the number of workers on the market. Not mentioned as often (because it's more controversial) is the fact that population growth and the introduction of women and minorities into the workplace over the past 50 years has ALSO greatly expanded the labor pool in most western countries, lowering the value of all labor.<br><br>Which really brings us to the &quot;great unspoken truth&quot; of this whole discussion: The belief that everyone was wealthier and had more opportunity in previous generations is largely mythical. White western males had more opportunity because good paying jobs were in many ways limited to that particular demographic (yes, I know there are exceptions). People outside the western world, women, and most minorities have never really had access to the kind of wealth that defined the American and European middle classes over the past few hundred years. In many ways, the western middle class was an artificial construct that was built by imposing social and legal restrictions that limited the size of the worker pool competing for higher paying jobs. What we've really seen over the past 50 years is a destruction of the barriers that reserved higher paying jobs for that demographic. As women, minorities, and residents of other nations started competing for jobs that were once reserved for white western males, the wages paid for those positions declined simply because labor scarcity was reduced. When you factor in a doubling of the global population on top of that, it becomes quite easy to see why good jobs are so much harder to find. There's A LOT more competition.<br><br>It could be argued that what we're seeing today is simply a normalization of economic opportunity on a global scale. The western middle class is being pulled back toward the global average now that its artificial protections have been eliminated, and that global average is declining a bit as population numbers continue to increase and labor scarcity continues to decline.</p>		</li>

			<p>The older generation had a lot of one off opportunities to grow their families wealth. Basically the older generation screwed us to make themselves wealthy. There was the addition of women to the workforce effectively increasing household incomes by some 50-100%. Then there was the push to normalize the idea of credit, loans, and the 30 year mortgage. This was good for a one time bump in the velocity of money and a huge increase in home prices as you could now finance them over long periods vs buying outright or with a small loan. I have more examples but I'm writing on my phone. I also have some interesting charts to illustrate all of this at work but can't get them until Monday. TLDR: Older generations created an unsustainable system to make themselves wealthy and screw future generations </p>		</li>

			<p>Wages are stagnant because in reality we have been fighting deflation for years. The economic crash caused sudden across the board drops in demand for all products, which then causes companies to either lay off or reduce or freeze salaries for many years. Eventually this impacts the money supply and everything else and you have deflation. Deflation is a very scary scenario, and so most governments and world banks to combat it have been artificially pumping money and credit into the economy... Essentially an inflation force to try and counter balance the deflation. It had been working relatively well. <br><br>See my earlier post on your other questions. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>Investing is not the same as spending. The money at the top just circles around the top. Whenever their companies do well, CEOs tend to pocket the extra money rather than give it out to increase wages all around. This causes problems because only they can spend greatly, and they have too much money to spend. So a lot of it gets wasted sitting around in banks, while the poorer Americans live paycheck to paycheck.<br><br>So I wouldn't say it's good for the economy.

			<p>Many so called economists engage in this fallacy of simply counting dollar bills; but paper bills are not what is important. What is important is <em>production.</em> The best thing for the economy is <em>more things getting produced</em> that fulfill more wants and needs. And the only way to ultimately produce <em>more stuff</em> is through savings and the build-up of capital goods, which is the exact opposite of what you said. <br><br>Also, If people choose to hold money over spending it, we can't say that this is inherently wrong. The people are simply expressing their preferences, their value scales. <br><br>And if this feeling of highly valuing money is assumed universal, then it also extends to the venders, or supply side. If the venders also highly value money, then they simply offer more goods and services in exchange for the same amount of money, and there is nothing inherently wrong with this. The customer gets more stuff for his money, and the vender gets what he values most. Both sides are still benefiting. </p>		</li>

			<p>And most of 'the economy' is just using energy to make/transport things and provide services. Every single facet of the economy is linked to energy. <br><br>Until very recently all energy costs have been rising and it's taking more and more energy to get at remaining reserves. See global Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI). In the 50's/60's it took one unit of energy to get 100 units back (from a typical gusher oil well). That left huge amounts of surplus to do 'work'. Now we're dredging hundreds of sq miles of dirty tar sands with 1 unit of energy giving 10 back. That leaves less useful energy to do work. Global EROEI progressively drops on a global scale year on year. <br><br>There are also billions more people, so there's a labour surplus but an energy deficit. Driving wages down. <br><br>I can't really articulate it well, but I'm absolutely convinced energy is at the heart of most economics. Spikes in energy costs are almost always followed by recession. But generally people don't understand very well (as it's quite abstract and almost completely invisible to everyday people). People like to blame other people because that implies the problem can be fixed. Whereas the EROEI problem has absolutely no fix, it's just a problem of physics. </p>		</li>

			<p>Note, the answers you're being given represent the predominant school of thought.  The majority of established economists say that a degree of inflation is necessary for a healthy economy.  <br><br>However, this is not the only opinion.  There is a sizable minority who disagrees with this.  There are people who argue that inflation serves to make the poor poorer to the benefit of the wealthy who are able to invest.  This school would advocate keeping inflation as close to zero as possible, thus allowing working and middle class people to save their money.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Of course not. If the lower half (income-wise) of the population would get a 10% wage increase they would spend every single cent they are getting more to buy more stuff. Suddenly increasing the nations GDP by 5-10%. It would be an all around good thing.</p>		</li>

			<p>The simplest explanation I can see is that automation and outsourcing have reduced the demand for domestic labor. This makes it a lot harder to compete in the job market than before, because there are fewer jobs available and higher educational and skill requirements. Put another way, employers just don't have the need for people the way they used to, so they are giving less back to the society that allows them to exist.<br><br>The boomer generation had a much easier job market to work under because there was such a high demand for all kinds of labor. A lot of boomers dropped out of high school and were still able to find a well-paying job and afford a house.</p>		</li>

			<p>But you still see wages fall off the productivity pace in the 80s. Before then, wage intermingled with the productivity line instead of always hanging out below it. Wages are in the ballpark, but below productivity. And in this economic atmosphere where companies emphasize getting every cent for profit, eventually that efficient standard should be applied by those working to the those commissioning the work to be done.

			<p>In order?<br><br>1. Financialization - More things operate through financing and financial markets now than ever before.  People buy more shit with credit than cash.  People finance cars and cell phones and computers and everything else way more often.  And on the back side, financial industry has its hands much deeper in all sorts of markets.  It basically means that everyone pays an increasing share of their income to finance and insurance, which grow as a result.  In the US, think of it like a stealth tax you pay to Manhattan instead of Washington.  This drives labor's share of income down and capital's share of income up.<br><br>2. Globalization - You can start a company in America and employ only people in China for $2 per day to make your stuff.  You couldn't do that before.  So more money goes to owners, less money goes to workers.  Basically, owners can make all people on earth compete for who will work the cheapest, but since very few people have the capital to build a factory, owners never face the same competition.  This drives labor's share of income down and capital's share of income up.<br><br>3. Tax and Welfare Policy - Estate taxes have dropped a lot.  Top bracket income taxes have dropped a lot.  Capital gains taxes have dropped a lot.  Sales taxes have increased.  Fees have increased.  State money to middle class institutions like hospitals and universities has decreased.  Health costs and education costs rise as a result.  The tax system is more regressive and much lighter on the very rich everywhere worldwide, and middle class services cost more to users.  This drives labor's share of income down and capital's share of income up.<br><br>4.. Technology - This one's funny.  In poor parts of the world, it actually seems to increase wages.  It decreases them slightly in wealthy parts of the world.  Maybe a temporary phenomenon.  <br><br>That's it.  Those are the 4.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Pretty complex but some factors include policies implemented by neoliberal governments, the financialisation of everything (after the end of the Bretton Woods era), lower energy returns on investment compared to previous generations, as some have said globalisation, changing demographics in the western world and technological advances. Lastly, which may or may not be true for a significant amount of people, a changing mindset of younger people who are a bit more adverse to debt or don't want to provide their respective banks/government with any extra tax take or money for things they do not necessarily need. I, for one, would rather squat than get into 20-30 years of debt to pay for an overpriced pile of bricks and mortar. </p>		</li>

			<p>Also owning a house and driving your own car is a construct of the American dream. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate" target="_blank">A lot of people in wealthy European countries are considered well of and do not own a house and few drive a car. In Germany and Switzerland is down to less than 50%</a> and the wage gap in those countries is significantly smaller than in the U.S or Canada with higher home ownership. Also of notice is the higher home ownership in poorer European countries.<br><br>One reason to buy a home is so that homebuyers can hedge against rising rent. In countries where renting is popular, there are usually strict caps on rent increases so it ends up being cheaper to rent.<br><br>In countries where home ownership is high such as the US, the government actively encourages it by giving tax incentives on mortgages. As it becomes tougher and tougher to own, that stigma of renting will wear off.</p>		</li>

			<p>You sound like a young kid awaiting a simple answer to this question, and there really isn't one. Its mostly the fact that our elected officials are pretty much legally bribed into looking out for the interest of companies rather than that of the citizens. Its the fact that CEO's are grossly over paid compared to the average employee. Greed, i suppose is the simplest answer i could think of. Greed drives the rich to continue getting richer and makes the poor even poorer. Its much more complex and theres lots of factors to consider but those are some pretty big ones. </p>		</li>

			<p>an idea that everyone has to work, and not enough work for everyone.  same thing happened shortly after the industrial revolution- with the increase in productivity brought on by automation, fewer people could get more done, but rather than distribute that work among lots of people, it was common to hire a few people who would work long hours, and they would because the alternative was not working at all, while their employer could easily replace them with someone eager to work for less. the same legislation that established the minimum wage also made the 40-hour work week, by requiring 1.5 pay to anyone who worked more than 40 hours a week. so now, it's happening again, but with computers this time. so we need another work week reduction. but try advocating that, and people call you lazy.</p>		</li>

			<p>Real estate and property prices are 3 to 5x the price their parents paid. So if you want to buy at house or rent an apartment instead of it being 500-1000 it's 1500-5000 a month. <br><br>There is no cap on what a house or property can sell for so in the Midwest a 1 acre lot may cost $20,000 but in a high demand area like LA it can cost 2,000,000. This type of bull shit causes prices to go up for every one. For the person buying they need more money to pay monthly. Thus crime, higher hourly rate, corruption, etc. Imagine if you and everyone you know could live in their own mansion for 100 a month? Would people steal? <br><br>BTW in my personal opinion Rent is pure evil. </p>		</li>

			<p>Coming from a college drop out with no degree, the real issue I see is that most people my age (26) are lazy as shit. I've worked over the table since I was 16 and under the table since I was 10 or so. Parents had crippling credit card debt that forced us to grow up very miserly. The biggest secret to living well is to prepare yourself for life after education, LIVE WITHIN YOUR MEANS, and work your tail off. <br><br>1. Preparing yourself for life after education. <br><br>     I've always been the guy who was doing something on the side. Learning skills, reading about new things, and educating myself on my own time. Pre high school graduation is the perfect time for figuring out what you enjoy doing. Then after high school, go to college or join the workforce.<br><br>      When deciding on your major of study don't get some bullcrap degree in women's studies where the only jobs are in academia where you gotta have a doctorate to get a job.  Unless you are willing to take on substantial debt getting a doctorate and have a very defined plan of what you want, then go with a degree that puts you in demand. Engineering is just a good example that comes to mind. <br><br>     If like me college isn't your thing, then pursue a job in SKILLED labor. The last thing you want is to be digging ditches or paving roads at 50. My best suggestion is joining a union. I've worked non union for 8 years and gotten taken advantage of left and right. Joined a union and so far it's been smooth sailing. Good pay, great benefits and excellent retirement.  <br><br>2. Live within your means<br><br>     Too many people are worried about &quot;keeping up with the joneses&quot;. Who gives a flying fuck what the kardashians are doing?! I don't. All I'm worried about is my family and my life. Who cares if the neighbors just got a new car or phone. I don't because I'm content with mine and it does what I need it to do. I'm not saying that I only care about myself, but what they are doing is none of my business. <br><br>     Having said that, use credit cautiously. I choose not to use credit cards just because of seeing my parents struggle to this day with them. All my debt is through secured loans with well defined terms that I am very comfortable with. No surprises.  This allows me to have what I need but not rack up a lot of unsecured, buy it at the drop of a hat credit card debt. <br><br>3. Work your tail off<br><br>     Yes my job pays well, but I work my tail off to have it. Almost always 5-6 days and 60+ hrs a week, but I'm freaking ballin for a college dropout. Slowly but surely getting to where I want to be one day at a time. If it was easy then everyone would be doing it. <br><br><br>Case in point. My wife has a 4 year degree and I have consistently made more than she does with no degree just because I prepared myself from an early age with great skills and a drive that makes me a desirable employee, and have kept my debt to a minimum. </p>		</li>

			<p>I am in IT actually, and during my entry level positions they all did not require anything higher than a bachelors, or 1-2 years experience. And even if those applications state they want those qualifications as a minimum, its often not the case. Its more for screening out those that won't put in more effort other than just filling out an application and hoping they get it. I've gotten plenty of jobs that I was under qualified for, on paper. But after actually meeting them and seeing what they want, they saw that I fulfilled what they needed. That's what an interview is for. Don't take it personally when you're not a good match for what the company is looking for. 20-30 years is ridiculous, are we talking the same thing here? Its entry level. Not some lead project manager with machine learning specialization.</p>		</li>

The powers that be play legal shadow games and use big words IN ALL CAPS TO RENDER WHATEVER THEY'RE SAYING NEARLY UNREADABLE, and use big technical finance terms, all of which help further the perception that &quot;regular people&quot; can't run a business. This is a farce, and I think it's a very dangerous one because it reduces competition from the little guy with a good idea.<br><br>And please don't get married unless you love someone truly</p>		</li>

			<p>I see a lot of finger pointing and frankly it seems like everyone feels entitled to getting wealthy, but the &quot;system&quot; is not against you. Ask anyone that got rich, the only secret to it is being so passionate about what they're doing, that it seems effortless to those outside looking in. What people don't realize when they say the wage disparity is unfair is all the hard work wealthy people pour into their career. Thousands of hours of dedicated work until they MASTER their craft. Those hours are almost always unpaid but they do it anyway because they love what they're doing. And they happen to have the right traits for it: ingenuity, tenacity, self-discipline, and a little luck. But when you have the requisite traits, you make your own luck. And what most people don't have is that drive to be the absolute best. So many people complain and think &quot;that CEO doesn't deserve his wage! I want a slice of that pie!&quot; but don't understand how that CEO got there. You think these men and women somehow became the most important person in the company simply through an old boy's system, or rich parents? If your incompetent and mismanage the company your ass is fired. There's a lot more risk, but the reward is high for performing. And they got there by hard work! I would argue its even easier to find a niche market to excel at, considering there is so much technology at our disposal. Education gives us a great opportunity to chase our dreams, the public education system makes it relatively easy. Getting good grades and scoring high on those standardized tests will guarantee entry into a reputable university and a plethora of scholarships and grants. From there you master your area of expertise. &quot;But the education system is so unfair!&quot; That's because you didn't put in the work necessary for it. If you can tell me you did everything in your power to get to where those that did the same and got to where they are (hint: they don't blame external factors for their lack of success), we wouldn't be having this conversation, because you'll be busy pouring your blood and sweat into your passion. And most people don't want to do that. It’s a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top. You want the reward but not the struggle. You must love the process to have results.<br><br>I know there will be people that disagree with me, and give me examples of how hard they know someone works or does x but never get y. Well, life's not fair, seriously. But those that do have a common set of traits that few have in the general population as I mentioned above: ingenuity, tenacity, self-discipline, and a willingness to sacrifice their comfort and stability for something greater.</p>		</li>

			<p>More power to you! I guess my rant was directed to those who seemingly like to blame other people or things or factors for their lack of success or wealth. When in reality, its there, but you just gotta go get it. As for being content, I am that way too, in a way. But I think being passionate and also seeking contentment can be reached mutually, in that if you find something you enjoy doing, you fulfill both at the same time: contentment with what you're doing, and being passionate about something. I think just finding something you care about, it being just a hobby or not, and make it into a viable career makes it more than just another soul sucking job. It becomes your identity. It becomes as second nature as breathing and eating. Sorry if I didn't really answer your question. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with just clocking in and cashing checks, so long people understand that if they're not willing to turn their job into a &quot;passion&quot; where you spend every waking moment pursuing it, they can't complain about not being wealthy.</p>		</li>

			<p>People have always been greedy. Many of the poor are just as greedy as the rich, only less successful in their efforts to obtain wealth. So pointing to greed does not answer the question of why more gains are going to capital as opposed to labor. Both sides want more money, out of greed perhaps, but only one side is getting it. This is a systemic problem, and it's dangerous to reduce it to individual lack of responsibility. It makes the problem seem intractable.<br><br>Besides, even if people <em>are</em> greedier or more short-sighted now than they were in the past, you still haven't explained <em>why</em> people changed. </p>		</li>

They sit on their mountains of money and don't put it back into the economy...generally.

			<p>The Housing Crisis had a lot to do with the general crash of the world economy too.  The extremely short version is that in the early 2000's whole countries started investing in American housing. Traditionally banks have been investing in American housing forever and always got huge returns on their investment.  It worked and everyone made a lot of money back.It worked so well that in 2004(-ish) every person in America who could afford a house now had been sold a house. There was now no one left to sell houses to. Now at this point all the banks and countries collecting money on these houses could have rested on their laurels and collected payments for decades. Instead, however, they made the loan processes more lax in hope of getting new customers. At first potential homeowners needed to prove that they made enough money at their job to afford house payments, then all they needed was to prove they had any job, then all they needed was a name. Many of these new people, of course, could not pay their home loans.  That meant all these banks and countries who invested billions of dollars into these houses got next to nothing back on their returns.  At that point everyone just decided that American houses were now worth a fraction of what they had been.  All that money literally just disappeared into nothing.<br><br>After that many businesses collapsed from the lack of money being passed around. Only the biggest companies could survive, and most of them did so by laying off human workers and replacing them with more cost efficient machines.  There are now more unemployed people than there are jobs. And, again, because many of these jobs have been replaced by machines, there is no reason for these jobs to ever come back.</p>		</li>

			<p>During World War 2 the industrial centers of most advanced countries were bombed to rubble, (except the United States). It's kinda easy to be an industrial juggernaut when you have zero competition. <br><br>Eventually though, those countries rebuilt. Countries like Japan and Germany started making better products (cars, etc.) than the U.S. makes. So the monopoly we had on industry went away. <br><br>This  obviously isn't the only reason why the U.S. finds itself where it is now, but it certainly contributes to our current state of affairs.

			<p>I'm not an economist, but I am part of the millennial generation so I think I can speak from experience when I say this. <br><br>According to the book called &quot;The Defining Decade&quot; by Meg Jay, a large part of our jobless and resume-less twenty-something society is based on the &quot;30 is the new 20&quot; culture. This means that many of the millennials 20s are being used to conduct their own sort of social experiment that lacks a lot of identity capital that is absolutely crucial to build a career or a family or a fulfilling life. <br><br>Many millennials saunter through their twenties searching for an answer and going from job to job without any kind of actual intent to start a career. This makes it harder for them to find jobs in their desired career field because of their lack of specific job experience. <br><br>Many college students can't afford cars because they go to school full time and don't  even have a part-time job. And many kids that are lucky enough to go to college now  have parents that pay for everything, so they don't know how to budget when they graduate. <br><br>Another thing is that even though the millennials can navigate almost any social media site with ease, websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, etc are all very much like hieroglyphics to them.  So they can't utilize the tools that we're lucky enough to have available to us today to find a job that will lead into a career. For most people, it's easier to find a job as a barista on Craigslist. <br><br>Note: excuse my grammar and punctuation </p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;The Internet&quot;, or &quot;The Information Age&quot;, coupled with transportation advances.  People don't often talk about just how many jobs have been eliminated due to better information management.<br><br>Some of my favorite examples:<br><br>20 years ago my &quot;phone&quot; would have been made in the USA.  It would have gone to a distributor who employed people to run warehouse, take orders, and send it out.  The product would have then gone to a retailers warehouse, think Best Buy, where more people were employed to divide it up between retail stores.  The stores would receive it, and keep stock, have displays of the product someone had to set up, and sales people to sell it to me.<br><br>I just ordered a phone online, made in China, shipped by Airplane from China to my door, where it probably employed 2-4 pilots for a few hours, a box sorting person for a few seconds, and a delivery driver for a few minutes.  All those warehouse jobs and driving a truck between them, gone.  Many of the retail front end jobs of stocking, making displays gone.<br><br>What about the service industry?  If I wanted to go on a business trip from Chicago to New York in the 1950's, I probably took a train overnight.  Because of the length of travel, I probably stayed in New York for a week.  Those two items employed porters and cooks and conductors on the train, housekeeping staff, bell boys, and such at the hotel.<br><br>Today I fly out at 7AM from Chicago, have my meeting in New York, fly back at 7PM, and I employed a couple of pilots and flight attendants for a few hours.<br><br>What about manufacturing?  In the 50's, to design a part for a car you sketched it by hand.  Perhaps had someone who made a clay model.  Payed multiple machinists to custom make the first part.  Payed people to test it, in real car test mules.  More people to figure out how to manufacture it, and then more machinists to make custom tooling.<br><br>Today, a designer makes it in the computer, tests it in the computer, sends the program to a CNC mill or water jet or 3D printer which cuts out a prototype perfectly.  Perhaps there is still some testing.  Maybe there is still some custom tooling, although also largely automated in a CNC machine.  What used to take 20 people 6 months, now takes 3 a few weeks.<br><br>The middle is being hollowed out by these advances.  Low end jobs persist, because they are generally hard to automate personalized service.  There will always be a retail clerk for some things.  There will always be a bellman to get your bags out of your car at the hotel.  On the high end, there will always be jobs, someone has to be CEO.  Someone has to be the lawyer to negotiate the contract.  Someone has to be the design/idea person.  But information management and transportation keep removing all the mid-skill, mid-wage, middle class jobs.  Think of some of the things that are coming.  The self driving car?  Perhaps a novelty at home, but if a trucking company can have a self driving truck, which drives 24x7 and doesn't do amphetamines to keep up the schedule, and is always on time, and is a one time capital cost rather than wages?  Done and done.  There are 3.5 million truck drivers in the US.  I suspect self driving trucks could make 2-2.5 million no longer necessary.<br><br>Many of the other answers are right as well.  Globalization means you're competing with cheaper employees elsewhere.  The costs of education and healthcare have significant impacts on the curve.  The decline of lifetime employment in favor of a freelance economy generally depresses wages.  But at the end of the day I think the &quot;Information Age&quot; is the main answer, and the reason most people don't turn to it first is that it's been like boiling the frog.  A few more jobs eliminated every year, often in ways that seem positive or cool.  The splashy product announcement of a new 3D printer has a different light when you think about the thousands of people it will put out of work a few jobs at a time.  A self driving car has a different feel to it when you consider all the people who drive trucks, busses, taxis, or even automakers.  If I can call up a driverless car on my smart phone at any time like a taxi, car ownership will go down, and with it the need for everything from manufacturing of cars to dealerships to service technicians.<br><br>It may seem weird to say, but great economies require a particular amount of inefficiency.  Make them too efficient, and there isn't enough for everyone to do.  I fear we're going to find out for the first time in history what that really means over the next 30 years or so.</p>		</li>

			<p>A bunch of reasons, but one that hasn't been mentioned here is consolidation. Companies need to increase the amount of money they make to keep stockholders happy. However, at a certain point you end up spending more money fighting for market share than you make. So it makes more sense to buy another company and add their markets to yours. Do that 10 times, and you have a huge company, with a lot of extra employees. So you cut them to increase margins. Now there are fewer middle management (collage grad) jobs. Now that there's only one big company, a lot of the other extra jobs, like say outside advertising, no longer are required. So that business is gone too, and those jobs.<br><br>Another is the 5 year investment approach for equity capital companies. They want to make their money back fast. And they want to make a lot of it. So they cut important employees and adjust prices above sustainable levels to make more money, and make the company appear to worth more to the big companies looking to buy I mentioned above. The companies will often fail or become less prosperous after they are sold. Again, less jobs.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>I disagree. It doesn't have so much to do with individual actors exercising greed as it has to do with the structured incentives of capitalism. Even an altruistic CEO would choose to decrease wages for his employees and save the company in the long run than to keep wages the same and have the whole thing go under in six months and have everybody lose their job. The thing with capitalism is that it forces you to engage in specific kinds of market actions that you wouldn't otherwise do because the options that capitalism often gives you is bad, worse, worst. They even say it when they say &quot;there are not good options.&quot; They literally say it all the time. Accusing people of greed, I would argue, is a pretty big failure of the liberals and Democrats because mass wage stagnation and other problems like climate change , our health care debacle, and massive upcoming savings and retirement disaster, have nothing to do with people's individual choices and everything to do with the way that capitalism has organized our economic incentives for us. </p>		</li>

			<p>Housing asset prices rising against real wages. The main reason for that is a lack of infrastructure spending, or &quot;restricted supply of desirable new land&quot;. That in turn is very much the result of decades of under-taxation because of &quot;small government&quot; policies. If you are in a blaming mood you could say that is intergenerational cost shifting by the baby boomers.<br><br>Because of the large amount of infrastructure destruction which will occur in the next 100 years due to global warming it is unlikely that the infrastructure underavailability will be rectifiable by Gen Y.<br><br>(Was an actual economist, but in 'developmental economics')</p>		</li>

			<p>Allow me to throw my 2 cents in (since I'm sure not enough people have done that.)<br><br>Financial deregulation.  It's, honest to god, all about Wall Street.  Hear me out here...<br><br>In the 80s, Reagan started the deregulation trend.  His biggest target was the financial sector.  Why?  In his eyes, the more freely investment capital can move about, the more people can invest in job-creating things.  Sounds reasonable, right?<br><br>However, the only jobs being created were money movers.  Think of them as shell movers in a shell game (you know, the game where they put a token under one of 3 shells, move them around a lot, and you have to guess what shell the token is under to win).<br><br>Ultimately, the financial market overheats (Gordon Gekko, Wolf of Wall Street, blah blah blah), we have the Savings &amp; Loan crash, and suddenly we're in unexplored economic territory.  <br><br>You see, prior to this, most recessions had an external cause that could be turned on and off.  Carter's recession was due to the second OPEC oil embargo (and the stagflation at the time was due to a bungling Federal Reserve).  Most recessions before that were due to either the Fed tightening the money supply, or wars ending causing a severe drop in government spending.<br><br>But the S&amp;L crash was new...to most of us.  We deregulated a market, let it create a &quot;next big thing&quot; style feedback loop on itself, and it created tens of thousands of jobs...we didn't actually need.  And when the crash hit, those people laid off weren't just waiting around for the economy to cycle back.  They held truly worthless experience.  They held jobs that never should have been created in the first place, and were never going to come back.<br><br>Same thing happened in the late 90s and the tech bubble.<br><br>Same thing happened in the late 00s and the housing crash.<br><br>The same things will happen again in about 4-6 years when we overheat a new sector of our economy (my bet is on mobile).<br><br>Every ten years now we (Wall Street) decide to throw hundreds of billions of dollars at the latest trend, and hucksters get in and create things that follow the trend, but don't have any actual value (it's all fake), and eventually the jig is up and everyone loses their shorts over it.<br><br>A lot of the other things mentioned, globalization, technology, etc, are certainly factors.  But those have been factors for more than 150 years now.  Deregulation is the one thing that, over the past 30 years, has become &quot;new under the sun.&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>This is a multi-variate problem; there are lots of causes, and thus it is awfully difficult to ELI5. /u/dorestes' answer is terrific, but I want to point out that the <em>timing</em> of these changes is not random. There is a very specific reason that it started in the 1970s. The class-consciousness discussion is very encouraging, but if we stop at replacing capitalism with something more equitable, people might be disappointed at the results because doing so - despite being a great improvement - doesn't solve the underlying problem.<br><br>That problem is <em>energy</em>. It is not at all coincidental that we started to see a huge divergence between the 1% and the 99% in the 1970s - <a href="https://gailtheactuary.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/us-crude-oil-production-including-tight-oil.png" target="_blank">US domestic oil production peaked in 1970.</a> It was easy for capitalists to more equitably share the spoils of growth in the 1950s and 1960s, as the US was the world leader in oil production. Energy was cheap and abundant. Then, in the 1970s, we had to shift from a position of dominating world energy markets to sharing control (prior to the shale boom, the US was <em>still</em> the third largest crude oil producer in the world). So capitalists, eager to keep profits flowing, squeezed the little guy.<br><br>When the shale boom started (note, it wasn't economically feasible to extract this oil when the spot market price was less than $100/bbl, which is why this didn't start until the late 2000s), you'll note that the economic gains went nearly exclusively to the 1%; the folks in control aren't going to voluntarily loosen the screws. The profits were too good over the last 40 years, and frankly those in influence now rose to positions of influence under this highly divergent economic scheme; they are unlikely to know anything different.<br><br>You might be somewhat skeptical (I have left out a lot of details), but something that should give you some pause is to think about when the second industrial revolution kicked off... the 1880s, when the oil boom started. Energy is key.<br><br>What should be potentially terrifying is to think about how much our social organization has changed in the last 100+ years. If we cannot find a way to continue high energy availability - and you can't run a combustion engine on sunlight - we're going to have to have a major social reorganization. Away from cars, big cities, etc. A return to a more rural distribution of people. A return to a larger percentage of the workforce involved in agriculture.<br><br>(Aside: anybody talking about Bretton Woods and the US departure from the gold standard in the 1970s as a <em>cause</em> is completely, unequivocally, <em>wrong</em>.)<br><br><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Our society is built on ample energy. It is becoming more difficult and more expensive to extract, and this is &quot;encouraging&quot; elites to put the squeeze (via the capitalistic tools available to them) on the working class.</p>		</li>

			<p>true. I only pasted a portion of my article. One of the pieces from the beginning mentioned the oil shock of the 1970s.<br><br>But what with climate change and environmental impacts, going whole hog after the shale oil is still a terrible idea. I think we'll solve the energy problem--renewables are well on their way to getting there, and they'll get there faster with more government support. The combustion engine is outdated technology for most applications at this point--it's just that the alternatives are still a little too expensive at the moment.</p>		</li>

			<p>Here's one theory. The availability of student loans has caused the price of college to skyrocket. Also, due to the crash in 08 and the current outlook of social security, a lot 60+ year olds that would be retiring have been unable to do so. Therefor they have years and years of experience and of course they are going to get/keep the job in front of a college grad with no experience. </p>		</li>

The &quot;trickle down effect&quot;  suddenly trickles <strong>up</strong>. <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/c3/c3a45ba805cc3cd0d8594496743b12582110c18bb0247905e97d671316c22a80.jpg" target="_blank">Mother%&amp;@$!</a><br><br>It has to do with two economic phenomena - <strong>inflationary credit expansion</strong> (A) and <strong>Cantillon effect</strong> (B)<br>Now the slightly longer but not very difficult explanation.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The economic explanation (which I can give because I studied economics for too long) is:<br><br>Too much money for loans was made available for too long in and it drove prices too much.  Why? Because supply and demand affect money the same way as other goods. If you can create new money faster than build new houses then the price of houses will go up because the value - purchasing power - of money goes down. Whatever is scarce  and in demand is valuable. Same is true for new cars - if there's too many consumer loans the dealers will jack the prices up and the manufacturers will be happy and won't make more cars to drop the price. No sir!<br><br>The prices would normally fall - just like it happened after the 2008 crash - but that would mean too much money would evaporate from the banks (also known as deflation) and that just couldn't stand. GDP would contract, a crisis would strike and that might cost the politicians an election! Screw dropping standard of living! We might lose the next election!!!! So the government and the fed kept propping the credit bubble up and even increasing it.For years and years and years.   And the prices kept rising and rising.. long enough for the <strong>cantillon effect</strong> to occur. This is the key and an important term to remember - because it is soooo obscure and pundits and politicians like to talk about getting new taxes, dropping interest rates more, introducing new laws... And never address the real issue! Besides who'd care about some Cantillon? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cantillon" target="_blank">Who was he?</a> A Frenchman? An Irishman! Get out!<br><br>-----<br><br><strong>Cantillon effect</strong> occurs when a lot of new money is introduced into the economy through very few channels. Meaning when not everyone suddenly gets a 100$ bill stuck into a wallet but when the banks can borrow money from the FED at a much lower rate. Then the banks get it first, play a bit on the financial markets, then perhaps invest in some stocks and that money slowly, slowly, very slowly trickles down to you. There's just one 'but'. Whoever gets it first can use its full purchasing power. As it filters down through the economy people realize that there's more money and the value of it (the purchasing power) falls down. So whoever gets the money last gets the least of purchasing power. Whoever gets the money first spends it on a market that is <em>not yet aware of this new money</em>.<br><br>The problem? There's no difference between &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; money. So if a bank creates one billion new dollars it will affect the value of the new dollars just as much as the value of the old dollars in your wallet.  And if the credit expansion was happening continuously since the 1987 crisis and the post Gulf-war recession (which cost George Bush Sr the election)... That's almost 25 years of printing money to suck out all the life from your wallet. <br><br>Only the bank and the government can keep printing, and printing, and printing.... And they get bailouts, TARPS, quantitative easings... And you have to keep <em>working</em> for your wages.  You have only two hands and there's only 24 hours and 52 weeks.<br><br>----<br><br>This is really what causes the &quot;drop in real wages&quot;. The wages don't decrease. You don't get wage cuts but the money you are earning isn't worth as much as it used to be before. And while people keep telling you that &quot;inflation is consistently low&quot;...  remember that inflation is measured to avoid &quot;systemic shocks&quot; such as rapid growth in oil price, housing bubbles, higher ed bubbles...<br><br>Pretty much everywhere where the inflation really hurts.  If you want to know how badly put a baloon in your butt and blow it up with a compressor. That's how much it hurts. Damn inflation.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>There are obviously other causes too. Jobs are getting scarce because the market is volatile. Companies can't get credit or capital for investment and can't expand and employ people - especially when Li and Wong work for a bowl of rice. Banks have too much troubled assets and can give loans for free like 10 years ago. Unless you are an old white guy - but even then it's not guaranteed. But the reason why this here - <strong>above</strong> - is <em>the</em> explanation is that in times like this prices should <strong>fall</strong>.  Just like the prices in 2008 did. Just like the housing bubble in Nevada brought new homes in Las Vegas from hot properties for 150k  to vacant lots at 25k. Just like the property bubble in Britain in the late 80s drove the price for a broom closet in the City of London to 25000 pounds and then brought it back to a pack of peanuts in 1991.<br><br>Shit doesn't sell anymore! People are out of work! So why <em>some</em> prices are still so high? <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/57/574aa510639422f9e66a9832de8c6bfcad2b57a23afa95c8488baa81ee6ed301.jpg" target="_blank">Why is it so too damn high I am asking you!!!</a><br><br>You need to get the money <em>out of the economy</em>. And that means &quot;deflation&quot;. And the banks and the politicians poop in their pants when they hear this.

			<p>I'll explain the understanding that I have at the risk of possibly being wrong.<br><br>Say ten years ago a pack of gum cost half as much as it does today. Same goes for countless other consumer products in our hypothetical. That doubling number is roughly what is labeled the inflation rate.<br><br>But you want to buy a house. Near a city. The land supply is finite and dwindling. Population is increasing rapidly. In the past ten years, let's say almost all housing has gone up 8x.<br><br>Housing's a fairly small portion of our country's overall market, so it doesn't get represented much in inflation, but local to the housing market that number is HUGE. </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rotorain" target="_blank">rotorain</a>
			<p>This sounds right to me. The cost of a pack of gum only doubled, but the cost of a college education went up to 100 times its original value. So for people who don't care about getting an education because they already have one or have other options, that insane level of inflation doesn't apply to them. The inflation is &quot;localized&quot; to the market of people who are trying to get an education. And since that market is shrinking as people decide a college degree isn't worth $100k, but everyone is still buying gum, the education inflation spike has a relatively low effect on the whole picture. <br><br>Then, look at what commodities are experiencing inflation spikes. Most of them are stacked up to fuck over younger people and make it impossible to get anything without a loan. Which the people who are already rich will sell you. In huge quantities. So if you already have money, that money will multiply on its own, while the people working for their money don't get that multiplier to keep them in front of inflation in markets that matter to them. </p>		</li>

			<p>So to actually see the standard of living change we should calculate the real inflation based on some index of wares we usually buy. Is there any such metric? Not overall inflation or local inflation, but perceived or real inflation as the general population sees it. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well, that's the thing. You don't usually buy houses. You might do so a few times in your life, but you're buying groceries at least once a month. The groceries are what you usually buy and what gets represented. Really, individual numbers for different sectors of the market would be best.</p>		</li>

			<p>General price increase is the standard &quot;inflation&quot;. All prices going up a notch every year or so.<br><br>Market-wide is a poor name (I made it up) for an increase in money supply entering one specific market. It is simply a local asset bubble. <br><br>I really should say that.

			<p>I dont think money printing is a major cause of inflation. You see low inflation in things like food. You would see higher inflation there if the cause was money printing. It is not like agriculture got that much more efficient over the past few decades.<br><br>I think you are right that real inflation has to include housing and education.

			<p>LOL!  That was a <strong>joke</strong>. <br><br>I actually didn't pursue any of the PhD in either of my fields (engineering or social science) and I am still hesitating because I do have ideas I'd like to write about in both. Perhaps in the future. Friends of mine are getting PhD in my field so once they're higher up the doctorate will be easier to get through. I'm in Europe so the regime here is different and depends a lot on the country. I am trying to avoid serfdom and just get my degree even if it costs me a bit. Hence the hesitation.<br><br>Since my fields are not very rewarding in relative terms to hard-core STEM for example (private sector is much more profitable)  I actually never considered pursuing an academic career. Even though I love research.  Unfortunately academic career is mostly bureaucratic wasteland and often byzantine hierarchies constant fight for funding...and only then some satisfaction.<br><br>Oh and the students.

			<p>Sure. <br><br>I have no idea how electrical engineering fits into economics and law. This seems ... highly irregular.  <br><br>Physics and electrical engineering is a really nice mix. PhD there might be challenging mostly because it will block off a potential more profitable career. Economics is always useful because it's incredibly interdisciplinary and physics and economics helps in finance at the tech-wiz level. Political science IMHO is a waste of time. Mostly demagoguery which you can avoid by simply educating yourself smartly. I have friend who went PhD and further in political science and I can't see how they have an edge in practical matters over me. It just helps in their academic careers - which mostly suck in that field.  Latin - that's for fun I presume.<br><br>Law... now law is useful if you want to get engaged in business but law school seems like more than the general course. Weird. Very random.<br><br>Are you sure that you're not spreading yourself a bit too think. Schools tend to overcrowd syllabuses with junk courses and you might refine what you are interested in by arranging an interdisciplinary study if your school would permit. Saves time and adds an edge on paper.<br><br>PhD in economics or law - only if you intend a career in academia in that field. Then political science is a plus. Electrical engineering however.... hmm...  </p>		</li>

			<p>pharmaceus. This is a great post. I too am an economist and agree with your assessment. You might do well to offer some additional resources for readers of this thread, who are interested in learning more about these subjects from sources that are not skewed by a strictly neo-classical or Keysian bias. Maybe &quot;Money Illusion&quot; by: Irving Fisher or Minsky's &quot;Can 'It' Happen Again&quot; would have been good suggestions. You might have also done well to discuss liquidity traps with citation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap</a>).<br>I particularly like your last statement. Pretty much all the national governments are pooping bricks, as they have no clue how to exit the insanity that they've generated. Although many commentators would call this time period unprecedented, that is not strictly true, as there are any number of historical examples where governments have done the same (Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe, and the Roman Denarius to name a few). It is rather common for governments to debase currencies, papering over their problems. This is the easiest action in the near-term and possibly the most destructive in the long-term. The big difference now is that the debt backed nature of our currencies ensures that as central banks sow inflation, they will only reap deflation (as you astutely identified in your comment). What does make this period unprecedented imho is the scale of the problem (Global). Keep up the good work. Your post was the best on this thread.</p>		</li>

			<p>Because it was the only one - other than the somewhat on point - top post which actually addressed economic issues.  I do think the second one suggest as much - that one about how you could go to college and pay for it in its entirety with a summer job or a second shift during the semester.<br><br>One of the other ones points out something which I forgot to add - that thing about expectations. If your entire world is set in a perpetual bubble from 1990 to 2007 then as a millenal you enter a completely unknown territory with prolonged crisis and price levels which make it completely unattainable to live as your parents lived.<br><br>But since it's high enough there's no point for me to add it. <br><br>I also don't think we're in Weimar/Zimbabwe yet. I remember a very high inflation personally - during the last years of the People's Republic of Poland it was in the 100-200% annual range and it hurt despite the formal &quot;central planning&quot; in the economy. Right now it's very much local -through asset bubbles all over the place - and is sinking in slowly, very slowly. This is why QE can create trillions and yet we barely feel it - because it all went into the black holes of derivatives markets and other speculatives. Essentially it only maintains us at a 2007 level - perhaps slightly higher in general terms.  We'll see what happens next.  Hopefully nothing too bloody or destructive.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're an idiot and certainly not an economist. Banks have regulations that forbid them from investing in financial markets. Banks don't have any control over monetary policy whatsoever. The Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to maintain a relative equilibrium in the economy. The change in purchasing power is the change in quantity of goods purchased with a fixed amount of money over time. Inflation is so subtle that you would not be able to notice the change in purchasing power over a short period of time. If inflation was that rapid, we would experience huge increases in the price of normal goods.<br><br>Your entire post is one big fallacy of ambiguity.

			<p>Most economists argue against deflation simply because it's politically untenable or they are banking analysts - and deflation is a death kiss for the banking system.  Most economists simply don't do economics when talking about inflation and deflation but talk politics. Most economists are either Keynesian or post-Keynesian in term of macro in the US and UK. I know plenty of economists who approach deflation differently - not with enthusiasm but with realism.  If it happens then it happens and we know how to deal with it.<br><br>Deflation in the short term it is sharper and more violent than inflation. In the long term deflation is far more manageable than inflation. Also you can correct deflation with controlled inflationary impulses. There's no way to deflate an inflationary bubble once it grows too much.<br><br>So I say deflation is a c4 bomb. Inflation is a biological weapon.</p>		</li>

			<p>Inflation and deflation are caused by changes in supply and demand of money and output.  Once you inject/remove either there's an adaptation phase and equilibrium phase. In an adaptation phase you can change it because it's still a whole bunch of information signals being distributed through market. Once it reaches equilibrium and stops naturally then the new supply/demand has exhausted its transformative properties and you have physically remove money or increase output to re-start the adaptation phase again.<br><br>So you can and can't - it depends on the stage of the process which one.  If you start deflation and it still is running you can stop it or soften it by creating money. If you start inflation you can stop it or soften it by shutting down creation or increasing interest rates. Once deflation hits bottom and inflation stops however and you want to do something about it you need to either throw or take a lot of money or some productive capacity.<br><br>I did use a lot of confusing language but that's unfortunately what you get in a confusing environment such as this.

			<p>IMO Baumol disease is not &quot;against classical economics&quot; but simply a model gone too far in separating variables which was then interpreted by confused or tired people.<br><br>This is how I see it. At a certain level of wage growth all labour starts to move towards high homogeneity. Simply speaking the higher the marginal cost of acquiring specialized labour in a given sector (experiencing increase in productivity resulting in increase of salaries ) the lower the marginal cost of acquiring unspecialized labour.<br><br>This is how in Norway people with training in mechanical engineering and physics find employment in energy sector looking for chemical engineers.  The cost of acquiring another qualified employee is equal or greater of the cost of acquiring unqualified employee and the necessary training.   If the market is sufficiently restricted then the unqualified employees will most likely come from domestic rather than foreign labour markets. And therefore their current employers have to increase salaries so as to prevent the brain drain of their own workforce.<br><br>Actually very basic phenomenon. 1960s were an age of criticism towards classical economics for political reasons. That's why so much weak theory was produced back then.It was the trend regardless of how solid it was.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's quite a thoughtful response. I certainly wouldn't disagree with you characterization of the 1960s/1970s trends in theory. But still, as a gedankenexperiment, the theory was pretty strong as a predictor. One of the side effects predicted was a siphoning of labor resources to sectors that were difficult to add capital to because productivity didn't increase with added capital. Teachers, police and, of course orchestral musicians. <br><br>No theory is perfect. Some contribute to our weak understanding of reality. I think Baumol did.</p>		</li>

			<p>The current state of neo-classical/classical economics is to the 60s/70s as is 20th century physics to its 19th century predecessor.  The problem was that a lot of contesting theories were politically motivated and as such they rejected the general paradigm rather than trying to expand it.  Classical economist is still a hodge-podge of better and worse models because it is a mathematical construct put on a philosophical basis. The philosophical side was already well explained in the 19th century. However once you put it in scientific terms you often drag people who don't know that philosophy at all and will run in circles with their imperfect theories instead of looking up what their predecessors thought.<br><br>The problem - philosophical economics, the old &quot;political economy&quot; is really no different from political demagoguery in its form. You can read Marx and think this guy makes sense because his critics write quite similarly. It's in the details that Marx is wrong and subjectivists are right. Also since Smith/Ricardo preferred Labour Theory of Value and Smith is said to be &quot;right&quot; how can this be wrong. A lot of confusion there. And if you lack insight and are biased because of approaching neo-classical economics from the wrong end (expecting clear data et al) then you can easily fall into the pitfall of some Marxian. Keynesian etc <em>political</em> paradigm and thus reject good <em>philosophical</em> underpinnings of the <em>political</em> paradigm of Smith, Bastiat, Hayek etc.</p>		</li>

			<p>Very True. When I went off to college in the late 80's, it only cost me $700/semester in tuition and another $300/semester in books. I studied at the top Aerospace Science college in the US at that time. Today, just an art school will charge you 25-50k/ year.</p>		</li>

			<p>$50-$60k for a bachelors is TWICE what it should cost. I don't know a single person with an undergraduate degree who paid more than $30k for it. THAT is the problem. Teenagers are fucking horrible with money and student loan lenders are practically throwing money at them knowing they can't not pay it back. It's exactly like the housing bubble, except the lenders won't have to deal with defaults or selling houses. My fiancé gets a notice almost every year telling her who swapped her student loan debt.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is the situation I'm in as a 2008 class highschool graduate. College is too expensive to afford with an entry level job, and all of the jobs out there which I could afford higher education with require me to have already obtained higher education. There's a TON of open positions and jobs in the IT, website administration and software engineering field, but I'm barred from that field because there's no way to brute force my way in through work experience and no way to afford the education necessary for it.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is the same problem as with religion or language or nationality - all of those are man-invented. There is nothing you can measure objectively to search into the &quot;right&quot; system and its mostly belief that &quot;your&quot; system is the right one. <br><br>The same is with economics. People believe capitalism is the &quot;right&quot; system because it still works &quot;somehow&quot;, and they tend to overlook its faults.

			<p>I would like to add that a lot of the reason for this is that recessions have occurred more and more frequently. That results in the largest generation (baby boomers) having less than they thought to retire with and forcing them to work longer and not retire. We need those jobs to vacate allowing those jobs to be taken by people leaving college. </p>		</li>

			<p>There are a lot of problems in America, and while inflation isn't the biggest reason for this difference, it's the only undeniable downward trend of inflation increases being higher than wage increases to adjust for inflation.<br><br>It's worth noting though that &quot;car ownership is much less common&quot; is a massive exaggeration.  Cars used to be something you bought when you were 30 years old, and now you can pick up a nice used car at 19 or 20 so if anything cars are significantly easier to get. <br><br>To put it simply, the market is saturated with so many cool things that consumers do what they do best:  consume...and they don't prioritize traditional things such as home ownership.  There are other things you can blame it on, but it's really more that the new generation prioritizes ownership of many things, rather than a home and car first.  <br><br>In fact, my sister owns two homes, a 4-year in Finance, a 2-year in CS, and is completing a 4-year Law degree, and she's only about 6 years older than me but she makes intelligent financial decisions and wastes as little as possible.  <br><br>It might be easy to blame the economy, but the economy is easier than ever to predict compared to the past.  If you prioritize home and car ownership, of course you're going to have it...but if you prioritize having a brand new car, cutting edge smartphones, and a top of the line television well, it should go without saying that it will take you longer than it did for your parents.<br><br>And lets not even go into the historical differences between consumer mindsets, that's a whole other bag of worms.  Then again, this IS ELI5, not Explain-Like-I'm-A-Bored-Financial-Oriented-Major.  </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; it's a controversial issue and I very consciously left it at that<br><br>This is why I generally don't like to see questions like this appear on ELI5.  So many questions that are presented here just can't be explained &quot;like I'm 5,&quot; so they produce answers which are almost necessarily superficial, controversial or misleading. Moreover, as many have observed, many of the questions on ELI5 are even worse because  they are loaded to suggest a specific partisan view.

			<p>&gt; Wages have been stagnant and even dropping relative to inflation for quite a long time now<br><br>Since about the 70s, in fact. During the same time, executive pay has zoomed to obscene levels. Executive pay is generally given as the ratio of worker:executive pay, and in the 1960s, it was hovering around 1:30. Today, it's in the 1:390 range. Note that this figure is <em>independent</em> of inflation.<br><br>So the ELI5 answer is that the ultra-rich have been looting a greater and greater slice of the pie from the economy since the 60s. They can do this because it's THEY who get to decide how much everybody gets paid.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;Wages have been stagnant and even dropping relative to inflation for quite a long time now<br><br>This is false though, attempts to make this seem to be the case typically ignore:<br><br>1.

Include public employees, ignore salaried employees, make all kinds of CPI/inflation errors<br><br>How about real compensation per hour? <br><br><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org//fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?g=UZ3" target="_blank">http://research.stlouisfed.org//fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?g=UZ3</a><br><br>Disposable income per capita?

There are also other problems like changes in depreciation in the value of capital and knowledge and changing import numbers.<br> <br>Generally the idea that people are not being compensated for productivity gains is just nonsensical with the way our economy is structured. <strong>It would require a massive conspiracy of all or nearly all employers to not compete for my productivity</strong>. If I generated $20 and my boss only paid me $10, I could easily find another employer who would give me $20. It would take some conspiracy of laughable size to get them all agree to cap my wages at $10 - if anyone broke the conspiracy and paid me $11 they'd be making $9.<br><br>Reddit's entire economic hivemind is based on bad and/or misleading statistics, go figure</p>		</li>

			<p>none of us are economists?!  I actually am.  Labor isn't one of my fields but like anyone I have an interest in it.<br><br>I think you hit some salient points, but I think what isn't answered is why any of this occurred.  I think, and again this isn't something I have studied in great detail just with passing interest, that the baby boom really really threw things off in the US.  Came out of WW2 with a huge population AND productivity surge.  Though technology continues to improve, the technological changes occurring in the 50-80s was something different.  And the PC became practical around the same time the baby boom was really hitting the work force.  This means that everything was great (even granting the oil crisis in the 70s and the recession in the 80s).  It led to a very odd sense that things would continue to improve economically without end. The GI bill also granted college access to a lot of people that probably wouldn't have gone on to higher education otherwise, and without data to back me, I think this may have been a beginning of a change in mind set about who goes to college.  This surge in college students does two things: it increases demand which pushes prices upwards, but also lead to a bunch of opportunities to turn profits on a personal level.  Higher education became a profitable industry. This is where I'll leave that, but there are clearly great challenges in education even when profit seeking doesn't start to come into play.<br><br>Couple this with an aging work force now that is becoming more reliant on the gov to take care of, and which also constitutes the largest active voting bloc in our country.  Laws are passed that focus on the old not the young.  Laws protect entrenched property owners, making it difficult for markets to correct (the bay area is a prime example of this). It means that the gov spends about $60k a year on helping those over the age of 65 while the gov spends about $5k on those under 18.  <br><br>The system is top heavy. <br><br>Those are just some of my ignorant thoughts as an economist.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;  And the PC became practical around the same time the baby boom was really hitting the work force.<br><br>Quibbler in chief here:  The peak of the baby boom was in the mid-late 1950s (although it's really hard to say when the boom started and stopped, I usually think of it as 1947 - 1965).  Those born in 1955 entered the workforce in 1971, or 1968, depending on whether they went to college or not.  The IBM PC was the first successful business oriented computer and it was introduced in 1981, when a &quot;mere&quot; 1.6 million were shipped.  <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-940713.html" target="_blank">Source</a><br><br>&gt; The GI bill also granted college access to a lot of people that probably wouldn't have gone on to higher education otherwise<br><br>Quibble 2:<br><br>The boomers were not eligible for the GI Bill.  Their parents, though, might have been, and developed an exaggerated opinion of higher education.  By 1947, nearly half of all admissions were veterans. Although it's important to note that the GI Bill was widely used for trade schools - not everyone was in University by any means.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;Manufacturing jobs have been sent overseas<br><br>Yes and no. The US is still a major manufacturing base, <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.CD/countries/1W?order=wbapi_data_value_2010%20wbapi_data_value&amp;amp;sort=desc&amp;amp;display=default" target="_blank">the number 2 producer in the world</a>, and accounts for 21% of all manufacturing world wide. The big change is that, due to automation, manufacturing takes far less people today. This is why even if you brought back all the manufacturing from China, it would not bring back all the lost jobs.<br><br>We have changed to a service economy, and thus our job market needs different skills today.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;We have changed to a service economy, and thus our job market needs different skills today.<br><br>Our economy has shifted dramatically. I wouldn't blame automation so much. I believe it has a much smaller impact then what people are being led to believe. Manufacturing has outpaced the population growth as people tend to have more stuff today then they use to 30 years ago. It's just not the manufacturing jobs but the jobs that support manufacturing that have suffered as well. Look at the bike industry. Almost all frames are made in China and Taiwan today. It's not solely due to wages but a limited availability of the raw materials needed to produce the bikes in the US. Most of the tubing suppliers have closed shop and those that do build their bikes in the US pay a premium for the material. A US made mountain bike frame costs over $2,000 (just the frame!) and the manufacturers are not getting rich from it. Other blue collar jobs that relied on lower level workers to move up in their field are suffering as well. Machinist, welders, operators etc are all in short supply. Most businesses that have wanted to keep their production in the US are finding themselves forced to move overseas because of this. Meanwhile, our education system is pushing everyone into the same basic fields.</p>		</li>

			<p>I attended an talk about alteratives to capitalism, and we started talking about how if you've got a peach tree and you'll never be able to eat them all so they're going to rot, and others are hungry should you give them peaches. A large part agreed that if they were to pick the peaches for themselves then they should get to eat them. These kids straight up said they should starve because its their fault they dont have a peach tree and the peach tree owner owes them nothing, even if they were to pick the peaches. I asked them if they were inferring that the peach tree owners right to peaches surpassed the hungry peoples right to life, and they shouted 'well clearly you've never taken economics 101!!'<br><br>I've never heard someone say that other people straight up deserve to starve to death until then. It was bizarre. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well, that's pretty much the Econ 101 view of the world, so I don't really fault them for parroting back what their professors told them. <br><br>That being said, economics is a broad discipline, and I hope that they'd take some 300-level courses, too. </p>		</li>

			<p>No, they are completely at fault. It's your job to question what you learn and always try to be a morally good person. If these fucking kids can't understand how clearly evil it is to let people die over trivial shit like not having any food while you have a rotting mass of surplus food, theyre just plain idiots... evil, closed-minded, undeserving idiots. Nope not even from a purely mathematical point of view does it work. If you want something from society, you work or provide for it yourself as well, so they can continue the cycle and eventually services and goods are provided for you. If you let the whole town suffer from starvation because you own the only abundant source of food, most of them will die, and the &quot;lucky&quot; ones that live wont have the energy to work, and soon all you will be left with is yourself and your stupid food, and if that runs out you gotta do all the work yourself to find/hunt for more, and do everything else yourself. See? Being evil and all for yourself is both morally bad and logically does not work out for you. That's where it goes in the end.<br><br>Realistically, in those times, you'd just get beaten and murdered and then that tree would belong to the mob. (As someone pointed out, the mob <em>appears</em> to have disappeared. No, now some of them just get to wear uniforms and carry guns, some of them have that but without the badges, and the rest are every day citizens that are so disconnected from each other that they don't even realize they could become the strongest mob.)<br><br>I know they teach logic in economics in general, and I know most teachers are still at least morally good enough to bring up points like this, like the guy above did. If students don't understand and follow that, they're just too stupid and inexperienced, as I explained in my first paragraph. You become undesirable as a person, burn bridges down, etc. Until you can invent robots to do all of that shit for you, and you have the knowledge and access to resources to keep those robots maintained (or they're just that automated and self-sufficient they can do it themselves)... you need other people, and you need to do work for them so they can do work for you, one way or another everyone has a place and needs to chip in. Others get around it by making it seem like the &quot;work&quot; they do deserves the biggest cut, because they have a way with words, family history.... and a shitload of hired guns. Just trust the logic... if there was a monopoly on all the necessary resources, and they weren't being shared, 2 things would happen: Lots of people would die due to lack of resources, and lots of people would die fighting to gain back access to those resources. Lots of death, lots of people with skills, knowledge, and strength disappearing... less people to help you, less people to keep the good parts of the system going.<br><br><br>As far as the entire human race goes, this method won't last much longer. Its slowing down progress, people are getting more and more sick of this shit, and their numbers are growing, as well as their access to higher technology and information on how to use/build it. There will be a balance coming soon this generation, just make sure you're on the right side.</p>		</li>

			<p>We are more than animals. We can think for ourselves, we can deny ourselves immediate satisfaction to contribute to the greater good.

			<p>I know it was only one person that downvoted you, but still, that guy is a fucking moron, and the guy above is way too narrow minded and he's getting more upvotes for backing up that godawful belief. Where are these kids' heads today where they don't understand that what you're saying is true? Yea, we have the brain parts that evolved from reptilian and other periods... and now we have the <em>human</em> parts of the brain, where we form amazingly complex thoughts and ideas, concepts... and I believe that we are actually capable of feeling different kinds of emotions than other animals, emotions you could only feel through certain kinds of realizations that only highly evolved beings with brains like us can have. We're more than wolves, and lions, and deer... We're certainly not mindless ants. Hell ants work together in GIGANTIC colonies far better than any living organism I've ever seen, and they're idiots... so with that said, where the hell do people get off thinking we have an excuse to be evil and apathetic just because certain other animals are? So we're the same as wolves, but less than ants? Is that what some people don't mind admitting?<br><br>Yes, we're animals, but we're different animals. We are very intelligent animals. Some animals only protected their immediate family and purposely let others die, or killed them, because they didn't know any better. They don't know what their purpose is as a living, reproducing being. It's to live, reproduce, grow, explore, populate. Not kill, steal, and conquer. We're all on this planet together. Fighting and killing and taking from ourselves is just like a single body with Autoimmune disease.<br><br>We are far more intelligent and resourceful than that. We have no excuse to act like common unintelligent animals. We have the emotional capacity, intelligence, and strength to help care for our entire population. That's what we are meant to do. We know that we're only hurting ourselves, and we know how big of an impact a SINGLE death makes across dozens of families. We know the benefits of keeping our entire community strong. We know that two scientists get more than twice the research done than a single scientist, and 10 scientists are magnitudes more resourceful than a single scientist working 10x as fast. As we strengthen and provide for more and more people, our potential for faster and more efficient progress in computer, transportation, building, and medical technology increases at a higher and higher rate. And we know what will happen in the &quot;end&quot; when we've reached a certain plateau in all that research. We'll all be able to have whatever we want (within reason, like, not trying to be a demonic world ruler or whatever), never worry about cancer, can travel anywhere, &quot;work&quot; and &quot;jobs&quot; won't mean the same thing in the future. It'll be all but 100% automated, and we'll all have the knowledge and tools to fix any little problems, but for the most part 99% of our time will be spent with people we love, doing whatever the hell we want, traveling anywhere we want.<br><br>That is what we're working towards for our entire race. Even if you care about no one, and only want it for yourself... Do you honestly think you can make all this happen on your own for yourself? Fuck no. It takes thousands of people in each field of research to get this shit done at a decent pace.<br><br>That is why education and higher quality living is important. We need to nurture our community if we want to get anything decent out of it for ourselves and those we care about. Or we can just continue to live like savages, and live short lives, where we spend the last 20-40 years in constant pain, going through painful and scary medical procedures, getting cut into, getting spinal injections, worrying about getting cut into and injected outside of the medical places (aka getting attacked on the street)... If you guys are into living in hell... go for it. Or you can get with the program and help the rest of us live to see a new golden age of society, where there is no more suffering, oppression of the good (only of evil ideas and evil actions), and just lots of fun and leisure for all.<br><br>No matter how many people you want it for, we all have to work together if we want to live to see it happen. The more of us that work together, the sooner it will come. <br><br>If you want motivation, find a bunch of old people in their 70s/80s/90s and ask them what they go through at hospitals, and realize that our medical technology still isn't close to the shit we see in the most optimistic sci-fi movies, that they still go through hell... and if society continues to progress at a sluggish rate (honestly I think it's going a little fast... though we could do with less interference for sure, and more emphasis on education so we can get more people involved), YOUR visits to the hospital at YOUR inevitable old age will be a scary, living, HELL.<br><br>So the next time you think about being apathetic and only living for yourself, remember that. We'll all inevitably be old, and maybe some of us will wish we did more to help, so that we don't have to live through the shit we're going through, and die so soon or in a very unsettling/painful way.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Let's be actually realistic here. Let's assume you have the only source of food in town, which is a magic tree that produces food; you want to maximize the amount of food you have; and, you want to avoid other people taking your tree. <br><br>The best way to achieve this would be to give just enough food to enough of the population to keep the rest of the population from taking your tree.  If you're truly seeking to maximize this food, as people grow less able to seize your tree, you can slowly have less people guarding you and your tree.<br><br>In reality, but still in a simplistic fashion, this is how actually things work except you may specialize in food production and trade some of the food to someone else who specializes, in perhaps, woodworking. Everyone gets fed as long as they can engage in an enterprise relatively better than you can. (And they don't even have to be better than you at the enterprise, just willing to do it for less than you value yourself doing it)</p>		</li>

			<p>what would happen is, you give the food to those without, and they owe you, usually in terms of money, and they would give you the fruit of their labour, say they make clothes, they sell clothes and give you the money. That being said, it's not a perfect system, otherwise people in Haiti and Africa would not be starving. Would you say that because America doesn't share its food it is evil? Quite the opposite, America use to donate food to poor countries, what that did was cheapen the price of food locally, bankrupting the farmers, so the coming year more people are starving. The correct way is to send money to buy as closely to the source of hunger as possible. Now why did the farmer not simply give the food away to starving people? Are they evil? No, because they can't, they would bankrupt themselves if they simply gave it away, so they sold it to whoever paid the highest price, and as a result those without money starved. What we have is not a perfect system, but it is an effective one, without modern economic systems, most of the world would starve and die, and if you can somehow come up with the answer to change that, you will receive the Nobel economics prize from now onto eternity.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're misinterpreting the story of the peach tree and then putting words in my mouth... I never gave a complex system to the peach tree scenario.<br><br>And yes, the people in charge of that part of America would be evil for not sharing food if people wanted it. That specific scenario you're talking about doesn't prove that sharing is bad... it's just that it was ruining their particular system that they set up. That doesn't apply at all to the peach tree scenario.<br><br>Yes, the farmer needs sustenance as well, and needs money, in that scenario you're talking about. You can't lump what I'm saying in one analogy to a totally different one and use that to say what I'm expressing in one is no longer right....<br><br>Besides that, I see what you're saying and I agree on some of it, but it's not worth getting into all the details on what I think is right and wrong.<br><br>Let me explain the point of my main post. I never said I had an answer and could solve this economic crisis myself, otherwise I'd be doing that instead of posting here. I just said this is what I believe is right and wrong, efficient and inefficient, and that one day in the near future there will be a change to our system in the near future. Our ease of access to information, massive wireless communication, faster transport, and level of technology are now reaching a point where very soon a huge change will come to how human society operates throughout a large part of the world.<br><br>Yes, some system needs to be put in place, I never called for anarchy. I'm saying it's very flawed and there are definitely changes that can be made even right now to drastically make things more fair. People think it will be decades from now, yea before we see a major change. However, nothing is physically stopping us from making changes every day, like adjusting minimum wage instead of ignoring it like everyone will just pretend we've always been not able to afford rent and groceries without cramming 10 people into a 3 bedroom house.<br><br>Economics is a huge, constantly changing beast, supply and demand for things changing all the time, it's incredibly complex and sometimes as random as the weather... but that doesn't mean the masses can't rationally agree to rule changes. Society isn't as retarded as they are portrayed in certain cartoons, or movies like Idiocracy. And it's not like the rule changes are permanent, or that it's a requirement to wait 6 or 12 months to make changes... no law of physics says that lawmaking has to always be done the way it's currently being done. <br><br>Well, as we can see, not everyone realizes this. But thanks to wireless communication, websites like reddit, the ever advancement of other technology.... the world continues to change and change, and more and more the masses are able to communicate, connect with, share, and work together with each other, and accomplish more and more things. Someday soon we'll do something great to make the economy work better for more people. You can see it too, right?</p>		</li>

			<p>I wasn't disagreeing with the principle of what you said per se, only that it is more complicated than what you presented. I think, to achieve what you envision, we would need a truly unified humanity, and the west will be giving up a lot of their privileges to make that happen, and people don't like to give up comfort they're accustomed to, but it is slowly eroding anyway. Perhaps one day we will truly enter an age of abundance for all, but I fear that once everyone becomes accustomed to luxury, humanity becomes a race of pure thinkers and nothing gets done, and that could lead to disaster. Life is meant to be a struggle, not a luxury cruise, that's how many advances came to be, and once we're all content to a utopian world, humanity could become stagnant. Nevertheless, I do agree with you that everyone should have enough to eat, though I wonder, who gets to eat the good food, and who gets to eat the cheap food?</p>		</li>

It's all still there, we just all wear different clothes and call ourselves by different titles now. They're the ones that ultimately decide on property rights.

			<p>Well, don't forget that culturally our system is widely accepted among the general population and reflects our willingness to personally enforce those distinctions in property and forms of accumulation. The police do the heavy lifting but we make the system efficient, ourselves, in other ways. <br><br>And we can't ignore the deeper question that remains to be answered at the bottom of all this: why is the current system's form of violence proven so efficient and usable, considering the myriad other 'mobs' which could take its place or actively oppose it? Surely there's something to be said about how well this system operates to subdue its competition and thus serve its constituent parts as best as possible, to remain in place with its survivors' blessing. <br><br>The common defense of property is that it's working so well, now, regardless of how it was first legitimated. </p>		</li>

Information pirates take care of that already, we just need more people willing to learn, and make monetary sacrifices to Fry's and Radioshaq to get a little experience in. It's really not so hard if you know how to read diagrams and have a few simple shop tools. Sure not all shop tools are cheap, but then that's why we meet people and work together. <br><br>And from what I've read, at least in America, the military is on the side of the people.

			<p>&gt;&gt; so I don't really fault them for parroting back what their professors told them.<br><br>&gt;I DO fault people for not doing any critical thinking of their own<br><br>What is there to think about critically? Most of the theory taught in Econ 101 is mathematically proven correct, <em>given the assumptions made</em>. The tricky bit is that many of the assumptions don't hold in the real world, so Econ 101 theory is of limited practical application, but this nuance is easy to miss since most professors recognize that many students struggle with econ and they try to avoid confusing the freshmen too badly by dwelling on that. <br><br>That's why I'm saying it's really worth going beyond the basics. </p>		</li>

			<p>As someone that teaches Econ 101, I'm sorry if that's how you were taught. That's not the view in modern economics at all. I'm going to be lazy and parrot some of the text I wrote in a response above:<br><br>&gt;   Economics doesn't just say &quot;capitalism is awesome&quot; or &quot;the free market is the best ever&quot;. If that's what your econ 101 professor told you, I'm sorry, you didn't get a quality class. We study problems with capitalism, like inequality, environmental externalities, resource depletion, and free riding. We worry about consequences of policies like bailouts, government support of loan systems, and how to deal with insurance when sick people need coverage (but people don't want to pay taxes and business want profits).<br></p>		</li>

For a society to be prosperous it needs to have productive constituents. For constituents to be productive they need to be COMFORTABLE. They can't be comfortable and secure if they are struggling to always remain afloat.<br><br>I'm not sure how they can't see that by taking away security from the masses it's like undermining the foundations of a building to get materials to renovate upstairs.

			<p>Well, there's a bit of Econ 101 they missed here: Maximizing return.<br><br>That is, if the Peaches are going to rot, you get zero return.<br><br>If those others are hungry and unable to provide anything of value to you in exchange AT THE MOMENT YOU HAVE THE PEACHES, you still stand to gain more by giving them the peaches than letting them rot. Good will is an intangible, but it is worth more than nothing.<br><br>Finally, if they are picking the Peaches themselves - that you know will go to waste if not given away - you have reduced your opportunity cost required to harvest the peaches that would be wasted anyway, thus increasing your return relative to expense (all in intangibles at this point).<br><br>The only reason, economically, not to give the peaches away is if there is a perceived opportunity for a better return by not doing so. But since this is a hypothetical, we can assume that opportunity does not exist.</p>		</li>

			<p>Let me tell you that attitude isn't the norm everywhere. Here in Australia I'm sure we would redistribute the peaches. I know that's a very broad statement but from interactions I've had with Americans it would seem we think differently to you guys. Australian people generally believe in universal healthcare and equitable access to higher education (though current government would see that go of they could). <br><br>To me here is Australia it seems the American poor have been duped by capitalists into thinking their circumstances are their own fault.

			<p>As for why most Americans reject universal healthcare...There is a huge well funded propaganda machine behind the barbaric for profit system that is in place now and everyone constantly has lies about equitable health care shouted at them. Stuff like &quot;It takes, 6 months of waiting to see a doctor unless you have a broken leg&quot; in places like Canada, Aus, Sweden, and every other industrialized western first world nation . Or that it is somehow more expensive than the outrageous $20k a year per household it costs here, and paid for in taxes collected from you in your hovel by Jackbooted thugs. Seriously, even a large percentage of the people who live right there on the Canadian border and mingle with happy healthy Canadians EACH AND EVERY DAY still somehow believe stuff exactly as ridiculous as what I just said.<br><br>Another big problem is that most people here, for some reason I have never been able to understand, just despise the idea of being charitable to other Americans. That is probably the number one weakness the machine exploits.&quot;Some bastard who doesn't have a job is gonna be able to go get medical care I PAID FOR, not in my back yard!!! (And more ignorant stuff like that, spoken while waving a rifle and ranting incoherently). Right along the same lines as the peach discussion in this thread. There are many millions of people here who believe a person unwilling or unable to fit in to our system of wage slavery is unworthy of basic human rights, up to and including health and life. The average American is just as knowledgeable about life, economics, and how the world truly works as, say, a mildly enlightened North Korean...<br><br>Remember that here the medical industry is nearly as big as big oil...Also most Americans have been taught from birth to go to the doctor literally every single time they feel out of sorts. 65% of the visits an average American makes to a doctor's office are a waste and just for an emotional placebo effect. A frightening number of people get procedures, up to and including major surgeries, that are totally unnecessary and wasteful, and/or take themselves and especially their children to the doctor every time their noses drip. They want the right to continue doing all this enough to pay 33% of their wages out toward it for a lifetime...but universal healthcare is expensive and restrictive, and above all (drumroll) SOCIALIST <em>Jeers and gasps from the crowd</em>. (Edit: In the defense of most of the Americans, this attitude largely comes from the lie that social welfare programs are a huge part of our national budget and are the reason they are taxed so much, or why their company can't afford to pay them well. In their prosecution, it is really, really, really, easy, 15 minutes easy, to look at the US budget numbers online (Google it) and determine that all of that is bullshit. Oddly though, somehow, Social Security and Medicare get a pass, regardless of the fact that they ARE crippling our economy and will eventually take it down, if left unchecked or the fact that they DO account for half or nearly half of our annual budget.)<br><br>Lastly, most Americans are too poor to travel abroad and the ones that can afford it are mostly of the variety that benefit from the exploitation of the poor in some way or another and it isn't in their interest to be objective and upset the apple cart with the truth. They are invested in the stock market and the companies poisoning the souls of our whole nation with mood elevators and highly addictive opiates or charging $490 for a $17 neck brace make up a big part of that market. The medical  and pharmaceutical corporations are untouchable because they are &quot;too important economically&quot; to disrupt. The kind of folks who mostly travel over seas are able to afford our 1000% inflated health care with no problems and everyone who can't is just lazy in their eyes. Plus they want calf implants, and you can't get those in Sweden, at least not without waiting a while. What barbarian wants to live in a society that denies calf implants next week to those who want them?. (Edit: In defense of that crowd. Another big problem in America is that as a person becomes more &quot;educated&quot; here, they have also been conversely more propagandized. Also, our system works great for the rich, and it wouldn't work for them at all if it was socially just and equitable. How can we expect them to dismantle their little glory hole here?)</p>		</li>

			<p>What you just said is exactly the case <br><br>&quot;The American poor seem to have been duped into thinking their poverty is their own fault.&quot; <br><br>Exploiting the poor is basically the number one industry here. Furthermore, the average poor person here has also been duped into siding with the guy exploiting them and against their peers. Hence no more true organized labor or good old fashioned torch and pitchfork &quot;This tiny group owns 95% of the nation's wealth and is steadily taking measures to enslave everyone, better put a stop to this before it gets worse&quot; type of justice. <br><br>Just look at all the hatred of those on social programs in the USA, even as our economy is crumbling directly because of the bottom to top &quot;redistribution of wealth&quot; and gainful employment rapidly is becoming a thing of the past.<br><br>The average American views anyone less fortunate than them as at fault and lazy. As long as that view persists, we are doomed. No one has the common sense to realize that if &quot;Everyone just would do what I did, it worked for me and therefore you have no excuse, you lazy bum.&quot;, then whatever &quot;I did&quot;, in that hypothetical, would become totally devalued.<br><br>Actually, that is the big problem, and the answer to OP's question. Everyone in the US is trying to follow some mass marketed &quot;recipe for success&quot; and getting a piss poor &quot;education&quot;, believing one will impart intelligence or replace actual experience, rather than finding what niche in life is for them and being their own individual. We pressure our young people to arbitrarily attend mostly second rate colleges and just get some job, any job, &quot;You better have a job and make some corporation money your whole life or you are a loser kid.&quot; In doing so we have created huge mobs of ignorant, inexperienced, and aimless people with similar and highly specialized, but largely useless, skill sets and no mind of their own or survival skills.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think it depends how you acquired the peach tree and the peaches that grow on it. If you just stumbled upon it, and it grows peaches on its own without you having to care for it, I'd argue you have no right to keep the peaches for yourself.<br><br>But if you planted it, or found it and took care of it (water, prune, etc.), and especially if the tree would not grow peaches without your care, I think you have a pretty good case that the peaches are your property.<br><br>I do think it would be cruel to withhold your peaches from starving people, but we do have this problem: Say there are 100 hungry people. You could share your peaches with them, everyone would get very little, and then be hungry again very soon. Or you could keep them all and feed you and your family for some time.<br><br><em>Edit: missed the part about there being more peaches than you can use, which would result in them rotting, so forget it, haha.</em></p>		</li>

			<p>In this hypothetical example, I agree with you. The peach tree owner would be acting spitefully whereas a person using a dollar on something trivial may be acting selfishly. <br><br>However, real world considerations would almost always change the farmer's motivations from spiteful to selfish.<br><br>Giving away peaches could cost the farmer. Letting people on his/her land would open the farmer up to theft, property damage, intentional or accidental,and liability from those picking the peaches getting injured or sick. <br><br>Even if none of the above happened, the farmer would still lose out. If he grows and sells some peaches, giving peaches away would increase the supply, lower the demand or both. For this giveaway to have no effect on supply or demand, the farmer would have to institute a screening program to ensure that no one who was currently buying or receiving peaches from those who bought them came to pick them for free. He or she would also have to ensure that no one came to pick the peaches for resale. Making the screening program effective would cost time and money.<br><br>Even if none of that happened, there would be no way to know that beforehand. The fact that the farmer would be worried about any one of those issues happening means he  or she is acting selfishly as opposed to spitefully.<br><br>Don't get me wrong; I'm not Ayn Rand or anything. Every year, I help pick corn for a farmer who grows some just to give away; that is very admirable and much appreciated. No one deserves to starve to death; I just think human nature is the greater factor in how much we give, not our economic system.<br></p>		</li>

You thus make people more dependent on handouts, and since there are only so many extra peaches, people end up starving anyway.<br><br>And no, I am not swayed by your argument that their right to live trumps my right to peaches, because there aren't enough peaches to go around. Where does it stop? Should I have to give up half of the peaches I need to not be hungry to save the life of someone else? If they're my peaches, if I put in the time and effort to grow them, why should I have to suffer so that someone who could have grown peaches but didn't can continue to be a drain on society? It sounds harsh, because it is. The world is fucking harsh.<br><br>But I'll tell you what: I may not give up my extra peaches just because you're hungry, but I'll offer you as many peach seeds as you like. I'll even give you advice and help you tend your tree. In fact, as long as you're seriously putting in an effort towards tending your tree, I'll do my best to help you out with spare peaches until your own tree starts producing a crop. Problem is, I can't do that for everyone—there simply aren't enough peaches to go around. But I would rather see my spare peaches rot than give them to someone who refuses to help himself.</p>		</li>

			<p>There's something that throws a wrench into your theory: Inheritance. At this point in history, no one has earned 100% of what they have. No one. What if your mother planted that peach tree, and left it to you when she died? You didnt plant or grow it, and the only thing that makes you 'deserve' it more than anyone else is the fact that you happened to be born to her. You didn't earn it but inherited it. <br><br>Fast forward a few hundred years and we have wealth inequality thats based largely on familial inheritance, all of which is unearned. Some people can't grow peach trees because their families have no resources to plant them. Some people grow orchards because their parents left them a shitton of resources. Do the Walton children deserve their wealth just because they were born into the right family? <br><br>I'm not making a argument for or against any economic movement, I'm simply suggesting that rationing resources is a lot more complicated than a simple basis of 'deservedness'. A system of allocating resources based on work effort cannot properly function if inheritance exists, because inheritance by definition is not based on work effort. </p>		</li>

			<p>How are hungry people trapped in generational poverty, with no land or any potential to obtain it, supposed to grow peaches? Also what will they eat for 20-30 years while they wait for the tree to grow to maturity and bear fruit? <br>(Edit:Ok sorry,I will give it to you that you said you would help the guy out who wanted to grow his own with a peach or two. Still, you have only helped the one already fortunate enough to have the land to grow his fruit on.)<br><br>I am kind of surprised you didn't throw out the idea that giving away your peaches for free devalues the peach as a commodity and that the hungrier everyone is, the more you can charge for your fruit, so therefore it makes the best financial sense to let them rot. Also, no smart business man in the peach industry would ever encourage another guy to grow peaches and thereby foster competition.That is the American way though, after all, so it's gotta be right. <br><br>Oh, on another note. Fun fact, each and every peach comes with a &quot;peach seed&quot; in the center. If you give a person a peach then you automatically have given them a seed along with the calories to fuel planting it. </p>		</li>

			<p>There is a middle-path, you know. Scandinavian countries seem to have found the magical medium.<br><br>The problem, I think (and it's a tragic, harsh truth about how awful people really are), is that countries where inequality runs high tend to be ethnically heterogeneous and prone to institutionalized racism and hatred of &quot;the other.&quot; This is not to suggest that Danes <em>only</em> help out other Danes and wouldn't welcome brown people having a slice of the pie, just that 'Murica tends to be very openly hostile to the idea of sharing the wealth with &quot;not 'real' Americans.&quot;<br><br>Religion plays a big role in this too, I think. I mean, look at the Pandora's box that the Hobby Lobby case opened up. You're going to have wingnut lunatics saying that it's their right not to pay for medications for AIDS patients because &quot;Jesus hates teh gays&quot; and the First Amendment says that your bullshit religion is more important than providing medicine for people you don't like.<br><br>Also, look at the panic over Ebola and how many Americans want us to just out-and-out stop giving help to Africa and actually declare an embargo, basically just close the whole continent off and let &quot;those people&quot; die. It's bad enough how we treat black people living here in this country, never mind demanding that our elected officials cordon off an entire continent and let literally hundreds of millions of other black people die because one isolated airhead in New Jersey wasn't going to be inconvenienced from her early Christmas shopping.<br><br>TL;DR 'Muricans are mean and Danes are fuckin' awesome.</p>		</li>

			<p>3 28-02-2013 13:59<br>Anarchy is simply organised opposition to the status quo. That is a form of political anarchy. Social anarchy is quite different, it is the abscence of centralised or governmental control. The one is another form of control, whilst the other is the affect due to a lack of or complete abscence of control. Social anarchy is an interim of social disorder, it will eventually culminate in control and it may become dictatorial. Political anarchy is organised, it is often what comes after the interim of socially disordered anarchy.<br><br>For anarchy to occur there needs to be revolution. This is why anarchy has often been one of the principles of Communism and Marxism. The case of Bakunin is not in any way unique.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>I studied economics undergrad, eventually settling into econometrics, (even started /r/econometrics) and I have to disagree, completely. /u/GOBLIN_GHOST was almost correct in his assessment as &quot;weathermen for money,&quot; because there are simply too many factors in most micro and macro economical situations to accurately model. You're never going to be 100% accurate as you could be in something like accounting or the physical sciences, because humans are involved, and are inherently irrational. You can't model for a an executive believing himself to be lucky due to a string of occurrences in their life when he makes risky decisions on allocating capital, causing a collapse in the stock price when that bet fails. What you can do is make a statistical assumption given what's known and give a forecast, hence the money that stands to be made as accuracy rises. But economics, at least at the basic level, assumes everything as being ideal, hence the capitalism is best, infallible rhetoric, but you having a degree in financial economics should know all of this already.</p>		</li>

You say:<br><br>&gt;But economics, at least at the basic level, assumes everything as being ideal, hence the capitalism is best, infallible rhetoric<br><br><br>That's my issue. Is capitalism as it's taught really the best? Econometrics is great and statistics can be wonderful but I just wonder if maybe, just maybe, economics should broaden itself a bit as a discipline and have more focus on philosophy instead of numbers and equations. That's all. For example, not once was anything related to &quot;Marxism&quot; or &quot;Communism&quot; ever discussed, let alone even brought up for discussion. Questions like &quot;Should we tax capital?&quot; or &quot;What should we do with all this capital created from capitalism?&quot; are glossed over and it's back on to the current narrative of the textbook.</p>		</li>

			<p>It is most definitely not a waste of time to learn about economics. I would it say it may be a waste of time to pay college tuition for a degree in it, though.<br><br>Go check out MIT's Open CourseWare or something and go through basic and intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics. There's nothing wrong with supply and demand models, how taxes and price controls can affect S&amp;D, how trade can make everyone better off, etc... and these fit all schools of economic thought. <br><br>My beef was that most of my upper level courses (Money and Capital Markets, Derivative Securities, International Finance, Econometrics, Financial Investment Analysis) were all a teaching of &quot;This is how the system we use works&quot; which was fine. Learning about the Black-Scholes model and how to price options is useful knowledge. Knowing how to calculate the return on investment is useful as well. The accounting classes I took were useful and gave me insight into just how much goes into balancing a ledger and how to account for depreciation of assets, so on and so forth.<br><br>I had <em>no</em> classes on critical thought and analysis of the system from less of a systematic, equation point of view and more of a philosophical, critical thought point of view. I graduated in May 2008, shit broke in October 2008, and I moved to IT in Feb 2009. About 2 years ago I got bored and I decided to read Marx's &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;. It was a little over the top with the attacks on capitalism but it did present a narrative that fit pretty well and one could almost say predicted the current financial we ourselves in (the massive growth of capital while labor is losing). Nothing of the sort was even brought up for discussion in any of my classes.<br><br>All that being said, I guess it depends on what you want to learn. If you want to learn how the system works, then by all means take college level courses. If you want to explore different economic theories then just read books on the subject. Learning how things work though would probably give you a little better grasp on the politics of the world. I'd suggest starting out with trying to learn about the world reserve currency, the gold standard, what FDR did in 1933, and then move on to what happened after WWII and Breton Woods and the Nixon Shock. Then maybe read about the petrodollar. </p>		</li>

			<p>They can predict the likelihood of an earthquake within a certain time.  That's pretty damn good.  They can look at the ground, tell you what all the possible risks are, how to prepare for them, and what the odds are that any of the given problems will happen to you.  Those are all useful pieces of information that are not simply observations of the past.  They are reliable statements about the future.  How do you think the cost of flood insurance is assessed?  Geologists look at the area, and as a result can predict the odds of a flood, and therefore how much someone needs to be paying per year for their insurance.  Economists never seen to tell make any useful predictions or observations.  Many core economic principles rely on the faulty logic of correlation = causation.  Whenever there is any sort of change, economists say that they had no idea that it was coming.  They are however, great at predicting that factors will continue... right up until the moment that they don't.  Yeah, if you say the market will continue to do what it's doing, you'll be right 99% of time.  The market will continue to go up, as predicted, until it starts to go down, at which point economists then say that the market will go down.  Anyone can do that!  That's just pattern identification.  The whole point of science is that ideas and theories are testable, and must stand the test of time.  A valid theory can'y be disproven even once.  A single piece of evidence is enough to topple a theory.  Yet, in economics, theories are developed, multiple pieces of problematic evidence surface, and rather than the theory being thrown out, they just say, &quot;yeah, but it works most of the time.  Economists don't have the ability to forecast.&quot;  That's funny, because all of the physical, biological, and mathematical scientists do have the ability to forecast, and use it quite reliably.  This is how I came to the conclusion that economics is not in fact a science, but is a social study that falls under the category of humanities.  If it's going to be a science, it has to follow the scientific method.  Experience tells me time and time again that the word of economists isn't worth a damn.  That's not even dealing with massive number of economists that work entirely for individual interests and somehow always manage to come up with data that supports their employers.  At least in other fields people don't entertain the idea that two several conflicting theories can all be valid at the same time.  That's what peer review is for.</p>		</li>

			<p>The majority of economists have nothing at all to do with predicting the macroeconomy. Yes, some people that are economists (and some people just call themselves economists) do that for a living. But economists study WAY more than that. Economics is the study of choice.<br><br>Economics doesn't just say &quot;capitalism is awesome&quot; or &quot;the free market is the best ever&quot;. If that's what your econ 101 professor told you, I'm sorry, you didn't get a quality class. We study problems with capitalism, like inequality, environmental externalities, resource depletion, and free riding. We worry about consequences of policies like bailouts, government support of loan systems, and how to deal with insurance when sick people need coverage (but people don't want to pay taxes and business want profits).<br><br>Do you think the economics made people greedy? Was there no greed or exploitation before Hayek? No government waste before Keynes? Is Nash (fine, not really an economist, but we claim his game theory work) responsible for competitive behavior? No, we study these things to better understand them so we can help deal with them.<br><br>If you want to blame economists for greed, resource use, and corruption, you might as well blame physics for black holes, chemistry for arsenic, and engineers for gun violence.</p>		</li>

			<p>That is irresponsible to say. That is akin to saying we shouldn't trust scientists because they are disproven over time. Moreover, anyone who talks like that is completely discounting the probability that certain experts lie or try to manipulate policy for personal gain. Just because some people did that does not discount an entire field. <br><br>There is plenty of evidence to suggest economic theory has pratical applications that would otherwise not happen if <em>the entire field was ignored</em>. The Marshal Plan? The New Deal? <br><br>Is it frustrating that it is a complicated field filled with opportunists?

			<p>Economics is not a science. Science requires that the field can make testable, consistent predictions. So your first comparison is pretty off base. Scientists don't say, &quot;trust us&quot;. Economists do. In fact, economics treats methods as privileged information, so you literally do have to just trust the work, because you really can't check it.<br><br>That's not to say that economics will always be this way. But it is very much a tool, and misrepresented, in pursuit of political agendas. I'm looking at you Chicago School of economics.<br><br>Finally, considering there are mutually conflicting schools of economics, that actually pretty much puts the field in a bit of an empirical problem, you see. Reliability caps validity. The whole field of economics has an extreme problem from the ground up with statistical validity. Even theoretically economics cannot be a statistically valid field as long as everyone is making different predictions, which they are.<br><br><br>The mere fact that the discipline is divided into those schools of thought which are mutually contradictory, gives the entire field a largely insurmountable obstacle to overcome before even beginning to rub shoulders with empiricism. Until economists can agree on the most basic of things in macroeconomics, the field will pretty much continue to be a political tool rather than an empirical field.</p>		</li>

			<p>So you're not going to address any of my specific criticisms in regards to inferential statistics, and external validity.<br><br>My point is if you can't prove anything, you have no grounds to make claims. Economics cannot prove anything in a statistical, reliable manner. Not that it can't in principle, or in theory, but that the field literally cannot do that now. Not in macroeconomics.<br><br>You can hand wave it away all you want, but when key statistical concepts like validity and reliability quite literally say, in a strict, mathematical, provable, and empirical way, that economics is <em>not</em> empirical nor, in it's present incarnation, can it ever really be. That is not something you handwave away. <br><br>Here is the article you would need to grasp my specific criticism of the field, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)#Reliability" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)#Reliability</a>. My other specific criticism is that peer review is not a thing in economics, either. Not as it is in any other field claiming to be empirical. Economics formulae are considered privileged, which means third party review is essentially impossible.<br><br>Care to actually address either point? I mean, our whole argument is based upon empiricism, so we should perhaps maybe stick to that.</p>		</li>

			<p>Your problem is you are projecting the statistical significance of &quot;testable, consistent predictions&quot; from clearly another subject when it is obvious that the degree of what can be considered &quot;testable, consistent prediction&quot; varies from subject to subject. I think it would be fair to say that pyschologists, doctors, meterologists are scientists of one form or another, but how many of them have a singular solution to a given problem? Meterologists state the probability of their prediction, which implies some inconsistency, but we consider it a science. Doctors don't have a magic bullet for every illness, there isn't always established consensus on <em>every</em> issue, personal assessment plays a role and there fore people go for <em>a second opinion</em>. And yet we would never dare to say that the original doctor was just half-assing it and guessing, only that the original doctor had a personal set of logic that might not be ideal and that other doctors differ on that logic. We still consider it a science despite that inconsistency. So my point is you have to define for me what you consider &quot;testable, consistent predictions&quot; before I answer that question. <br><br>EDIT: Shocking that they wouldn't reply after I shot down that conceited post with basic logic. </p>		</li>

			<p>Hayek, a famous economist supposedly (I'm not an economist) wrote a 3-volume work about politics that I've studied and he broke it down like this - the system is like a beehive or better, one of those cave crystals that forms and hangs from the ceiling.  Neither of the singular atoms in the crystals knows the other exists or what the other does or how to even form the main crystal so that it hangs down, i.e. how the whole thing works.  It just works.  <br><br>But when you bring sentience into this or outside interference (i.e. court decisions/politicians/interest groups), they take out one crystal move it to another crystal and suddenly a billion crystals collapse because in the end, we are all those crystals.  We kind of sort of know what happens over here, in this tiny area around our own interest but how the entire beehive actually functions is a wild guess and how changing one tiny thing will affect the rest of it is impossible to know.<br><br>That's my very rudimentary understanding of him, take it with a grain of salt or not at all.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's hard to explain and it possibly doesn't make sense to begin with (it made sense to me at the time but I spent 2-3 months on the paper about it).<br><br>Basically it's like this, one entity, whatever it is, has a singular purpose, which is a culmination of all the minor/singular things within it.  Without each other's knowledge, they create this one thing that does something none of them may even know about and even if they did, they would never be able to replicate.  Like, if you put 10 people into 10 rooms and tell them all to build 1 structure (a beehive for example) without telling either person about the other 9 or anything like that, they'd never be able to do it in such a way that in the end you have 1 product that appears like it was deliberately created by the 10 people working together.<br><br>So his point is that politics is like that.  The ultimate product is a culmination of a person in a room doing his own thing, then in the end we have the one system that is <em>supposedly</em> there as a result of everyone working together but in fact is not.  As a result, if you take the finished product and change it from the top level (there is a way to change it through a more fundamental change, as in, &quot;this beehive should be made to produce milk instead of honey&quot; rather than &quot;b #2 should go and gather over there instead of over here&quot;), you will cause a ripple affect on everything else in that system (because again, whatever they created wasn't inherently due to the explicit agreement between the 7 billion bees/people, in fact he claims, the agreement is the illusion we need in order to have government, which his main argument claims is fucked for this very reason).  I don't know, I have just written quite a bit and realized I probably made it more complicated than not.<br><br>Maybe it helps to think of it like a game of jenga, each piece has its own interests and doesn't care about the entire structure but the structure is predicated on its place in the system.  If you try to reach out and remove that piece, all the other pieces will be affected somehow.  The problem is, we are the pieces, and, the complexity of how many of us there are aside, it's impossible to look at ourselves from the outside to know what we will affect because we simply cannot see the Jenga tower (the ability to see, judge, interpret, and move peices is around - each of these is just another jenga piece).</p>		</li>

			<p>In point of fact, whatever else you might think about them, several presidents have come up from close to nothing in the past 25-50 years.<br><br>And, it had never occurred to me before, but they were all democrats. Carter was a farmer, the son of a farmer, relatively well-to-do by local standards, but not especially wealthy. Clinton's stepfather was a car salesman who beat his mother between drinks. Obama's parents split when he was very young, and he was raised alternately in Indonesia and the States, spending some of his childhood with his grandparents.<br><br>The presidency is one of the federal positions <em>less</em> susceptible to nepotism or oligarchy. Which isn't to say that presidential elections aren't a corrupt contest between well-funded giants. Just, relative to Congress...</p>		</li>

			<p>I get that you're just going for easy pot shots, but among all the criticism of Austrian economics &quot;oversimplification&quot; isn't one of them.  A major problem with the austrian school is that they're averse to simplification and abstraction, which leads to them not being able to generate the same powerful tools and models that mainstream economics can take advantage of. </p>		</li>

			<p>Economics in many cases get way more complex because humans doesn't act like rational agents. The old models always assumed so, but &quot;recent&quot; (if you want to call ~30 years recent) research shows that isn't so.<br><br>Example of a test: Take 2 people and give them $100 to share, but A divides the sum a B can veto the entire deal, making it so that none of them gets any money. Old models assumed that A could take 99% and B would accept, but the result is that the less fair A makes the divide, the larger the chance B will veto.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drinks_antifreeze" target="_blank">drinks_antifreeze</a>
			<p>Yeah we talked about this in game theory, called it the Ultimatum Game. I asked my prof this very question and according to the strict rules of rationality B will accept an infinitesimally small amount of money without vetoing. (And I'm told - <em>within the confines of the model</em> - this can be proven using more rigorous &quot;grad school level&quot; analysis methods.) But in real life people aren't perfectly rational, and there are obviously more variables at play (for example, a real person would get disutility from getting screwed over but a perfectly rational agent wouldn't care about that as long as they got any payoff at all).<br><br>Behavioral economics dives into that stuff more. Pretty cool stuff. Bummer my school doesn't offer any behavioral econ courses.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fundamentally the problem as far as I can see it is that economics is a social science that we insist on treating as an empirical one. It doesn't and never has worked that way, not even at the macro level. You can't say that A plus B will always equal C, but we build economic policy against the idea that it somehow will.<br><br>Because of this, everyone's economic theories are full of holes and so we can't manage to get rid of even the worst of them.</p>		</li>

			<p>Macroeconomics doesn't have a single cohesive model. Instead, there are several different models, and most economists look at several of them, because they're good at different things. For example, the Austrian model could have predicted the recession, whereas the more commonly used monetarist model didn't.<br><br>There are simply too many variables to perfectly model the whole economy.

			<p>I can't help noticing that several &quot;economists&quot; lost their shit in 2008, while I didn't.    That doesn't make me smarter, it just means I made fortunate decisions and it is indicative of the possibility that within any profession there can still be a lot of misconceptions that only work when conditions meet the misconception.     It's why you get second opinions from doctors,  it's why you don't automatically assume an actual economist isn't full of shit.    <br><br>I'm an industry veteran in what I do,  I'm wrong sometimes still.

			<p>While I don't disagree with the general gist of what you are trying to say, I want to point out that a lot of the increase in cost of education seems to have occurred in the last 10 years, making it even more extreme.  <br><br>As one example, a semester at WSU was about $1700 when I went (~ 10 years ago), meaning close to $14K in tuition for four years.  Now it is about $5500... making a four year degree $44k... and that is for a public institution price as a resident of the state!</p>		</li>

			<p>I think you have to mention why wages have been relatively stagnant the past 20 years or so: HEALTHCARE! If you include government transfers (like medicare, SNAP, etc.) and the subsidies for insurance coverage most people get through their employer, then total compensation has continued to rise. Not quite at the pre-1970s levels but still at a significant rate. The rising cost of healthcare is eating up all our raises. <br><br>I also want to say that I think the loose money for student loans has had an effect, but that the price hasn't risen nearly as much as it seems. Yes, the sticker price is WAY up since the 80s, but the actual cost paid by a student has risen significantly less. Once you account for federal and state grants as well as need and merit based financial aid from the university, you find that most of the rise in sticker price since the 80s has been countered by a rise in free financial aid. The remaining balance is then often covered by 'cheap' student loans.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm currently in college at Georgia tech and I can tell 100% for sure that hope does not work like you just said. Hope is divided into multiple differs grants and merit scholarships. Zell miller is the highest one, and it covers 100% of tuition for a bachelors degree. As far as Alabama goes, that may have been an auburn specific thing, but I explicitly remember being told about the option when I was there. We had considered moving there to be able to get the scholarship, had I decided to go there, which I did not. I also have friends in many other states that have told me instate students have special scholarships similar to hope. I believe some states even call the program hope as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>Finding a couple anecdotes doesn't disprove what the commenter said. In my home state, if I had gone to the big-name state university, it would've cost $12k a semester just in tuition. x8 = $96k. That's a public university, and that was the price in 2005-2006. It's gone up since.<br><br>Granted I was offered a full-ride, I was an exceptional student in high school, so it's not like they just throw money at students. Regardless none of that changes the fact that the raw price of in-state tuition for the average student is almost $100k - and out-of-state students pay considerably more (the school is known for both academics and sports, so it has a draw for non-local students).<br><br>The point of my anecdote isn't to &quot;cancel out&quot; yours but to illustrate that you can't look at the issue on an example-counter example basis. You need to look at the overall stats - means, medians, and also regional discrepancies, tuition vs. median income in the area...</p>		</li>

			<p>That would be the high end. I obviously wasn't claiming these schools don't exist, but personal anecdotes DO disprove his point. For example, in my home town there are 3 schools within an hour (easy commute) that I could pay $0 for tuition. I could stay with my parents and pay $0 rent. Many people that I went to high school with chose to do this, because it's so cheap. Some went to these schools and then went to UGA or GT for masters. I know it CAN be expensive to go to school, but $15K per year, is not low end. </p>		</li>

Just put my earbuds in, listen to music all day and type memos or whatever's assigned to me. I'm hoping that the middle-range grunts don't have to go to meetings... ugh, I hate group work and hate having to &quot;contribute something.&quot; I had a class this past semester (my first one on-campus after going online from freshman through junior year) where you actually got points <em>off</em> your grade if you clammed up. I did, and ended up with an A- instead of an A. I got all A's on my papers, and attended every single class, but just couldn't muster up the courage to contribute anything to discussions. I just sat there quietly and took notes -- and ended up being &quot;punished&quot; for it. I have all A's otherwise on my transcript so didn't see the need to bother challenging it. I just hope that the business world isn't the kind of place where you can have your salary docked for not speaking up in meetings or hanging out with coworkers and talking about TV shows at the water cooler or lunch room. I'm shy and get nervous when speaking up, why is that something to be punished for?</p>		</li>

			<p>^Exactly. A degree is no longer a sign of intelligence. At this point it's merely an indicator right off the bat of how much debt that person has. I worked as a debt collector for about a year, and I can tell you that a lot of people went to school to get degrees, who should have never stepped foot in any kind of campus. That, and I have a job but no degree, and while it isn't the best...several of my coworkers do in fact have degrees. Yet we all get paid the same.</p>		</li>

			<p>Part of the problem is comparatively speaking everyone goes to college now as opposed to a generation ago. Just having a degree doesn't mean anything. As far as credentials alone an undergrad degree has the same value as a high school diploma did a generation ago. Combine that with people thinking having a college degree makes many menial jobs beneath them, and you end up with lots of people feeling they're underpaid or under employed. </p>		</li>

			<p>Again, ask ten different people and you'll get ten different answers.<br><br>Without trying to solve the whole problem, I can see a few things that basically nobody disagrees with (except perhaps the people whose pockets are being lined!). I by no means mean to suggest this list is exhaustive, and it is purely my best-guess opinion: <br><br><em> Whether we're for regulation or not, we can certainly agree that </em>slanted<em> regulation is a bad thing: it's bad to a capitalist because it stifles competition and it's bad to a socialist because it's corporations running the government as well as the economy. Corruption is the consequence of unrestricted campaign finance, super PACs, and the like. So I think a priority everywhere on the political spectrum would be the removal of unlimited corporate contribution - probably by publicly-funded elections.<br><br></em> Globalization is already sorta fixing itself, it just doesn't work out so well for those who were originally at the top. The early part of the 1900s saw the West doing crazy stuff with the ridiculous resource glut provided by colonialism, and with the end of colonialism, it makes sense that the West's dominance relative to places like China would not stay there. But as wealth has flowed steadily into east Asia, their standard of living has risen, and the infinite well of free labor there is beginning to dry up. They, in turn, are turning to central Africa - effectively the only large area of the world that hasn't seen major industrial development yet. But eventually, cheap labor of this kind will dry up.<br><br><em> Education is harder, and I don't have an uncontroversial answer for it. For myself, I'd make a large move towards localizing it; I think many of the issues we see in the educational (and other) bureaucracies simply come from there being way too many levels between the work and the decision-making. On the educational level, we need massively higher standards than what we have now: the number of graduate students I encounter who have no concept of how to even formulate an argument is staggering. And those standards cannot simply be based on horribly flawed standardized exams (and here my opinion </em>is* professional, I teach test prep at a state university), because that creates a huge industry that is yet another barrier to anyone without financial means.</p>		</li>

			<p>/u/Chel_of_the_sea has wonderful observations. I would like to throw around the idea of institutionalizing apprenticeship programs, not internships, old school apprenticeships modified to fit the modern economy. It would decrease the career mobility of workers, but set a standard for what is expected and what the compensation will be. Maybe.<br>And the idea of collars is a barrier.  70 hour workweek is a 70 hour workweek. I think in reality we need to get really good at being adaptable. Got a communications degree? Have you ever poured concrete? By raising the what the basic worker brings to the table, English degrees and all, there is an adaptability to the workforce. However, if this our place, then, and thhis is sciences, we have to be fuck offs and do whatever we want in our personal lives. It's the only way for the economy to go forward.</p>		</li>

			<p>For starters, really enforce the 40 (or maybe bring it down to 35) hour workweek. Bring the salary floor for FLSA exemptions to at least $100k per year. When companies can no longer expect free overtime from most white collar employees, they'll need to pick up hiring to cover the workload. <br><br>Also minimum annual leave like in most developed countries.

			<p>Possibly a Land Value Tax, citizens income, legalisation of all drugs, changing the money creation policies to a non debt-based monetary system. But I would say the best options are the radical ideologies in your eyes. <br><br>Though I would consider all ideologies - religions, capitalism, communism - radical in their ability to subvert complex processes and systems into simple, flawed modes of thought. All models are wrong, some are useful but the followers of any ideology will back their ideas without any original thoughts on how and why they are fundamentally wrong. <br><br>So when Goldman Sachs models seemed to be wrong, with their models predicting the events of 2007 as a 1 in a 100,000 years event. Did they go back to their original assumptions and think they were wrong? Or did they just tinker with the models a bit, giving them fat-tails etc...? I'm guessing the latter, while I think the former.</p>		</li>

			<p>So this is a good answer, but not entirely complete.  I am not a practicing Economist, but I do have a degree in economics, for the record.  Much of what we are experiencing is simply related to the maturation of the capitalistic system and the successful dominance of capitalist thought around the world.  As more economies have become capitalist, the market for goods and labor has grown, while the gains in efficiency have as well.  Essentially what this means is we have built a bigger market, while at the same time learning to do more with less.  Now, we recognized this in the early 90's and for those who were alive you may remember the uproar over NAFTA.  It was this issue that was at the heart of those concerns.  Essentially by opening up trade to other poorer countries, we no longer had to use American workers for manual labor.  This was good for companies because someone in Bangladesh could make textiles for 10 cents an hour that previously an American was making for $25 an hour.  Obviously middle and lesser educated Americans were very upset about this as it meant they were going to be doomed to $5/hour jobs flipping burgers, if they didn't get an education.  But it also meant their kids would be doomed, if they didn't get an education.  That is in fact the core issue of why the mellenial generation is suffering.<br><br>There is a concept called Comparative Advantage that basically states a certain country tends to have one thing they do better than any other.  Think Saudi Arabia making oil or Columbia making coffee.  These countries have certain advantages that allow them to make their specific thing better and cheaper than anyone else.  This was the primary economic theory at play behind the argument for open trade.  While the US might lose our ability to make textiles to Bangladesh and pressed plastic to China, we would build such a large market that we would be able to employ far more people doing what we do best.  And what, you ask, were we supposed to do best?  We created educated, creative, people that could manage, design, market and control all the other aspects of the economy.  We were all going to be kings, so long as we continued to educate our children well.  The minor flaw in that plan, was we didn't.  We failed miserably at raising our children during this time.  We did worse raising our children during this period than we had at any time during the 20th century prior to that moment.  It wasn't that our primary schools were bad, they were not dramatically different than before and some would credibly argue better than ever.  It wasn't that our colleges and universities were bad, they turned out some of the most dynamic research ever created in the history of mankind.  The issue was our parents had to work more.  <br><br>The deterioration of the 40 hour week driven by the decline in union labor, meant parents were home less in those early days when it was so important for kids to have a stable parent around to be their first teacher.  More families became single parent homes as our culture, created by capitalist entities, celebrated the needs of the individual above sacrifice for ones family or community.  At the end of the day, the simple truth is the parents of millennials were not able to spend as much time with you as you needed.  It's not really their fault, but it had a huge impact.  As a result there are too many millennials that struggled in school and are now without the skills needed for success, and so our entire economy is smaller and less powerful than it should be.  Europe has essentially been drinking our milkshake, because our parents believed the hype that we could do whatever we wanted to make ourselves feel good.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;Wages have been stagnant and even dropping relative to inflation for quite a long time now, and the requirements to get said jobs have generally gone up. At the same time, the cost of education has skyrocketed something like 1000% relative to inflation. So where a bachelor's degree might have costed you a few thousand in today's dollars back in the 60s and nearly guaranteed you a decent job, today it costs $50-60k and doesn't at all guarantee work.&quot;<br><br>It never guaranteed you work.  It just so happened to be that at that time, there were much less college educated people in the world and there was a high probability that you got a job after graduating.<br><br>It's the same with the real-estate industry pre-2008.  People thought because the housing market was so good, it was a guaranteed investment.  Boy were they wrong.  I suppose these are good lessons, but many will just blame the government and everyone else for their own foolish decisions (and history will repeat).<br><br>The cost skyrocketed because the government wanted everyone to have a chance at getting an education, even if they couldn't afford it, through student loans.   As a result of this glut of college educated people, many companies now require a college education as a minimum to get a job.  Saturating the market, even in the name of helping out the poor and less fortunate, leads to devaluation.

			<p>The thing is, it actually would increase prices, because business owners wouldn't want to see a drop in profits caused by having to pay employees more. The real issue is how <em>much</em> those prices end up being raised. Many businesses would only have to raise their prices slightly in order to make up for the increased wages, because the sheer amount of business they do completely dwarfs the number of employees they have to pay.<br><br>Say I have to pay each of my 10 employees $100 a week (using simple numbers to keep the math simple), and I do so by selling 10,000 hamburgers per week at $1 per burger. This nets me a profit of $9,000 per week (ignoring other costs for the sake of simplicity).<br><br>If minimum wage goes up and I now have to pay each of my 10 employees $150 per week, I only have to raise the price of my hamburgers by $.05 to make up the lost profits. I'm paying an additional $500 a week to my employees (50 x 10), but I make an additional $500 a week by gaining an additional $.05 from each burger sold (.05 x 10,000).<br><br>That's a 5% increase in prices in order to effect a 50% increase in wages.<br><br>Now, there would definitely be some people that take advantage of the <em>perception</em> surrounding a raise in the minimum wage. People who would raise their prices more than they need to to make up the lost profits, just because they know they can get away with it. But that's a problem with unscrupulous people, not with the act of raising the minimum wage in the first place.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well you are talking Revenue and not Profit.  Margins in business are usually very small.  If the profit margin on revenue is 10%, you actually have to increase revenue 10 times to offset the increase in  wages.  More realistically, the burgers would have to go up a .25 cents.

			<p>The main issue with this argument is that the business owner owner isn't going to raise the price to compensate loss. He is going to raise the price to maximize profits. So to recover loss, sure, he raises the price by 5c. But with the new minimum wage and everyone making $50 more per week, maybe he can get away with 25c more. And EVERY business is going to do this, and get away with it. <br><br>And as business owners make more money, the suppliers for their materials will realize they can charge more as well. This forces ALL businesses to raise their price. The only winners are the ones that react quickly and raise their price shortly after the minimum wage increase (though not immediately, they need to give the customers a chance to save up a little and feel like they have more spending power).<br><br>I think the strongest argument in favor of minimum wage increase is that it doesn't influence EVERYONES paycheck. Prices definitely go up, but not everyone can afford to up the amount they spend, so with a minimum wage increase of 10%, business owners might only be able to get away with a 6-8% increase in prices. This DOES devalue the money of people not making minimum wage though, so they may press for higher wages as well, and once everyones paycheck increases, then prices will raise to match the income. </p>		</li>

			<p>If they can do so without backlash, sure.

			<p>You are leaving out details. Cost of food to make, etc. let's say the prices of your food becomes unmanageable for the consumer to buy. One dollar is a rarer commodity in the market because the consumers aren't making enough to justify the purchase. Demand drops and you are unable to support the 9k profit figure. In response to lower demand, you can select either making them cheaper to promote sales, or raise prices to compensate for losses. One lowers bottom line profits short term, second lowers long term returns. If pay is increased without marking up price.

If you think you can raise prices without losing more money to lost business than the price increase brings in, you're going to do it, regardless of costs.

			<p>The point here is that they're not going to be losing business due to the rise in prices. There are two main reasons that business would be lost due to high prices: the first is that people will choose different stores with lower prices, and the second is that people won't be able to afford the new prices and thus won't buy anything.<br><br>If prices increase due to a wage increase, that affects <em>every</em> store. Your store won't lose business due to increasing prices, because every other store will also be increasing their prices to match the wage increase.<br><br>As for people not being able to afford your stuff, the whole point of increasing the minimum wage is to allow the workers to have more money. People will be making more money, and thus they will have more money to spend, which means that a slight increase in price won't be raising the price above what the people can afford since what people can afford is also increasing at the same time.</p>		</li>

			<p>There have been initiatives like that, but the problem is that inflation is not the main determinant for how expensive things are.

			<p>The reason people are talking about raising it so sharply, though, is that the incremental raises in the minimum wage over the last few decades have <em>not</em> kept up with inflation. <br><br>To put it simply, if inflation is going up at a rate of 2% annually but the increase in the minimum wage is only 1% annually, obviously there will be a disparity. And as it compounds over the years, you end up with a huge gap, and when people finally notice it, it's big enough that now people argue you <em>can't</em> just change it because it's too hard a hit.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; It's meant to raise with inflation to maintain the standard of living.<br><br>Who told you that? Inflation is hardly the only factor that determines what a living wage should be.<br><br>&gt;What's funny, is people think raising minimum wage would cause prices to go up<br><br>It does, be definition. Raising minimum wage raises prices until the point at which the labor is too overvalued, and then you lose jobs to outsourcing - because the same product can be made elsewhere for such a dramatically lower cost that it's more sustainable to have it built in Mexico or China, then shipped back to America, than it is to employ Americans to build it. If you make the man-hours too expensive, someone else will out-compete you for your own unskilled labor.<br><br>But you can't outsource everything - most service-oriented jobs can't be outsourced. You can't have retail workers and mechanics outsourced - so it raises the prices of everything anyway. That's why graphs like <a href="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/05/01/why_poverty_is_still_miserable_cheap_consumer_goods_don_t_improve_your_long/nyt_cost_graph.png.CROP.promovar-mediumlarge.png" target="_blank">this</a> exist - all the durable goods and consumer goods have plummeted in prices, while services are higher than ever.<br><br>So, sure, it's fine to say you want a higher minimum wage (or imply it). But try to understand what you're advocating.</p>		</li>

			<p>Increasing what a laborer makes is good for the economy. If they bring home more money, they have to spend as a consumer. With more money put into the business, they can afford more employees. As they are able to expand and improve sales, confidence in the money increases the value of the dollar. This slows inflation to an extent. That's how it works. Without money injected into the system by increasing wages, the dollar loses confidence and value. As the consumers have less to spend on luxury items or expansion, the market stagnates. Devalued money requires more to purchase things. There is no motivation to take out loans for cars, houses, new businesses because the market isn't doing fantastic. Loans aren't approved that are submitted because they couldn't support the payments. Do you get what I'm saying here? Businesses can't flourish without paying their employees more and it hurts our money.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; With more money put into the business, they can afford more employees<br><br>Well yes, but only because they aren't domestic employees. When you raise the price of an American man-hour, it makes the foreign labor market more competitive, and more jobs centered around creating consumer and durable goods go to foreign firms. If businesses tried to hire more Americans at higher prices, they'd hire fewer or the same as before (while raising prices), because they need to compensate for all of their man-hours (not just minimum wage ones) costing more in the first place. This is fine with retail jobs, since they can't be outsourced, but it decimates jobs that create durable and consumer goods. If you don't understand this, you might want to re-read what I said above and try to formulate an argument against it.</p>		</li>

That's why President Obama is urging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage and give low-wage workers a much-needed boost.<br><br>[source] (<a href="http://www.dol.gov/minwage/mythbuster.htm" target="_blank">http://www.dol.gov/minwage/mythbuster.htm</a>)<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>The value of labor is the minimum cost it takes to satisfy the labor provider. It stands to reason, a college graduate would sneeze at a salary less than a fifth or something(I'm not researching what it should be) of their total money invested into a degree. That's off now too because of increased tuition. Back to what I was saying; someone who hasn't invested towards a higher education can be paid less. Think of that like tools. If you have the best tools for a job, you can charge a premium for services rendered. I'll equipped, you may be able to complete the tasks, but won't be able to charge as much because inferior tools(or lack thereof) would make for a lower quality service. </p>		</li>

			<p>Not quite. The U.S. money system is based off of credit from the federal reserve. If people don't believe the money will be worth anything, by using it or taking out loans, accruing debt, etc, it's worth less. In countries where money is based on something physical, like gold or rice or silver, it's value is based on the open market prices of the commodity backing it. Anyways. If people aren't getting money, they can't get credit by taking out loans or qualifying for credit cards. That's where the money loses value. If one in a thousand has more money than the rest of them combined, that money is worth less. As the one thousandth person controls a larger supply of credit, they can get more credit for things. However, they don't because the money they put into it won't garner a return equal to what they put in. This also lowers the value of the dollar. Now. Let's say the person sitting on a shit ton of money. They don't actually have much of it that is taxable income (business profits, interest from savings accts, investments, etc) they aren't putting that money back into the system the money comes from. This prevents the government from paying off more of the interest for the loan for the money being created. It's long and drawn out. And most of my posts strung together are all connected. Study economics. I do first hand working in retail and researching things in my free time. </p>		</li>

			<p>the price of the Apple wont be reactive. It would hurt business for the apple seller to do it. As well, you wouldn't just increase pay tenfold for each bracket. It would go up to equal the difference. So one would go up by One or two, doubling for each larger group. It wouldn't work for the whole to make compensation go up that much. I think I'm starting to understand the reluctance to accept that it would be good to make more money, or for everyone to do so. it doesn't change the concept that in a capitalistic society, people that have money to spend on stupid shit is what makes the wheels turn. The less money to spend on stupid shit, the less stupid shit is bought. Profits go down, prices go up to compensate for lost sales. With the same stupid shit at an unattainable level, more money is required to support the buying it. So, minimum wage increases reactively to inflation. </p>		</li>
