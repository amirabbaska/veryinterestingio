			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote an article at Salon with my<a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/05/04/how_the_rich_stole_our_money_and_made_us_think_they_were_doing_us_a_favor/" target="_blank"> answer to this question</a>. Here's a snippet:</p>
<p>Simply put, starting in the 1980s policymaking elites in the Western world were scared to death of oil shortages, inflationary spirals and the impact of jobs being shipped to lower-wage nations or made obsolete by increasingly powerful machines and computers. Something had to be done. Even as foreign policy became explicitly focused on securing access to oil, domestic policy became focused on quashing inflation while disguising wage stagnation. Either countries needed to move sharply to the left through increased worker protections and redistribution of incomes, or to the right by substituting an asset-based economy for the old wage-based economy. Most chose to go right — an understandable move at the time given that state Communism was still a threat to capitalist economies, but also a spent and discredited ideology. Ronald Reagan best made the case for the new economic model in a speech from 1975: </p>
<p>Roughly 94 percent of the people in capitalist America make their living from wage or salary. Only 6 percent are true capitalists in the sense of deriving income from ownership of the means of production …We can win the argument once and for all by simply making more of our people Capitalists.</p>
<p>One of the chief ways that American and British policymakers put this vision into reality was by crippling organized labor. But while that certainly placed downward pressure on wages in the U.S. and Britain, labor was not so similarly affected in most of the rest of the developed world. Organized labor remains a powerful force throughout most of Europe, yet growing wealth inequality and a declining middle class are present trends there as well. The health of organized labor abroad has helped stem the tide, but has not managed to stop it. The less noticed but potentially more consequential way that policymakers across the industrialized world set about accomplishing this goal was to push their middle classes to invest their wealth into assets, especially stocks and real estate, then use the levers of public policy to inflate the values of those assets in order to disguise the inevitable declines in wages. There was also a concerted effort to hide wage losses by lowering the prices of non-perishable goods — even if doing so meant domestic job losses. These goals were accomplished in several ways:</p>
<p>1) Push people away from defined-benefit pensions and into stocks and 401(k)s. Believe it or not, there used to be a time when the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indices were little-noticed figures in the business section of the newspaper. That’s because most people’s retirements weren’t tied to the stock market. The switch from pensions to market-based 401(k)s helped change all that. Moving employees into 401(k)s did more than just reduce the obligated burden on corporate bottom lines. It also helped goose the growth of the financial sector upon which the ultra-wealthy depend for their passive incomes. This was not an accident. Combined with the Reagan-era excesses and the explosion of the tech bubble, suddenly Wall Street was hot popular culture, and the nation watched breathlessly as the health of the Dow Jones was commonly equated with the health of the overall economy. The share of GDP taken by the financial sector grew from 2.8 percent in 1950 to 8.4 percent and rising as of 2006, and financial sector profits account for nearly a third of all corporate profits in America. As a broader sector of Americans watched their meager stock portfolios rise, they weren’t as concerned with the slow growth of their regular wages. Only lately has the damage done to retirement security by moving from defined benefits to uncertain stock markets started to become more widely known.</p>
<p>2) Push more people into buying real estate, and increase home prices by all means possible. Rates of homeownership increased most dramatically in the 1940s to 1960s, creating the first major bump in housing prices. However, the period between 1960 and 1975 saw home prices decline slightly when adjusted for inflation. The government used the levers of public policy to encourage greater homeownership and reduce interest rates. Big business and wealthy interests pushed through Wall Street deregulation during the Reagan and Clinton eras, which not only boosted the stock market but also allowed large banks to make unprecedented money off of home loans. The end result was that wealthy landlords and asset owners got much richer while rents increased and wages declined, but most Americans didn’t feel the pinch because rising home values made them feel rich on paper until the Great Recession. After the financial crisis, policymakers have done everything in their power to boost both stock and home prices through quantitative easing, 0 percent interest rates, and increased homeowner incentive programs. </p>
<p>3) Democratize consumer debt, especially through credit cards. Americans born after 1975 don’t remember a world before the widespread use of credit cards. But it used to be that if a regular member of the public couldn’t pay his or her bills, debt wasn’t usually an option.  But that wasn’t usually a huge problem, either: Because jobs were plentiful and wages had more buying power against the cost of living, most Americans didn’t need credit cards. Revolving credit used to be the province of capitalists, not of wage earners. </p>
<p>Though Diner’s Club cards originated in the 1950s, the charge cards as we know them today were truly born and popularized in the mid-1970s and early 1980s – not coincidentally the same time as Wall Street deregulation, 401(k) transitions and the birth pangs of the real estate boom. The boom in popular credit had two major effects: to enrich the same financial services companies whose success disproportionately benefits the wealthy, and to disguise and soften the effects of stagnant wages. </p>
<p>4) Reduce the cost of goods through free trade policies. The same decades that produced the previous trends also saw the implementation of free trade agreements like NAFTA. It is commonly understood today that these treaties benefit wealthy stockholders while reducing jobs in developed nations. But their less-discussed effect was also to reduce the price of many consumer goods made overseas, which in turn helped to disguise wage stagnation. </p>
<p>All of these moves toward increasing the value of assets do directly benefit the wealthy. But more important, they have served to create a more purely capitalist society, hide the decline of the middle class and mitigate public discontent over stagnant wages. There are many problems with this, of course. The first is that the vast preponderance of wealth will accrue to the very top incomes in an economy where assets inflate while wages deflate. The second is that a purely asset-based economy is bubble-prone, deeply unstable and given to sharp and painful boom-bust cycles. The story of the last half-decade is in part the removal of the blindfold that has been hiding wage losses over the last half-century. Housing prices have skyrocketed beyond the ability of most people under 40 to afford, even as household debt nears record highs. Nearly half of Americans have no retirement savings at all, while much of the rest of the developed world faces a pension obligation crisis. </p>
<p>The tools policymakers have used to distract the public from the raw deal of low wages are no longer working. And that may more than anything else help usher in a new era of populist progressivism in the U.S. — if, that is, the Democratic Party can shift itself away from reinforcing the asset-based economy toward rebuilding a sustainable model that encourages wage growth and a strong labor market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the thirties to the late 1960's, increases in productivity moved parallel with wage increases.  But in the 1980s, for some reason, wages flattened out, while GDP continued to rise. So while GDP has roughly tripled since 1970, the portion of the national income going to wages has remained at 1970s levels.  </p>
<p>It's worth considering what happens when productivity improves.  Lower costs will lead to higher profits, which of course first arrive in the accounts of the owners of the business. Where does that money then go?  The owners keep it, of course. Even if total income is increasing through productivity gains, the owners of a business are under no obligation to share that increase with anyone.  </p>
<p>And why would they?  </p>
<p>From a eagle's view, it would seem pretty obvious.  Owners of businesses are first in line to keep any money that comes their way.  Why should they be expected to share the proceeds of increased productivity?  Out of the goodness of their hearts?</p>
<p>It seems that the period when wages rose along with productivity was  a historical accident.  Unions, for a while, gave workers the power to extract some of the proceeds of productivity from owners.  But owners took steps to correct this through the political process, and have been highly successful in eliminating unions.</p>
<p>There is every reason to expect that the share of national income that does not go to capital will continue to fall.  Looking at the very long term, aside from that brief period ending in 1970, this seems like the natural order of things.</p>
<p>An ELI5 way of explaining it would be to say that business owners will continue to keep as much of their money as they can.  Without unions, they can.  And who would expect them to behave any other way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I generally would agree, but replace &quot;Owners&quot; with corporations, and you are closer to the problem. Corporations are required by law to maximise profits for their shareholders. But they are short-sighted in the sense that they avoid &quot;externalities&quot; like the cost of pollution, road building, schools, hospitals etc even though they depend on them or are affected by environmental damage themselves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres a downside of unions too of course, leveraging their power to demand more and more money/benefits/protection for poor workers until the company is uncompetitive/not profitable/has to be propped up by subsidies. The balance of who gets the profits seems to go one way or the other...sounds crappy, but when it goes to the employers, the company sticks around, when it goes to the union, it goes the way of the dodo.</p></div>		</li>

A globalized economy means wages are competing with China and India, and better technology means many sectors of job - especially in manufacturing - simply no longer exist. People live longer and retire older, and thus take up space in the job market for a longer period.</p>

<p>In any case here's the copypaste of the original.</p>
<hr />
<p>Since so many people found my responses in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2pp3nc/eli5_how_can_donald_trump_go_bankrupt_multiple/cmyt9qf" target="_blank">eli5</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2put61/what_can_we_as_americans_do_about_the_current_two/cn0d0zc" target="_blank">AskReddit</a> helpful in the last two days (and I feel deeply humbled and dutiful all of a sudden)I'll explain it in two sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The banks <strong>can print money and you can't</strong> and have to go to work and/or borrow money at interest - which means that the banks can print money faster than you can get more jobs and loans.<a href="http://img.pandawhale.com/84964-Clay-Davis-SHEEIT-meme-demotiv-ejWX.jpeg" target="_blank">Sh######t!</a></p>
</li>
<li>The &quot;trickle down effect&quot; not only doesn't work when they keep doing that - it works <strong>backwards</strong>. The &quot;trickle down effect&quot;  suddenly trickles <strong>up</strong>. <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/c3/c3a45ba805cc3cd0d8594496743b12582110c18bb0247905e97d671316c22a80.jpg" target="_blank">Mother%&amp;@$!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It has to do with two economic phenomena - <strong>inflationary credit expansion</strong> (A) and <strong>Cantillon effect</strong> (B)
Now the slightly longer but not very difficult explanation.</p>
<hr />
<p>The economic explanation (which I can give because I studied economics for too long) is:</p>
<p>Too much money for loans was made available for too long in and it drove prices too much.  Why? Because supply and demand affect money the same way as other goods. If you can create new money faster than build new houses then the price of houses will go up because the value - purchasing power - of money goes down. Whatever is scarce  and in demand is valuable. Same is true for new cars - if there's too many consumer loans the dealers will jack the prices up and the manufacturers will be happy and won't make more cars to drop the price. No sir!</p>
<p>The prices would normally fall - just like it happened after the 2008 crash - but that would mean too much money would evaporate from the banks (also known as deflation) and that just couldn't stand. GDP would contract, a crisis would strike and that might cost the politicians an election! Screw dropping standard of living! We might lose the next election!!!! So the government and the fed kept propping the credit bubble up and even increasing it.For years and years and years.   And the prices kept rising and rising.. long enough for the <strong>cantillon effect</strong> to occur. This is the key and an important term to remember - because it is soooo obscure and pundits and politicians like to talk about getting new taxes, dropping interest rates more, introducing new laws... And never address the real issue! Besides who'd care about some Cantillon? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cantillon" target="_blank">Who was he?</a> A Frenchman? An Irishman! Get out!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Cantillon effect</strong> occurs when a lot of new money is introduced into the economy through very few channels. Meaning when not everyone suddenly gets a 100$ bill stuck into a wallet but when the banks can borrow money from the FED at a much lower rate. Then the banks get it first, play a bit on the financial markets, then perhaps invest in some stocks and that money slowly, slowly, very slowly trickles down to you. There's just one 'but'. Whoever gets it first can use its full purchasing power. As it filters down through the economy people realize that there's more money and the value of it (the purchasing power) falls down. So whoever gets the money last gets the least of purchasing power. Whoever gets the money first spends it on a market that is <em>not yet aware of this new money</em>.</p>
<p>The problem? There's no difference between &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; money. So if a bank creates one billion new dollars it will affect the value of the new dollars just as much as the value of the old dollars in your wallet.  And if the credit expansion was happening continuously since the 1987 crisis and the post Gulf-war recession (which cost George Bush Sr the election)... That's almost 25 years of printing money to suck out all the life from your wallet. </p>
<p>Only the bank and the government can keep printing, and printing, and printing.... And they get bailouts, TARPS, quantitative easings... And you have to keep <em>working</em> for your wages.  You have only two hands and there's only 24 hours and 52 weeks.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is really what causes the &quot;drop in real wages&quot;. The wages don't decrease. You don't get wage cuts but the money you are earning isn't worth as much as it used to be before. And while people keep telling you that &quot;inflation is consistently low&quot;...  remember that inflation is measured to avoid &quot;systemic shocks&quot; such as rapid growth in oil price, housing bubbles, higher ed bubbles...</p>
<p>Pretty much everywhere where the inflation really hurts.  If you want to know how badly put a baloon in your butt and blow it up with a compressor. That's how much it hurts. Damn inflation.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are obviously other causes too. Jobs are getting scarce because the market is volatile. Companies can't get credit or capital for investment and can't expand and employ people - especially when Li and Wong work for a bowl of rice. Banks have too much troubled assets and can give loans for free like 10 years ago. Unless you are an old white guy - but even then it's not guaranteed. But the reason why this here - <strong>above</strong> - is <em>the</em> explanation is that in times like this prices should <strong>fall</strong>.  Just like the prices in 2008 did. Just like the housing bubble in Nevada brought new homes in Las Vegas from hot properties for 150k  to vacant lots at 25k. Just like the property bubble in Britain in the late 80s drove the price for a broom closet in the City of London to 25000 pounds and then brought it back to a pack of peanuts in 1991.</p>
<p>Shit doesn't sell anymore! People are out of work! So why <em>some</em> prices are still so high? <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/57/574aa510639422f9e66a9832de8c6bfcad2b57a23afa95c8488baa81ee6ed301.jpg" target="_blank">Why is it so too damn high I am asking you!!!</a></p>
<p>You need to get the money <em>out of the economy</em>. And that means &quot;deflation&quot;. And the banks and the politicians poop in their pants when they hear this. Because election!</p>
