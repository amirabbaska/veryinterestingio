			<div class="markdown"><p>I checked out most of the qz.com deal. It was a lot of fluff. The best parts are where you acknowledge the thermodynamic limitations and implications involved, i.e., that we ultimately need to use renewables and/or nuclear to deal with it. I'd focus on that more, even if it's not sexy. The majority of your arguments were economic and that stuff is often arbitrary or in conflict with reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imo it may have seem like a lot of fluff to you since the author didn't cover what you wanted covered. I thought the material covered was the correct way to go considering 1. The reader base and 2. The economic incentives are what sway the public's opinion on implementing the renewables,  not the 'thermodynamic implications' </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Petroleum Engineer here having worked on numerous CO2 flood EOR projects.  Thermo does screw it.  You can do it but it will significantly raise the cost of power because it burns a less than insignificant amount of the power produced from burning the fuel to run the process to capture the CO2. </p></div>		</li>
