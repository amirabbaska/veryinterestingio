			<div class="markdown"><p>No the reason it was an ice bucket is because the sensation of your body reacting to the freezing water is what people witg als feel all the time so you're kinda puttung yourself in their shoes for a brief second</p></div>		</li>

<p>Optimal is &quot;body temperature&quot; which is around 37C/98F</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I assume this is the optimal body temperature and not the optimal external temperature. Typically the body is designed to operate with lower temperature outside than inside to dump some of the heat created in the normal biological processes of being alive. If it's 98F outside it's kinda hard to get rid of heat you produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, body temperature refers to core temperature.</p>
<p>It’s not impossible to get rid of heat when it’s over 98F though. Your body cools itself by evaporating sweat. As long as the humidity is below 100%, and your body is sufficiently hydrated, you can cool off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you're sweating, you're losing sodium, potassium, and electrolytes, which relate pretty strongly to lowered performance mentally and physically across the board. If you are just hydrating and drinking water, it won't be enough to make up for it. If you are replenishing lost nutrients and electrolytes, it shouldn't make as big an impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's not impossible, but it is hard. Would you rather hang out in a room that's 98F or in a room that's 78F? Feeling uncomfortable at 98F is our body's way of saying, &quot;You know, these aren't the best conditions for me&quot;</p></div>		</li>
