<p>She might have just been distressed that it didn’t happen. Not so much that you could control it.</p>

<p>I can't speak for dogs, but I can clearly distinguish my cat's behaviour when they're stressed and want me to address it (e.g. I've been negligent with the litter box) something vs when they're stressed for things not directly related to me (e.g. thunder).</p>
<p>Dogs are commonly thought of as more communicative, so I'd wager wisconsinwookie78 can notice the difference between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. But then after you turn back to the station and they realise that after their whimpering you actually can go back, they may learn that you in fact can control it and later let you know that they want you to go get the cheese curds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mainly where my question comes from... Just the idea that dogs go into these things that speed them around but they may not know how it's all working.</p>
<p>Edit:obv they don't know how it works, but more like do they realize it's not like another animal that they're riding? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think they care.  Their minds are too simplistic for that.</p>
<p>They know there are these big things with chairs inside that sometimes they and the human go into.  There's a sense of motion.  There's wind if the windows are open, with a ton of changing smells.  Things move by.  When the wind and the motion stops you get out and you're not in the same place you left.</p>
<p>If the dog finds the experience fun they may repeat behaviors that they did just before they had the experience (jumping up on the door, grabbing the leash) in the hopes that it'll create it again.  They will also notice patterns of behavior from other things that precede the experience (human picks up jangly keys) and show signs of excitement when these omens occur.</p>
<p>That's the extent of how much a dog cares.  They don't care &quot;why&quot; or &quot;how&quot;.  They're all about &quot;what&quot;.  &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; are human concepts.</p>
<p>In some ways, a dog is like a zen master.  It observes the world, but doesn't make any attempt to look beneath the surface.  It simply accepts things as they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that dogs are wary of vacuum cleaners because it's something that moves, makes noise, so technically it's &quot;alive&quot;, but the dog has no way of cataloging it in the &quot;what animal is this&quot; part of their brain. Is it dangerous? Is it above them in social hierarchy? Do they act submissive or boss it around?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there was that instance of the dog (probably lots but this one made in into a 'feel good' news segment and got around reddit etc) of the dog that worked out how to catch the bus by itself to its favourite park (or a pub it like or something like that) and then catch the bus back home as well when it was done.</p>
<p>A lot of that is just mimicry and pattern recognition, but to recognise that in the first place shows that it knows there is more going on than just random metal ball, destination unknown (though it's fair to say that doggy intelligence is on a variable scale). </p>
<p>It cheated a little bit in that it'd only get on when the 'trusted' driver was working, but that's intelligent as well to build in your own failsafes in case you screw up.  </p></div>		</li>
