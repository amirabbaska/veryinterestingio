			<div class="markdown"><p>Prostate cancer is curable if detected early which is people aren’t so keen to wait around for symptoms.</p>
<p>Acting on every growth would be silly, which seems to be why you suggest ignorance as noticing currently mandates action.</p>
<p>The most useful use would be to monitor changes over time to highlight what is abnormal for an individual.</p>
<p>MRI may be extremely expensive but sit idle a lot which is a large part of the reason the cost recover is so high per test. And I don’t imagine the “machine operator” aspect would require an amazing amount of skill.</p>
<p>Churning people through to create development profiles over time would greatly reduce the cost recovery time and price.</p></div>		</li>
