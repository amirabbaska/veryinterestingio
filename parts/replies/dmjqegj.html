			<div class="markdown"><p>Heyo, recently graduated visual effects artist. Mimd if I ask you a couple of questions?</p>
<ol>
<li>How's the industry treating us effects artists ? I have been so discouraged with my experiences at interns and in school work</li>
<li>Where do you supervise?</li>
<li>How many years did it takw before you move up to that position?</li>
<li>Where did you start?</li>
<li>Im seriously considering working on small companies / starr ups cause I know in thos big comlanies youre hired for that 1 job and it's crazy hard to move on from there, plus I heard from profs that the pay is better in smaller studios</li>
<li>Basically I am not happy with my experiences and I am currently in road to get a mba in marketing. I am v mucj into the business side of things and for my goal as a peoducer, I feel that this is a good path to take while doing some side producing </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey hey,</p>
<p>1). Since the studio I work at concentrates on commercials and a few small films or music videos, we're doing great.  A lot of our bread and butter work will be work that'll never stop coming in (pack replacements for new artwork on older commercials, demos and pack shots, etc).   It's not the most glamorous thing but it's work so you can't complain.</p>
<p>2). I supervise at OPTIX (optixlovesyou.com) specifically at their Dubai Branch.</p>
<p>3). Roughly 7 years</p>
<p>4).  Started out as an intern straight out of college at OPTIX.  Been with them for close to 9 years.</p>
<p>5).  That's basically the path that I took.  Working for boutique studios has its charm with the people you work with.  We're like a close-knit family.  It's easier to move up in, and a lot of opportunities presents itself if you're the type to take on responsibilities and not be afraid of the pressure of fucking up.  You will get chances to do things outside of your realm because we don't have the luxury to rely on one person to do a specific task, so everyone is more like a Swiss Army knife of sorts.</p>
<p>6).  In the case that you'd want to be a VFX Producer, I would use the schooling experience as basic credentials for your resume but definitely pursue a marketing degree if you can't get your feet in to the door at a studio.  You'd want to try and jump on as a junior producer and work on your portfolio focusing on CG / VFX jobs so that you can start specializing on those specific projects and not deal with editing / grading jobs.  If you can't get your foot in the door then I'd try to hit an MBA, just not sure how important that will be compared to the tuition you'd need to throw down on.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great reply, and if anyone's still wondering why it's expensive there are loads of other positions and costs left out of this summary (it would get unreasonably long if everything was covered)</p></div>		</li>
