			<div class="markdown"><p>There is another mission in the works called TESS (Transiting exoplanets space satellite) which is supposed to do a full sky survey for exoplanets using wide view cameras. </p>
<p>When I was referring to 1000s of exoplanets in my previous post I was mixing up JWST &amp; TESS, it's actually TESS that will detect all those exoplanets.</p>
<p>JWST was designed to work in the infrared so it can observe star and galaxy formation something we can't do from the ground. That's probably what it will do most of the time.</p>
<p>The planets detected by TESS are then targeted with JWST and ground telescopes for further studies. I think EELT will be used mostly to calculate the orbit, and thus the size and composition (density) of the planet while JWST will analyze the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>
