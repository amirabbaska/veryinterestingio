			<div class="markdown"><p>That's definitely not why they're called beakers. Beaker comes from the Germanic word for &quot;cup&quot; and is still used for cups in German, Dutch, Danish etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> That iconic soy sauce bottle you see everywhere was designed to prevent this, the spout enables the precise and clean dispensing of small quantities or even single drops of soy sauce without drips. It took the designer 3 years and 100 prototypes to perfect that bottle, also it has a broad-based tear shape for stability, with a narrow funnel neck making it easy to hold.</p>
<p><strong>Not so fun fact:</strong> The designer sister was killed in the blast of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and his father, a buddhist monk, died later of radiation poisoning.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As I was reading up to this point, I was picturing the designer using explosions to develop his soy sauce bottle prototypes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The terminology is called surface tension, a droplet of water &quot;sticks&quot; to the ends of surfaces if they have the right conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our stupid glass Pyrex measuring cups have a nice little pouring spout on them, you'd think it would make pouring liquids out of them nice and clean. That stupid spout is the worst thing to pour from in the house. Gets everywhere. Every. Time. </p></div>		</li>
