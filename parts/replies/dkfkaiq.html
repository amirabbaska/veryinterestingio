			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea about plants but I remember reading that if a human being lives long enough and nothing else gets to them all the cell replication will necessarily lead to cancer. This could be irrelevant though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cancer is not <em>necessarily</em> inevitable, it's just that with an imperfect repair system, it becomes more and more likely the older you are. Some animals have better repair systems than others. Elephants in this regard are notable for a rare incidence of cancer that contradicts what you'd suspect from their size (number of cells for which something can go wrong) and their longevity. Certain human individuals may have cancer-fighting genes and better repair systems than others. Their risk of cancer might not even increase with age, but if they keep playing the same odds year after year, eventually their number comes up. Put another way, even if you're 21 forever, you'd probably get cancer at some point. Same way if you drive a car long enough you'll eventually get into an accident, even if you're an excellent driver.</p>
<p>Anyways, the way you phrase it - &quot;if a human lives long enough and nothing else gets to them&quot; - then you could say that of almost any cause of death as being inevitable, e.g. cardiovascular disease.</p></div>		</li>
