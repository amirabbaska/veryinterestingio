			<p>&gt;The intensity of each color in the rainbow could also change based on the color of the star / sun's light.<br><br>This is certainly apparent when looking at a rainbow near dusk; when redder tones dominate blues, rainbows appear more monochrome.<br><br>&gt;I think it's possible that the secondary, reversed rainbow could actually be the more prominent one, if the droplets are positioned and shaped correctly<br><br>I think the droplets' refractive index (and at some level, the dispersion profile and wavelength) would also play a large role in how many TIR bounces are supported, but I would expect the answer would be driven by Fermat and the laziest/quickest path for the light to pass. I also leave the proof to the reader.</p>		</li>

			<p>Simple explanation is that the colors you see are simply the way that your brain interprets the range of light wavelengths that your eyes are capable of detecting.</p>		</li>

			<p>I wish more people would understand this. <br><br>Most people think of colours as wavelengths. <br><br>I hate when people say &quot;there are colours like x ray and ultraviolet we can't see&quot;. This is absurd. <br><br>We wouldn't see any more colours without an extra cone, which is not essential to see other wavelengths. </p>		</li>
