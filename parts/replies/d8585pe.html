<p>The intensity of each color in the rainbow could also change based on the color of the star / sun's light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is certainly apparent when looking at a rainbow near dusk; when redder tones dominate blues, rainbows appear more monochrome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it's possible that the secondary, reversed rainbow could actually be the more prominent one, if the droplets are positioned and shaped correctly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the droplets' refractive index (and at some level, the dispersion profile and wavelength) would also play a large role in how many TIR bounces are supported, but I would expect the answer would be driven by Fermat and the laziest/quickest path for the light to pass. I also leave the proof to the reader.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most people think of colours as wavelengths. </p>
<p>I hate when people say &quot;there are colours like x ray and ultraviolet we can't see&quot;. This is absurd. </p>
<p>We wouldn't see any more colours without an extra cone, which is not essential to see other wavelengths. </p></div>		</li>
