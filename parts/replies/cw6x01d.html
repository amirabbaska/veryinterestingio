<p>Reality is the disease leaves you very emotionally vulnerable, and bad luck + bad people took advantage of that. I got pretty sick, but I've been improving the past three years.</p>
<p>I'm very thankful my government takes care of me, and I'm working hard to get back on my feet. If I'd been born somewhere with worse social safety nets than Canada, I'd probably be homeless or dead by now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have hypersomnia as part of my depression - I could easily sleep 12+ hours a day, but had a hard time staying awake no matter how much sleep I'd had. After years of panic-dozing while driving my morning commute, I got a prescription for modafinil. It doesn't make me wired like caffeine, it just wakes me up all the way. </p></div>		</li>
