			<div class="markdown"><p>This redundancy in the system is also really important in situations other than amputation. For example if one blood vessel is blocked by an embolus (e.g. blood clot, air bubble, fat) there is often another route that the blood can take. Obviously some blood vessels are more important than others (e.g. coronary arteries which supply the heart) and if these become blocked then you can have some real problems (e.g. a heart attack)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what also causes a stroke. On top of the brain is a circle of arteries. If one side gets clogged the brain pushes the blood to another side but whatever part is clogged doesnt receive enough. This why stroke victims can be affected on different sides of the body and different parts of the brain. The thing about strokes only affecting the left side or primarily the left side is just a myth. They commonly happen to both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heart can also form &quot;collaterals&quot; to bypass blockages - in an acute situation obviously the heart cannot do this, but over a longer period of time, a progressively worsening coronary artery obstruction can lead to the formation of these collaterals which can in fact be efficient enough that a 100% blocked coronary artery will not need any intervention to treat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this really gets to the heart of the issue. It's important to realise that the <em>role</em> of the artery is to supply tissue, not capillaries. It also helps to think about the limb in terms of <strong>above amputation</strong> and <strong>below amputation</strong>. The muscles and tissue below the amputation, no longer have need for blood supply, so the artery can be tied off. The muscles and tissue above the artery still need oxygen and nutrients, but there's no need to change the blood supply that's already there as it is getting to the tissue effectively and presumably is getting drained effectively. Same goes for the veins. The <em>below</em> veins are out of a job and the <em>above</em> veins do the same job that they were always doing (also the vein's don't have extra blood they have to drain. I can explain why if you want, but it is an entirely different ELI5 question).</p>
<p>EDIT: the original comment was edited since I posted to be more like what I said. So enough with the snarkiness down below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it is also important to perhaps explain collatorization. If a particular vein can no longer provide adequate blow flow to certain tissues, the smaller blood vessels which were mentioned before, will grow and expand till blood flow is adequate.</p>
<p>I've learned quite a bit about this as I have recently found out I lack the Inferior Vena Cava, this is the major vein that brings blood from the legs to the heart. Instead my body built a complex network of collaterals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, blood vessels adapt over time to the demands of the body.  My dad had blocked arteries in his heart, but the damage was not that bad because his decades of excercise had caused other smaller blood vessels to increase their capacity to compensate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no doctor, but I've done a number of human anatomy and health courses. As far as I know even small amounts of blockage in coronary arteries is very bad and can definitely lead to complications that wouldn't be solved by having slightly increased capacity in other vessels. Artherosclerotic plaques that form in coronary arteries can dislodge and cause cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease and potentially ischemic strokes. Could you elaborate on what you said or, if possible, get more information?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If this is true, would a neuroscientist be able to compare this to the idea of neuroplasticity - the brain's ability to adapt to change over time? Stroke sufferers can regain up to 90% of their movement through physiological changes in brain structure, so I assume that this would be similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the guy you were responding to, but the vascular system is surprisingly elastic and so most of the pressure equalization would happen at the artery level. Capillaries are nowhere near as elastic. Furthermore the heart rate would likely decrease in order to compensate for the smaller stroke volume the body needs. That's assuming we're talking about a large amputation like an arm, which would change the body's blood needs drastically.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yessir! Also the reason such wounds ooze instead of pulse. Blood pressure slowly forces blood out through those super tiny channels. So tiny that the pulse isnt noticeable. Nick an artery however and you can get a gush for meters every heartbeat. Ive done it. Its not super fun. </p></div>		</li>
