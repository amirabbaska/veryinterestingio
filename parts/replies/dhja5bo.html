			<div class="markdown"><p>Ensure is gross. They made us drink it when I was in residential treatment for eating disorders when we needed to restore weight or if we refused to eat. Very sticky, heavier than full cream, weird aftertaste. Boost is ok because it's a gluten free formula so it goes down more like thicker chocolate milk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard of getting these for free in Ontario. Maybe it's a provincial thing? They do regularly go on sale and I've bought packs a few times when my diet was poor for medical reasons, as a supplement.  Disgusting, but serves a purpose. I'm not a shake or smoothie kind of person though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can be free in Ontario.</p>
<p>But only for those on the Ontario Drug Benefit Program (available to only ultra-low-income people, seniors, and those with disabilities.) If you fall into that population, you still need the requirement of a prescription from a physician, and be unable to eat solid food/have no other sources of food.</p>
<p>So it's only free if you're using it as a meal <em>replacement</em> and not a supplement.</p></div>		</li>
