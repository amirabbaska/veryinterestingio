			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking of spaghetti and meatballs, then the other guy said something about burgers and my brain nose went to whataburger, just a plain burger in my mouth. Then you mentioned bacon and that burger became a double with bacon on it. I know what I'm having for lunch tomorrow </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it has to do a lot with the fact that sight and ears process energy, but smell processes physical molecules and their composition. It's not that we can't imagine smells, we can, but we can't store the information of a smell because it's bound to one of the first and most primitive ways of seeing- through molecular sensing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why it actually evolved this way is another topic.</p>

<p>Probably because we needed to see and hear predators to survive, but not taste or smell them. </p></div>		</li>
