			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny thing is, the Dutch did indeed tend the polders to be enriched with nutrients, but now the government has assignt some polders as emergency flood areas. In case of high water in the rivers (of which we have to many here) those areas have to be available to be flooded. Now the civillians, living in those polders where their family lived for hundreds of years sometimes, are angry ofcourse, because the fertile land their forfathers created has to &quot;be given back to nature&quot; so the river can flow there without trouble if nessessary. (my english isn't amazing, sorry) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has been some time since I learned it in school, but there were 2 things. The &quot;Give the rivers more room&quot; project and the emergency flood polders. I remember something about the farmers in Zeeland being very angry because there polders were selected to be part of one or the other. The farmers were/are angry because it has taken a long time to create and fertilize the polders and those polders are some of the most fertile. I don't remember exactly what the whole story was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your English is great in writing. I've  always been of the impression that English is as hard as Chinese (In any context) simply because of the multiple usage of words. They sound the same, but the usage and context are variable. Don't  apologize for having a more extensive use of the English language than those who naturally employ it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At least, when I apologize for my French, that's what I'm hoping for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also helped that this country contains the deltas for a few major rivers (the Meuse and the Rhine). This would bring a lot of nutrient-rich soil and clays.</p>
<p>But the poorness of the soil is still very noticeable in our nature areas. The forests are very species-poor, heather fields are everywhere, and we even have a few <a href="https://www.google.nl/search?q=kootwijkerzand&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=924&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis3fmEpLzRAhWE7hoKHa3ZBbYQ_AUIBigB" target="_blank">large sand dune areas</a> where the soil is so poor almost nothing grows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those sand dune areas are actually like that because, in the middle ages, the forests that were there were cut down, and then the land was exhausted through overgrazing and agriculture without enough nutrients getting put back in. Of course, being sandy soil, not getting nutrients from being in the river deltas doesn't really help to begin with either. </p></div>		</li>

<p>An example would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lammefjorden" target="_blank">Lammefjorden</a> in Denmark, which was dammed in the 1870s and drained in stages. It's now known for excellent carrots, which are covered by an EU protected geographical designation.</p></div>		</li>
