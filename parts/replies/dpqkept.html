<p>Is this actually how it’s done? Or is this an exaggeration for something much more complicated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, that's literally how it's done. I've never done the process myself, so there's most likely more that goes into it, but when graphene was first &quot;discovered&quot; that's how it was made: scotch tape.</p>
<p>In a way, the R2R process <em>is</em> the much more complicated version. You've got the graphene on one surface (in my case, copper) and you want to essentially peel it off of the copper and onto some other, more useful surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Novoselov and Geim specifically used Selotape the first time.  </p>
<p>In current research, exfoliation techniques are usually reference to sonication, chemical oxidation  and / or mechanical shearing forces now. No-one works with tape!  </p>
<p>Fun fact: one of the main chemical exfoliation protocols, which has been iterated on to produce graphene oxide was written in 1954 - they were literally one step away from &quot;discovering&quot; monolayer carbon half a century early.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um, it's nothing really concrete that I can pinpoint a reason for. That part's more of a gut feeling. But currently, the technology for even basic R2R isn't there, and that's what will ultimately (in my opinion) open up graphene use in the mainstream. It will almost certainly take a few more years to get R2R figured out in a research environment, and then even longer to transfer that into a production setting.</p></div>		</li>
