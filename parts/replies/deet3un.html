<p>If that's not enough &quot;spin&quot; for you, just remember that this collusion included stirring up christian hatred for jews and secularists.  </p>
<p>Just a big, ole 'nothingburger,' though, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is so much wrong here regarding &quot;Russian&quot; hackers.</p>
<p>1) The only evidence linking the hacking attempts to Russia are the tools used. While those tools are believed to the Russian in origin they are available to anyone that knows where to look.</p>
<p>2) The company that was hired by the DNC to deal with the hacks is CrowdStrike, co-founded by Dmitri Alperovitch who hates Putin. He is a Russian Ex-pat who is happy to place blame, fairly or not, on Putin for anything any everything he can. This comes from his own employees.</p>
<p>3) The &quot;Security&quot; report had no actual evidence that linked Putin, or people working for him, to any actions that could be considered influential. Instead it speculated that two year old news shows that showed Clinton in an unfavorable light &quot;might&quot; have influenced voters. Any evidence that proved Russian attempts at hacking into the DNC email servers was left out of the public report, assuming it existed, and no one will confirm what that information might be beyond &quot;Trust us, its there&quot;.</p>
<p>4) Wikileaks has repeatedly stated that their source was not from the Russian government but was a DNC insider. Both the CIA and FBI have stated that this is in fact the most likely scenario.</p>
<p>5) The one person who has claimed responsibility, Guccifer 2.0, is not Russian but Romanian. So far they have only claimed responsibility for hacking Clinton's private email server.</p>
<p>6) It is entirely possible that there are ties between Trump and Putin, but those so far remain unconnected to any of the the known hacking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, one thing I wasn't clear about -- Flynn later became Trump's National Security Advisor. He was forced to resign a week or two ago when this all became public. </p>
<p>Also, Clinton campaign manager John Podesta had his personal email account hacked by russia as well. There was some more embarrassing sausage-making there, but nothing scandalous except the revelation that DNC operative Donna Brazile tried to feed the Clinton campaign the information that there would be a debate question about the Flint water crisis at the Clinton/Sanders debate being held in Flint. (I mean, seriously.) Podesta did not pass the information on. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No he didn't. He left his tablet in the back of a taxi and used the oh so secure password of &quot;password&quot;. A 5 year old could have got past that. That tablet was still logged into his email, so once they guessed his password it would have taken maybe half an hour to upload all his email to another location.</p>
<p>I guess you could call that hacking but I've done more than that dead drunk.</p></div>		</li>
