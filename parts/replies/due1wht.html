			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems to me that the beanball is used for similar reasons in baseball. Steal a base when your team is already up five runs in the late innings? Next guy gets beaned. Slide into the catcher too hard? Next guy gets beaned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m assuming you mean a hit by pitch. A bean ball is a pitch specifically targeting a batters head,  which is never acceptable.  A pitcher who intentionally hits a batter in the situation you described above generally aims for the batter with the intent of hitting them in a place that doesn’t have a high probability for serious injury. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forwards are usually smaller, fast guys, and defenders are bigger and bulkier. So a big guy hitting a forward with excessive force is probably going to get in a fight with one of that forward's big teammates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, back in the 80s and 90s things got ramped up with special players on your team called enforcers.  They would generally instigate big hits, fights, etc.  They were there to protect the players that didn't really wanna fight so if a certain star player was getting checked a lot they would step in and remind the other team to stop doing that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things have changed since then though.  Teams really don't use that kind of tactic these days and the league in general has lowered the level of fighting.  It's more of a tradition in the sport these days and 9/10 when you see one it was mutually agreed between the fighters to throw down.  Probably not necessary at all, but eh, it's unique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basketball has a slower pace where they have time to cool down with a foul or timeout every 3 seconds. Also contact is allowed in hockey, a legal check is enough to break bones sometimes and people don't stand for their teammates getting roughed up like that.  I'm surprised there aren't more fights in American football, but then again, plays only last a few seconds with a long huddle to cool off</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not, the NFL is <strong>extremely</strong> draconian towards unsportsmanlike conduct, and fighting is a huge no-no. Heck, there was one dude who was roundly criticized for sacking quarterbacks too hard.</p>
<p>I wonder if XFL v2.0 will be the same as &quot;He hate me&quot; v1.0.</p></div>		</li>
