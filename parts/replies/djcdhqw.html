			<div class="markdown"><p>probably not your case but In my country we have scam calls that make you say the word &quot;yes&quot; (like when asking your name) and ask you to read out your phone number so they can activate unwanted services on your line because (sadly) you only need those 2 stupid recorded snippet of a conversation...</p>
<p>have you (or companies similiar to yours) done something like this? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it wasn't based around phone services. The clients had to physically enter their credit card details on our website.</p>
<p>I am aware of various phone scams but I didn't know about this one. The most common one is when you try to download something and are asked for your phone number, you are then sent a code and are supposed to enter the code on the website. By doing that, you activate a premium SMS service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may have changed, i do not know you personally. Its nothing against who you are now. Iv been in a similar situation on the scamming end. I used to work in a locksmiths shop and we sold safes and these elderly people would come in and want to purchase safes thinking all of their lifes work and valuables would be safe in a small sentry safe the size of a small microwave. While i managed to convince them no that is infact the worst thing they could do i was told by my manager to sell them something from the line of american security safes and he wanted me to sell them top tier which i knew was way to exspensive and way more than what they needed. I could have done it they were vulnerable, but i didnt. I dont care how much money there was to be made from those sales i just knew better than to prey on people like that. </p>
<p>Sorry if i came off like an asshole for just ourright calling you a piece of shit, people just really dissapoint the hell out of me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fine, really. I did act like a piece of shit.</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of the scam industries is that they are setup in a way that prevents and punishes attitudes like yours.</p>
<p>If I didn't take the guy's money, my buddy sitting next to me would. If not him then the next guy, if not him then there was another company like ours that would get the lead after an hour or so, and they'd take the money.</p>
<p>If I kept not taking their money I'd be fired and replaced.</p>
<p>And the most demoralizing thing is that even if they were told that it's a scam, it wouldn't guarantee that they won't fall for it. We had freaking repeat customers.</p>
<p>Does that absolve me from responsibility? No, but I will keep saying that the real villains are the owners. Because they actually got up one morning and said &quot;I'm going to start a scam business&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

And I don't mean just close down one of the offices. How do you hurt the owners?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to hurt the owners because they are hiding behind thousands of kilometers and a few shell companies. Honestly, I have no idea. The legal system basically makes the actual owners invulnerable.</p>
<p>I think the best way to put them out of &quot;business&quot; is to educate people. My clients actually believed that they could get super rich by pushing a button on their PC. Not to victim blame but if you belive that, you will believe anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true... The people at the top are borderline untouchable. </p>
<p>I was loosely involved in the online payday loan industry for a few years. While payday loans themselves aren't necessarily a &quot;scam&quot;, there are still many ways that the companies can operate illegally. </p>
<p>The parent company of the particular company I worked for was based offshore. The company I was employed directly under was located in a different country than the parent company. The country we actually loaned in was separate from these two countries. We had no physical presence within the country in which we provided lending services. We never conducted any physical business there, and never so much as rented/owned a single square foot of real estate there. I'm unsure if the owners ever stepped foot in that country. </p>
<p>And yet while all of this may still be legal (or at least a grey area), many of our day to day operations were totally illegal. But that didn't hinder profits in the slightest, and the entire company was a huge cash cow for the owners/investors. </p>
<p>Most of the employees, at least in my department, were taking home more money than they knew what to do with. We had to have been on the radar of every applicable government agency, but nothing ever happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way is probably for people like u/scammerthrowaway123 to help bust them from the inside. Maybe make there be a substantial financial reward for helping law enforcement crush these fuckers' businesses. </p></div>		</li>
