			<div class="markdown"><p>If you dig deep enough anywhere on the Earth you will eventually hit solid bedrock. In some places the bedrock is only a couple inches below the soil or even completely exposed (like in the Canadian Shield) and in other places it's buried under many meters of soil and dirt and small rocks. Someone else posted that beneath the Sahara desert is sandstone, but at some point under that is bedrock (or basement rock), which is a really hard granite-like rock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>coarser sand, small stones, larger stones, rocks, and finally bedrock. In that order. There are stones of all sizes in a desert. the smallest dust blows away, so the lightest sand ends up on top and the larger and larger sizes of stone ends up deeper and deeper down because they have higher density (not really density, it's all the same material afterall, but if you count density over the volume of a big rock there would be lots of air between the same volume of sand). Over time the desert moves so it's sort of liquid, so heavy stones do  sink.</p>

<p>It would be so gradual that you'd have a hard time deciding when to define it as small stones rather than sand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>depending on the density of the compacting material, and in the presence of vibrations(earth quakes), large(not necessarily heavy) objects would instead rise to the surface. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_convection" target="_blank">Brazil Nut Theory</a> {Why Brazil nuts are always on top of a bowl of mixed nuts; Granular Convection}</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is a phenomenon where granular material subjected to shaking or vibration will exhibit circulation patterns similar to types of fluid convection.</p>
