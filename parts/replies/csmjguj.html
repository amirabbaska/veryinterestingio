			<div class="markdown"><p>Just was about to say that. But I have a question too. How does the matter know what percentage of energy to turn into mass. Let's say you have a baseball at rest. Then you throw it 60mph. What percentage of the energy given to it is used to increase its kinetic energy and what percentage is used to increase its mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass-energy equivalence means exactly what it says. Mass is energy and energy is mass. They are exactly the same thing. Gravity is the distortion of spacetime caused by this energy. Where you might be getting confused is there are several different quantities that are commonly called mass which aren't the same thing. The kind of mass most people are familiar with is rest mass. That always stays the same. The mass that increases based on velocity is the relativistic mass which is directly proportional to its energy. They are two names for the same thing in slightly different units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you say the word &quot;but&quot;? It's as if you consider there to be a contradiction. If a black hole formed in the early moments of the universe, and we were inside of it (i.e. inside of its Schwartzchild radius), we would have no idea. Life inside of a black hole is identical to life outside of a black hole, the only distinction is the two &quot;societies&quot; cannot communicate with one another, as one considers the other to be smushed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Five of the seven base units, yes. There is a Planck Mass, Planck Time, Planck Length, Planck Temperature and Planck Charge.</p>
<p>They're almost all either tiny or large (with the exception of the Planck Mass, about as heavy as a flea egg) and thus you don't see them in use often, but they have the useful effect that fundamental constants just drop to 1 when you do the equations in Planck units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are all connected, yes.  A body at Planck temperature would emit photons with a Planck length wavelength, which is also to say, photons having Planck energy.  Planck length is also the distance that a photon travels in Planck time, so a wavelength of Planck length corresponds to a frequency of 1/Planck time.  Also a black hole with a radius of one Planck length would have a mass of one Planck mass. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be that it's an actual physical impossibility, not just a temporary one due to missing information, in the same way that it's impossible to transmit information out of a black hole without extra dimensions.  As far as we can tell, it's not just about current understanding, but prediction is impossible with any level of understanding.</p></div>		</li>
