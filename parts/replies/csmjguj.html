			<p>Just to finish off: That high a temperature would theoretically cause a black hole to form (essentially because of mass-energy equivalence)That's a pretty good argument for considering it to be a maximum irrespective of what we know about high energy physics.</p>		</li>

			<p>Just was about to say that. But I have a question too. How does the matter know what percentage of energy to turn into mass. Let's say you have a baseball at rest. Then you throw it 60mph. What percentage of the energy given to it is used to increase its kinetic energy and what percentage is used to increase its mass?</p>		</li>

			<p>Except not quite. That is the simplified equation which deal with rest mass. Mass is just a form of energy. The full equation clears things up and allows you to see adding more energy doesn't mean an increase in mass nessesarily. Often it's in the frequency or kinetic energy increasing. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yeeeah, that's a short version of a longer equation. Here's the full thing that is used for things in motion: E²=(mc²)²+(pc)² <br><br>p here means momentum. If p is zero E²=(mc²)²+(pc)²  is the same as E=mc^2</p>		</li>

			<p>It's mostly just confusing to think of mass as increasing with speed. You have a rest mass that is constant and can be converted to energy via E = mc^2 and then you have kinetic energy. As you add kinetic energy, the total energy of the object increases. This could be considered to increase the weight of the object and will affect it's gravitational pull, but the &quot;rest mass&quot; is not increased.<br><br>If you use energy to accelerate an object, you will increase its kinetic energy and therefore its total energy. If you want to be confused you can think of this total energy as the mass.</p>		</li>

			<p>First of all, I disagree with labeling the total energy of an object as mass as it's more confusing than useful.<br><br>As for the energy of an object, it will change depending on what reference frame you use. Just like different reference frames will see speeds and lengths differently, they would also disagree on the energy of an object.<br><br>If you also want to take into account the rotation of the Earth you are in a non-inertial frame and that makes things a lot more complicated, but it's not needed to answer the basic question.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;If you also want to take into account the rotation of the Earth you are in a non-inertial frame and that makes things a lot more complicated, but it's not needed to answer the basic question.<br><br>Would it still give more energy to the things on Earth while looking at galactic clusters moving as a reference point?  Why is it non-inertial?  I understand that we would gain and lose energy as we spin around a complete revolution assuming that the galactic cluster just happens to be moving in the same direction of our spin.</p>		</li>

			<p>To have an inertial reference frame according to general relativity you must be free-falling. When you are standing on the earth this is no longer the case as the ground is pushing up on you. Your understanding seems correct in that the distant galactic cluster would theoretically see us gaining and losing Energy as we accelerate around in a circle. The speed of rotation is completely dwarfed by the speed at which the galactic cluster is moving away from us though, so the changes would be fairly insignificant.</p>		</li>

			<p>E=mc^2 assumes no momentum. If momentum (p) isn't zero, the equation is (Pythagorean Theorem!)

			<p>Yeah basically. We're talking about very tiny amounts added though. That 60mph is a tiny tiny amount of energy compared to all of the atoms in that ball. Think of splitting atoms, and the preposterous amount of energy inside of such a small space. The total energy in that baseball, if you could release all of it at once, could probably flatten a small town.</p>		</li>

			<p>The lowest permissible mass for a Baseball is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_\(ball\)" target="_blank">141.75 g</a>.  <br>E = mc^2 gives <a href="http://www.calctool.org/CALC/phys/relativity/emc" target="_blank">1.274x10^16 J</a>.  <br>Since a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent" target="_blank">ton of TNT</a> is equivalent to 4.184 gigajoules, then the total energy contained in a Baseball would be roughly equivalent to 3 Megatons of TNT.  <br>  <br>To put this into perspective:  <br><br>&gt;The Little Boy atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 exploded with an energy of about 15 kilotons of TNT (63 TJ), and the Fat Man atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 exploded with an energy of about 20 kilotons of TNT (84 TJ).  <br><br>Our little Baseball contains almost 100 times the energy released by those two bombs.

			<p>Mass-energy equivalence means exactly what it says. Mass is energy and energy is mass. They are exactly the same thing. Gravity is the distortion of spacetime caused by this energy. Where you might be getting confused is there are several different quantities that are commonly called mass which aren't the same thing. The kind of mass most people are familiar with is rest mass. That always stays the same. The mass that increases based on velocity is the relativistic mass which is directly proportional to its energy. They are two names for the same thing in slightly different units.</p>		</li>

			<p>Why do you say the word &quot;but&quot;? It's as if you consider there to be a contradiction. If a black hole formed in the early moments of the universe, and we were inside of it (i.e. inside of its Schwartzchild radius), we would have no idea. Life inside of a black hole is identical to life outside of a black hole, the only distinction is the two &quot;societies&quot; cannot communicate with one another, as one considers the other to be smushed.</p>		</li>

			<p>They are all connected, yes.  A body at Planck temperature would emit photons with a Planck length wavelength, which is also to say, photons having Planck energy.  Planck length is also the distance that a photon travels in Planck time, so a wavelength of Planck length corresponds to a frequency of 1/Planck time.  Also a black hole with a radius of one Planck length would have a mass of one Planck mass. :)</p>		</li>

			<p>It could be that it's an actual physical impossibility, not just a temporary one due to missing information, in the same way that it's impossible to transmit information out of a black hole without extra dimensions.  As far as we can tell, it's not just about current understanding, but prediction is impossible with any level of understanding.</p>		</li>
