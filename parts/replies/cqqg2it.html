			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that we can feel vibrations well above and below the audible range, so if your body is making a sound that's outside of your audible range, you may still think you hear it because you feel it happen i.e. gut rumbling from hunger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think we can feel ultrasonic sounds as vibrations... That would be a ~20000 Hz vibration. It might be painful if the amplitude was large enough but I doubt it would feel like a vibration in the same way that extreme bass frequencies do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So my pets can hear me digesting? And they hear it constantly? I am so sorry. It explains why it's so hard to sneak up on them. Even being really quiet while they're presumably asleep and relaxed, their ears follow me. Maybe senses like this and others explains part of how they know when I don't feel so good. Like there our sounds or smells that our body makes only when we're sick, you know?</p></div>		</li>
