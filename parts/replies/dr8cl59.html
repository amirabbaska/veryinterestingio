			<div class="markdown"><p>I forgot to add that some foods increase in caloric value upon cooking them because the nutrients become more bioavailable. A great example of this are potatoes or carrots, where heating the starchy plants causes breakdown and rupture of most of the cells holding starch molecules, which allows the starches to be directly metabolized. So the Atwater caloric value increases, but the actual caloric value (of potential energy for letâ€™s say combustion) has not changed, which again shows you that this is an example of accessibility to nutrients and not overall energy changes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why humans cook food. Gotta feed the gigantic brain nutrients and calories (its huge compared to the rest of our body). Also why I find the raw food movement a tad questionable. Unless it's for weight loss. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only recently learned about how much calories our brain actually requires. With such a large brain to body mass ratio, it seems obvious that we need to consume more calories than our bodies would normally be able to absorb raw. Large animals with large brains and correspondingly large digestive systems, like elephants, can eat all day to fuel their brains. But we needed to compensate for our comparatively small digestive systems, so we began cooking food before consumption. This also means we wouldn't need as much food to satisfy our caloric requirements, meaning less hunting and gathering and more time to make tools, invent religion and language, and raise children.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Glucose is virtually the sole fuel for the human brain, except during prolonged starvation. The brain lacks fuel stores and hence requires a continuous supply of glucose. It consumes about <strong>120 g daily</strong>, which corresponds to an energy input of about <strong>420 kcal (1760 kJ)</strong>, accounting for some <strong>60% of the utilization of glucose by the whole body in the resting state</strong>. Much of the energy, estimates suggest from 60% to 70%, is used to power transport mechanisms that maintain the Na+-K+ membrane potential required for the transmission of the nerve impulses. The brain must also synthesize neurotransmitters and their receptors to propagate nerve impulses. Overall, glucose metabolism remains unchanged during mental activity, although local increases are detected when a subject performs certain tasks.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, especially in families where rawism is imposed on children who are still developing and then have much lower access to a variety of nutrients. There is also the question of food safety especially with meat.</p></div>		</li>

I've seen this theory on Reddit many times but have never heard any supporting evidence aside from exactly one researcher's <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1095643303000205" target="_blank">theories</a>, and inconclusive studies from students in his lab. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could only find one study that argues that fire and brain evolution are not directly related:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the appealing hypothesis of thermal processing of food as a pre-requisite to brain expansion during evolution is not supported by archeological, physiological, and metabolic evidence. Most likely, the control of fire and cooking are rather a consequence of the emergence of a sophisticated cognition among hominins.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/11/why-cooking-counts/" target="_blank">here's one</a>. they measured the weight of mice from eating cooked and uncooked potatoes. </p>
<p>Also, just off the of the top of my head, cooked carrots have more vitamin A than raw carrots. That can be checked in the USDA database</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Username checks out hard. This was a super well done
exlanation. I had never actually considered how much caloric value might technically be unavailable to us as omnivores with no breakdown of insoluble fiber, but it makes sense when you say it out loud. Also props on the Maillard process. Learning about that in cooking, just went through an explanation on Brown butter that discussed it.</p></div>		</li>
