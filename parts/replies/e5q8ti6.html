			<div class="markdown"><p>I study animal diseases and immunology, so this may not pertain exactly the same to humans. Low body fat does not make animals more susceptible. Basically when animals have an infection (viral, bacterial, protozoal, fungal) their body's innate immune system, consisting of neutrophils/heterophils, macrophages, and cytokines, goes into action to destroy the invading pathogen. Your body will also run a slight fever by burning more &quot;energy&quot;, as the change in temp will cause the pathogen to generally replicate slower. If, after approximately 4 days, the pathogen has continued to outrun your innate immune system, the body will call upon the much more energy intensive adaptive immune system.</p>
<p>I believe what the OP is actually trying to figure out is more like &quot;Do people with lower body fat have a harder time fighting off a pathogen?&quot; to which the answer is no, they don't necessarily have a harder time, they just don't have as much fuel in reserves to fight it for a long time given how much energy is required for the fever and adaptive immune system. Get several infections in a row or even one that persists, and someone with low body fat will quickly burn through their energy stores.</p>
<p>This also has a lot to do with why you get lethargic and low energy when sick. Most people logically believe that the infection is the cause of this, when in actuality the majority of the crummy, lethargic, tires feeling is your body's natural response. It tries to slow you down to conserve energy, and that energy usually used for daily activities is diverted to the immune system as the response increases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Outsode of not spreading diseases, I feel like this is another good reason why people shouldn't be expected to work when they are sick. Or penalized for being sick. You should be conserving your energy and getting better quicker. It's what your body should be doing anyways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extremely low body fat can be a pathological situation. Possibly indicating a stress or starvation response. Cortisol (aka colloquially as the stress hormone) can have a negative effect on the immune system. Also potential nutrient deficiencies caused by the process of becoming low body fat could play a role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about non obese people who are just extremely large.   Very tall, but muscular people (like The Mountain) with lean body mass, but a ton of it.   Are they more or less prone to sickness?  Or no difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fat cells actually start to become sort of sickly with obesity, and a source of inflammation comes from lack of vascularization in some of the fatty areas. People that are just big shouldn't have that problem, and muscle mass to fat mass ratio being the same, it should not increase your sensitivity in this context. Other health issues that tall people may have that influence this - I'm not aware of any.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This claim isn't so far off, as obesity has been shown to cause increases in inflammation throughout the body. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the claim is far off, as its a claim in the complete opposite direction off the truth.</p></div>		</li>
