<p>For example if you are trying to dissolve something that has a strong exothermic reaction with water (acids and bases being good examples of this) you can inadvertently heat up the water too fast causing it to boil and splatter all over the place. Which of course if you are splattering acid solution all over the place it could injure you if you aren't careful. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about endothermic though? I'm kind of interested now. You'd have to make some kind of reaction that made the freezing point of water greater while adding a compound which as far as I know isn't possible. I'm not sure you can add anything to water on its own to make it freeze. If you do know, and it is tasteless and non-toxic I'm sure you could get plenty of investors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also possible, for example mixing Bariumhydroxid-Octahydrate and Ammoniumnitrate into water, it can cause water droplets to freeze outside the container. The reaction is possible and volunteer because the increase in entropy is so great that it happenens despite of the reaction being endothermic.</p></div>		</li>
