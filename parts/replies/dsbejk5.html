			<div class="markdown"><p>My question about that method is: what if some phenomena changed (accelerated/decelerated) expansion for a discrete amount of time. Working off an assumed constant rate of expansion wouldn’t account for that and, therefore, be wrong. Right? How can we be sure that hasn’t happened? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually think that has happened. We think that there was a period of rapid expansion, inflation, in the early universe that occurred for only a discrete amount of time, and after which the universe settled for expanding more slowly, and has recently started accelerating. There are a few problems with this that are to do with thermodynamics, but a few reason why we think this inflationary period occurred are due to the universe appearing the same in all directions, and space being flat. That being said, who knows really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't actually work off a constant rate of expansion. We know that right now the rate of expansion is actually increasing and this is the second period of accelerated expansion the universe has gone through. There was also a brief period at the beginning of the universe know as inflation where there was a rapid increase in the rate of expansion. This is a theory for how the CMB was formed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the methods for measuring age are getting better quickly, we have no concrete methods for it. There's always variables that you can't account for because we weren't around. With problems like this, we solve based on the data we have.</p>
<p>The age of the Earth is a good example. When my parents were in school, the Earth was only millions of years old. When I was in school it was billions. I'm only 18 years younger than my mom.</p>
<p>People like to think science is concrete, but it's not. We're not advanced enough to have all the answers so what I'm getting at is, yes that number is off. But it's not necessarily wrong...</p>
<p>What we are given is the most accurate ESTIMATE, which is also the answer based on the data available. As we get more data, the answer will change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When was this? The billions of years old has been known since the '50s right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a great question! In fact, it’s something scientists are still trying to work out. The rate of expansion was theorized to be either constant, or slowing. The scientific community was a little surprised when observation showed expansion was <strong>accelerating</strong>.  There are many theories around now for why, but none have been proven. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that is an open question, but we've measured the rate of expansion and, for the moment at least, the rate of the universe's expansion is increasing.  So everything is getting further apart, faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still looking for an explanation of accelerating expansion that takes into account time and relativity. The farther away an object is, the faster away it's moving, but our data is also from farther back in time.</p>
<p>It makes intuitive sense that the closer in time our observational data is to the big bang the faster those objects would be moving, but when it comes to physics at the extremes, I know intuition can be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My issue is that the way this is worded doesn’t mean acceleration is increasing, just velocity from the initial point. I don’t know enough about this though. Is acceleration actually increasing, or is it just velocity of the farthest bits increasing (accelerating). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine it as if <em>empty space was creating more empty space</em>, if there are no forces to counter it. For example,  gravity is sufficiently strong to block the expansion at that point of space. That's why people, animals, Earth, planets etc. won't expand - gravity is holding those things together. But in the vast intergalactic space, there's nothing to prevent the expansion - gravity is not strong enough there. And the space expands. And since empty space creates more empty space, which will, in turn, create even more empty space <em>(and so on)</em>, the expansion is accelerating.</p>
<p><em>At least that's how I finally understood it, after years and years of watching documentaries about the universe.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not virtual particles relieving the vacuum causing the universe to expand like a ballon as it fills with something other than space.</p>
<p>Virtual particles are used as the basis of hawkings radiation but surely if they can appear on an event horizon then they will be appearing all over the Universe and could then cluster into dark and ordinary matter.</p></div>		</li>
