			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, it's scary to think how easy it would be to end up in a DUI that way.  One minute you're cooking a grilled cheese doing several shots of vodka, the next moment you wake up in jail with a bad hangover and they tell you hit someone's car.  I wonder if that's how a lot of DUIs play out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but you are still you. You just couldn't remember it. There is a medication they distribute for some procedures with a similar effect. The truth is there are a lot of things you can't remember or can't remember correctly (even if you think you can). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When sober, is it possible that some people have better hippocampus activity than others? I've always wondered about people forgetting stuff from a night of drinking, when I can't see the difference to a sober night. Is my memory actually defective?</p></div>		</li>
