			<div class="markdown"><p>Screeners get sent for writers guild, sag/aftra, all the other unions that do awards. Smaller unions or smaller distributing studios may not have the resources to fully track who the screener belongs to and bring action? Or surely some go missing during distribution season along the way to their intended viewers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The watermark doesn't need to be detectable information added to the frame. It can be the complete absence of a frame. Imagine how many cuts there are in a movie. Now imagine that each reviewer got a copy that had a handful of cuts at a slightly different frame. Or were missing 10 specific frames out of the 200,000.</p>
<p>If you have multiple copies and compare them carefully maybe you could detect the differences. But maybe all of your copies have some watermarks that are the same and you miss those and they can still identifying all of the origins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My good friend works for a company that does distribution for one of the largest movie makers.  He would often have DVDs and we’d watch them but he would never loan them out due to what I said (he told me all of what I posted).  He said it’d cost him his job.   Usually a few days or a week after he had his, I’d also find it later on newsgroups (back in the day) or a torrent site.  Not his copies of course as he never loaned them out and never lost his job.</p>
<p>I’m supposed to see him later today, I’ll get the nitty gritty from him if I do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks man. I don't mean to sound snobbish at all either but I was thinking of those that just work while at college or part time in a cinema and aren't in it for the career. I wonder what the consequences exactly are? Is it call the police the instant it gets leaked?</p>
<p>Edit: I mean you described the consequences already really I guess. Sorry haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no knowledge of how the companies actually practice this watermarking, but it wouldn't be hard to obfuscate it beyond anything recognizable as a watermark or ID stamp. </p>
<p>Imagine they had a watermark image trackable to whoever this copy was given to. </p>
<p>Putting it on a single frame would make it hard to find especially if the software searching for it didn't know what it looked like or how big it is or anything (doesn't have to be a company logo or text or anything, just something traceable).</p>
<p>But take that a step further and say there are 1000 pixels in the ID stamp image. Let's break apart those 1000 pixels and place them on separate frames spaced at irregular intervals apart throughout the movie - good luck finding it to get rid of it, but it's easy to reassemble if you know where to look to see who leaked it. </p>
<p>Or maybe very slightly alter a small group pixels on each frame of the movie, which pixels we're altered on which frames could be reassembeled to find out who leaked it but since it's a very small alteration it would be hard programmatically to figure out what the changes were unless 2 copies leaked and we're compared very closely. </p>
<p>Just a couple of over-simplified ideas, no idea what they really do... But let's face it, I just wanted to use the word obfuscate!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those interested in this, google stegnography - that's the name given to the techniques used for this sort of data hiding. </p>
<p>It can get quite advanced - even a filmed copy (an analogue conversion) could be traced using sophisticated stegnographic techniques (such as using particularly hard to identify hue/saturation changes/signatures for some parts of the movie).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're thinking too mundane here about it.</p>
<p>There's nothing to say that the effects they use to watermark it would be even remotely detectable to humans or even software as they don't have anything to compare it with.</p>
<p>From obvious stuff like filtering so every client has iron mans blaster in a slightly different shade. How do you know it's not supposed to be green? That's even on the very superficial level.</p>
<p>The options are truly limitless when it comes to this as they will put the watermark in but, they don't need to detect it manually so they can make the watermark as complex or as simple as they want.</p>
<p>The watermark could be a non-human detectable sound every 34.9341242 seconds throughout the movie. It could be having a specific amount of dead pixels every 93rd frame. It could be 10% dead pixels over a 10 frame burst at 30 frame intervals for 10 intervals then swap them. The money will be there to protect the IP so developping this software isn't really that far fetched.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinavia" target="_blank">Cinivia</a> is a somewhat famous example where a huge number of dvd's and films contain an audio and visual watermark denoting them as genuine. If you attempted to stream a pirated film to a ps4 for example it wouldn't play because cinivia would detect it as non-geniune. This was using mass produced technology. It took years to actually defeat it.</p>
<p>If you control all the output to certain cinemas or special showings, there's very little to stop you making them all absolutely 100% trackable while they remain extremely difficult to detect without the &quot;key&quot; as you have nothing to compare them to and don't know what you're looking for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Around Oscar &quot;season&quot; you can find all sorts of screen copies on torrent sites.  Is this specifically because it's Oscar season?  I'm thinking maybe more copies are given out or they are tracked differently?</p></div>		</li>
