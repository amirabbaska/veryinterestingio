<p>To understand how we perceive, you need to be an 4D creature (or being bumbed up to 4D by an 4D creature so that you can observe 3D, like his example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Little late, but, stars bend space the way we bend paper.  We can see light bend around them.  Now extrapolate that to the entire universe.  All this matter COULD bend space into a huge sphere, yet you are going straight from your perspective and going in a sphere in 4D.  Kind of like a globe to a 2D creature.  It thinks it is going straight, but we can see it is actually slightly curved.   Now that's us, thinking we are seeing straight into space but really it's slightly curved.  </p></div>		</li>
