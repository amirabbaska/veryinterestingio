			<div class="markdown"><p>What does defragging <em>do</em>?</p>
<p>I've heard people say it's good for your computer/makes it run faster etc. and I do it every now and then, but I still don't know what it actually does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a shelf with all of your favorite DVDs. Everytime you buy a new DVD, you add it to the end of your collection. One day, you decide to sell some of your older DVDs, so you remove them from your collection, but now there's empty spots where your previous DVDs were.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, you buy a new TV Series which comes in 8 DVDs (1 DVD = 1 season). You hate those empty spots in your DVD collection, so you will fill them before adding more DVDs to the end of the shelf.</p>
<p>The problem is if you want to watch that series in the future, you're going to have Season 1 and 2 near the beginning of your shelf, 3 in the middle, and the rest near the end. Searching for the seasons of the same show is going to take a long time because they're all over the place.</p>
<p>By defragmenting, you put all the seasons of the same show next to another, so you can quickly find all of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what are the DVDs?</p>
<p>I mean, they're not the files and stuff I have stored on my computer because I'd notice all my pictures and stuff being reorganised, right?</p>
<p>EDIT: Ok, thanks I get it now, please stop posting more explanations, it's blowing up my inbox lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Defragging rearranges files on the physical disk. You should only do it on actual spinning hard disks, not SSDs.</p>
<p>/u/Axacu has a decent explanation, but it's worth mentioning that a single file can be split all over the place, an even your free space can be cut to pieces.</p>
<p>This is a problem with a spinning disk -- if you look <a href="http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/adding-a-hard-disk-1-1.jpg" target="_blank">inside a hard drive</a>, that arm reaching across it is like the arm on a record player. If your files are in order, the arm can stay in pretty much the same place as the disk spins, just like with a record player -- it'll move slowly and smoothly as data just streams off the disk. But if your file is split all over the place, the disk needs to move back and forth a lot, which is <em>sloooow.</em></p>
<p>By the way, if you've noticed your computer make a clicking or chugging sound when it's &quot;thinking&quot; -- very different than the fan noise, by the way -- that's probably what's happening. Tends to happen a lot during boot -- OSes are getting smarter at organizing their boot process to match the disk layout, but it's still a problem.</p>
<p>Defragging has a <em>marginal</em> benefit for SSDs, because it can also store files <em>slightly</em> more efficiently. But SSDs also wear out the more you write to them, and defragging basically needs to rewrite most of the data on your disk -- so defragging is likely to make your SSD <em>slower,</em> or maybe even make it die prematurely. And SSDs have no moving parts -- it doesn't matter where your data is on disk, it takes exactly the same amount of time.</p>
<p>This is the biggest reason hard drives are so slow and SSDs are so fast.</p>
<p>TL;DR: <em>Don't</em> defrag your SSDs.</p></div>		</li>
