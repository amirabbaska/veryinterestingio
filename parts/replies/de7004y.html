<p>Another big thing is editing. You can use careful editing to make it look like the animal is seeing something that is not actually there. For example; the scene of the harvest mouse in Planet earth two, when it is being hunted by a bar owl. The mouse was almost certainly shot in a set and the owl in the wild. The two bits of footage were edited together to make it seem like the owl was hunting the mouse. When in reality they were probably shot days if not weeks apart.</p>

<p>That's so annoying if done badly, which it mostly is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea there were such things as solitary bees, I just assumed they all lived in colonies/hives much like honey bees. This is amazing. </p>
<p>Even the wasp video where the wasp tastes the blood of the cockroach before dragging it away blows me away. Do you get to travel around the world for this? How come I haven't heard of that documentary company before?</p></div>		</li>
