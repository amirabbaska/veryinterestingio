			<div class="markdown"><p>4k on a 1080p screen will definitely not look better than 1080p on a 1080p screen. Having the info means nothing if the TV literally throws it away. Additionally, if sharp lines that wouldn't be in a 1080p stream are sent in the 4k video stream, the 1080p interpretation that I'm sure you're thinking would average out the 4 4k pixels into 1 1080p pixel would make it a blur instead of however it was designed to look on 1080p, which probably wasn't a blur.</p></div>		</li>
