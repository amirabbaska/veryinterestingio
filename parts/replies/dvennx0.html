<p>I've heard people say that bears that are killed after blueberry season taste like blueberry. So obviously, some of the phytonutrients in an animals diet will still be present in their tissue when we eat them. Additionally, maybe some of these phytonutrients are precursors to useful nutrients found in animal meat.</p>
<p>I don't think we're anywhere near close to understanding what all these various plant molecules' benefits are, so I don't know that you could just toss a list of vitamins in the slurry on a reductionist level. </p></div>		</li>
