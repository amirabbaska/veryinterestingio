			<div class="markdown"><p>I was gonna go with a lemonade stand analogy. You steal $20 from some nerd at school, but you don't want your mom finding out because you would get in trouble. So you open up a lemonade stand and <em>pretend</em> to sell 20 more cups of lemonade than you actually did, so you can report your stolen money as legally earned money. </p>
<p>However you also realize that if your mom pays enough attention to how much lemons, water, and cups you used that she will be able to deduce that you didn't actually sell as much lemonade as you claimed. In order to cover your tracks you have to drink 20 cups yourself, or just pour them out, so that the materials you used matches the amount you sold. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand you correctly, if you have the same costs for resources and production, you’re only getting your profit margin from your stolen money. So basically, the thing your making up and lying about is the amount of business you actually get? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that is correct. You would also have to pay taxes on your now reported income, so you'd lose even more money. That's why it's best to launder money though a business with high profit margins (typically things in the service industry, like nail salons). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes, in this example, but that's assuming you could just sell $20 more of lemonade. You either didn't really try most of your profit was from lemonade you just poured out, or you really did try and sold as much as you could but then you tacked another $20 on the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, safe to say that laundering money is never 100% efficient, and you will lose some amount in the end, but it’s probably equal to or less than taxes and you can use the money now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, you definitely lose a portion of your money to supplies, the guy you're paying to launder your money and keep quiet about it, and taxes, but it's <em>much</em> better than going to jail. Al Capone never laundered his money and that's how he ended up getting caught.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To take it a little further (throwaway for obvious reasons): </p>
<p>I own a legitimate business. I manufacture and distribute legal products.  </p>
<p>I also sell weed. </p>
<p>Selling weed is illegal. But I want to pay taxes on the income, and legitimize it. </p>
<p>So I make up a bunch of fake invoices, and &quot;buy&quot; some of my legitimate products from myself with the &quot;dirty&quot; money. Now, as far as the govt is concerned, that money was legally obtained through my legitimate business. I paid my taxes on it. It is now &quot;clean&quot;. It has been laundered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can just pay taxes on your weed sales, y'know. There's a line item on taxes to declare income from illegal sources (such as gambling, theft, prostitution, drug sales, extortion, etc.). Supposedly your taxes can't be used to start a criminal investigation, but they may well audit you to make sure you are fully paying taxes. One thing to be aware of though is that you can't take any business deductions on drug businesses specifically. That is, you can't offset the taxes owed from selling drugs by the cost of doing business in the first place. If I was growing marijuana, I couldn't deduct the costs of fertilizer, electricity, grow lights, hydroponic systems, etc., although you can do so with other illegitimate sources of income.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like you're selling cocaine for $5 a line, and you know mom is going to start asking questions if she sees you with all this money cause she knows you don't have a job. So you start your own business, something that deals  in paper money, say a lemonade stand. You're selling lemonade for $5 a glass, and you only really have to make it look like you're selling lemonade, so you make up one pitcher, go out and sell a few glasses, then write up your accounts like you sold a bunch of lemonade, and go party and sell cocaine all day. When mom asks where you've been and why you've got so much cash, you tell her you've been out selling lemonade. You end up having to pay some of your sweet cocaine money on taxes for all that lemonade you said you sold, but at least you can buy a big wheel and pimp it out with tassels on the handle bars and shit without worrying about the IRS throwing you in jail for tax evasion like Al Capone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never sell a product. Sell intangibles. Have a music concert -rent a stage -sell tickets for $50 each- give a bunch to radio stations, schools ,non profits , who cares? 1500 people show up pay the band 10k ,5k to the stage, security(off duty cops) sell a few hot dogs cokes. It looks legit 1500 people look like 2500 so lets do the math.2500x$50=$125,000- $15000 =$110,000 cleaned add $25.00 each for food on the books= another $50,000 net. So  I just ,&quot;cleaned&quot; $160,000. Invite a few- Politicians- Shriners-Rotary members - maybe the local Sherriff to a VIP tent. Next thing you know everybody loves you and you are on the inside. Put a few people in the right place and POOF! You are invisible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or, you only show mom the fake books, and report the cocaine sales income to the IRS as what it is.</p>
<p>Mom can't demand your IRS return, and neither can the police, the best either of them can do is tell the IRS they don't think you are paying taxes, and the IRS investigates and decides you did pay, because well...you did.</p>
<p>Then again, all it takes is one congressional aid to slip language into a bill and you could lose that protection in a summer session recess. It has happened before.</p></div>		</li>
