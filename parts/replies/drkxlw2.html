			<div class="markdown"><p>League of Legends reduces the impact of wild RNG as well by increasing your crit % when you consecutively don't crit, and reduces it immediately after. The likelihood of getting 3 in a row or zero in a long fight are reduced, which results in a lower variance bell curve for number of critical hits per x attacks. I'm a big fan of this because nobody likes losing because the enemy got wildly favorable RNG.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, &quot;gambler's fallacy dice&quot; are a popular tweak to an rng.  In a boardgame, you can implement them with a deck of cards - once a possibility comes up, it won't come up again until the deck is recycled.</p>
<p>The infuriating nature of the dice in Settlers of Catan led to the introduction of an expansion pack &quot;traders and barbarians&quot;, which includes (among other things) a deck of numbers to replace the dice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Over the course of a game, let's say you attack 1,000 times. You absolutely will crit at roughly 20% of the time with a 20% chance to happen.</p>
<p>The problem arises when your sample size of a fight is, say, 6. Your expected number of crits is 1.2 (so 1). However there is a rather high (about 26%) chance that there will be zero crits, which will frustrate the user. While the likelihood for crit 3 times isn't particularly likely (about 8%) it will happen about one out of 12 instances. Someone winds up unhappy.</p>
<p>The impact here is it makes the instance of zero crits and the instance of 3 crits less likely which is usually a good thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to balance games I have made I also use the concept of a 'grab bag' to select numbers from. As a player, if you have 10% chance to crit and you hit 10/15/20/30 times and don't crit it feels unfair. As a developer it is hard to balance fights when a player might crit 4 times in a row. I made a function which would (pseudo) randomly select a number, say between 1 and 4. If '2' came up then it was removed from the pool of numbers. Next time a selection would be made from 1, 3 and 4. If '4' came up then it would select from 1 and 3. After it used them all up it would reset. Even this could be a bit intuitive feeling, when the numbers were reset as you could get two critical hits back to back. I have found that a person's perception of what random should feel like and what random is actually like are two very different things. I imagine the algorithms in games could be quite sophisticated to get the right 'feel'.</p></div>		</li>
