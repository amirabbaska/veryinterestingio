			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, crystallization of starch is a major player in the staling of starchy foods. I will make one slight correction in that it is not going back to its crystalline state, it is actually going to a new crystalline state in a process called retrogradation. This has an interesting implication in bread staling for instance, where this process actually results in a decrease in caloric content of the bread. In both the uncooked wheat flour and in the bread the starch is in a state that is relatively well digested by human enzymes. Retrograded starch on the other hand is not easily digested by these enzymes and mainly passes through to the colon where it is fermented by gut bacteria (potentially producing some health promoting compounds). The rate and extent of this retrogradation depends on the length of the starch chains and so it is common practice to add enzymes to these starches to clip back those chains. This is a major factor in why your commercial breads will last a lot longer before going stale than home made.</p></div>		</li>
