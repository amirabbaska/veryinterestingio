			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't many local farmers also have agreements or deals as part of business where they may routinely &quot;swap&quot; bulls or similar to mix things up a bit, as well as buy frozen seamen, etc. I thought I remembered someone discussing that at a dairy farm in Vermont, where they had two bulls, would routinely either charge neighbors to breed with their bulls or just have a swap agreement, or they'd actually trade products (i.e. the dairy farm would give cheeses to the beef farm, etc). They were of course smaller and non-factory farms, but still!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Living in a rural area with lots of irrelevantly small farms I can confirm that this is in fact the case, but only for dairy farms, not meat farms (I’m not sure if these are the correct terms but what I mean is selling milk vs lambs/calves) because as mentioned before the latter don’t keep any of the offspring so inbreeding is not an issue</p></div>		</li>
