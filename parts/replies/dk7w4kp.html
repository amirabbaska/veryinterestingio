<p>You're referring to parasitic birds - a fun read there.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, chickens - obviously domesticated - will steal other hens eggs sometimes when broody.  I had one once tuck another hens eggs in her wings, fly down, then back up into her nest box.
They want to raise everyone's baby when they're in mode: broody..</p></div>		</li>
