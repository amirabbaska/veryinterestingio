			<div class="markdown"><p>What completely fucking does my head in, is that the USAF is the only service who realised you could just <strong>put it on the other side</strong> and it continues to &quot;fly into battle&quot;. No other service even started to consider it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because that is the shoulder the unit patch originally went on. So when the US Army added the start and stripes to their uniforms, they put it on the right shoulder so they wouldn't have to change a bunch of things on the uniform. If the soldier was a combat veteran, the flag was sewn under their combat patch. Since the fielding of Army Combat Uniform and the backing of the patches and flags being Velcro material, I have no idea why this change hasn't been made. My guess would be that big Army doesn't want to change all the TM's and FM's that involve the uniform and unit identifiers. Or it does and it just takes WAY too much time, effort, and money to change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We (Army) used to not wear the flag on our uniforms until we went on combat tours.  When deployed we would wear the flag as you see it on the current uniform except it was under the patch of our mobilized unit (combat patch).  When we returned home from duty units would &quot;reverse&quot; the flag to what people would consider the correct orientation for approximately six months.  This was to show the wind of battle.  A soldiers flag flys back as he is heading into the wind of battle and the flag flies forward for six months to show Soldiers walking out of battle.  This was an effort to identify Soldiers who had recently returned from war.  Since September 11th 2001, and the idea that we live in an asymmetrical war time environment where the enemy could be anywhere at anytime, Soldiers are always considered to be walking into battle.  We will most likely wear the flag in its current configuration until there is a ceremonious end to the War on Terror.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the Marines don't even wear it on their uniforms. Also, I generally see squids just wearing the Navy Jack patch. This leaves the Army as the only guys who haven't come up with a solution.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep and on Air Force flight suits it's worn on the left shoulder (when worn) and it appears like a &quot;normal&quot; flag. Army wears theirs on the right hence why it's backwards. Tails of aircraft have it painted &quot;backwards&quot; when viewed from the right wing for the same reason. </p></div>		</li>
