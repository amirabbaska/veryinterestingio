			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don't need a whole beam of neutrons, you just need a simple laboratory source, for example to calibrate detectors. There are a few ways to get sources like this. For example you can produce a source containing some heavy nuclide which decays via spontaneous fission. If you enclose it in a thick material, the charged particles will all be stopped, but the neutrons and gamma rays emitted after the spontaneous fission will escape.</p>
<p>You can also find PuBe and AmBe sources, where you have some alpha-emitter react with some target material and cause (α,n) reactions. Then again the neutrons escape from the housing of the source, while the charged particles don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person you replied to but thought I might chime in.</p>
<p>There are a few main ways we get neutrinos to look at. </p>
<p>The first is, again, from a nuclear reactor. The next is solar neutrinos. These neutrinos radiate from the source in all directions, whereas we want a beam, which leads me to the third source we use. </p>
<p>We can produce a beam through pion decay. We produce some pions (and kaons) by smashing some kind of accelerated ion in to a target. These typically decay in to a lepton-neutrino pair. We can use magnets to deflect the charged leptons away (or some kind of shield to block them), leaving us with a beam of neutrinos.</p>
<p>If we specifically want neutrinos or antineutrinos, we set up a system of magnets which deflect positive charges but channel negative charges (or vice versa), which leaves us with only a beam of pions of the right charge to decay in to what we need. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrinos can also be produced by nuclear reactions, but that's not how you would make a neutrino for a neutrino experiment.</p>
<p>You can use a particle accelerator. In the USA you have Fermilab for example that is doing precisely that.</p>

</ul>
<p>For the short explanation: Scientists create a neutrino beam by firing protons from Fermilab’s Main Injector into a graphite target (basically a long and thick cylinder).</p>
<p>They then use magnets to &quot;direct&quot; the neutrino beam to whichever experiment needs it. There are several ongoing neutrino experiments like MINOS and NOvA among others.</p></div>		</li>
