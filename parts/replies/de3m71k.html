			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but that's kind of like the idea of a space elevator. You would have a station orbiting the earth at a speed that matches the earths rotation and attach a tether from the station to Earth. The problem is creating a nearly indestructible tether that can withstand sitting in our atmosphere as well as not snapping under its own weight. Then you need some sort of elevator capsule that has enough power to lift itself and cargo into space at a decent speed. (It would probably take a few days to climb). Then from there we could have cargo ships fly from the space station to the Moon carrying supplies. Something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggy-backing off this comment, the moon gives us an excellent opportunity to practice space elevator construction before we tried it on earth. It's possible with currently available technology (kevlar for the tether) and it would let us work out what works well and what doesn't.</p>
<p>That being said, both projects would still be astronomically expensive. So they're not on the table yet. But it's food for thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its not like we dont have the resources to do this, its more of the worlds fucked up priorities. how much is spent on weapons? how much is spent on just the r&amp;d for weapons? some of which are never even made. disney spent 4.05 billion on buying star wars from lucas. everyones priorities are so backwards and fucked up. in 2017, the world in which we see is what we have. you mean to tell me it couldnt be any other version? there are people who still believe that others are witches and then burn them alive. no, we cant build a base on the moon because we put too much effort into bullshit. how many resources you think goes into making those giant testicles that hang from the back of trucks? how many resources go into shit that just ends up buried in the ground? we do this to ourselves as a species. its quite an embarrassment if you ask me. imagine if some advanced life forms came to earth and lectured us all. saying something like, wtf have you people been doing all this time? </p>
<p>tldr - imo we should be more advanced than we currently are but we are our own worst enemies </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get your overall point, but imagine how dull and mundane life would be if no one invested in star wars movies, or any other form of art for that matter. The point I'm trying to make is that life is so fucking dull and monotonous that we have to add all these things to entertain us, get us through this bullshit. People are happier to spend there money on moves, tv, games or what ever, rather than scientific research in space exploration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yea and i totally get that but i feel like theres no balance. i was in miami recently and saw a homeless guy sleeping on a seawall at the base of these condos only about 50ft away from a multi-million dollar yacht that was docked on that wall. something about that scene just bothered me a lot. such a stark juxtaposition. im all for entertainment and distraction but im also for a balance with much less excess and waste</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine if most other advanced lifeforms are even worse in some ways than us and that's why we don't seem to find anyone? Maybe intelligent life just pulls itself down the toilet in a similar manner every single time?</p></div>		</li>
