<p>Salt doesn't make ice colder. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While mostly true, there's an exception to this statement that's relevant to OP's question.</p>
<p>The temperature of a mixture of ice and water will stabilize at the freezing/melting point until all of the ice has melted (or until all of the water has frozen). The same is true at the boiling point: liquid water (at normal atmospheric pressure) cannot be hotter than 100° C. Adding more heat will cause the water to boil faster, but it will not affect the liquid's temperature. Because of this, you can actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9gKzea3Cno" target="_blank">stick a paper cup full of water over a flame</a> and it won't burn until all of the water has boiled off.</p>
<p>The reason the temperature is constant during phase changes (transitions from ice to water, from water to steam, or vice versa) is because phase changes are not energetically &quot;free&quot;: melting and boiling both require energy input to happen (they are <em>endothermic</em> processes), and freezing and condensation give off energy (they are <em>exothermic</em> processes). So if you have a block of ice and add heat to it, the ice's temperature will rise until it's 0° C, then the temperature of the ice-water mixture will hold steady for a while as input heat is used to melt the ice, then the water's temperature will continue to rise once all of the ice is melted.</p>
<p>Now back to the original question: salt will reduce the melting point of ice but won't change the thermal energy of the system. If you have a block of ice that is much colder than 0° C, adding salt will not affect the temperature. However, if you have a block of ice near 0° C, or if you have an ice-water mixture (which will be 0° C), adding salt will melt some of the ice and reduce the system's temperature. There's no external heat source applied to the system but some of the ice still melts (remember, melting 'costs' energy), so the system uses its own thermal energy to melt the ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not as significant as the phase change, but it does make a difference. Some back of the napkin calculations indicate if you create a saturated solution the reaction of dissolving salt will reduce the temperature of the solution by about 0.4C.</p>
<p>This is more than offset by using room temperature salt though, so I guess freeze your salt too?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, it does.</p>
<p>The process of melting ice uses energy that is drawn from the surroundings. That's why a few small ice cubes can be enough to cool down a large drink.</p>
<p>If you add salt to ice and thereby &quot;force&quot; it to melt, it will cool down even further because melting takes up energy. You can get as low as -50°C/-58°F with CaCl2 and regular water ice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What do you mean by &quot;force it&quot; to melt?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt (anything that will dissolve in water, really) reduces the melting temperature of ice. By reducing that temperature to a point below the actual temperature of the ice it forces the ice to melt.</p>
<p>This process dilutes the salt water, which increases the melting temperature a little, so the process continues until you reach an equilibrium point of ice being cooled by some of it melting and diluting the salt enough that the new melting point is equal to the new temperature of the ice.</p>
<p>You can keep the process going by adding more salt, but eventually all the ice will melt (or you drop to the freezing point of completely saturated water, whichever comes first) and you won't be able to get the system any colder.</p></div>		</li>
