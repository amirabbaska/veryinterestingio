			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is true that the mutation rate for the human genome on a whole is around 10^-8 per base per generation this does not give an accurate picture of mutation accumulation as those mutations occur with very different rates in different regions of human DNA. </p>
<p>Mutations in the non coding sequences of DNA occur with higher frequency than mutation in DNA involved in gene expression. But the big difference comes from the fact that the human cell has mitochondria which has its own DNA with a much higher error rate. Mitochondrial DNA has an error rate of 3 <em>10^-5 (roughly the same as bacterial mutation rate) while the human genomic mutation rate is around 3 </em>10^-8 (don't quote me on the numbers I'm not certain about them). So mitochondrial DNA mutates much more frequently than gene expressing DNA sequences (there are some genes in mitochondrial DNA but we will ignore them) however there are a lot of mitochodria per cell and the mutant population need to reach a certain critical point to have an effect. </p>
<p>However I think the fact that bacteria are monoploid and human cells (with exceptions) are diploid would play a bigger role. A mutation in a bacterial cell will be expressed and the chance it goes unnoticed in 50 generation is minimal whereas mutations in human cells can lead to recessive alleles which will not be expressed. Moreover only mutations in the gametes (which are haploid themselves, however the forming zygote will be diploid) will carry the mutation to the offspring. </p>
<p>So I would say in 50 generations you would see far more expressed mutations in a bacterial organism compared to a human organism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the &quot;top units&quot; on that 10^-8 per base pair per generation? Mutations?</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.genome.gov/11006943/human-genome-project-completion-frequently-asked-questions/" target="_blank">humans have 3 billion base pairs</a>, so that means... </p>
<p>(3x10^9 base pairs) x (10^-8 per base pair per generation) = </p>
<p><strong>30 mutations per generation?</strong> Is that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The math checks out. But you have to remember, <strong>30 mutations</strong> doesn't equate to <strong>30 mutations with a significant effect</strong>. Most mutations do nothing at all, as they occur in a non-coding region or don't change the protein they code for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be pointed out that the mutation rate and the evolution rate are not synonymous.  </p>
<p>A high mutation rate may make rapid evolution easier, but if there is no selection pressure that aligns with those mutations, they may be weeded out with no real evolution happening.  A population with low mutation rates may evolve rapidly under a heavy pressure simply by changing the relative frequency of different established alleles. </p></div>		</li>
