			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the asteroid that took out the dinosaurs, was going too fast to be slowed down by terminal velocity? Like it didn't have the distance in the atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that terminal velocity would have neutralized it, nor is it the direct &quot;cause&quot; of meteors breaking up before impacting earth. Space rocks are brittle, and the air resistance encountered during atmospheric entry tends to break off extruding edges and pieces. For smaller meteors, they're small enough that atmospheric entry causes them to totally burn off.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event" target="_blank">K-T extinction event</a> involved a projectile far more massive than the meteors /u/Zordock is referring to. The impacting object was believed to have been 10-15km in diameter. At that size, it's not nearly as much a function of the entry speed, as the amount of how much breakdown would have been needed to reduce the rock to a less hazardous size, or eliminate it completely, is much more significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was way, way too massive and way, way to fast for the atmosphere to have any protective effect. Imagine doing a cannonball into an inch of water. That inch of water isn't stopping you. </p>
<p>However, even if the atmosphere could absorb all the energy in the asteroid somehow it wouldn't matter:</p>
<p>&quot;The collision would have released the same energy as 100 teratonnes of TNT (420 ZJ), more than a billion times the energy of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&quot; </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event</a></p>
<p>So it would have been like exploding a billion nuclear bombs in the atmosphere all at once.  That would, uh, be pretty brutal. It would, by a very rough calculation, roughly raise the atmospheres temperature to 100 C (if the atmosphere actually stayed on earth and kept all the energy).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the short version is that asteroids are moving too fast for air to get out of the way.  </p>
<p>So, the air compresses.  And, if you remember PV=nRT from high school chemistry, when the volume goes down, the temperature cranks up.  </p>
<p>And this stage, these to rocks are going so fast that the temp gets so got it begin to vaporize the rock.  At least until the rock is deteriorated enough that the shockwaves make it explode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shockingly, no. Yes, there is a bit of heating due to friction with the air, but the actual source of the heat is a touch more complicated. I'm not really able to adequately explain it (certainly far from what I know best) but you can read up on a wonderful explanation [here] (<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-a-spacecraft-heat-up-during-reentry" target="_blank">https://www.quora.com/Why-does-a-spacecraft-heat-up-during-reentry</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like it's best to explain terminal velocity to be an equilibrium point where gravitational acceleration is neutralized by air resistance. It might help to also diffuse the confusion people seem to have about what terminal velocity actually is (since many laypeople think it's &quot;the speed where a person dies upon hitting the ground&quot; or some variant thereof).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this means the object would be accelerating opposite to its velocity until it reaches terminal velocity for the bullet example?</p></div>		</li>
