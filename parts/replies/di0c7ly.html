			<div class="markdown"><p>The flow rate is proportional to g^(1/2), and thus the time taken to empty an hourglass is proportional to g^(-1/2). This is not an exponential relation. (Indeed, exponential functions are finite everywhere, so an infinite value at <em>g</em> = 0 precludes any exponential relation immediately.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I prefer to think about &quot;infitesimal gravity&quot; since zero could be a special case.</p>
<p>In very very low gravity, it could potentially take a whole day for just one grain of sand to fall. So, the hour glass would be very slow.</p>
<p>This is still an extreme case. It would not surprise me if the rate of flow in the hour glass is somewhat constant for a range around 1G.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's true. I've been thinking about it and the zero gravity case does make (rather obvious, I suppose) sense. So clearly at 1g, it takes the expected time t, and at 0g it will take infinite time. I'm not sure it'd be exponential between the points, but it would certainly take longer and longer. Part of my curiosity is on the &gt;1g side, however. I guess without knowing things like grain sizes, it's impossible to say what the... 'terminal flow rate' of the grains would be, where increasing the gravity doesn't decrease the time any more? I am failing to come up with a good thought experiment for this case, so far. Ideas?</p></div>		</li>
