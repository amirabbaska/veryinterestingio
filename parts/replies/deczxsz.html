<p>It's only on the last 200-300 years that civilization has been stretching out lifetime compared to hunter gatherers. There's in fact plenty of evidence that in its beginnings, civilization caused a marked drop in health and longevity of most of its population. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they mean that by being a part of a community, you are able to find &quot;purpose&quot; in your life, which helps calm the dear of death. If everyone was alone, there would be nothing to distract you from the terror. I don't know that I actually believe that, but I think that's the most likely interpretation. Unless the guy is a philosopher. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. I wonder though if individuals in a society were actually aware of this. I'd hypothesize that many do feel safer within society, if only because of how often I've heard &quot;life is nasty, brutish, and short&quot; echoed in the annals of history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been fascinated with Terror Management Theory (I'm certain this is what you're talking about when you say the 'terror of death,' right?). When you think about it deep down, it makes sense that every action we do somehow connects to our crucial survival our avoidance of death. I personally believe everything we ever do connects to our survival, and is shaped by our desire for survival.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The human body doesn't have any central goal from which it's actions dictate. We're machines with no purpose that happen to be built in way that allows us to survive long enough for children...and only because the people who weren't died off. When you think about it like that it's extremely unlikely that every action in our body is deliberately intended to aid our survival, and much more likely that every action in our body is just good enough that we don't fall down dead, with many traits being wholly incidental (really they all are). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, the purpose of an organism is to survive long enough to reproduce. But even after that, organisms try to survive for as long as they can. In general, the goal of every living thing is survival, so couldn't you say that's our purpose?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I think I meant everything is INDIRECTLY connected to our fear of death and willingness of survival. I don't mean as in when we decide to do something with a minute choice, we're constantly thinking of avoiding death; more like small actions we do are unconsciously linked to our primal instinct of survival. I might not be making a lot of sense, this is all stuff I just think about in my head without ever telling anyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wholeheartedly disagree.</p>
<p>Under that assumption you are basically saying civilisation would cease to be important if we somehow achieve immortality. It is saying civilisation values more &quot;death rituals&quot; than division of labour, human rights, social interaction and protection.</p>
<p>I'm curious about the &quot;meat&quot; in the theory but at first glance I don't like how it starts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Becker's theory is more that civilization has come to be what it looks like because of the complex facets of human psychology, and that psychology is very deeply shaped by 1. knowledge of our eventual death and 2. the struggle between our consciousness (which feels boundless and immortal) and our physical bodies (which are defeatable, decaying and place a harsh limit on our consciousness). From this springs the personal heroic story as a tool for the mind to postpone mortality and pursue reassurances that life is not simply death, as well as other personal and social initiatives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we know that it would be impossible to simply change that one variable and no others in reality, in that if our bodies didn't die, a lot of other things would be different than just civilization. It seems that evolution would have happened much differently as well. And there are people who argue that even the notion is impossible, although we have reason to believe there are organisms on earth which don't age towards death but are only killed by their environment or predators.</p>
<p>I don't think we can really know the answer, but it seems to me like civilization would perhaps not have occurred if we were immortal from the start because that start would not have allowed our intelligence to evolve. Death would have to come from natural events and in large enough numbers to counter our reproductive ability and kill us off at a similar rate that aging does for us now, in order for there to be room for an ecology to continue past the rise of life on the planet. And in that scenario you could no longer say that we are immortal, as you are just replacing aging with whatever natural phenomenon takes care of our lifespans. But naturally there would be some individuals who outlive the exterminator phenomenon, so in this scenario civilization would likely look much different as we have a few members of our society who are thousands or millions of years old. That is an interesting line of thought. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a frequent scenario in science fiction and fantasy writing. The theory's power is that it flies in the face of expectations. </p>
<p>I will made an addenda, not so much as Civilization, but Culture/Community is created by reverence/care for/concern/etc. for the dead. Don't think Egypt, or Babylon, or Ancient China; think the precursor cultures that developed into these and others. Cultures from which the only things we have left is evidence of funeral rites that indicate crazy amounts of effort and material costs. </p></div>		</li>
