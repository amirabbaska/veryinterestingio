			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another potential explanation here; confirmation bias.</p>
<p>You don't remember all the times someone was in your room and you didn't wake up - because you didn't wake up.</p>
<p>You also may not necessarily remember all the times you woke up and nobody was there - because they weren't significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually wake up started and as I wake up I'm asking why they're in my room (most notably my mom does elf on the shelf [yes I'm 18 it makes her happy though] and any time she would try to hide it in my room I would bolt awake. That's what I'm meaning here</p>
<p>Also I'm not entirely sure I understand what you're saying</p></div>		</li>
