			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had acne all my life, BAD acne up until I got to 16 or 17, then moderate acne up until now at 20, but it's still regular. </p>
<p>On those really deep ones, you can put epsom salt and a hot compress on your face, refreshing the hot water every 15-20 minutes for an hour or two every night until it comes to a head. </p>
<p>I personally spot treat with something heavy in salicylic acid and avoid make up. You won't get the satisfaction of a pop, but it'll go away quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easily the most obnoxious part is having to hold the damn compress to your face for an hour or two. Can't do anything requiring two hands for that whole time. I'd love to find a strap or something I can use to hold it on so I can free up my hand during that time but I haven't found anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oo thanks. I don't get them a lot but it's like my face saves up all the little annoying pimples and just pours them into these massive nightmares. Then I get the redness that takes a good six to eight months to fade completely...  </p>
<p>I don't use makeup (face won't tolerate it or the cleansers to remove it... sigh), I only wash my face with witch hazel (my face freaks out if I use soap or any other cleanser) and water, and just pat dry... still get these things.</p>
<p>I'll try the salt trick next time I get one of those submarine pimples. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean the deep ones that are sensitive to pressure (mild pain)?
Don't know if it's only me, but my skin heals pretty good after sticking a tiny needle right into the middle of those fuckers and then pop them. Make sure to disinfect the needle before and the spot afterward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do the same, but with most zits, not just very deep ones. I have pretty thick skin, and I figure that the pressure I'd have to put on them to squeeze them would have a much higher likelihood to make the walls of the zit erupt into the surrounding skin if I didn't help them along. </p>
<p>I am careful with finding the right spot for the needle, so it mainly opens up the blocked channel and doesn't randomly bore into the skin. On the whole, my zits heal a lot quicker than they did back when I was squeezing them unaided or when I waited for them to heal on their own (and that especially never worked well for me).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is you don't pop them you need to get treatments that act on the inflammation which causes this deep nodular or cystic acne. If you're a female you'll take anti-androgen agents and retinoids or isotretoin if you're at the point where your acne is scarring you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thankfully they don't happen a whole lot but when they do... eek. I'm on depo for endometrial problems so I'm not sure how further fiddling with hormones would work. </p>
<p>It seems to come in little waves. Months of nothing... then it's like a party. It's almost always after I get my injection. </p>
<p>I'll try the salt pack. I can do ace bandages and look like I was the loser in a bar fight. ;D</p></div>		</li>

I heard popping = injury, therefore just leave it alone (referring especially to whiteheads/inflamed+closed). But they seem to last forever when left alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: this is 100% anecdotal</p>
<p>I have popped all of my zits always. I enjoy it to a degree. I've heard that this will scar them, I've heard it could get infected, and I'm honestly certain that I have managed to pop a zit or two into my body because I felt and heard them pop, but they didn't rupture outwards. </p>
<p>Through all of this, my complexion isn't bad, I don't have scars from zit sites, and I have never had an infected wound from a zit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I too have always popped my zits.  I examined my face everyday and popped them when they were small on the theory that is was better to get them when they were small rather than letting them grow (and possibly stretch and scar your skin).</p>
<p>I'm well past the acne stage of my life and I do not have any scars.  My face is perfectly smooth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've made a few comments on the inflammatory acne, the type that forms nodules or deep cysts. You can feel like they are there and deep. You need a different sort of treatment for this kind of acne to remove the enzyme inflammation. It can vary from antiandrogen agents for females (diane 35, spironolactone) to retinoids trying several as tolerated, to some topical antibiotics or dapsone. It's pretty common to be treated with multiple agents. </p>
<p>If you're scarring most dermatologists would jump right to isotretoin unless contraindicated (can't be pregnant, or high level athlete, several other things)</p></div>		</li>
