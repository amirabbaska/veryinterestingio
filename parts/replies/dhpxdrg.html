			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Remember, they're designed to be written and re-written. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. I remember this happening with credit cards a long time ago - back when I could also change my pin whenever I needed to. Now I have to get a whole new card for a new PIN number. Probably because they can't rewrite the credit card anymore? Which is less embarrassing than having no way to pay for gas when your cc is erased. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they're meant to be re-written so the impression isn't as &quot;deep&quot; as they would be on credit cards. </p>
<p>after erasing 3 hotel keys in 2 days i realized it was the magnet on my phone mount killing hotel room keys. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was sharing a hotel room with my freind last year.</p>
<p>We went to the bars, and I went home early because I got too drunk, so I was completely comatoesed when he got back, and he kept banging on the door to wake me up until security came to kick him out, eventually he got given a new card, put it straight back in his wallet, went up to the room and realised he wiped it again.</p>
<p>Went back for another one and did the exact same the next night haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought I read once (yeah, I know it's weak) that the magnetic strip on credit/cash cards were wiped when inserted into a cash machine, and re-written when given back to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, basically the strips on the hotel keys are less effective at holding a magnetic field.</p>
