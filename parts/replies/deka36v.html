			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for asking, probably heard that before but, like, there is not even one single song that does anything to you at all but irritate you? Like I get not being into mainstream music or people not getting anything out of classical music or whatever, and I can grasp not liking music tooo much, but not at all, not one bit? Sorry, I am just curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem, but no, there is not one song I would intentionally listen to. Some music I find more irritating than others, if I was forced to listen to music I would choose something like classical I guess. I don't enjoy classical, it is just less irritating than stuff like rap and I generally, really dislike music with singing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The music doesn't really do anything for me, the movie itself might and I do think the soundtrack is required, but that might just be because I am used to it. It is less irritating in a movie, but that might be because I don't pay much attention to it.</p>
<p>FYI I'm normally the guy that spots all the plot holes and continuity errors in movies, not on purpose, but I don't get as involved in the movie as a lot of people.</p></div>		</li>
