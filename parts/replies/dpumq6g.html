			<div class="markdown"><p>If n is &quot;public&quot; doesn't that mean that a &quot;hacker&quot; would have plenty of time to find its prime factors (using brute force)?  I get that a computer can't factor n down to p and q in a few seconds, but if the key &quot;n&quot; is around for a few days or years, it seems like a dedicated computer would have time to calculate p and q.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are algorithms that are more efficient than brute force though. The state of the art technique is to employ a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve" target="_blank">general number field sieve</a>. These can factor a 256bit RSA key in a matter of hours on a desktop PC iirc, which would be unthinkable using brute force. So these algorithms are drastically more efficient than just brute force.</p>
<p>The largest RSA keys that have been broken that way were 768bit long over a duration of months and with considerable computational resources. Going from there to 1024bit already adds something like 1000x the computational cost IIRC. So current 2048 and 4096bit keys are relatively safe, but not &quot;brute force safe&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since there aren't that many huge prime numbers, couldn't you just start with the biggest ones and work your way down and get it right more often than just having a computer brute force?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every extra bit in a number doubles the potential numbers it could be - each option X becomes X+0 and X+1, 2 options. So if it takes 1 hour to brute force check every number that is 20 bits, it takes 2 hours to check every 21 bit number, 4 hours to check 22 bits, etc. I'm not sure of how time accurate this example is, but continuing the trend would give about 120 years to check all options for a 40 bit number, and all numbers being discussed here are IIRC 100+ bits.  That's around 1.38x10^20 years, or 13.8 quadrillion years.<br />
EDIT: As Arth_Urdent said, keys in current use are actually around 1000 bits.  This is not 10x stronger, it's 2^900 times stronger. Instead of a 'mere' million times the age of the universe (using one computer to check), if you compressed all that calculation to break a 100 bit number into 1 second, it would still take longer.</p></div>		</li>
