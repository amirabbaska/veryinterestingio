			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like maybe this is some marketing noise?  </p>
<p>Specifically, is there other evidence that wool &quot;keeps you warm without overheating your body&quot;?  What exactly does this mean?  Wool acts as an insulator at one 80F, but at 100F changes its properties to become a conductor?  Also, is there evidence (other evidence, not the sheep association) that wool releases heat when taking on moisture?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>edit:  I also think that's a lot of marketing noise, particularly about wool splitting a water molecule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't read the actual article, but I'll wager that the wool doesn't split actual molecules, rather the weak bond that holds the molecules together and creates surface tension. Those are called hydrogen bonds because they occur between the hydrogen atom of one molecule and the oxygen atom of another. So, rather than splitting molecules into pieces, the wool would (assuming it does have this property, which sounds plausible to me) merely pull the individual molecules away from each other and stick to them more strongly than they stick to each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He doesn't do a very good job of explaining it, but wool is an insulator at any temperature. It doesn't overheat you when it's hot, however, because it is excellent at wicking moisture which allows your sweat to cool you despite the insulating wool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's possible.  Hydrogen bonds are interactions between the partially possible hydrogen ends and partially negative oxygen ends of the water molecule, since oxygen is &quot;greedy&quot; and the electrons in the covalent bonds spend more time around the oxygen nucleus rather than the hydrogen nuclei.  This the reason water has surface tension, the molecules are weakly attracted to each other, enough to stick together but not enough to actually be bonded.</p>
<p>It's also the ability that allows it to dissolve so many things, particularly salts.</p>
<p>Hydrogen bonds also form part of the structure of proteins, and wool is of course made out of proteins.  So it is possible for water to affect the shape and thus properties of wool, though calling it a &quot;chemical reaction&quot; is not quite accurate.  Keratin does have a lot of hydrogen bonding in its structure, which is why humidity affects hair as much as it does, and why you can change how you hair sits by making it damp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about polarity, which means that you should understand chemistry well enough to know how wrong the comment was.</p>
<p>Calling it a chemical reaction isn't right at all.  And the comment talks about the breaking of chemical bonds.  So it goes past being not quite accurate.</p>
<p>You don't have to defend them, you're better than that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Everything past that is ridiculous.  I don't know about the epicuticle's specifics, but the water resistance comes in a big way from lanolin in the wool (a lot of which is processed out, because it smells).  This sounds more like the kind of thing said by people who think that wool is a magically perfect fiber.</p>
<p>Wool is great.  It's my favorite material to work with and wear, by far.  But it's not some sci-fi superfabric.  The wool Bedouins wear is thin.  That's why it's not hot.  Wool is definitely not a magic humidity fixer, and I know because I've reenacted in plenty of it.  </p></div>		</li>
