			<div class="markdown"><p>Surface tension is in Force/Length (water is 73 mN/m). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension#Methods_of_measurement" target="_blank">There's a lot of ways you can measure it</a>, depending on what exactly you are interested in, but the aforementioned capillary action is a good way of doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind though that certain techniques for measurements of viscosity and surface tension are usually tied to certain applications. A capilliary measurement of surface tension is unfit for atomization uses. Both are very abstract material values and difficult to grasp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can do the same for you, just adjusting the definition of &quot;normal&quot;.</p>
<p>You just need to get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_bell" target="_blank">Diving Bell</a>, and go down a good ways.  Coming back up would have a similar effect.</p>
<p>In other words, the lower pressure can cause decompression sickness, as well as lung expansion if you try to hold your breath.</p></div>		</li>
