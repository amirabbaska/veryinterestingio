			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem isn't clocks, it's how we talk about time in the first place. Despite knowing about the consequences of special and general relativity for over a century now, we mostly talk about time in the Newtonian way where it is constant and universal everywhere. Our current standard for timekeeping, UTC, does make some concession for relativity, but only to keep clocks synced with the standard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about clocks; rather, it's about time itself. There is no such thing as absolute time. Time itself flows differently for people in different inertial reference frames as well as those experiencing acceleration or gravity.</p>
<p>I suppose we could design an advanced device that took gravity, acceleration, and relative speed into account and could calculate what the time would be at some standard reference location, say Earth, but that would pretty much be it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for answering. I figured the idea would still work, but since time would slow for it, would it affect the other one that isn’t part of the speed/gravity frame? Or would messages sent to it’s pair sort of “packet drop” ? Or would it get them in order, just to a relativistic viewer it would appear slow/fast depending on your frame?</p>
<p>I figure it’s mostly the last one. But I have so many questions :P </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest I always thought that the Star Trek system utilised some reference to galactic rotation to split it into units of &quot;days&quot; that increment by one and ten &quot;hours&quot; in between, so galactic day 12345 hour 6. The rotation of the galaxy with respect to something like the CMB would be pretty consistent and measurable from anywhere in the galaxy with that level of technology.</p>
<p>Probably not how it actually works in universe but it always seemed to make the most sense to me.</p></div>		</li>
