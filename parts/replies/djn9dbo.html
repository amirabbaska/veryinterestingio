			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to note temperature isn't the only issue. Yes, temperature is a big issue, but the increase in CO2 is also causing a large increase in carbonic acid in the ocean. The ocean has always been slightly basic, but it's becoming more acidic as more CO2 dissolves in the water. Coral create structures using calcium carbonate, which dissolves under acidic conditions. The more acidic the oceans are, the harder time coral (and many other she'll based sea creatures) have maintaining their shells and exoskeletons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it's really a multifaceted problem. </p>
<p>The temperature increases are occurring too quickly to allow for this kind of adaptation where the corals gradually select for more heat resistance. </p>
<p>The increasing acidity make it harder for the coral to strengthen and maintain their &quot;backbones&quot;. </p>
<p>On top of that the increasing temperature is also responsible for the water rising which adds another layer. Many of these corals depend on sunlight and as the the water keeps rising, more and more coral will be left out of the photic zone where they won't have access to the necessary light. </p>
<p>Hypothetically,  the coral would grow up to keep up with the photic zone but the water is rising too quickly AND they have less calcium carbonate to sustain such quick growth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, yeah, I think it's safe to say both plus a variety of other human caused issues are pretty dangerous to marine life. Fortunately, both of the things we are discussing have the same cause. Now if only we could do something about it</p></div>		</li>

<p>but it's possible that the coral would have enough genetic variation that something which can survive those higher temps has been generated,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not a mere possibility. There are corals that thrive in higher temperatures. The ones in Western Australia are well-known to not only withstand higher temperatures but also recover very quickly after bleaching events. Pockets of reef with similar corals are found throughout the Great Barrier Reef as well. If it is just heat stress, coral populations will quickly adapt to the new norm.</p>
<p>The bigger problem is everything else climate change brings with it. Higher sea surface temperature means more violent storms (especially tropical cyclones) that will put corals under even more stress. Corals' main predators like crown of thorns also thrive at higher temperatures. Rainfall in the tropics is projected to increase, which means even more river runoffs that will suffocate them. Coral bleaching is a spectacular event (in a bad way), but the simple sea temperature rise is only one of the many additive effects of climate change that are threatening them.</p>
<p>Throughout the history of nature, coral populations have indeed collapsed and recovered many times. The problem this time is that the climate change this time is largely man-made with some of the stress factors not being the ones they can recover from. </p></div>		</li>
