			<div class="markdown"><p>The Mini, which is a small car built in Britain but owned by Germans, sells very well in the United States.</p>
<p>Looking at the dimensions of the Peugot 308 and 508, they are about typical for a modern American car. Most cars here are around 175-180 inches, so about 4.5 meters plus or minus a few centimeters. I think French, Italian, Yugo, and Russian cars got a bad reputation here in decades past, although Fiat has successfully returned to the market in the past few years by selling small &quot;cute&quot; cars to women.</p>
<p>Edit: I just realized my car, the Nissan Leaf, was developed in partnership with Renault. They hid this entirely in the American marketing though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The beetle revamp highlighted a market for 'cute' cars.  That brought the Mini here, and now the Fiat 500.  I'm sure the others are just waiting to see if there's still room in that market.</p></div>		</li>

<p>^^^uwot</p>
<p>Yeah sure the Peugeot 308 and 508 might well be a typical size for American cars, but they're larger than average over here. The hatchback is the norm here, unlike in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point being made isn't that average car size is the same, it's that using this as an explanation for the near total absence of French  brands outside of a museum doesn't hold up on its own. Actually, all major car manufacturing nations (Japan, UK, Korea, Germany, Italy) have smaller average car sizes than the US as well.</p></div>		</li>

The designs usually include a rear wiper which most sedans don't.  The only problem is when the hydraulic shocks fail to hold up the hatches. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never understood the lack of pickup trucks in Europe. I really don't get it. There are small pickup trucks. I have a small pickup truck, and it is as nimble as most little cars. What do tradesman do in Europe? How do you transport your stuff? Does everyone have a van? What do you need to bring a long board or a pipe? Don't you have roof racks?</p>
<p>Pickup trucks are excellent work vehicles. Can somebody explain this dichotomy to me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our tradesmen predominantly use vans, because they make more efficient use of space and tend to get much better fuel economy. Transit-style vans are built specifically to fit 8'x4' sheets of construction materials, with space for pipe or long lumber on a roof rack. Some rural workers do use pickups, where 4x4 and high ground clearance are valuable.</p>
<p>You have to bear in mind that space is at a premium in much of Europe. Most of our cities were built long before the invention of the car and so have narrow, twisting streets with very little parking space. Here in the UK, a typical suburban street looks like <a href="http://blog.interflora.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Street-of-Terraced-Houses.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> or <a href="http://www.benravilious.com/photos/20060207_DSC_5596.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. If you're lucky, you'll have one parking space that is just barely big enough for a small car; if you're unlucky then you might have to park two streets away. Even newly-built houses tend to only have one parking space, because land is so expensive.</p>
<p>Car-derived vans are very popular in many countries - these are standard hatchbacks or station wagons built with a cargo bay instead of rear seats. Subcompact vans like the <a href="http://www.ford.co.uk/CommercialVehicles/Fiesta-Van" target="_blank">Fiesta Van</a> fill an important niche. In parts of southern Europe, you'll see tiny commercial vehicles like the <a href="http://www.piaggioape.co.uk/ape_range.html" target="_blank">Piaggio Ape</a> or the <a href="http://www.aixam-pro.com/ressources/pages/dtruck/dtruck_ambiance_8.jpg" target="_blank">Aixam D-Truck</a>; they look comical to us in northern Europe, but they work brilliantly for local deliveries in <a href="https://youtu.be/c_eLViH7_YI?t=3m45s" target="_blank">crowded medieval towns</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Workers use vans. If you look at the way Europe is set up, there's less &quot;rural&quot; living. Even in the countryside people live around town centers, not on large individual plots of land like the United States. For this reason, there's not always a safe place to plop your truck and leave your stuff - the risk of thieving is pretty real. Therefore, a van is a much more secure option, and domestic (and foreign in Ford) options are already abundant and affordable.</p>
<p>As a non-workmen, you'd be surprised about the amount of stuff you can get in a hatchback :)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I bet your definition of 'small' and 'little' is very different to Europe, though.  Here, [a Ford Focus or VW Golf is seen as a family car.]( <a href="http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-categories/family-hatchbacks" target="_blank">http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-categories/family-hatchbacks</a>)</p>
<p>A little car in Europe means around Fiat 500 size.  I cannot think of a 'small' pickup currently on sale in the UK for example, let alone one as small and nimble as a Fiat 500 or VW Polo.</p>
<p>Edit:  Vans are much more popular for tradesmen, as they usually give considerably more load space for the same or less overall length than a pickup, due to their lack of long bonnet (hood), etc.  <a href="https://fncdn.blob.core.windows.net/web/2/feature-galleries/fleet-management/case-studies/van-fleet-profile-pimlico-plumbers/pimlico-plumbers-photo-2_w555_h555.jpg" target="_blank">And yes, roof racks are common.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in the US, a Focus is on the small side of things. There are some smaller cars, but they're just not common. Average work commute distance is 16 miles, so 32 miles round trip or roughly an hour a day (average commute time is 25 minutes). Going more than the average is extremely common, with 10% of the population driving more than 50 miles each way. If you're in a car for that much, you don't want to be squeezed in.</p>
<p>Public transportation outside of the major cities is pretty much non existent, and also usually only covers the city itself and not the rest of the metropolitan region. For instance, the area I live, public transportation covers just a 15 mile radius of the region, and is very very spotty outside of about a 5 mile radius. Before I moved, I worked 6 miles from home, yet if I wanted to take the bus, it would have taken me an hour and 10 minutes each way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Must be why they sell so well in Chile too, our cities are cramped and have small streets because flat land is a premium. Although recently there's been a wave of retardation in Santiago from people who are getting bigger and bigger SUVs. Our roads are not prepared for that. Highways, no problem, but urban driving? Good luck on that. And getting a parking spot the size of your car. </p></div>		</li>
