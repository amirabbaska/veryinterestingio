			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydroflouric acid. Not enjoyable to work with. Weak enough acid that getting it on your skin isnt noticeable, but once it absorbs into your body and meets your bones it reacts and having your bones reacting inside of you is apparrently one of the most painful things. I was always paranoid for hours after using it as an etchant. Thats pretty much the only thing you need to worry about messing up you glassware though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The danger of hydrofluoric acid is that it can cause acid burns and the flouride is very toxic. You need the burn for the flouride poisoning. The bone thing is really only for fingers (I've had it described as a &quot;sawing&quot; pain).</p>
<p>The main and super dangerous issue with the flouride is damage to internal organs.  In particular, the hypocalcemia and direct necrotic effects of flouride cause a lot of heart problems.</p>
<p>Actually had the luck of seeing a refractory hypocalcemia event recently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this, I was under the impression that HF reacts with Calcium in your bones to form an insoluble compound that shuts your kidneys down.</p>
<p>So not only are you being dissolved from the inside out, you slowly start dying of organ failure as well. Oh, it'll also go through your standard latex glove, so anything with HF is a pain in the ass to work with. </p></div>		</li>
