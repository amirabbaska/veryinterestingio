			<p>pharmaceus. This is a great post. I too am an economist and agree with your assessment. You might do well to offer some additional resources for readers of this thread, who are interested in learning more about these subjects from sources that are not skewed by a strictly neo-classical or Keysian bias. Maybe &quot;Money Illusion&quot; by: Irving Fisher or Minsky's &quot;Can 'It' Happen Again&quot; would have been good suggestions. You might have also done well to discuss liquidity traps with citation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap</a>). <br><br>I particularly like your last statement. Pretty much all the national governments are pooping bricks, as they have no clue how to exit the insanity that they've generated. Although many commentators would call this time period unprecedented, that is not strictly true, as there are any number of historical examples where governments have done the same (Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe, and the Roman Denarius to name a few).  It is rather common for governments to debase currencies, papering over their problems. This is the easiest action in the near-term and possibly the most destructive in the long-term. The big difference now is that the debt backed nature of our currencies ensures that as central banks sow inflation, they will only reap deflation (as you astutely identified in your comment). What does make this period unprecedented imho is the scale of the problem (Global). Keep up the good work. Your post was the best on this thread. </p>		</li>

			<p>Your view of modern economics is highly skewed if you think the fed loans money to banks to speculate with.  <br><br>In fact after reading through this crap It almost completely lacks any factual pieces of information. </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not taking a side or anything, I'm just not really a fan of half-assed replies. <br><br>Saying &quot;In fact after reading through this crap It almost completely lacks any factual pieces of information.&quot; doesn't really help anything, you need to pick out what exactly you consider false. Yes, he has the burden of proof, but regardless the vast majority of his argument is logic, not claims, so he really doesn't need proof, just like saying 2+2 = 4 doesn't need proof.<br><br>Also, you don't necessarily need to, but correcting him where he's wrong would also add to your argument as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>Overnight rate on reserves only. None of that money is free for speculation. Plus for the most part it's money from OTHER BANK's surplus reserves. Not the FED. The Fed merely facilitates unless there's an emergency deficit, in which case the Fed charges a higher rate than the FFR.</p>		</li>

			<p>That is correct, however the interest for banks is something like 0.5% (please correct me) while many people's loans will be in the 5% range. 0.5% on the money you give out at 5% or even 1% is essentially free money, is it not?</p>		</li>

			<p>Yep it is different, but that is primarily due to the perceived risk difference.  There are some other factors as well, but they are relatively minor.  There are also other costs involved in issuing a loan than just having the money - does it account for the spread?  That depends on the loan size.<br><br>As for what the banks have to pay for debt, it is greater than 0.5% (on actual debentures), but at the current market it is possible.  Take Bank of America Corporation.  They are rated at BB,  this suggests that they can borrow money at about 3%.  <br><br>BoA rating: <a href="http://investor.bankofamerica.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=71595&amp;p=debtoverview" target="_blank">http://investor.bankofamerica.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=71595&amp;p=debtoverview</a> <br><br>Spreads: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating</a><br><br>You should also note that if the bank had AAA rating, they would borrow at around 0.4%.  The 'safest' North American banks are around AA which would enable borrowing at around 0.73%,<br></p>		</li>

			<p>I dont need u to explain anything since u know nothing of how banking works.  You claim banks borrow from the fed, the lender of last resort.  That's hilarious, since no bank in their right mind would borrow from the fed because it's taboo and it indicates they can't get a loan from other banks.  <br><br>And it's hilarious you actually thought i meant printing physical money.  <br>The endogenous created money is NOT forever money, since it has to be paid back.  It gets created when loaned out and destroyed when paid back.  And there  is no trickle down, anybody can get a loan as long as the bank manager oks it.  </p>		</li>

			<p>yeah.... but who cares. I really tried to strike a funny note this time. Not sure if it worked out. <br><br>It's definitely not the whole picture. One thing which I completely forgot and remembered when I sat at the pub a couple of hours ago was that expectations- personal and of the markets  - are important too. If you happen to enter the workforce and adult life during a crisis which occurs after one of the biggest booms we had and a constant long term growth for close to two decades then you are going to have a bad time anyway.<br><br>Everyone expects you to buy stuff at the old &quot;bubbly&quot; prices.<br><br>Your self-worth and social status is also locked to the past &quot;bubbly&quot; prices.<br><br>Instead ... crisis everywhere.</p>		</li>

			<p>All of what you just described was caused by deregulation of the laws that govern banking, and more specifically, how loans are created and valued.<br>The deregulation happened hours after G.W. Bush was selected by the SCOTUS to be president in an unprecedented decision.<br>These laws protected investors and consumers from banks mixing bad loans with good loans and from banks gambling with consumer loans in the market.  The laws also prevented derivatives, a market where money is created from whole cloth (bogus) and then turned into real money.  <br>All of this happened after Bush was unconstitutionally declared president, and Republicans put the bill into a rider inside a 2000 page bill and voted on it at 3am in a special session so that no one read the bill.  It only took eight years for the entire financial industry to collapse under their own greed and take the wealth of a generation with it.  That, combined with 12.2 TRILLION DOLLARS of spending debt (not including so-called &quot;entitlement programs&quot;) led to a global great depression that rivaled the previous one created in the same way in 1929, and to a smaller extent with the savings and loan scandal in the 80s.<br>Greed got us here.  Unmitigated greed.  We had laws on the books to prevent this that were put in place by Democrats in 1932, and it created the greatest time of prosperity that this nation, and the world, has ever known.  Now we have boom and bust, boom and bust, and the people of the world are paying the price.  It will continue until people wake up and vote for those who will put regulations in place on banking again, and KEEP them there.  Republicans and Bankers did this in collusion.  It's time to get rid of both of them democratically with what little power the people have left.  It's time to elect true reformers and save the economy, for everyone.</p>		</li>

			<p>Of course it is correct. One of the guys had a good point which I forgot to include - and didn't since he said it - about how the expectation of the &quot;boom generations&quot; - those who grew up during 50s and 60s and those who grew up in the 80s and 90s and 00s determine the outlook on the future and what life is about of those who grew up in the 70s and 10s which are so far both crisis decades.<br><br>However the economics of both explanations is atrocious. It's political science and sociology attempting to resolve economic issues without addressing economics at all.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're supposed to be explaining like op is 5 years old, not 5 years into an English degree. These kind of massive posts are just overkill in my opinion, but evidently I'm alone in that viewpoint because you have thousands of people upvoting your comments (but I'm accepting that so don't shoot me). <br><br>For the record I didn't read it, I've never read a comment that long on reddit unless there's a tldr that really intrigues me. As soon as I saw your links to your previous comments I just assumed you were going for celebrity status, and there would probably be adverts and popups offering to increase my manhood or reveal the secrets of wealth to me by the end of it. <br><br>Going off your reply though, you're obviously either silently thinking you have what it takes to be a writer or one who's (hopefully) fully aware of your talent and making a real attempt at it. You're very good. I'd hate to find out your talent never became anything other than a few days of interest on the front page of reddit, I'd love to find out you've already had something published or you're working on it. (Even if it is on something as boring as economics! Personal opinion again, don't shoot me)<br><br>Tldr: I don't agree with long posts on ELI5, but I do like good writing, and my post is now exactly the thing I hate. Shoot me. <br><br>Edit: reread your comment due to interest in your writing, you've summed it up in two sentences right at the beginning making my complaint completely and utterly redundant. Disregard everything I've said except for the praise on your writing skills, which I still praise highly. (I still hate those links to your previous comments you Kardashian)</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm no economist, but I want to here your take on this. Plenty of companies are hiring workers outside of the US. Like how most things are made in China or the Philippines. I've heard that this could hurt our economy, but after reading this post, is that the way to get money out of our economy or a way to lose jobs?</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pharmaceus" target="_blank">pharmaceus</a>
			<p>No. Often it effectively encouraged money creation because with foreign economies relying on US import for their goods created huge demand centers for US dollars. This is how the US could effectively create a lot of money in the banking system and increase public debt creation under Bush and sink it into cheap manufacturing in China. Not only it created the idea that suddenly everything was cheap (because China rigs their RMB artificially below market rates) but also maintained high value of dollar despite deflation because China was buying it off with their cheapened goods like crazy so the financial markets really didn't notice that there was more dollars than economic production (money supply vs output) which starts the process of saying &quot;too much money compared to everything else ----&gt; inflation&quot;.  The real culprit was not just the US - if China had proper market-based currency it would  appreciate beyond profitability for such schemes.<br><br>It does affect the economy in another way too - by outsourcing manufacturing you deprive yourself of <em>productivity</em> because services don't provide as much of it. There's just so much you can generate buying stuff cheap and selling dear to unwitting clients - houses, loans, education, insurance. That's not productivity - that's a scam.<br>The US has only 19% of its economy in industry while Canada has 25-27%. Similarly Germany and many other countries. While in short term that can be problematic because industry is less flexible than services in the long run it is essential because after re-arranging factories, laboratories workers and technologies you start producing or researching other productivity enhancing technologies.  Many people argue that the growth during the 80s and 90s despite being bumpy was aided by explosion of personal computing. It slowed down in the 00s because the explosion of social networking and other bullshit really only aids noting or services at best. Again it is all about selling or scamming stuff while earlier on there were colossal breakthroughs in how people approached technology with their clunky PCs and other computing. Cell phones did more to increase productivity than smartphones etc etc.<br><br>Other than that it's not very much different than it was since the establishing of the bretton woods system which made the US the global money printer and allowed it to sell <del>paper</del> cotton at ridiculously high prices.<br><br><br><br>Don't forget that this happened also to Japan and Korea. The whole Japanese and Korean (and Taiwanese) booms were all fueled by US dollars in exchange for cut throat cheap technology. Same thing happened in Germany only Germany settled into the EU and let off a bit and also was much more flexible as an economy culturally while Asian economies are well.. huge work camps. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>I disagree highly and I say this as a person who supported Ron Paul in the 2007 primaries.<br><br>Inflation isn't running high. It's been in the 2%'s for a while which is pretty normal and stable and safe.<br><br>Moreover, inflation benefits average people, the non-wealthy i.e. people who have debt. The middle and lower classes own houses in the US and most people's sole source of &quot;wealth&quot; is in the value of their house. (This is why baby boomers freaked out about the housing crash. I know because I have baby boomer parents. Baby boomers have suburban house/McMansion fetishes.) If inflation hits, the value of houses will increase along with other assets. Not to mention if inflation hits the monthly mortgage payments are fixed in $ while the $ themselves start to shrink. It'd be like rent controlled apartments in NYC where people today still pay $100 per month for a giant apartment from a deal 40 years ago. This would benefit low wealth people who own houses. (Student loans holders too! All you with student loans should be begging for inflation! What's a fixed $700/month payment when after a round of inflation minimum wage is $50/hr and a meal at a restaurant is $125? The idea of &quot;austerity&quot; is the worst idea for average people and young folks while benefiting debt lenders, hence why the GOP pushes it. DUH!)<br><br>Most Americans have no investments other than their houses and little savings maybe a few thousand $ if that at all. Lots of Americans live pay check to pay check. Their finances are basically pay balanced against expenses. If inflation happens, their pay would start to go up too but perhaps not as fast as expenses though. They don't have cash in savings accounts to get wiped out.<br><br>Deflation is bad. It's bad for everyone. Less than 1% of the US is farmers today. Modern Americans are employed by other Americans spending money buying non-essential things and doing services for each other. I spend money now because I know I'll get paid in the future so I don't have to hoard all the money that comes to me. Stores employ people because they know a constant stream of customers will still come through their doors a year from now. If deflation starts happening people will stop spending money except for what they're forced to spend. It's natural. If you have $100 now but in a month it'll be worth $110 in today's money what else would you do? You'd put off your purchases as much as possible to spend it later when it's worth much more. Except if we all start spending less money, then the number of jobs will start to shrink because there will be less demand for stuff. If people spend less money then stores will need fewer workers, fewer products will need to be made (fewer jobs), fewer stores will be built (fewer construction/architecture/resources jobs)... it spirals out until we're all unemployed except for the work that is unavoidable and needed to be done now: food, shelter, and clothing. <br><br>Haven't you heard people say that if you spend $1 locally in your town it will circulate through your town producing the effect of $7? We all pay each other because we're all payed. NASA is restricted to only buying American products from American companies. Every $1 NASA spends produces $10 or more in our economy because money circulates around and around. You spend $1 and it becomes $1 of income somewhere else which repeats when they spend it and so on. Modern economies are giant circle jerks. I get paid doing my job producing something which satisfies a part of some demand so I can buy stuff and that produces a demand for other things so other people get paid to do their jobs and so on and so on.<br><br>The 1800's had big problem the whole century because &quot;money&quot; was defined as pieces of gold and silver. The value of the money was in the metal in the coins themselves. The amount of gold and silver couldn't increase fast enough for any economic growth to happen. Not to mention that you would pay someone for something with a gold coin and then it disappears into their vault for the rest of forever as their retirement plan rather than circulating throughout the economy. Prices went down by 1/3 over the course of the 1800's and the economies in the US and Europe alternated between depression and malaise the whole century. (How'd you like it if you had bought a house for $100k and then discovered it's now worth $66k and everything and anything was like that.)<br><br>Modern currencies are just paper. The value of the $ or Euro or Pound is what you can buy with a $/Euro/Pound. Because paper currencies slowly lose their value, like 2% per year, the dollars themselves are hot potatoes that everyone wants to get rid of before they shrink in your hand. This is a little nudge to keep people spending money to get things of actual value (products and services are what's actually valuable and what we want to encourage more of, not the metal in the coins) and this keeps production happening and jobs and people employed. <br><br>A potential criticism is you could make is that this keeps low income people from ever breaking the cycle because they can't get over the hump to start accumulating capital. I'd say that paper money that slowly inflates encourages consumption which produces demand which makes demand for labor or paper money keeps them employed. Without it, consumption would go back to an 1800's level and they wouldn't find any employment at all except as servants for the rich or something. Another point is that with computers and the internet it is now easier than ever to invest in stocks. Poor people aren't trapped with a maximum of like $10k in the bank that the Boogie Fed is slowly stealing from them. They can invest in stocks too if they want and prioritize it. This wasn't possible even 20-30 years ago.<br><br>There are two actual problems in the economy: taxes being too low on capital income/very wealthy people and competition from developing countries.<br><br>The point of Piketty's book earlier this year was that a whole economy/country has businesses that are winners and losers. Say the whole economy grows by 3% in a year while some companies will grow by 10% or more and some will go out of business. Average people with no particular wealth get the benefit of the aggregate prosperity. All of us in the country get 3% wealthier. Wealthy people who have their own capital would have selected the growth companies and had their wealth expand by the 10% while avoiding the losing companies so capital gets a higher return than the whole economy and it tends to capture the growth.<br><br>Also big corporations have a ton of money right now just sitting in bank accounts. Part of the problem is that it's profits from foreign countries that they'd have to pay taxes on again to bring into the US. The US's corporate tax rates are higher than the rest of the world. (And our personal taxes on wealthy people are way too low. Such ironic!)<br><br>There is also a problem in that regular people go to jobs where they have to work actually toil for their income while people who own millions of dollars in stocks sit back and relax and get income from capital gains and dividends (owning stuff) and are taxed differently. But this and taxes are a political and philosophical problem.<br><br>Also, NAFTA happened in the early 90's. This opened cheap labor in Mexico to US companies. I'm in the Midwest where the mid-sized cities are all former factory towns. Some went down in the 80's when the domestic auto industry couldn't compete with foreign companies. The rest went down in the 90's. A bunch of factories moved south because why would you pay a factory worker in the Midwest $30/hr when you can pay a factory worker a fraction of the amount in Mexico? Then the last 15 years, China swooped in at even lower prices. Factory work moves away from the US. There has also been a huge amount of automation in the US. The US has more factory capacity than ever, it's just that we have small groups of people making multi-million $ airplane engines and writing software rather than giant factories mass producing plastic parts and ipods.<br><br>There's also the financial effect. Generally the imports and exports of a country tend to balance and industries &quot;flow&quot; around the world so that a country does what it does best. Countries that have oil for example, like the Middle East, employ a small number of people to get the oil out of the ground and export it and then use the money from oil exports to import all the other stuff for the rest of the country to live--food, cars, building products, entertainment, etc--and that's the economy. Same thing with natural resource economies like copper, lumber, or coal (Canada, Australia). Now imagine a country with no natural resources--they have to take in cheap raw stuff like metal ($) and turn it into high value cars and electronics to export ($$$) so that they can take the difference in value ($$) and use it to import all the stuff they don't have (Japan, or Germany to a lesser extent). <br><br>If you are a car company, where would you put your car factory? The oil country? It wouldn't make sense. The country already has a few oil workers and everyone else already sitting around enjoying doing nothing on all the oil money flowing into the place. Your exported cars will be perpetually too expensive because you have to pay people a lot to compete with oil jobs and then you'd have to compete again with oil abroad as the export.<br><br>Starting in the 70's and especially in the 80's financial products exploded and the US took up producing them for the whole world. To balance imports we export these financial products and they pushed out the industries that make physical products like how discovering oil would push out regular industries from a country. Factories became too expensive to be based here.<br><br>I rambled on here. I feel kind of bad because a few years ago I would have agreed with what you wrote but then I gained experience and saw better. Yeah inflation isn't good but deflation is much worse.</p>		</li>

			<p>Banks don't have the ability to print money. If you're referring to National Banks (or the Federal Bank) then sure. Even then, you're first point is very flimsy. <br><br>National Banks like the FED print money not in their self interest, but in the interest of citizens in their particular jurisdiction.<br><br><br>Secondly, your description of the economic response to the 2008 crash seems...very, very misguided. When lending and spending are at all time lows, governments have to spend money to prop up the economy again. That includes lowering interest rates to make loans more attractive. It also includes the government taking on more debt, since un-employment is high and, as previously discussed, interest rates on loans are at all time lows. <br><br>Also, it's interesting to note, that the US is outperforming all industrialized countries in the world right now undoudebtly due to their strong monetary response.</p>		</li>

			<p>yes. banks can in fact &quot;print money&quot; it is just not made of paper.<br><br>its a number in a digital file. Where exactly do you think the money for your mortgage comes from? if you think &quot;depositor holdings&quot; your delusional.<br><br>It is called fractional reserve banking. Nothing wrong with it. Perfectly ok. Now pair it with 85 to 140 % interest rates actual on home loans. (calculate out what a 4.25% APR 30 year loan is in ACTUAL interest)<br><br>See the problem yet?<br><br>Good video to look up on youtube. Money as Debt.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;yes. banks can in fact &quot;print money&quot; it is just not made of paper.<br>its a number in a digital file.<br><br>We need to establish what you mean by &quot;banks&quot;. Government or federal banks have the power to print or create money, but there are no private institutions in America able to &quot;print&quot; money. In the UK I believe there is one, called Lloyds, however the UK government have a 43% stake.<br>(This info is from a free Yale Course with Robert Shiller, winner of a nobel prize, that you can find on YouTube)<br><br><br> &gt;Where exactly do you think the money for your mortgage comes from? if you think &quot;depositor holdings&quot; your delusional.<br><br><br>If not depositor holdings, then they borrow it otherwise. I don't see your point? Again, it certainly doesn't come from them being able to &quot;print&quot; money.<br><br><br>&gt;Now pair it with 85 to 140 % interest rates actual on home loans. (calculate out what a 4.25% APR 30 year loan is in ACTUAL interest)<br><br>&gt;See the problem yet?<br><br><br>Your argument that banks make around 85 to 140% on mortgage loans, forgets that the basic principal of interest rates makes that gain a lot smaller. Secondly, borrowing that amount of money for just 4.25% APR is insanely cheap, and one of the most important financial inventions for the betterment of mankind. So no, I don't see the problem? <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>no that gain is not a &quot;lot smaller&quot; most people just lack simply understand about how this stuff works.<br><br>they &quot;think&quot; the bank needs 30 years to get their investment back when in fact they get in back in 1 or max 2 years and reinvest again.<br><br>you see if you get $100,000 from a US bank the bank only puts $10,000 on the line. (a lot less actually but lets assume a single bank that is not linked to other banks and depositers money etc..)<br><br>but let us keep it simple<br><br>the bank deposits $10k into the fed and they can use fractional reserve banking to now loan out money 9 to 10 pus the deposit.<br><br>so by &quot;risking&quot; $10k they can loan you $100k. quite literally printing money out of thin air (this is WHAT fractional reserve banking is)<br><br>this is not the SAME as adding money to the money supply (printing money as in the fed or congress) Money conjured from fractional reserve banking &quot;goes away&quot; as you pay it back. Money printed by the fed or congress actually permanently increases the money supply. IE fractional reserve creation does not cause inflation fed/congress printing DOES inflate.<br><br>that makes it confusing so lets call what I am talking about &quot;conjuring&quot; money into existence.<br><br>the bank get's it's $10k back pretty quickly. tyicaly mortgage $1400 figure $400 is taxes and its 10 months to 14 months and they have their $10k back NOT 30 years.<br><br>the REST of your mortgage payments for the next 29 years is &quot;un-conjuring&quot; the $90k that was conjured via fractional reserve banking &quot;AND&quot; paying the bank the interest from the loan.<br><br>with fed reserve interest at basically 0% they get their money and their interest FIRST reinput that to the fed as high power money and 9 to 1 + deposit gets loaned out again and again and again.<br><br>they DO NOT wait 30 years to get their money back. 1 to 3 years TOPS<br><br>suddenly that 85 to 140 % interest is not so fair anymore ehh?<br><br>in fact if it were NOT for that 85 to 140% interest there would simply be no need in most cases for 30 year loans.<br><br>10 to 15 year loans would cover things if it were not for the out of control usury in our banking system.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well sure, but it's the underlying reasons for why the dollar is the world reserve currency that <em>really</em> keep it afloat. Also, the US does have a lot of debt, but when compared to GDP (which is how it should be compared) it really isn't &quot;truly awesome&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Sure. Here's some text from Wikipedia<br><br>&gt;In 2013, United States public debt-to-GDP ratio was 71.8%, according to the CIA World Factbook,[2] or 104.5%, according to the IMF including external debt.[3] The level of public debt in Japan 2013 was 243.2% of GDP, in China 22.4% and in India 66.7%, according to the IMF,[4] while the public debt-to-GDP ratio in 2013 was at 78.1% of GDP in Germany, 90.1% in the United Kingdom, 93.5% in France and 132.6% in Italy, according to Eurostat.<br><br>Also, [this] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY8o5eq6h54" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY8o5eq6h54</a>) is a short (6 min.) yet very interesting video about why there is no alternative to the dollar. It's especially relevant now, since the Dollar is very strong. In case you weren't aware, gold is at all times lows as well. Hope it makes sense. </p>		</li>

			<p>I don't know, and neither does anyone here. What's your point? When compared to GDP (which is how debt should be compared), the US debt is high, but not even close to being unmanageable at least in the next 10-20 years. This again is why inflation is important, because it makes their debt worth less and in turn easier to pay off. He makes the argument that this is why politicians don't want deflation, but seeing as 2/3 of the US debt is owned by American institutions (which in turn are owned by Americans) I have to disagree that deflation is good for the public. </p>		</li>
