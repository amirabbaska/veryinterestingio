<p>If you want to mask that you're even going to the Pornhub DNS (pornhub.com) or some other website, you can use VPN to absolutely mask the DNS request and alongside any metadata (in this example, what videos you're watching).</p>
<p>But you have to find a VPN solution that doesn't store any sort of logs from their customers, which is pretty hard to find a trustworthy VPN provider.</p></div>		</li>
