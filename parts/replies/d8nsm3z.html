			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a proof that there is no possible algorithm to calculate the nth digit of pi that doesn't need to store all of n at once? What if there were an algorithm that could read n two bytes at a time, do a calculation, read another two bytes of n, do a calculation, and so on, and output digit n at the end?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that the algorithm has to know when to stop, so it has to count how many digits it's already processed. The algorithm can forget the <em>values</em> of each subsequent digit, but it needs to know how many total digits to churn through before it burps out the <em>nth</em> output digit.</p>
<p>If the total <em>n</em> number of digits is too high to store, the algorithm will fail. Since <em>n</em> can approach infinity, the algorithm is therefore impossible.</p></div>		</li>
