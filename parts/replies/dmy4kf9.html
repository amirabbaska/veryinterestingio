			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the key, mass doesn't work the same way as your intuition expects at the sub atomic levels. The mass of a proton and a neutron in a hydrogen nucleus is less than the mass of the two separately because the bound state has a lower energy level than the unbound state. Any state can transform into a lower energy state so long as a lower energy state exists and it can be done while preserving conservation of charge, angular momentum etc. Preservation of particle type and quantity is not required however, allowing nuclei to emit particles that didn't actually exist in the nuclei prior to decay to ensure conservation of physical quantities is maintained</p>
<p>Particle accelerators take advantage of this to create new particles, creating situations where there is sufficient energy density for exotic particles to be created in the aftermath of a collision. Basic rule for particle physics; if nothing forbids it from happening, it will happen with some probability.  </p>
<p>Also, beta decay transforms a neutron into a proton, not vice versa. Otherwise charge is not preserved. Some elements have isotopes that do transform a proton into a neutron, but they emit a positron instead of an electron in the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A proton becoming a neutron or the other way around doesn't change baryon number. The emitted positron has a partner neutrino, which is a lepton, so lepton number is conserved. There are a few rare interactions in the standard model that can violate B and L conservation, but nothing in the standard model or most extensions violates B-L conservation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those can be conserved through creation of anti-particles. For example, pair production can occur when a sufficiently energetic gamma ray decays into a electron/positron pair.</p></div>		</li>
