			<div class="markdown"><p>They really can't, although the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Perfect_Storm" target="_blank">&quot;Perfect Storm&quot;</a> in 1991 (yes, same as the Mark Wahlberg movie) is an example of a group of storm systems closely interacting with one another.</p>
<p>What more often happens if two tropical cyclones move close enough to each other is they'll loop around one another. We call this the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiwhara_effect" target="_blank">Fujiwhara Effect</a>. Basically, if two tropical cyclones move close, they cause each other to spin around the other one. If one storm weakens as a result, then its remnants may be &quot;absorbed&quot; by the remaining storm. But this doesn't necessarily make that storm stronger or weaker. <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/07/24/fujiwhara-effect-pacific-hurricanes-fidget-spinner-hilary-irwin/#FIJqw3QC4aqo" target="_blank">Here</a> is a great article from earlier this year which has a beautiful animation of a Fujiwhara interaction between Hilary and Irwin in the Eastern Pacific.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I loved the book. It was actually a super system of three storms which is why it was named storm of the century. It's such a rare event but three storms can encircle each other creating some pretty impressive wave sizes in the open ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow I never knew it was three. I definitely have to look into it. I only remember parts of the movie, and the tales some people talked about since I lived in CT as a kid back when the movie came out. </p>
<p>I wonder what the storm of recorded history will be as far as meteorological events go. </p></div>		</li>
