			<div class="markdown"><p>there are a lot of reasons for this. Here are some of them.</p>
<p>The tax rate is different.</p>
<p>The product was made in the same place and costs more to ship to the country that is further away from that place.</p>
<p>The product is manufactured in both countries but costs a different amount to make in each country (for reasons such as taxes, different wage levels, cost of importing ingredients/machinery etc).</p>
<p>The shop you buy it from charges more for reasons similar to the previous option (this can also happen in the same country, even on the same street)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok...but it's true across the board. Housing. Food. Import products. Services. I could go on. Commensurate goods and services in the UK are universally more expensive than their US counterparts, even those that do not require much difference. Example: a PS3 back in 2006 was fully <em>75%</em> more than its same manufactured import brother in the US. There is no way that is taxes. McDonald's is more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially if your talking about an import like Hershey's. There isn't a large market for it here (we eat cadburys and we like it that way) so it's expensive due to the small volume that's imported </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about online services such as Spotify, where it costs $9.99 in US, and yet £9.99 ($14.28) in UK?</p>
<p>I think we all know the answer.. companies will charge what they think most people will pay, not what the actual value of it is.</p></div>		</li>

Someone suggested that hanging it on the 30' wall would be better than the 20' because there would be more space to spread out.</p>
<p>I had to say the wall didn't matter because the barrre was only 18' feet. I had to say it 3 times.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>More than half of the participants in the Yankelovich focus groups questioned the price of our burger. &quot;Why,&quot; they asked, &quot;should we pay the same amount for a third of a pound of meat as we do for a quarter-pound of meat at McDonald's? You're overcharging us.&quot; </p>

<p>Sometimes I really worry about my kids and whether they'll be ready for the challenges life brings their way once they leave home. Am I sufficiently preparing them? Do they know enough? Can they really manage on their own? Then I see shit like this that illustrates the intelligence level of many functioning adults you see wandering around each day.</p>

I'm sure they'll have just use a hamburger weight calculating app on their phones that they can use in a pinch :/ It really is pretty depressing to realize just how mathematically and scientifically illiterate we are. You'd think we would be getting better at both fields considering our lives are so dependent upon them, but alas the exact opposite seems to be happening. All the more reason to take charge and be involved in you kids' education from the start. </p></div>		</li>
