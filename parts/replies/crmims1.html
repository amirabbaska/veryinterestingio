			<div class="markdown"><p>That is incredible. Is this the only species that can revert back to its child state like this? Can you ELI5, what the process for that is and why would the jellyfish start to do this instead of just aging and dying? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This species of jellyfish is the only animal known to be able to revert to an immature state after reaching sexual maturity. To begin weâ€™ll need a quick understanding of the jellyfish lifecycle. They start as a free-swimming larva and then develop into a sessile polyp (similar to a sea anemone). Polyps are colonial and can asexually produce medusa (asexual reproduction results in a clone). Most medusa (the stage that looks like the jellyfish you picture in your head) die after releasing sperm/egg, but <em>Turritopsis nutricula</em> can return to the polyp state after producing sperm/egg through a process called transdifferentiation.
Transdifferentiation is a change of well-differentiated cells (cells with specific jobs) to other cell types (different jobs) by returning to a state of undifferentiation (cells with no job). Stem cells are a kind of undifferentiated cells, but it is unclear if they are involved in the transdifferentiation of <em>Turritopsis nutricula</em>. Transdifferentiation is usually only seen in regeneration, but this jellyfish has managed to use it to revert to an earlier form of life.

<p>While <em>Turritopsis nutricula</em> is the only known animal to revert to an immature state, there are other examples of biological immortality. To be clear biological immortality means that likelihood of death does not increase with age.

</blockquote>
<p>I'm curious about this aspect - are they more or less &quot;immune&quot; to genetic mutations and cancers?  Does this undifferentiation effectively buffer against this?  Might the stem cell aspect play into the equation this way (so to speak)?</p>
<p>Interesting, seems <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdifferentiation" target="_blank">transdifferentiation</a> is a relatively young concept, and a brief ctrl+f &quot;cancer&quot; found no hits on the page..  I'm more intrigued now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't lobsters supposedly &quot;immortal&quot; as well?  They don't revert in quite the same way, but they are capable of dealing with telomere issues due to something within their biology.  They continue to grow in size, so they find it more and more difficult to hide and avoid being eaten; so it isn't quite like the mentioned jellyfish.  But </p>
<p>I just remember this because one of my top rated comments was about using the science behind the telomere &quot;fix&quot; in lobsters to extend human life, and having to compete with my great-great-great-grandchildren for potential mates due to nobody ever dying.</p>
<p>Edit:  Scrolled down and more or less got my answer.  They die because of predation, but also because they lack the ability (eventually) to sustain the energy levels required to keep up with their size.  So, they eventually do get too big and will eventually die no matter what.  However, I would be interested to find out if there have ever been mutations in lobsters that create &quot;dwarf&quot; lobsters that are unable to increase in size beyond a certain point, thus never having to deal with the size issue, and because their genetics are not an issue, they would be theoretically capable of existing for a very, very long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if those size limited mutants existed, the avg fitness (in terms of offspring produced over lifetime) would have to outpace the fitness advantage that large size presumably confers to the wildtype lobsters for the mutation to become fixed within a population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a lobster could survive endlessly due to a mutation that limited its size, would it not have more opportunities to pass on its mutation? </p>
<p>I realize that the lobsters who occupy and compete for resources would continue to reproduce, but repeated reentry of the mutation to the local population would increase the likelihood that it would take hold. </p>
<p>This is, of course, assuming that the lobster would not be at a disadvantage due to its smaller size. So it is likely that the mutation would need to stop growth at a point optimal to its defense and attractiveness. Any lobster better would potentially prevent mating and decrease the chances of it passing. </p>
<p>The chances of the stars aligning perfectly is unlikely. And so I don't expect it, it was more of a what if it did happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most animals have excellent DNA damage repair mechanisms. Also the stochastic effect of a single point mutations or InDels that do slip through are spread out over all of the tissues which means that the likelihood that any individual mutation is likely to be harmless and not cumulative if they don't occur within a progenitor cell. Mutations don't always cause cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lobsters can live indefinitely, but they die to predation, and if that doesn't happen, their size becomes so large that their metabolism/physiology can't keep up with the size and they die.  So they sort of do die of old age, but it's a different flavor.</p></div>		</li>
