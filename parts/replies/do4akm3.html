			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a warning.  I had a lot of wax and the doctor said &quot;Hey, do you want me to clean out the wax?&quot; I said &quot;Sure!&quot; And he did the drops then cleaned it out.  Got an $800 bill for &quot;Minor Surgery&quot;. </p>
<p>That being said, there was one time where I got a sinus infection and my ears were really bad.  Thankfully I was on a medical volunteer trip and our primary care doctor with the group did it for free. That one was worth $800.  He got like 2 full pencil erasers worth of wax out. I went from agonizing pain to cured in no time at all. </p>
<p>He said he has a lot of older patients who come in who say they need hearing aids, but he finds out they're essentially wearing ear plugs from so much wax. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats crazy.  </p>
<p>I hate this stuff.  I have had this done like three times.  </p>
<p>I think twice at urgent cares and once at a family doc?  </p>
<p>I never paid more than $100 for this </p>
<p>I really wish they'd make them have up front pricing.  I got nailed on something similar a bit ago with the wife.  She gets UTI's fairly commonly (maybe once or twice a year) due to some kidney issues she has.  Anyhow typically not a big a deal, but she knows what a uti feels like.  So she went to a new gyno and they did the anything else you want to talk about?  thing and she mentioned her cramps were worse than normal or something so they suggested they could do a quick uti check just to make sure that wasn't an issue.  She says its not, she knows what that feels like and its not what shes talking about and they say 'well it just takes a second then we can rule that out' so she says ok.  </p>
<p>2 months later 500 bill in the mail.  I don't think shes ever paid more than $50-100 for a uti swab.  Her one jackass doctor prescribes the same anti biotic every time that works but demands one <em>arg</em></p>
<p>If they phrased that shit as &quot;would you like to spend $800 for me to clean out your ear?&quot; i bet you'd have laughed your ass off </p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no way you should allow that. Sounds like a billing mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might feel good afterward, but during the cleaning it's hell on Earth.</p>
<p>Or at least it is for me. Maybe I'm just sensitive, but liquid in my ear drives me insane. Worst is when it's the wax-dissolving stuff (think it's really just hydrogen peroxide), which fizzes. But then flushing it out requires so much more liquid that goes deeper because the was is now dissolved...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this guy is correct; I get the exact same thing you describe and my family calls me 'bat ears' because of my good hearing. I just have ears that are prone to getting blocked, possibly cos my eustachian tube doesn't slope down as much as most adults. It gets congested quite easily for some reason anyway. But I was examined by an ENT doctor and there was nothing else going on.</p></div>		</li>
