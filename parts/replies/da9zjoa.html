			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about technology, it's about consumer preference. If I make a battery that holds 10% more power, do I use it to make the phone's battery life 10% longer, or do I make the phone 10% faster?</p>
<p>People would rather have a big fast processor and a bright shiny screen, and recharge every day, than a slow processor and a small dim screen and recharge every week. So we get phones designed to last a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, there is an inverse relationship between the amount of battery charge capacity and the time it takes to charge the battery. People prefer to have a phone that can charge in a couple hours and lasts 8 hours to a phone that last 10 or 12 hours but takes 4 hours to charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost everyone I know pretty much runs their phones on 'power saving' or whatever the equivalent mode is with low brightness etc in order to make the battery last longer, which in turn somewhat nulifies the improved display, processor speed etc. I think it also has to do with the fact that the other technologies seem to be advancing at a faster rate than anything to do with batteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CPUs could be made way more powerful but manufacturers choose CPUs that doesn't draw too much charge from the battery of their choosing.</p>
<p>Batteries instead... They are not getting better at that rate. If you compare new CPU to old CPU which both has same energy consumption, the new CPU is often way more powerful. Batteries can't do even that rate even though the development of CPUs is already held back by batteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A smaller process <em>can</em> give you performance gains. Or the designers could choose to build a chip with the same performance, but lower power consumption. Again, it's the same calculus.</p>
<p>Technology sets a limit on possible combinations of power and and performance. Newer, smaller processes simply shift that line outwards.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you want sleek with all the bells and whistles then you're going to have to wait for a significant breakthrough in battery tech. Which is hard because there's only so much energy you can store in a confined space safely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I got a powerbank for Pokemon Go when that exploded and now I no longer play, but I carry that brick everywhere when I leave the house for more than an hour.</p>
<p>I got a 20k MA when most phones have 1.8k-3k and the biggest batteries in phones on the market are around 3.6k-3.8k. I often don't even bother charging my phone for 3-4 days just because whenever I'm low on power I just plug it in where ever I am and never run out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, this answer. For a while, I used one of those cheap plastic Nokia phones (non-smart phone) with 12 buttons. Battery lasts forever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first thing I do when I get a new phone is go through the software and uninstall or turn off half of it that I will never use, then glare at my phone as a third of the stuff I uninstalled reinstalls and turns on with the next patch. Its all battery draining bloatware.</p>
<p>I don't care how much time and effort you put into having an IR blaster in a phone HTC, I am not going to use it as a TV remote, let me completely remove the goddamn app and stop turning the app on!</p></div>		</li>
