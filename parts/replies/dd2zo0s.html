			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is actually &quot;yes&quot;.  The criteria for impeachment are, effectively, the opinion of 2/3rds of the House that impeachment is warranted.  The criteria for removal from office is 2/3rds of the Senate voting to do so.</p>
<p>The fact or non-fact of any criminal charge is effectively immaterial.  You might consider Congress to be voting on facts, but if they vote their opinions or what their psychic told them the result is just as legally effective.  There is no way to overrule Congress on this.  The Supreme Court cannot save a President that has 2/3rds of each house ready and willing to vote to oust him.  Nor could the Supreme Court force the ouster of a President that Congress did not vote to remove, regardless of him selling the White House to Russia, demolishing the Pentagon, and peeing on the Iwo Jima memorial.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you are wondering if Trump can be impeached if his Executive Order regarding refugees is declared unconstitutional, the answer is &quot;no.&quot;</p>

<p>Why on earth do you think that? The House of Representatives can impeach someone for whatever they want to impeach them for.  They can impeach a person for doing jumping jacks if they want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's my professional opinion as a lawyer who has been admitted to the US Supreme Court bar for 20+ years.</p>
<p>Trump didn't even personally write the text of the Executive Order, he had his staff do it and it was approved by counsel before he signed it. What act did he commit that would constitute an impeachable offense? Abuse of power? He signed an order on the good faith belief that it was a legal action to take. On top of that, this was not a personal action done outside his capacity as President, he was acting within the scope of his office.</p>
<p>I realize that &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; is vague, but Congress is not going to expand that to include acting in good faith on the advice of counsel in the execution of one's official duties.</p>
<p>I know Gerald Ford once said an impeachable offense is &quot;whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment,&quot; but most legal scholar reject that. If that was strictly true, the President would essentially be serving at the pleasure of Congress. </p>
<p>They can <em>try</em> to impeach a President for doing jumping jacks, but that's not going to be a successful effort. There is some question as to whether an impeachment is a justiciable action subject to review by the Supreme Court; in
<em>Nixon v. United States</em>, 506 U.S. 224 (1993) the Supreme Court held that US District Court judge Walter Nixon's impeachment conviction was nonjusticiable, because Nixon's conviction did not raise any other Constitutional issues that the Court had the ability to review, and Art. I, ยง 3 of the Constitution provides that the &quot;Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.&quot; However the Court also clearly indicated that it would find an impeachment conviction justiciable if the conviction itself raised a separate Constitutional issue.</p>
<p>Impeaching someone for doing jumping jacks would almost certainly raise separate Constitutional issues, and I would be hard-pressed to believe that such a ridiculous impeachment conviction would survive scrutiny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a lawyer who is also admitted to the Supreme Court bar, I respectfully disagree. As you noted, Nixon is the best case on point. </p>
<p>As the case notes, the House has the &quot;sole&quot; power to impeach and the Senate has the &quot;sole&quot; power to try impeach charges. This language suggests, and the Supreme Court seems to agree, that the decision of Congress is non-appealable and non-removable. </p>
<p>It seems this has to be right. As the court has noted, even assuming Congress screwed up, what remedy could any court possibly impose? Any possible remedy in the face of a Senate conviction is almost certainly going to create a full fat constitutional crisis. </p>
<p>It seems to me impeachment is a political question and a non-starter for any judicial review.</p></div>		</li>
