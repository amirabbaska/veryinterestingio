			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. I wish people would stop up voting the other incorrect comments saying it's logarithmic. </p>
<p>It's very simple. The time constant of an RC (resistor+capacitor) circuit is, well, RC (resistance times capacitance). This is the time it takes for the system to respond to a signal. </p>
<p>The resonant frequency is just 1/(RC). Therefore when you change the resistance (or capacitance) with the dial, the frequency changes as the inverse.        </p>
<p>For a circuit with an inductor, it's a bit more complicated since the resonant frequency is sqrt(1/LC). Still the same concept though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AM stations are spaced 10 kHz apart and FM stations are 200 kHz apart. You'll notice that the FM numbers are evenly spaced but the AM numbers appear to be spaced logarithmically (or 1/x because of all that science stuff in the above comment). The AM numbers need to &quot;catch up&quot; with the FM numbers, so to speak.</p>
<p>AM has 1180 Hz to cover while FM has 19800 Hz to cover.</p>
<p>EDIT: Well here's a link that explains it all in great detail: (<a href="http://www.quadibloc.com/science/freqint.html" target="_blank">http://www.quadibloc.com/science/freqint.html</a>)</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually it's not logarithmic, it's closer to a 1/x relation since what you turn is not a resistor, but a variable capacitor. A capacitor and an inductor are used in the tunning circuit attached to the antenna. But log scales are indeed used in frequency plots since it better represents the behavior of systems.</p>

<p>are straight up word salads to me. I have literally zero idea what anything before or after &quot;It's very simple&quot; means and I doubt I'm that dumb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THAT was the a great explanation, and you are right. But I would like to quibble with you, if I may. </p>
<p>If the above comment approached things the same way you just did, then I wouldn't have made MY comment. But if you tried giving the original explanation as it was given above to say....my 60 year old bank teller mother? She'd still be just as clueless as she was before reading it. She's an example of a layman that still wouldn't get it. So while you're right, we're explaining to lay men, and not literal 5 year olds, the best explanations are the ones that could be given to someone that doesn't have even a foundational  knowledge base of the subject matter, and they could still at least grasp the concept. As I already stated, this was a great explanation, but I still think it misses what I would argue to be the point of the sub. To explain something simply enough that a person with no knowledge about the subject can understand.</p>
<p>...it's not like I'm a moderator on the sub or something though. I probably shouldn't bother nit picking, but I let myself in this case. </p>
<p>Just my 2 cents.</p></div>		</li>
