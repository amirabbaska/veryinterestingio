			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're right but 4K also matches this - </p>
<p>4K is 4096 pixels x 2160 pixels.</p>
<p>4K is approx. 4 times total number of 1080p pixels. But it could also mean 4K count on one axis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, I actually prefer using the horizontal measure as it didn't change with varying aspect ratios. Plenty of so called 1080p videos don't have 1080 vertical pixels, but they always have 1920 horizontal pixels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cinemas use the horizontal pixel count which is where 2K and 4K is from. Consumers typically use the vertical pixel count (eg. 720p or 1080p) which are close but not the same resolutions as the cinema standards</p>
<p>4K comes from 4096x2160 which is pretty close to the Ultra HD resolution of 3840x2160, so it's not pure marketing bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, there was a standard in professional video called 2K which was pretty close to 1080p. Instead of inventing a new separate term for consumer grade video, they just went with the professional term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1080p is 2k because it has ~2000 <del>vertical</del> horizontal pixels (1920). 2160 is 4k because it has ~4000 <del>vertical</del> horizontal pixels (3840). </p>
<p>Edit fixed vertical to horizontal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1080p isn't technically 2K. There is a 2K standard in between 4K and 1080p that was popular in cameras for a time as a way to increase sharpness for 1080p broadcast. It has 2048x1080 pixels and was used to get full resolution on a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, since 1080p is at a less wide 16x9. To get 1.85 on 1080p you have to crop a bit and use fewer pixels. 2K cameras allowed you to achieve this naturally.</p></div>		</li>
