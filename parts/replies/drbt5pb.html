			<div class="markdown"><p>HDR stands for High Dynamic Range.</p>
<p>What this means is that the range of colours can be displayed in a much more extreme range than your standard, non HDR, device.</p>
<p>So blacks are a much deeper black and whites are much whiter. Furthermore, the sections on the screen that require particularly deep blacks or bright whites don't affect the colour tones of the different colours around that area.</p>
<p>This results in much a more lifelike and realistic image which is more important at this point that more pixels.</p>
<p>TLDR: HDR adds colour realism whereas 4k/8k adds pixels/sharpness </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that HDR as used for displays is unrelated the the existing term HDR as it refers to photography. Photography HDR refers to a very specific process for displaying detail within areas of diverse tonal values; HDR for displays sounds mostly like an ambiguous way of saying your TV has very accurate display of tonal values.</p>
<p>It also has nothing to do with colour, by the way; it's just how light and dark is represented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need a way to store a picture in a digital way. So you must somehow tell what pixel has what color.<br />
You can generate any color by adding up the 3 base colors (red, green and blue for additive).<br />
Currently we're using 256 levels of brightness for each color. This allows you to generate 16.7 million different colors (256^3), but it only allows you to achieve ~256 levels of brightness.<br />
With HDR 10 we allow to have 1024 levels of brightness for each color and should be therefore get a better representation of color and brightness.<br />
However there are some misconceptions:<br />
HDR does NOT give you a deeper black, a more powerful red or a brighter white.<br />
It more like having a finer scale:  If you have nothing on your scale the normal scale would show 0g, the better scale wouldshow 0.00g  (deepest black).<br />
If you put a kg of weight on it the normal scale would show 1000g, the better scale would show 1000.00  (max brightness).<br />
The values are the same. The improvement comes from packing something like 5.63g on the scale: The normal scale would show 6g, the better one would show 5.63g.<br />
.<br />
However: many HDR TV's have a higher brightness than your old TV. So if your new TV can make the display 4 times brighter than your old display then the white will be brighter or you'll have a more powerful red.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing is just 30-bit color (10bpc). 10bpc is only one part of HDR specs, overall brightness and contrast ratio are also specs and those do indeed get you deeper blacks. Higher color Gamuts are also part of HDR and that gets you deeper colors.</p>

<p>Upvoted for this sentence in particular.  'Deeper black' is completely meaningless.  It's either black or a shade of grey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhhh, no... You're confusing bit depth with contrast ratio.</p>
<p>The two main components of the HDR standard are color AND brightness. High Dynamic Range literally refers to the range of contrast between blacks and whites. It's a measure of luminance, how dark and how bright the screens can get. Color is part of the standard, but so is brightness. HDR allows for a much higher contrast ratio, which is a measure of how bright the screen gets compared to it's darkest black. As you can see below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On January 4, 2016, the Ultra HD Alliance announced their certification requirements for a HDR display.[5][6] The HDR display must have either a peak brightness of over 1000 cd/m2 and a black level less than 0.05 cd/m2 (a contrast ratio of at least 20,000:1) or a peak brightness of over 540 cd/m2 and a black level less than 0.0005 cd/m2 (a contrast ratio of at least 1,080,000:1).[5][6] The two options allow for different types of HDR displays such as LCD and OLED.[6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're describing it like every single screen has the same range of brightness, and that's just not the case. The peak brightness and range of black levels can vary. OLED screens do not get nearly as bright as LED TVs, but their darkest blacks are truly black, which allows them to achieve a higher contrast ratio required for the HDR standard despite not achieving nearly as many nits as their LED brethren.</p>
<p>There is also a finer gradient of shades per color, which is the bit depth you're referring to, but the brightest whites and darkest blacks do vary, it's literally in the requirements for the HDR standard.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is HDR for cameras. HDR for displays is completely different thing and not really connected to camera HDR.</p>
<p>HDR displays have more colors, wider color range and higher maximum brightness.</p>
<p>It kind of sucks how same HDR name is uded for so many things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And that's a nice understatement. </p>
<p>Star Trek has something that not only looks perfect, with full colours, but also <em>feels</em> perfect - water is wet, metal is cold, trees rustle... </p>
<p>Further, it's doing it from all angles - multiple people can interact with any part of it, including being far enough apart that they have to yell to each other. </p>
<p>Lastly, of course, is the ability to have a natural, unscripted, human interaction. </p></div>		</li>
