			<div class="markdown"><p>Tin foil is probably fine, but do not use aluminum foil. Exposed elemental aluminum quickly oxidizes and becomes corundum, an extremely hard mineral that can scratch nearly anything. Corundum varieties include sapphire and ruby. Its hardness is 9, just under diamond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not your finger nail - your finger nail is short enough that the screen can detect the finger, even though it is not on the screen. I think it can detect things a few milimeters away from the screen if the surface area is big enough. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I’ve tried to scratch my screen with keys and it doesn’t leave a mark (iPhone X, but any smartphone from the last 5 years should be the same result).</p>
<p>Your screen scratches from things harder than it, mostly dirt and dust in your pockets. Metal won’t make a mark. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should be chrome or steel coated brass. Basically what most keys are made of. Brass is pretty soft, which makes it easy to cut precisely, and is also what makes it easy for the teeth to wear down. Keys are also made out of brass to lessen the chance that the key can mess up a tumbler of a lock. Messed up keys are a lesser problem then a messed up lock. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keys are most often made of brass (copper zinc, yellowish) or nickel brass (copper, nickel, zinc, &quot;silver&quot;y)</p>
<p>The copper is probably the common denominator. (Pennies are often only copper plated, since copper is relatively expensive)</p></div>		</li>
