			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a steel mill, they had a machine called ‘midas’ which had a number of induction probes in a rotating head, (background the probes were induction probes that used eddy currents to detect defects in the surface of steel)  the head ran span fast, the centrifugal force powered a small generator on the head which powered the probes, the information from the probes was transmitted through radio waves to the body of the machine, every time a probe was changed a tuning card had to be calibrated to align the signal with the machine, this was about 15years ago, Midas was long in the tooth then! I imagine now, they would use digital transponders rather than analogue systems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tires dont always have sensors in the tire</p>
<p>Tire deflation systems work with camera like systems in the car it measures how fast a tire rotates. If a tire starts rotating slower/differently than all others the system detects „low pressure“.</p>
<p>Its all optical sensors</p></div>		</li>
