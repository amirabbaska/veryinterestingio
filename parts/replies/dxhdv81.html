			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely a little bit of both. I think it is exceptional in that there are very few environments around the world where all the right conditions are met for this type of deposit, and also because such high concentrations are rarely found. Also I would assume it is relatively difficult to survey the sea floor for this type of deposit, so it is somewhat remarkable that it was discovered. </p></div>		</li>
