			<div class="markdown"><p>If you haven't eaten anything in a while, your glands have only been producing saliva at a minimal level. Once you start eating again, there's a sudden rush to salivate causing that pressure/burning sensation. </p>
<p>It's especially noticeable if it's something tart because your body recognizes that it's acidic and needs to produce saliva to act as a buffer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just out of curiosity, is it kind of a bubbly feeling, almost popping? If so, I get that too! I didn't realize anybody else did. For me, it's pretty much exclusively when I drink alcohol, although not every time, and a lot less often now than it used to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once got a salivary stone in one of those glands (the parotid, to be exact) and it swelled up until I looked like <a href="http://bmoussavi.com/temp/ParotidSwelling.jpg" target="_blank">this guy</a>. The treatment was to eat super sour things to make the gland kick into overdrive. If all went well, the stone would be flushed out. After suffering through a bag of lemon drops and Extreme Warheads it finally came out and the pain and swelling stopped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had one too! I just couldn't get the damn thing out, even getting the sourest things I could. At first I couldn't get any Warheads anywhere, or any real sour candies, so I went to the grocery store, bought some lemons, and started sucking on those a couple times a day... But it just wouldn't come out! The worst part is that it was SO CLOSE to coming out, I could feel it under my tongue! At that point I even tried squeezing it out by hand, but it just wouldn't budge.</p>
<p>Then one day I was drinking some ginger ale, it went down wrong and I started coughing, and then POP! It flew out, bounced off my monitor, and landed on my desk. It looked like a tiny popcorn kernel. </p>
<p>It was a gross and painful experience, 1/10, do not recommend. (Would be a zero, but yummy sour things were required, so yay!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a point of clarification, although this will likely be buried, but the pain itself is from the specific stimulation of the vagus nerve, which is involved in the sensation of sour taste. The pain is referred from the jaw and even the ear, and the salivary glands are induced to excrete saliva due to the multifaceted nature of the nerve. The pain isn't actually from the gland or ducts squeezing.</p></div>		</li>
