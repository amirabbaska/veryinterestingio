			<div class="markdown"><p>The pressure isn't a concern, unless you were suddenly introduced to it. Humans can withstand and breath in well at 4 atm, that's only a 30m dive. </p>
<p>Methane is not at all toxic. Worst it can do (other than burn) is asphyxiate you, which given the premise is not a concern. It's also not toxic to the environment. </p>
<p>Carbon dioxide takes a lot more concentration to start being toxic, and it wasn't anywhere near that high. It's also not toxic to the environment, again unless we start going really high. </p>
<p>Carbon monoxide is toxic, but I'm not sure why you are assuming it was so high. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the video i saw did state that during this era the atmosphere pressure was equal to &quot;8&quot; atmospheres. I am sure that would be a great stress to the human body but my main question was if we could breathe air that was 35% oxygen. You do bring up a good point about the mix of other gases in the atmosphere though, i am not aware of the percentages of the other gases was during this era hopefully someone can answer that.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is definitely not known at this point.</p>
<p>There is some very indirect evidence the the total pressure was once higher based on the larger size of flying insects and aerodynamic considerations, but that's about it; any statement like this is just conjecture at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it were 8 atmospheres of pressure then the pressure of oxygen would be 8*0.35 = 2.8 atmospheres of oxygen which would cause oxygen toxicity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass of the atmosphere really shouldn't increase 8x.</p>
<p>Also oxygen toxicity depends on how long you'll be breathing it. EMTs will give you pure oxygen on the way to the hospital, but if you're going to need it for more than a day the hospital will or at least should cut it to half. Oxidative stress never really stops at any dose including the level you are currently breathing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't imagine carbon monoxide accumulates in open atmosphere that much unless a container of it goes off. Nitrogen can be a problem at some combinations of partial pressure and overall pressure; it can cause narcosis and carbon dioxide can cause acidosis. And enough oxygen can practically burn lung tissue. /u/_Close_to_the<em>Edge</em></p></div>		</li>
