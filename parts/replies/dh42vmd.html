			<div class="markdown"><p>A ribbon gets twisted one way when it loops over the top, then gets un-twisted when it loops under the bottom.</p>
<p>Ever wind up a garden hose?  You can wind it one way and it starts to get twisted so you can turn the loop around and wind it the other way to untwist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's happening with the top and bottom ribbons? They appear to be constantly twisting in a single direction without problems.</p>
<p>Edit: nevermind. played around with an elastic band for a bit and solved it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not what's happening.,  The torque points on both sides of each ribbon strand remain fixed.  If I attached a ribbon to any one side of a cube and kept twisting the cube in any constant direction, the ribbon would twist over itself repeatedly and eventually become tangled.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not twisting in a constant direction, because as the ribbon goes over the cube it's twisting in one direction, but on the next turn it goes under the cube and un-twist in the opposite direction, even though the <em>cube</em> is always rotating in the same direction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It made more sense when I looked at the ribbon going to the right side. It flips back and forth like the other commenter said about a water hose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, it goes counterclockwise over the top, and then clockwise under the bottom so the notion that it's always twisting in the same direction is an illusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, after about 15minutes &quot;wasted&quot; at my desk, I think I figured out the top &amp; bottom ribbons. You'll notice that they go around the cube half as much as the cube itself rotates. So the twist that would be caused by a ribbon going around the cube is being untwisted by the cube's rotation.</p>
<p>Please note that one elastic band lost its life in the process of this investigation.</p></div>		</li>
