<p>Not so much the expansion of space, but just general mixing of material in galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, not <em>at all</em> because of the expansion of space. All that does is increase the distance between <em>everything</em>, so it wouldn't contribute to mixing of different clouds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did those stars which lived short violent lives go through the fusion processes all the way up to iron at an accelerated rate then if they were able to produce those heavier elements in the early universe? If so, what made them &quot;burn up&quot; faster than a regular star?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The size of a star impacts its life. The more hydrogen there is, the larger the star. The larger the star the more fusion occurs. So larger stars burn hot and fast. A super giant star will last as little as a few million years whereas smaller stars such as the sun can last billions of years. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't the projected lifetime for some of the smaller red dwarfs actually on the order of <em>trillions</em> of years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bigger the star, shorter is its lifespan. Stars of the size of our sun have life of about 10 Billions years, while super big star (~100 of solar mass) have life span of just few tens of millions of years. Early universe had much more material available to form such Big stars. On the other hand, there are tiny stars that probably will live to 100 billion years. </p></div>		</li>
