			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting problem because it's not about total funding. People often offer simplistic solutions on the assumption that just more money is needed.  But if you look at U.S. spending on education per student, it's actually quite high. There are different issues affecting educational outcomes, including the distribution of spending across schools and the allocation of that spending to specific areas.</p>
<p>In the United States, each state runs its own school system, and they aren't equally funded. This makes national-level comparisons misleading. Even within one state, the way money is allocated can mean that per-student funding amounts are very different between schools. It's no surprise private schools tend have more money than public schools, either. </p>
<p>And also important is what the money is spent on. For example, American schools spend a significant amount on sports. The foreign school I used to attend on the other hand did not have any sports teams, only a weekly physical education class. People often disagree about what the most important thing to spend money on is, and favoring one area means less money for others. Comparing strictly academic outcomes and total funding is misleading when you don't take into account different priorities.</p>
<p>Another example would be spending on disabled students: in the city I live in now, charter schools are allocated the same amount of additional money per disabled student as the public school district, by law. But on average public schools' disabled students cost more money to accommodate than the charter schools' disabled students. (Compare the cost of accommodating blindness to accommodating ADHD.) Without changing the funding formula, public schools will have a lot less money to spend on other areas than charter schools, no matter how much the total funding is.</p>
<p>Successful education reform in the United States depends on better allocating money to the schools that need it most, and more efficiently spending it on the programs people want to prioritize. Then an evaluation of the outcome needs to take into account those priorities.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Especially because parents (and their general SES) contribute to funding. Some districts need to provide kids with pencils and paper. Some districts can ask parents to send their kids to school with $100 calculators. Suddenly similar levels of funding result in vastly different levels of support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. Refreshing to see people bring up some reality about school funding.</p>
<p>A few years ago in California we had some more money allocated for schools...which were set aside mostly for construction projects. So schools were getting shiny new auditoriums or whatever...which sounds nice, but really does jack for quality of education.</p>
<p>At my college we got a new performing arts center, and yet within 4-5 years, they almost had to cut some music majors. What a joke</p></div>		</li>

<p>But muh taxes . . . my kids aren't in school any more / I paid enough for the schools when my kids were there / I don't have kids, why should I pay for schools / etc.</p>
<p>Besides, if we give them more money they'll just waste it on foreign language or art classes.  IF you're gonna raise muh taxes I want to improve the FOOTBALL TEAM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do have the funding. Well, in part. However, their allocation of money may not be for the advantage of the teacher. </p>
<p>For example, one place I worked would hire management consultants at very premium rates but allocate you a single ream of a4 paper per month. I had 220 students, so just over two sheets of a4 per learner per month.</p>
<p>Of course, I had to buy my own paper for the kids, some who could barely afford shoes. I bought them text books. I bought them breakfast bars. Why? Because I was the only adult who have a shit about them. The organisation didn't and their parents didn't. Importantly, perhaps, I have maintained some pride in the job.</p>
<p>In short: some of us want to do our fucking best. Whether that's buying them materials or attending their funeral.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it isn't &quot;we don't have money&quot; but &quot;we don't have the money in the right place&quot;. Schools (government agencies) have funding but designated for specific functions. You can have a general fund and a supply fund and if you run out of those yet still have money for personnel (even if you are staffed fully) then you can't just use the money from one pool to cover the other. There are a whole bunch of goofy rules and tricks to purchasing stuff in a government agency. </p></div>		</li>
