			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. It is an extreme balancing act.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tight precisions of physical robustness</li>
<li>Full chemical reactions of propulsion and to facilitate that mixture</li>
<li>Storing the yet to be used chemical tanks</li>
<li>Storing that forceful reaction in direction</li>
<li>Extreme tight balancing of weight to strength for containment</li>
<li>That feeds back into needed propulsion the more you make things heavy to lift in ratio.</li>
<li>All of this needed force to lift in altitude</li>
<li>All of this designed as a rocket to pierce the atmosphere in drag over the course of changing altitude.</li>
<li>And then to balance that so things don't go astray otherwise the composite assembly of a large structure will snap like a twig.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is all focused mainly on getting the rocket to &quot;go&quot; without exploding. Now think you need materials which are as light as possible, as was said, but you also need them to withstand extreme temp. differences from the heat of exiting the atmosphere to the extreme cold of space. Next think, okay we are in space, now what. Oh, I just need this thing to be programmed to chart a very precise course in 3D space taking into all the effects of the different sources of gravity it will encounter, not simple gravity (earthbound F=m w/ a=9.81m/s^2), but this one F=(GMm)/(r^2). They have to take into account the effects present from the sun, moon, etc. as well, as we change our relative distances to these bodies AND we need to make sure we packed enough fuel into our as efficiently light as possible rocket in order to make this trip and get back. I am sure this translates into an extremely difficult set of differential equations I would NOT want to solve. And you know then Mr. Musk wants to land them and reuse them so good luck with that...

			<div class="markdown"><p>And let’s not forget that with most things, if you screw up a bit you fix it and try again. Here, if you screw up a bit the best case scenario is that it explodes into a bajillion pieces in the air, and the worst case scenario is that you accidentally bomb a nearby town.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms, there's two types of drag: skin friction and pressure drag. For anything moving in air at any reasonable speed, pressure drag will absolutely dominate. Pressure drag is the drag caused by the object displacing the air around it: as the object moves out of the way, it creates a zone of vacuum that air has to rush back in and fill. This also pulls back on the object. Minimizing the size of that zone will save you tons of fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you manage the balance well, the &quot;pencil&quot; shape is a massive reduction in drag. Which directly translates to fuel efficiency. Rockets would have to get WAAAY bigger to leave the atmosphere with significantly smaller payloads. </p>
<p>We don't really think of air as something that slows us down, but at rocket speeds that difference is VERY significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you want is the center of gravity to be as far forward as possible. The rocket rotates around the center of gravity, and so the fins and/or nozzles (which can be moved to steer) need to be placed as far away from it as possible.</p>
<p>This gives them leverage. And this is why to make a bottle rocket, you attach the rocket to the top of the stick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the aerodynamics and combustion process (interactions between the inner walls of the rocket engine and the gases and liquids) is a very complex process which takes several iterations and a long time to get right. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, the nozzle is also extremely complicated. Not sure of the material but I would guess some sort of titanium, magnesium, and aluminum alloy. Anyway, the nozzle has to be cooled. Liquid powered rockets are cooled by the exhaust of the jet engine which is the pump. So on the outside we  see a smooth nozzle but the nozzle contains channels for that cooling air to run through. Fun fact I learned in propulsion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some rocket engine use the propellant itself to cool it down - run cold fuel through the nozzle walls, let it absorb the heat, and then finally pump that hot fuel into the combustion chamber. I believe it both cools well and rises efficiency somewhat since you recover a bit of the energy otherwise wasted as heat, but it only makes the nozzle that much more complex.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Isn't this rather uncommon? The F1 used turbine exhaust to help cool the nozzle extension (by forming a shielding layer inside the nozzle. You can see the dark layer in the exhaust plume.). The main cooling was still done by the kerosene fuel though. The Merlin 1 seems to just dump the gas generator exhaust overboard (looking at static test photos).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think maybe a lot of people don't realize how complicated rocket engines are. They aren't just the big nozzle hooked up to a fuel tank with a combustion chamber like a normal gas powered vehicle. As someone who is very much not a professional I think it's much more fair to compare it to a gasoline powered water pump. You need to pump the fuel at incredible rates, and you need to power the pumps that pump the fuel. And each step of the process can be effected by the temperature, speed, pressure, etc. of the fuel. I think most people don't realize how insanely complex they are. If anyone is curious, look up pictures of rocket engines on their own so you can see the big bundle of pumps, pipes, etc. that is normally hidden inside the rocket.</p></div>		</li>
