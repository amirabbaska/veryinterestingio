			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry. I'll try and be more explicit, using the metaphor I set up. Since the special machines have dedicated special mother machines, they're better at making sure you never run out of them. That is, Special mother machines make more special mother machines at a high enough rate to ensure that there are functioning ones for the majority of the lifetime of the factory. They have the freedom to do this since the special machines aren't performing functions essential to the function of the factory itself.</p>
<p>And to be more clear about the metaphor in general. I'm not just trying to outline cell division, but cell differentiation. The mother machines are stem cells. They can differentiate into any cell type, but once they commit down certain cell type lineages, they can only become certain cells. As your stem cells either commit or senesce, you loose the ability to regenerate tissue and this is the major underlying mechanism behind aging.</p>
<p>So to be clear. The reason offspring aren't in any state of &quot;decay&quot; is because the sperm and egg haven't been dividing previously. They were produced from a stem cell and so are &quot;new&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this description (I assume you are talking about the relationship between stem cells and differentiated cells). </p>
<p>It's unfortunate that people hear about telomeres in some high school or undergraduate biology class and assume that's all there is to aging. If that was the case, we would have cured aging already! But numerous experiments have shown that you don't get say, immortal mice if you give them the ability to extend telomeres indefinitely. It's only a small part of a bigger problem. </p>
<p>The bigger problem is an accumulation of damage, either as damage to the DNA, or too much junk protein, or whatever else. Eventually it overwhelms the body's ability to regenerate itself, as you described with the failing stem cells. </p>
<p>And it absolutely is a problem for reproduction, that's where all the genetic/congenital disorders come from!</p></div>		</li>
