			<div class="markdown"><p>The stagnation of air along with solar activity plays a big part in the equation. It allows the reactions that you mentioned to accumulate in greater concentrations, which ultimately leads to the ozone action days. That's a large reason for the poor quality in LA as well as the DFW and Houston area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humidity level plays a significant factor. High humidity can help stave off what would otherwise be a high ozone day. The same conditions, but with low humidity, can cause much higher ozone formation.</p></div>		</li>
