			<div class="markdown"><p>A pretty basic thing that’s hard to accept is that empty space isn’t <em>just nothing</em> but is in fact a fabric that has properties. It is full of the flux of particles coming into existence and disappearing. It can expand. It can be warped. It even has non-zero energy. A popular guess is that dark energy, which is causing the expansion of the universe, is an intrinsic repulsive property of empty space which causes all of it to want to move away from all the rest of it, hence the universe expanding in all directions. Matter isn’t moving apart. Space is expanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like that you reference dark energy as if we know what it is. This is the standard currently accepted explanation for this, but there are plenty of physicists who are pursuing other explanations for the phenomena we observe.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact of the matter is that we don't know <em>what</em> gravity is. We don't know what causes it or &quot;why&quot;, just that it causes particles to be attracted to eachother, and it is a function of a particle's mass. </p>
<p>Everything we're talking about here is just a description of measurable phenomena. It doesn't make more or less sense that gravity warps space-time, we are just able to observe and model that it does.</p>
<p>Further to that, when it's described that way, it doesn't necessarily mean that it (gravity) <em>is</em> physically bending something (space-time). It's a description of the effects we witness (lensing, time dilation), almost like a metaphor, depending on how accurate our understanding of the concepts involved turn out to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thoroughly appreciate your answer. It gets at the heart of the issues, that we really just don't know. We have guesses, and hypothesised what could be the cause, but we just don't know. And implying otherwise seems arrogant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that gravity is a force that acts between masses is not accurate, it's at best a useful approximation. The more accurate description says that gravity is the result of matter and energy causing spacetime to have curvature. It's simply a property of the universe, there's no deeper answer for &quot;why&quot; this happens as far as we know. But we know it's accurate because it correctly explains every relevant observation we've ever made.</p></div>		</li>
