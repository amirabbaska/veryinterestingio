			<div class="markdown"><p>On that note, it can surprisingly be more helpful to let a car sick or motion sick person sit at the front of the vehicle so they can see the road and help alieve that sensation. Found this out two years ago hosting a school trip to Costa Rica with a few motion sick students. I was very surprised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always had to be in front as a kid or else I'd puke on long trips and my sister always thought I was faking because I was ok driving in town where you can't really drive for too long. Well once driving with my aunt and uncle she somehow convinced them I was fine in the back. Jokes on her though since I puked on her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even now if I'm driving I don't get car sick or even as a front seat passenger. I couldn't go more than ten miles in the back of a car without puking my guts up when I was a kid. Even now at 43 if I'm a passenger in a car I need to look out of the windows all the time. If I try to read a book or use my phone as a passenger for more than a few minutes I start to feel nauseous! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very anecdotally true.  I don't get motion sick while in the front unless I try to read/focus on something with my eyes.  I can hold out for about 2-3 hours in the backseat if I'm actively trying not to get motion sick, then it starts to not matter what I'm doing.  Closing my eyes is hit or miss for helping at that point.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I don't get sea sick or motion sick on trains or planes (or at least haven't yet).  Something about the movement of a car (or bus or truck) just does me in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can do short trips in the back, and I can look at my phone for about 10 minutes. I can’t spin and even swinging makes me nauseous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would be the cause for someones tolerance to change?</p>
<p>I used to be one of those that could happily sit in the back of a car and read a book even for long 4+hr journeys. Now I manage around 30 mins before nausea starts to kick in. Or is it just a simple answer of age?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me at least, different cars caused widely varying degrees of motion sickness. I could read books on road trips in an old diesel pickup my parents used to have, but couldn't do anything in most sedans or I'd get queasy in minutes. Once we replaced that truck with a similar one, I started having problems with it again. Just little variances can make a huge deal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d imagine the old diesel pickup was bumpier than the newer model cars. Maybe the extra  jostling helps orient your brain to accept that you’re moving. I don’t get carsick TOO easily, but I always get sick from that roller coaster scene that runs before certain movies play in theaters. Apparently they’re too realistic for my stationary brain to understand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember being taught in an occupational therapy seminar that as you transition into adulthood you lose some ability to deal with extreme motion. They said for kids it's crucial for development to experience it, but as adults are already developed they don't need it anymore, so the tolerance for motion lessens. That's why you see kids whipping around merry-go-rounds willy nilly while my motion sick ass can't even sit through a 3D movie.</p></div>		</li>

Even when i couldn’t see the water, i could “feel” the boat move. But I found the motion sickness bracelets worked really well for me. </p></div>		</li>
