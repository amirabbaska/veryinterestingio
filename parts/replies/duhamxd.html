			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, I should have been clearer on that. They start to degrade pretty rapidly after the spore release, but if you get to them quick enough they are indeed still alive and can be cloned and cultivated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as long as that mycelium is alive still, it's always possible. and it can survive in the fruiting body in the right conditions for a little bit as was mentioned with store bought mushrooms. it's a pretty amazing system of evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like a plant where you can often just clear some grass away and plop it in. You can grow them, but you need a carbon source, like wood or wood chips. The process of the fungus decaying the growing medium will produce a nice additive for the garden, material with high nutrient retention, basically a compost, which is good for plants. You'll need to read up on mushroom cultivation. If you are serious about it mushroom cultivation can be a nice compliment to managing a yard and it's vegetation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suppose a mushroom starts to die after it releases spore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I lack formal qualification, but I'm something of an amateur mycologist. I like hunting and identifying mushrooms. I think they are cool little creatures, and can be quite tasty if you know what you are looking at. So take the below with a grain of salt. It's not well-researched, more a collection of my own obversations and understanding given a few years of learning about and cataloging mushrooms as a hobby.</p>
<p>You started to distinguish between a mycelial network and a mushroom, but didn't really do that great a job, IMO.</p>
<p>Okay, so this guy made clear that mushrooms are just a part of a mycelium. Specifically, they are sort of like ovaries. The job of a mushroom is to produce spores and spread them on the wind (or through water back into the soil, or even through an animal back into the soil).</p>
<p>Mushrooms only sprout naturally during certain seasons. In greenhouse conditions, you can keep a mycelial network constantly spawning new mushrooms by controlling moisture, temperature, and light conditions. Most mushrooms that people eat are gilled mushrooms. The gills produce spores constantly while the tissues are alive.</p>
<p>The tissues are delicate. They require moisture and the mycelium requires food to generate spores. The mushroom can continue to produce and drop spores for hours, even days after it has been picked. Spores are the mushroom's answer to sperm. (or more accurately, sperm is the animal answer to spores)</p>
<p>Spores are hardy. They can survive for years on end. But mushrooms aren't. They require moisture and key temperature, and being rather delicate, they are quite prone to bacterial and fungal infection that quickly causes parasitic fungi and bacteria to reduce mushrooms to slime within a matter of weeks of sprouting.</p>
<p>From the minute that a mushroom sprouts, it begins to die. It will hold out for a short time, but eventually the cells will either dessicate and wither, or the mushroom will break down. Most often, this is accelerated by insects and animals feasting on the flesh of the mushroom.</p>
<p>As for when a mushroom dies... That's a complicated question. Cellular activity in mushrooms is an awful lot like cellular activity in other plants and even animals. The tissues can still differentiate when fresh. Think of it like stem cells. They can become just about any kind of cell. Once the mushroom starts to ripen, though, the cells have lost their ability to vegitate (spawn a mycelial mass). At this stage, I would argue that the mushroom is now dead.</p>
<p>In animals, this line is pretty easy because we have brain activity that drives the body. Fungi don't have this distinction. The mushroom can separated from its mycelial mass and recuiltivated elsewhere, effectively cloning the original mass. Also, the mushroom can rot without it really dying (as the spores exist as clones of the mushroom.).</p>
<p>As for a direct answer to the OP's question: Slicing won't kill a mushroom. Picking won't kill a mushroom. Refrigeration won't kill a mushroom. Digestion will kill the mushroom, but the spores may survive digestion.</p>
<p>The only real way a mushroom dies is when it matures enough that it loses the ability to regrow the entire mycelium it spawned from. This only happens with time.</p>
<p>Even worse, this varies from species to species because of the chemistry behind cooking. Some mushrooms are harvested as buttons, others are harvested at maturity, and others are harvested ripened. It really depends on the species and what goes on inside of the mushroom chemically during development. Some mushrooms are quite foul-tasting as buttons, but not as adults, and others are the opposite. (Better yet, some mushrooms are actually harvested specifically for their foul-tasting compounds. Mushrooms aren't just food, they can be recreational.)</p>
<p>Some mushrooms are already, at least by my definition, dead by the time you pick them. Others are quite far from it when picked.</p>
<p>One thing that picking a mushroom does do, however, is it severs the mushroom from many of the special tissues that the mycelium maintains for digestion, respiration, and distributing moisture. Mycelium are a bit less specialized than animal cells, but they are specialized just the same. If you cut an organ out of an animal, it starts to die then and there. It's not dead the instant you cut it out, but it doesn't have long. Mushrooms are never meant to have very long. They basically have a 1-2 week window of life when they sprout to when they are dead. Unlike cutting the heart out of an animal, by cutting and storing a button mushroom, you may actually be able to lengthen the functional lifespan of the mushroom by doing so (with refrigeration and moisture).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
<p>So... It's kind of a mixed bag, but the best answer you can really get for the question: Either before you cut it, or some point after you cut and store it, depending on conditions. Harvesting the mushroom doesn't really factor into killing the mushroom. Once they have begun to drop their spores, death doesn't really apply to a mushroom. It's more like decay than death. The answer to &quot;When does a mushroom decay?&quot; is much more obvious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was saying how eating them raw is bad but it's not disputed by portobello producers. A lot of people eat them raw and it sounded like he was implying that the industry would try to take him out if he kept pushing this idea which would likely hurt their profits. Personally I think Stamets would have a lot bigger enemies to worry about (I think he talks a bit about that in the podcast too) and he's being dramatic to get people to talk about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just portabellas (crimini). It's all agarics. Basically, all agaric mushrooms have a protein that's known to be a carcinogen in high doses. Other mushrooms produce methylene/hydrides that are known carcinogens.</p>
<p>I'm not qualified to make a judgement on it, but my understanding of the current research on the subject is that it is not shown to have averse affects in rats that eat a reasonable quantity of raw mushrooms. Essentially, the current thinking is that for short term toxicity, it'd take a huge amount of raw mushrooms, an almost impossible amount to cause harm.</p>
<p>The current questions medically are what the risks are for small doses over a long period of time. Again, we don't know enough about the subject to declare whether they are good or bad. Many of these same mushrooms contain compounds that have been shown to act beneficially to the body with regard to preventing or fighting cancers and bolstering the immune system. We just don't know enough to say for sure whether eating these mushrooms raw is actually harmful. Currently, we have enough information on them to say that it's probably not anything to worry about. Just be sane and eat a diverse diet and odds are nothing will come of it.</p>
<p>I'm interested, as I eat a lot of raw agarics in general. I personally don't think it's worth worrying about. I'm of the line of thought that the point of life isn't necessarily living long, but rather living well. As such, I'll gladly consume carcinogens where doing so isn't obviously getting in the way of what I would consider living well.</p>
<p>As for Stamet's opinions... I'd take much of what he says with a grain of salt. Rogan's podcast frequently dips into pseudoscience in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He does not want attention from big business by saying the compounds in portebello are carcinogenic.  These can be cooked off at high heat, so do not eat them raw. More importantly he does not want to spread more &quot;mycophobia&quot; fear of mushrooms in the widespread public. That would hurt his research. So he doesn't take a stand which is wise for all mycologists. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so. The mycelium gets affected by senescence, which is basically age. So it ultimately slows down and eventually dies, however, in your scenario it's likely that the mycelium network would replenish itself with new spore.</p></div>		</li>
