			<div class="markdown"><p>In order for the laws governing sales so be the same in the UK and also the rest of the EU, they have to agree on those laws. But suddenly you have Germans and French making rules for the British (for example) which they don't like. Brexit fixes that. </p>
<p>They also send money to the EU in the form of membership dues and are obligated to help other members economically to an extent. The leave campaign said that money could be spent on public healthcare instead! Hint: it won't be.</p>
<p>And finally, they can get rid of those dirty foreigners. That freedom to work anywhere works both ways and apparently enough people thought that being able to get a job in Amsterdam wasn't worth ceding your home to Poles.
Basically all the reasons for leaving were either shortsighted, or lies. This is why it is often compared to the election of trump.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Looking from the outside it's easy to look globally, for the big UK economy, yes maybe it's bad. But that matters mostly for the big players, for the restaurant employee or the postman, having a job and seeing that your friends have jobs too is more important than if the state or the big company can bring in some more money. Everyone gets one vote, i.e. the big players votes counts just as little as each little employee that is happy to have a job at all.</p>
<p>So when the little employee sees that their friends go without a job while Polish people are getting jobs and accepting a lower salary they are not happy with that. The fact that they can go to Poland or Amsterdam to find a job matters little for most voters.</p>
<p>Maybe it's shortsighted, some people can't afford to think too much ahead, before planning 10 years ahead you have to make sure to solve your current problems or you'll never get there. </p>
<p>I lack the knowledge to predict what's really the best in the long run, but I can very well understand why normal people would think that in their local perspective Brexit is the better way (and normal people are the vast majority of voters). I hope I managed to project some of that understanding..</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any UK cheese producer is going to have to sell to Europe to stay in business, and in doing so they'll have to comply with the UK rules in addition to the EU rules. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm against brexit too, but let's not be so hasty to disregard the other side of the coin. Those are all valid arguments (except for the money that obviously won't be spent on health care). As much as you or I may believe the pro Eu arguments outweigh the anti arguments, they're not automatically short sighted. Calling the other side stupid or racist, instead of debating them, is a big reason politics is becoming more divisive and why controversial campaigns like trump and brexit won </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that now we get to make our own laws, rather than being forced to follow EU law (Which we failed to vote on, because we elected Eurosceptic MPs to represent us in Europe, and they never turned up.) and have complete control over immigration, which was often blamed for problems in the country.</p>
<p>It's disconcerting to say the least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the other side of the coin is at follows...</p>
<p>while there are clear benefits of the single market it can also cause it's own restrictions. member states are unable to negotiate their own trade deals, they are locked into bargaining as a block with the rest of Europe. within Europe itself there can be many conflicting interests making it much more difficult to get these things over the line and impossible to keep everybody happy.</p>
<p>as stated by other replies, Britain is indeed a net contributor to the EU basically meaning it pays more into the EU than it receives in benefits. vital services like the NHS are under severe pressure due to cuts in funding so it's natural for Britain to seek out areas where savings can be made.</p>
<p>in an area such as the EU with free movement of people, it's natural for people to want to move from poorer areas to places that are better off. why wouldnt any sane parent want to give their children better opportunities? whenever an area sees increases in population simple laws of supply and demand take effect. there is greater demand for housing for example so house prices, both buying and renting, increase significantly. this is great for the wealthy, and the many banks and pensions funds with their interests tied up in UK housing, but it kinda sucks for the average person on the street.</p>
<p>supply and demand also applies to the job market. an excess of available workforce means employers can pay less and still fill their vacancies. again, this is a sweet deal for the wealthy, but it kinda sucks for the average person on the street.</p>
<p>so, in light of this information, i hope it's easier to see why many people voted to leave the EU. like anything, there are positives and negatives. apparently, from the point of view of the majority of a democratic nation, the negatives outweigh the positives in this case. for that they get called ignorant, uneducated, and probably racist which again kinda sucks for the average person on the street.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can see that there were legitimate reasons for the UK to want to leave the EU. Arguably, the EU has expanded to more counties than it should have so you have countries with poor finance and poor prospects that suddenly share free trade and migration with nations that are much better off. Individual countries also lack monetary options that they would have otherwise had due to the single currency, limiting their ability to fix internal problems without taking loans. All of this is further exacerbated by a lack of kinship. Whereas, in America, a Californian feels close to a Nebraskan and wouldn't feel ill will towards their lots being tied to an extent, a German likely doesn't feel the same about a Romanian. There are many fair and valid criticisms of the union as it stands. I get that.</p>
<p>However, I feel that you may be overstating the extent to which people voted based on informed and legitimate criticisms. You say this migration caused housing costs to rise, but the cities (where that would be most acute) mainly voted remain. They could have used money currently going to the EU to prop up the NHS, but literally the day after the vote, they basically admitted having no intention of doing so. The large talk of &quot;controlling our borders&quot; has a slight scent of xenophobia to it, especially given the number of Britons who were surprised to learn that they would no longer be able to travel to France and Germany on a whim either. As if it's assumed that every country should welcome them. There were also huge divisions along age lines, indicating leave as a more popular traditionalist view. </p>
<p>Of course there are valid complaints about EU membership based on unfair practices and no hint of xenophobia. I don't believe 50.2% of the country voted leave based on those alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You clearly have no idea how supply and demand work in the labour market. It's painful how you argue that the average person is viewed as uneducated and ignorant, when the average person is in fact uneducated and ignorant on the pros/cons and has purely an emotional view on the subject sculpted heavily by the media. This kinda sucks for the average person on the street when we end up leaving our biggest most natural trading partner..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very good explanation.</p>
<p>it is quite likely that UK citizens will retain visa-free access to visit the EU (and EU citizens likewise).  It is very disadvantageous for both the EU to exclude UK citizens and for the UK to exclude EU citizens.  Visa waivers will be offered for visits.  </p>
<p>Permanent immigration procedures are likely to remain relatively relaxed between the UK and the EU as well, but this is likely to be a tougher negotiation.  (The UK would want to have bilateral free migration with the rich parts of the EU while imposing some immigration formalities on migration with the poorer parts of the EU; the EU is likely to refuse such an arrangement, so it will be interesting to see where that lands)</p>
<p>The UK and EU are also likely to work out a bilateral trade agreement which imposes relatively few restrictions and low or no tariffs.  The UK is likely to push for free trade.  The EU is likely to initially refuse &quot;You can't have it both ways; you wanted access to the Single Market, you should have stayed In&quot; -- but it is very disadvantageous to the EU to impose trade barriers with one of the wealthiest European countries, so there's a good chance that although they will open negotiations proposing huge tariffs and burdensome regulations, they'll probably agree to something fairly lightweight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on how the EU views its own stability. It's value as an economic block mainly has to do with its size, so more countries trying to leave diminishes that. If a country can just leave while still maintaining nearly all the benefits of staying, why wouldn't they? If the rest of the union is worried about that type of thinking, then they would want to make things very tough for the UK. High tariffs, high bars for work visas, the works. Given that Britain's largest industry is banking and the EU is much more diversified, I think the union would win that fight.</p></div>		</li>
