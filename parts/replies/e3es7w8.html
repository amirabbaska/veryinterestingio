			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a group of wasps (I assume it’s the same wasps, could be different ones) that insist on trying to build a nest under the covering of my front porch. The cycle repeats itself: wasps start building a nest about the size of a walnut, I come out with wasp killer and spray the thing, 3-4 weeks later they’re building again in another spot of my porch. </p>
<p>I feel bad but damn I don’t want them by my front door! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Make the place undesirable. Remove the nests after killing them. Repaint the area, I have antedocatly heard that a light blue will keep them from building nests as they think its sky. </p>
<p>Coat the area with permethrin. There has been some work done in doing this to keep Africanized bees out of bird houses (permethrin is harmless to birds and mammals) and it seems to be effective. No I have have no idea how to coat it, how often to recoat it or any other info on the subject.</p></div>		</li>
