			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy crap I do this too. I also forget to blink when I'm hyper focused.  I've never been tested for ADD. I'm always thinking about multiple things at once and if I have to focus on something I'll block everything else out, which seems to annoy a lot of people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here!  Back when I wore contacts, it would be really bad.  After focusing, my eyes would burn really bad, because I wasn't blinking.  The breathing thing usually never bothered me.  </p>
<p>But one time it did was when giving blood.  I would always get really light headed and start to pass out whenever doing it.  I just figured it was a side effect of losing the blood, until one time, when I was getting some blood work done, I told the nurse I was starting to pass out, and he just offhandedly said it was because I wasn't breathing for the past minute.  I didn't even realize it was happening.  I made a point to breath, and bam, back to normal.</p></div>		</li>

It's not nearly as bad as you think and they can help with general advice, meditation techniques or if need be, medication. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, crap, now I have 2 names for something that I feel I've experienced.  I think this one fits better, though, because it describes something that is done while awake rather than asleep. </p>
<p>I used to hold my breath when ultra focused on things when I was a child. </p>
<p>I miss that focus. Sort of wish I could do it again.  I'm glad I don't do the &quot;NEED BREATH&quot; groan I used to do when I stopped breathing for too long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL there's a word for it. ADD too and I forget to breath all the time. I jokingly call it wake apnea. </p></div>		</li>
