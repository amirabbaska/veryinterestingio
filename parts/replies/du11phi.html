			<div class="markdown"><p>Have been on a daily 18 hour fast, this is 100% true. Hunger waves occur roughly every 3 hours and that doesn't change even when you have a small meal. In time it's 9, 12, 3, 6 and 9. The last being the hardest to skip.</p>
<p>It does get easier and your body will always give you the energy you need if you truly will it to, just don't stuff it with sugars and temporary fixes, ice cold water is your best friend. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He only eats over a period of 6 hours every day.  Ex. wakes up, skips breakfast, lunch at 12:00, dinner at 6:00, and doesn't eat again until the next day.  It's called intermittent fasting and it's pretty popular atm for a variety of reasons, but is mainly utilized as a method of calorie restriction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the questions been answered but just to explain a bit more. Intermittent Fasting is a way of restricting diet based on time, you can eat the same amounts (generally) but restricting the time in which you're eating.</p>
<p>I'm always on 18h fast eating between 1-7pm where possible and twice a week I have 1 small (under 700 cal) meal only, meaning I go 7pm-3pm no food then eat the next day around 1pm again</p>
<p>I eat the calories I've missed over the next couple of days. </p>
<p>It's the only diet I've ever been on that's worked for me and stops me feeling hungry constantly as my bodies is actually using its resources for fuel</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black coffee for life. </p>
<p>I have a drip, French press and stove top espresso. Get into making really dynamite coffee for yourself because you'll get excited for it like a meal and nothing beats a powerful coffee. In dribbling typing this out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a super good question and something that has been baffling me for ages... I poop 3 times a day, all within the first 4 hours of being away. First one is minor, second is major, third is minor. I can't explain it. You know that like from Hot Shots - <em>I don't remember eating that</em> - that's my life. </p>
<p>Also, as a subnote to poops, I have an Apple box I squat on so I poop how my body is designed to poop and it's pretty incredible. I spent a third of the time on the can Because it just seems to fall out, not squeeze out, and my wipes are down to just 2. (which means I'm confident that 2 is enough... I get a little caught up in believe in <em>just one more</em>). </p></div>		</li>
