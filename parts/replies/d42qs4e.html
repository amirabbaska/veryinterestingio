			<div class="markdown"><p>AP typically have a core made of a dense metal, they are black tipped rounds in the military, while regular m855 green tip rounds have Steel core the M955 has a tungsten core.
This is all from memory so forgive me if I get a nomen incorrect </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the top tier being the DUR rounds used during Operation Iraqi Freedom, (Depleted Uranium), which had a DU core and a lead and steel jacket. Those suckers are HEAVY for a bullet, and go through most conventional armors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for smaller rounds like a 5.56 or 7.62. The weapons they're fired from are made to handle a certain amount of force. The whole equal and opposite reaction plays a big part. The force that is propelling the bullet forward is also the force going backwards, and really all directions. If you increased that force by 4 times the amount then you would quickly have some very damaged weapons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. The double speed/quadruple energy was just to illustrate the relation (KE=1/2<em>m</em>v^2). I realize that running 4 times the energy wouldn't be realistic. In this case, you would possibly drop the mass and up the velocity a bit to keep the energy roughly similar, but probably still increased, but just try to punch through a bit faster.</p></div>		</li>
