			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, more or less. Suppose you connect a wire to the negative terminal of a battery, and another to the positive, but leave the ends hanging. A few electrons will come out of the negative terminal and flow to the end of the wire, so a current flows <em>briefly</em> -- but then electrons accumulating at the end of the wire repel the incoming ones, and that flow stops.<br />
The reverse of that happens at the end of the other wire: electrons are depleted from it, leaving a net positive charge that attracts the electrons in the wire and stops them flowing into the battery.<br />
Result: a short pulse of current.<br />
Now connect the wire ends to a capacitor. The same thing happens -- but the accumulated negative charges on one plate <em>attract</em> the accumulated positive charges on the other plate, and that lets the current flow somewhat <em>longer</em>. The bigger the plates, and the closer together they are, the longer it lasts.
The dielectric allows the negative charges on one plate and the positive charges on the other to <em>attract</em> each other, but not to <em>flow across</em>.<br />
In the beloved tradition of water analogies for electric circuits, here's one for a capacitor: <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/Analogy/Capacitors/" target="_blank">https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/Analogy/Capacitors/</a></p></div>		</li>
