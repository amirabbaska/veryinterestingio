			<div class="markdown"><p>To add some detail about the other particles, when you combine hydrogen with anti-hydrogen, the vast majority of the energy released will be in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion" target="_blank">pions</a>, which will decay into photons (about a third of the total energy), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon" target="_blank">muons</a> (about half), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino" target="_blank">neutrinos</a> (the rest). The muons will then decay into neutrinos and electrons/positrons. </p>
<p>Of course, this is just the dominant decay pathway, you get a <em>lot</em> more different particles at lower probability just from the sheer amount of energy you're dealing with.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good starting place for all things math and science is the sixty symbols YouTube channel (their website might be a better place if you're interested in specific topics though). They started off explaining what different symbols are used for in math and science and how/why they are used practically and have expanded a lot since then. Planck lengths, neutrinos, relativity, etc.</p>
<p>There's also a great interview done with Richard Feynman called &quot;fun to imagine&quot; which is one of my favorite videos on the web. You can find it whole or in parts on YouTube. </p>
<p>Are you interested in specific learning about small particles or?</p></div>		</li>

<p>you could convert it all into energy in the form of EM radiation</p>

<p>Hypothetically, lets say we convert it. How much work could we do with that much EM radiation from a single atom? i.e. &quot;we could power a car for 10 miles&quot;, &quot;we could power a ocean liner across the pacific&quot;, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen, the lightest atom, has a mass energy of 1.5 x 10^(-10) Joules. Uranium, the heaviest element that occurs naturally on Earth, has 3.6 x 10^(-8) Joules. </p>
<p>The energy in one hydrogen atom is enough to lift up a single grain of sand by the thickness of a sheet of paper. Uranium will let you lift a (dead) fruit fly about half an inch. </p>
<p>Keep in mind though that a grain of sand weighs more than 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 hydrogen atoms, so that's a pretty incredible amount of energy. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never seen it phrased like this before. Thanks for the visual, that really helped me grasp the concept. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To extend this to a more human-conceivable bit of fuel, that grain of sand has a mass of .67 mg. Getting 100% of the mass energy of that grain of sound would net you 60.3 gigajoules. That is just over the amount of energy you get from 500 gallons of gasoline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hardly anything from a single atom. One atom is unbelievably small, so the mass energy is around a billionth of a Joule. However, macroscopic objects contain unbelievably large numbers of atoms. 1 gram of matter contains enough energy (9x10^(13) Joules) to power the entire US for 20 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When phrased like that, it really makes you think..</p>
<p>We're VERY bad at getting energy out of mass efficiently. We've got thousands of huge power plants that burn probably millions of tons of fuel in total every day, and yet, simply 72 grams of matter could give us the same energy if we could harness it efficiently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly I had a professor say it was about enough energy to make a grain of sand twitch. It depends on the mass of the atom.</p>
<p>Silicon is on average 28 amu. 28amu <em> 1.66x10^-28 kg/amu </em> (2.9979 x 10^8 m/s)^2 =4.18 x 10^-9 J.</p>
<p>Let's call a grain of sand <a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/MarinaTheodoris.shtml" target="_blank">.15mg = 1.5 x 10^-4 kg</a>. To calculate the height which the energy could raise a grain of sand E=mgh -&gt; h= 4.18 x 10-9 J / (1.5 x 10^-4 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 )= 2.8 x 10^-6 m.</p>
<p>That could be a visible jump if you are very observant. It would take around 10,000 atoms ideally converted to make a more dramatic jump on the order of centimeters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this and put it into terms that are a little more applicable (in a way), 10,000 atoms would be 1.0x10^4. A single <em>gram</em> of pure hydrogen contains 6.02x10^23 atoms. </p>
<p>It's easy to see that a <em>very</em> small amount of hydrogen would lead to a monumental release of energy if it was totally converted to energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to tie this back to your original context (re: fission), nuclear weapons lose a lot of energy due to incomplete consumption of their fissionable material. The explosion spreads the material out, at which point it ceases to be supercritical. I think the bombs dropped on Japan used something like 2% of the reaction mass. The rest just becomes a low-density hot mist of radioactive material. </p></div>		</li>
