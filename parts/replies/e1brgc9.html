			<div class="markdown"><p>[For context I am a PhD candidate studying newborn immunity]</p>
<p>The common and accepted answer is that the newborn immune system is just immature, because it is easy to understand and makes intuitive sense. However, many who specifically study the neonatal immune system (myself included) are trying really hard to convince everyone else that the system is not immature, rather it is distinct and purposefully regulated to function different than adults. There are some cell populations where are seemingly unique to newborns which exist specifically to down-regulate immune responses. It is possible these exist as remnants of the fetus needing to not react to the mother, but the fact that they stick around for a while (at least a month, but it varies) seems to indicate they are not just incidental. Honestly it is a bit of a mystery - if the newborn immune system isn't immature, why is it so much worse at fighting infections? There's no argument there - newborns are objectively susceptible to infection and inflammation. However, the last 30 years of understanding the newborn immune system to be immature has not led to any effective treatments for infectious disease (antibiotics / antivirals are all we've got). In a few instances people have tried to bolster the immune system and it has actually increased mortality, though more often there is no difference (always seems to work in mice though, so do with that what you will). </p>
<p>Anyway I think you hit the nail on the head: I just wrote a whole manuscript arguing that it is too energy intensive to mount adult like immune responses, and here it is in a random reddit comment. Another explanation is that newborns may be hypersensitive to immunopathology (self-harm from their own immune response) so they have to balance between not harming themselves and wiping out whatever pathogen got in there. Yet another possibility is that it is the lack of an established gut microbiome (bacteria that live in your stomach) which prevents newborns from mounting adult-like immune responses.</p>
<p>I made a lot of claims here about a relatively controversial subject, if anyone is curious about my sources feel free to message / comment and I will provide links. Alternatively, check out the review I just wrote on the subject where this is all done in a lot more detail and with more evidence - <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01077/full" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01077/full</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your immune system derives primarily from your bone marrow and your thymus. Both of those organs are not fully developed when you are born, so newborns essentially don't have an immune system at birth. They required on the borrowed immunity from the mother's blood, breastmilk (or formula, which is made to include drinkable antibodies). These borrowed antibodies are only designed to be temporary though, and do not give the baby permanent immunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, that is wrong. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6606446" target="_blank">The immune system begins to develop within weeks of conception and is active in the womb.</a>. However, the immune system is  a reactive system that <em>changes</em> in response to exposure and the womb is supposed to be a sterile environment. Premature infants are immunized based on birth day, not gestational age, because the immune system works and responds to vaccines, their immune systems will respond to immunization even earlier than the point of viability (roughly 23 weeks gestation with modern techniques and treatments). There are differences in parts of the immune system that are age/exposure dependent (NO2 production for chemotaxis, IgA production...) but the immune system is active very early in development.  </p>
<p>edit: No infant formula intentionally contains antibodies. There are two main reasons for this: antibodies are digested into inactive polypeptides and amino acids in the gut and antibodies are large antigenic proteins that can cause allergic reactions. This is one of the reasons breast milk is superior to formula: it contains human IgA from the mother for a variety of antigens specific to the mother's and infant's environment in addition to white blood cells, antibiotic polypeptides, and agents which promote the growth of good gut bacteria like lactobacillus reuteri.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your immune system is tuned in to know what is <em>you</em>, as well as what's safe (which includes gut microbes that technically aren't &quot;you&quot; since their DNA don't derive from yours). To a large degree, this is learned. The immune system tries to remove everything that isn't you / safe, and to directly attack anything known to be unsafe. </p>
<p>This learning doesn't happen in a day. </p>
<p>I don't know the exact reasons, but AFAICT it has to do with a combination of energy intensity + necessity, babies don't need to start off with strong immune systems, but they do need to spend energy on development. As others have said, they have limited exposure to pathogens (viruses, etc) and they start off with protection from the mother's immune system. During this period your immune system starts to recognize everything that is in your body, it kind of builds a whitelist of safe things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other side of the coin is <strong>maternal interference</strong>. The infant already has circulating antibodies from the colostrum/placenta (proportion depends on the species), and so will clear an antigen without having to activate the B/T lymphocyte pathway from within.</p>
<p>Think “give a man a fish” vs  “teach a man to fish”. You need the latter to have any lasting immunity against a particular antigen, and maternal antibodies short-circuit that process in newborns.</p>
<p>The idea is to give the vaccine as early as possible, while maternal antibody levels are declining. Some of the earliest vaccines might be “wasted” on some infants, but others might have low antibody levels at birth and so will benefit from early vaccination. Some babies have very high levels of maternal antibodies and so need the latest dose to achieve lasting immunity.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's a combination of the last two reasons.<br />
In order to get FDA approval you need to show that your drug/vaccine/whatever is &quot;effective&quot;. This requires a fair amount of statistical evidence.<br />
The effectiveness of the HPV vaccine decreases once you're exposed to HPV. It might protect against stains other than the ones you've been exposed to, but won't help with whatever you're already exposed to. This means when studies were being constructed to prove effectiveness, children and young adults were used. This means that the FDA won't approve the drug for use in older adults because it's effectiveness for older adults hasn't been proven, but it hasn't been proven because it's expected to be less effective.    </p>
<p>For example:<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copy paste from another comment:</p>
<p>That is not quite correct, the hpv vaccines are not recommended after 26 years old because they are said to be &quot;economically inefficient&quot; which is wrong too because the risk of it is being downplayed because the population doesn't know the risk so there is no need to act. The manufacturers didn't test the vaccine for older people but other studies did. Studies prove it's effective at any age and it definitely makes sense to get it because there are multiple strains of hpv and even if one is sexually active one probably hasn't gotten all of them (most only get a few or one strain in their life) so it makes sense to protect against the others too:</p>

<p>&quot;The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is efficacious in women aged 24-45 years not infected with the relevant HPV types at enrolment.&quot;</p>
<p>Also EVERYONE should get vaccinated since both MEN AND WOMEN get hpv and get the cancers from them too, different ones and at a different rate but still. Also one can not eradicate it by just vaccinating half of the population when everyone spreads it.</p>
<p>It is also found on gynaecological equipment and can probably be spread through genital to hand and then hand to hand skin contact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The non medical answer is that after 25, most people are already sexually active. </p>
<p>But yes, vaccines are definitely less effective as you age. The elderly are very prone to the flu because the flu vaccine has a low success rate in them. This is again thanks to the thymus, which atrophies with age, meaning it no longer contains as many immume cells (T cells) needed to fight a new pathogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand it was proved that vaccination at 9 to 15 years of age is associated with production of sufficient amount of antibodies which prevent HPV infection. As someone has already mentioned, preventing infection before sexual initiation makes more sense than vaccinating people who may have already been exposed to HPV. Actually most sexually active people will contract HPV, but around 99% of the infections will not develop into chronic ones. Still they often result in anogenital warts, and in countries where HPV vaccines and screening cytology are not popular cervical cancer is frequent. <a href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000703/human_med_000805.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d124" target="_blank">Gardasil, vaccine against four types of HPV, was proved to prevent infection in women up to 45 years.</a></p></div>		</li>
