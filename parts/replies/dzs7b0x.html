			<div class="markdown"><p>Because Argentinian ants are invasive, and formed out of a few initial introduced queens, there is very little genetic diversity. So nearby colonies are not hostal to each other. Individual nests can have 15-20 queens, ants move back and forth between different nests. Combined with mild winter, the cold season die off is less.</p>
<p>There is effectively one colony that spans from San Diego to San Francisco, another that spans across most of the Serria mountains.</p></div>		</li>
