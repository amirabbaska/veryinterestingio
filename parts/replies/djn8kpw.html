			<div class="markdown"><p>Friction is an electromagnetic force, believe it or not. Even between two &quot;neutral&quot; objects, with respect to their charge, there will still be some trace levels of attraction and repulsion at the molecular level. Static friction is higher because these bonds are permitted to form between two adjacent objects at rest. The bonds will point in the direction perpendicular to the motion. When one object is moving with respect to another adjacent object, electromagnetic bonding between surface molecules is not as strong. Draw the vectors and it will become apparent. Directionally, the bonds spend very little time in the direction perpendicular to the motion. This is the direction that would maximize resistance due to friction. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert but I feel like, after sitting for a bit, the little grooves and bumps settle into each other and it becomes harder to move the object. But once it's moving the grooves don't have time to settle all the way into the floor's grooves and that results in less friction than when it was standing still. </p></div>		</li>
