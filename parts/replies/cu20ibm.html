			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as any non-Earth colonies are still reliant on communication with Earth, they'll probably use the same calendar just because making a new one and handling conversions would be a nightmare. If/when they're full independent they'll make their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably Mars will have there own and ours. You want a calendar mainly so you can predict approximately what the weather will be like. If you have earth's calendar you would have to check at what point this year winter is going to be. It's a lot easier to just go by your own. They will also should have a different amount of hours per day. </p></div>		</li>
