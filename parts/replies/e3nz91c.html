			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been on keto since mid or late May, right after my summer break started. I've been researching it for months prior and finally decided it's time to give it a try since I wasn't in school and had all summer to adapt to the change. Since I started college 4 years ago, I went from 150 or 160 to 202 (doctor weighed me in March this year so I've gained over 50 pounds... my doctor has been seeing me every 3 or 4 months because of my weight gain). I just had my 3 month check up 2 weeks ago and I went from 202 to 170, so I've lost 32 lbs in 2 months. The weight came off fast at first due to water weight and other things, it's slowed considerably to around 1 lb a week but I'm still losing. This isn't me circlejerking to keto nor am I saying it's the best diet ever and is a magic pill to losing weight, no... keto isn't magic, it' a tool to weight loss. But to your point, it most definitely is calories in calories out (CICO). I went from eating 2500-3500 or more calories per day to around 1400-1700 on keto. Eating the &quot;right&quot; foods for my &quot;diet&quot; helps with eating less calories due to eating more nutrient dense foods, or rather more filling foods. I'm hungry less now, don't binge eat, snacking happens <em>much</em> less often, and my mentality of food has shifted to rejecting snacking. I still have cravings occasionally, but it's not nearly as bad as before where I'd want to stuff my face with bread, brownies, cookies.  I'm by no means an expert so if you say there's no starvation mode, I won't disagree, but there is definitely such a thing as lack of discipline. A person has to actually try to eat right/diet/lose weight/be healthy. It takes effort, not just eating &quot;less&quot; and hoping to shed a few pounds like I was doing the 4 years before this summer. Also... lowkey bragging about my weight loss ;)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know folks who really want to lose weight and they will only use chronic calorie restriction, WW and the like.  And they struggle and suffer because those things don't work as well as other methods -- long term.  Meaning they regain easily and lose slowly.  It's hard when they're friends and I don't want to come across as a keto-evangalist...</p>
<p>The issue with the myth of 'starvation mode' is that it drive snacking and snacking is really unhealthy.  If someone is going to focus on discipline and all that, do it with fasting. Or just making it 6 hours between lunch and dinner, then dinner to breakfast at 8am without a night time snack.   Your body doesn't flip into starvation mode at 4pm, your brain sends out hormones to drive you to eat.  You  NOT eating at 3pm/4pm results in the brain STOPPING this and you are less hungry. </p>
<p>I have found it SO empowering to understand the body can fast, can not eat and be fine.  Quite fine (and even leaner haha!).  Like you said it changed my relationship to food.  It's a very tasty fuel and it's a choice to eat or not.</p></div>		</li>
