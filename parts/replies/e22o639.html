			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup and even the prices of services can vary within the same dentist. For instance you might pay $35 for a fluoride treatment and then the a year later you have to pay $50. Why? Because the first one was &quot;covered&quot; under your insurance plan. So even though you had to pay because you hadn't met your deductible you only had to pay $35 because that's the dentists contracted rate with your insurance. Now a year later you have to pay $50 because even though you still have the same insurance, the insurance only &quot;covers&quot; it once every two years instead of the dentist's recommended every year. And since it isn't covered the dentist's full rate of $50 applies. It's infuriating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. The only reason I continue paying for dental and vision coverage is because it gets us a 20&#37; discount. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is true, it doesn't really answer the question, which is about why, not what. Why don't we then have such &quot;insurance&quot; for other body parts? Why not have separate ear insurance? It would be equivalent, but that's not how it works. Hearing tests &amp; hearing aids are just part of normal insurance. Or skin insurance, for the dermatologist? Why are dentists and optometrists treated differently from other specialists that people see regularly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I tried to be brief.  Its simply because &quot;dental&quot; and &quot;Vision&quot; are not insurance, at all.  They are not to cover your loss (i.e. somehow pay for you to get better) in the event you go blind or your tooth explodes or i dont even know whatelse happens catastrophically.    The reason why its separate from your health &quot;insurance&quot; is because its not insurance, even in the slightest. I also suspect traditional health insurers avoid it since it involves a definite annual cost that would (at least most people would assume) count against your deductible/out-of-pocket thus making them less money as you sought out relatively routine care.  They could bracket it out and say it doesnt count but then they would have to open a whole new complaints department to deal with the unhappy customers. Better to just leave the different products be.    </p>
<p>The reason they as doctors are treated different than the other specialties is most likely (i say likely because i dont have evidence but it seems self apparent) that these two categories of physician practice see the highest frequency of patient visit.  If skin issues were bigger (and there were significant preventive operations within skin care besides just using sunscreen) we would probably see a skin benefit plan come up too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You don't need to pop by for ear cleaning or a throat scrape. They're treated differently because they demand more visits by their nature.</p></div>		</li>
