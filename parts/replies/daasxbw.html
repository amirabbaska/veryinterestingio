			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! I'll pivot and talk about the S&amp;P500, because it rebalances most often.</p>
<p>The SPX is an index of the top 500 publicly traded companies by market capitalization (share price X # of shares available), which makes up for a vast majority of all available stocks, value weighted (in the US.... $18+ trillion). It generally represents the top 500 US listed companies, though companies are added and dropped periodically, as the top 500 public companies change. It's maintained by a Joint Venture between Dow Jones and S&amp;P.</p>
<p>The Dow and the Nasdaq ('Daq') have similar mechanisms, though their components are not selected in a similar fashion, but the concept remains the same (though the math differs). Up until recent history, the Dow was purely NYSE listed companies though I'm fairly certain that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>Regardless, because of their respective components, the Dow and the Nasdaq tell slightly different stories. The Dow was originally 'industrial' while the Nasdaq tends to be very tech heavy, which helps explain why they sometimes move in different directions.</p>
<p>For an overall proxy of the US economy, the S&amp;P is a better indicator, and if you're interested in how small businesses are doing, the Russell 2000 is a good barometer.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they do. It's s generally based on market cap (see FTSE 100 vs FTSE 250,) companies can drop out if they decide to go private and de-list, or were acquired in a merger etc.</p></div>		</li>
