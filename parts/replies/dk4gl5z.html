			<div class="markdown"><p>What is happening is you are changing the amount of air the blades are scooping.  At low speeds, the air resistance is less, so you can take a bigger scoop to get more thrust.  As speed increases, so does resistance, but now inertia is on your side, and you can take smaller scoops.</p>
<p>The idea is that a gas or diesel engine has a fairly narrow power band where it acts at optimal efficiency.  Just like a transmission in a car, the idea is to keep the engine in its optimal RPM range.</p>

<p>Not directly, but feathering, meaning to adjust the props for least resistance, is a standard emergency procedure to improve gliding performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but from my understanding, a greater pitch to the prop would also decrease the efficiency by disturbing the air more and creating turbulence behind the prop that cuts the efficiency of the next prop that hits the disturbed air.</p>
<p>For instance, that's why more props doesn't mean better performance, because it gives less time for the air to settle as the props cut through it, and when the air is full of turbulence it lowers efficiency...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - an important thing to remember is that turbines have a fairly narrow window of efficiency, so you keep the revs fairly constant and vary the pitch. A helicopter would be a good example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The engine driving the prop has an optimal operating RPM range (for fuel efficiency, wear, operating temperature, etc.).  Adjusting prop angle allows you to adjust power output while maintaining a relatively constant RPM.  Think of it like gears in a car, except a continuous adjustment rather than discrete gears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuel efficiency and power. Engines have an optimal power band and an optimal setting for fuel efficiency. If you get set the engine at a set speed and the vary the prop angle, it works out much better. Same thing as a transmission in a car.</p></div>		</li>

<p>few blades are better, but they have to be longer to get the same effect.</p>

<p>So like a wind turbine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, just like that.</p>
<p>Wind turbines are less concerned with space and more with the structural integrity of the blades.</p></div>		</li>
