<p>The story is more complex. Audio engineers use balloon pops to characterize a room because inside of an impulse wave is every frequency contained. A balloon pop is the sound of every sound at once. </p>
<p>This &quot;use an impulse and listen to the response&quot; style of probe is how active submarine radar works, how MRI's look inside your body (hence the BANG! sound they make), it's how bats hunt, etc. </p>
<p>By sending a pulse out, you get to hear back what frequencies are reflected, as well as the timing of when each one returns. All that information can be used to recreate the physical nature of the system you are observing.</p>
<p>In electrical engineering, we use this property extensively to characterize electrical systems using an electrical impulse in both micro and mega scales. In the micro world, we use a TDR to look inside of tiny circuitry and learn about the capacitative or inductive nature of it. In the mega world, we send a pulse down a transmission wire to learn where the breakage is that is causing your power outage.</p>
<p>Close your eyes and clap your hands and you can learn about the size of the room you are in without even looking around.</p>
<p>So now you know that an impulse in the time dimension contains all frequencies in the harmonic dimension. But what then is an impulse in the frequency dimension?</p>
<p>Well, if an impulse in time contains all frequencies, does perhaps an impulse in frequency contain all time? Yes! A frequency is an oscillation over time, so by definition, an impulse of frequency is sustaining. </p>
<p>Do we have an example of this? Of course! Look at all the colors around you. They don't seem to degrade much. That's because a color is an effect of electrons which are vibrating at a certain frequency and absorbing light of that frequency.</p>
<p>But I digress...</p>
<p>I would argue that the reason a balloon sounds loud to your brain could very well be in part due to it containing so many different frequencies within its impulse.</p>
<p>edit: <del>I was wrong on how MRI's work. This is how: Big magnet aligns the protons. Then, the radio transmitter beams an intense burst of radio waves into the patient to excite the wobbling protons; and the receiver detects the protons' faint radio signal. So while the BANG is not related to the imaging (but rather the coils), the imaging is still in fact produced by a series of radio-transmitted impulses.</del></p>
<p>edit2: Turns out I was right about the BANG of an MRI being an impulse connected to the imaging process of an MRI. There are gradient coils which use pulses to perturb the strong magnetic field. These coils need a current with a high slew-rate. The high slew-rate is what causes the bang. So it's connected. The BANG is part of an impulse of which the resulting perturbance is imaged. You can read about this under the Gradients section of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_of_magnetic_resonance_imaging#Gradients" target="_blank">Physics of magnetic resonnace imaging</a></p>
<p>edit3: For people who think Frequency has nothing to do with loudness, see the Equal-loudness contour <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour" target="_blank">here</a>, and also note that the figure-ground process is (probably) disturbed during stimulus shock.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Um, no. You aren't really wrong on the sonar/echolocation part but that is absolutely 100% wrong on MRIs. MRIs have nothing to do with using noise to image. The noise is from the magnetic field inducing a force in the coils that produce it. This force causes the coils to expand and contract slightly. It's this expansion that causes the banging noise you hear.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/question-month-how-does-mri-work-and-why-it-so-noisy-98" target="_blank">http://www.caltech.edu/news/question-month-how-does-mri-work-and-why-it-so-noisy-98</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An MRI is noisy because its magnetic field is created by running electrical current through a coiled wireâ€”an electromagnet. When the current is switched on, there is an outward force all along the coil. And because the magnetic field is so strong, the force on the coil is very large.</p>
<p>When the current is switched on, the force on the coil goes from zero to huge in just milliseconds, causing the coil to expand slightly, which makes a loud &quot;click.&quot; When the MRI is making an image, the current is switched on and off rapidly. The result is a rapid-fire clicking noise, which is amplified by the enclosed space in which the patient lies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultrasounds, however, do work on the same principal as sonar and echolocation.</p></div>		</li>

That's it, the mosquito make the air vibrate, which is what your ear receive. They figured out that, if I recall correctly, that the eardrum will move by about half an atom in width...</p>
<p>Now, imagine what this compressed vessel will do to the air when it rip out, and that fast! Imagine if you can hear that wings beating the air, what that much air movement do!</p></div>		</li>

<li>Because like some other senses, hearing is logarithmic. 10 mosquitos don't sound 10 times louder than 1 mosquito. </li>
<li>It's extremely easy to hide a sound with other noise (and wind).</li>
<li>The inverse cube law means that for every small amount of distance away you are from the sound source it gets considerably quieter. (For example a campfire a meter away from you lights up everything around you, but one 100m away is just a dot)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about signal to noise ratio.</p>
<p>Imagine if you drew a straight line. That's dead silence.</p>
<p>Then draw a tiny blip in that line. That's a tiny amplitude, but the signal is strong relative to the noise.</p>
<p>Then draw a noisy line with a lot of spikes and troughs; lots of zig zags in it.</p>
<p>Now imagine overlaying the tiny blip into that spiky line. Probably won't be able to see it; and you definetly wouldn't if you didn't know it was there.</p>
<p>Background noise is typically in the 40-60dB range; just stuff like machine noise (fridge, lights, computers, fans, etc), and external traffic noise is enough to wash out a lot of the quieter sounds.</p>
<p>And your brain will do the other bit which is it'll get used to hearing the background sound and just ignore it. In fact, we generally prefer some level of background noise to none; because our own body can be readily heard if it gets quiet enough (heart beats, neural noise, etc).</p></div>		</li>

The â€˜informationâ€™ that the balloon has popped would travel at the sonic velocity though. I.e. if the break is at point A,  point B will begin recoiling at time (the distance between A and B)/(sonic velocity of latex) later </p>
