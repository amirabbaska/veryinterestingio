			<div class="markdown"><p>The orbit shrinks due to drag, but the reboosts from visiting spacecraft put it back on course.
The end date is nothing to do with the orbit, it's to do with the age/cost/politics of the station.</p>
<p>Some of the hardware on station is very old and the cost of maintaining it (replacement parts, engineers on the ground, astronaut time) will reach a point where completely replacing modules would become cheaper. Also, NASA is hoping that commercial aerospace can take over provisioning an on orbit lab; either by selling them the ISS or having them replace it outright (since those maintenance costs will be burdensome). The problem with a station owned and run by governments is that the commercial sector can't compete against it. Putting an end date on the ISS lets companies know when they will be needed and solves the chicken and egg scenario where they won't invest unless they know when there will be a free market.</p>
<p>Of course this is a complicated situation since NASA also has to work out a plan with all the partner organisations in the ISS project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The end date is when we either stop funding it, or decide it is unsafe to keep occupying it.</p>
<p>The orbit slowly shrinks, then we reboost it, then it slowly shrinks, then, we reboost, etc. Eventually the station will run out of fuel, unless we launch a resupply mission (food and such will also run out eventually too). Each launch costs hundreds of millions of dollars, and we need one every couple months to cycle crew. </p>
<p>The ISS is a very valuable scientific tool, because it is impossible for us to have a zero g lab on earth, so if we want to know how anything operates in zero g, there is only one place to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't being in orbit on the ISS not quite zero g? I remember reading that there is technically gravity and you're constantly being pulled towards earth.</p>
<p>Edit: Found <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-microgravity-58.html" target="_blank">this</a> and it helped explain it a bit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not much of an issue really because the station can be boosted. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler_ATV#ISS_altitude_Increase" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler_ATV#ISS_altitude_Increase</a></p>
<p>End of life is more of an issue with modules getting old and material failure.</p></div>		</li>
