			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very odd, when i was younger, like from as early as I  can remember till i was about 17, i would occasionally wake up with my one arm or the other wedged at some awkward angle under my body or head, so drained of blood I could not use it.  Like pick my arm up with my other hand and not even feel it, it was just dead, couldn't move.  Few minutes later it would start to come back to life, but no pins and needles, thats just nerves, this was blood coming back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yer i have definitely had this multiple times and have scared the absolute crap out of myself due to the 'dead arm' against my body feeling like someone else is in my bed touching me. Such an unnerving feeling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do that too occasionally. It's so weird realizing just how heavy an arm is and that you can move it with minimal thought normally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to be persnickety, but the four stages merely describe the depth of tissue affected. Unstageable isn’t the term of the last stage, it’s just what you revert to when staging can’t be ascertained without surgical debridement because of occluding slough/dead tissue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, yeah I guess. That users correction is super common IRL, like if someone says the stage is unstageable you will 100% get a chime in that's like &quot;that's not a stage&quot; but it's like <em>you know what I meant</em>, but i totally should've explained for this subreddit. Side note though that you may find interesting- was just with someone telling me that they were taking care of a someone that had suddenly lost the ability to walk, and they were sitting in a chair unable to move for severallllll days. The wound showed bone at the end!!!!!! OK. That is all. </p></div>		</li>
