			<div class="markdown"><p>Buy a herbicide called Tordon RTU.  Take a hatchet and girdle or gash the tree all the way around and apply the herbicide to the open bark.  The tree absorbs it and it will rapidly kill the entire root system of the tree.  Cut the Tordon with diesel fuel, it acts as a surfactant, or put the Tordon in a spray bottle</p>
<p>Watch the weather you'll want it to sit on the tree for at least six hours before any rain can wash it off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah i know all about tordon.  Thanks for mentioning it though.  It does fit this comment perfectly. Its basically the only thing that works.  I should have mentioned it.  I grew up on a farm with pastures for cattle and spent many summer days clearing young trees and spraying with tordon.  Still use it now on the little cottonwoods that spring up in my yard.</p></div>		</li>
