			<div class="markdown"><p>It's about sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat. You know that feeling you get when you're in an unknown situation, and you have no idea what the right answer is or even what direction to start in? That's science, all day, every day.</p>
<p>There are no known answers, so you have to work really hard to find them.</p>
<p>At some point you look to your advisor for an answer, and they say &quot;I dunno. That's why I hired you - to figure it out, and tell me.&quot; And then it hits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You beautifully summed up the feelings I had in graduate school!! Thank you :) </p>
<p>That moment where I realized that I was actually the one responsible for answering the questions was a crazy one. I realized... wait... this isn’t an assignment. This is what I’m doing, I’m answering the question!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a CMM programmer, which is to say, I'm really just a metrologist that can program. We run into this all the time studying measurement systems. Let's just say, it's really hard to get the same exact number over and over, and we don't know exactly why in each case. (talking microns)  </p>
<p>I hope you see this and can respond.</p></div>		</li>
