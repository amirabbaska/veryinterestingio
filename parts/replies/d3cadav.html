			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even <em>more</em> important in pancakes, which is why most recipes say &quot;they will be lumpy&quot; to discourage over mixing/forming gluten. A good rule of thumb is 10 seconds of wisking and WALK AWAY. You will be tempted to work all the dry team in, but a little clumping won't hurt nearly as much as sticky stretchy gluton.</p></div>		</li>
