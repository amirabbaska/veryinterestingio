			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot wrong with this.</p>
<p>Gin is not fermented from juniper berries.</p>
<p>Liquor is made through distillation.  Brandy is not fermented from wine. Wine is fermented from grapes. Brandy can be distilled from wine.</p>
<p>Also, most of these are fermented and distilled in non-reactive containers.  They are then aged in barrels which affects flavor.</p>
<p>These things affect flavor but not the kind of alcohol produced, which is all ethyl.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just a heads up, gin is not made from fermenting juniper berries. It's actually essentially juniper berry flavored vodka.</p></div>		</li>
