			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your explanation, those receptors you mention can vary between people. For example, most people are trichromat (3-colour) but some women are tetrachromat (4-colour). The fourth cone in their case has a slight mutation on the opsin gene that controls absorption (inherited via the X chromosome so only women inherit it). Different animals have different receptors, so each animal will see the world a bit differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good post.  I find it amazing how Yellow is only one very narrow, almost exact frequency.  Move a tad one way and you have a very diluted orange.  Move a tad the other way and by God its a bit green. Yellow is 597 to 577 nm, tiny compared to other coulours. </p></div>		</li>
