<p>The result of a vector cross product is a pseudovector; the direction of the result is dependent on if you make the arbitrary choice of using a left or right-handed coordinate system. Since nature doesn't care about our arbitrary choices, psuedovectors aren't directly observable.</p>
<p>Since the B field is the result of a vector cross product, it's actually a pseudovector field, and so isn't directly observable. What you can observe is the force due to the field, which is calculated by taking another cross product. Taking a cross product of a vector with a pseudovector produces a vector, so the resulting force vector is indeed a vector which is directly observable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP might be more interested to learn about CP symmetry and processes that violate it. I'm on my phone, so maybe someone else can fill in some details.</p>
<p>Long story short, considering charge and parity together is a more fundamental symmetry than parity. That's what physicists are actually interested in measuring.</p></div>		</li>
