			<div class="markdown"><p>In special relativity the kinetic energy of a particle increases as (mc^(2)) / sqrt(1 - v^(2)/c^(2)). That equation can look a little intimidating, but the key point is that as the velocity approaches the speed of light, the kinetic energy diverges to infinity. Thus, anything with mass can never reach the speed of light.</p>
<p>Objects without mass do not have infinite energy. The above equation becomes 0/0, which is indeterminate, so a different equation must be used to determine energy. Specifically, the equation becomes E = pc, where p is momentum. Why do objects have momentum if they don’t have mass? That is one of the predictions of special relativity that turns out to be correct.</p>
<p>The result of the above equation for massless particles is that all massless particles must travel at exactly c, no more and no less.</p>
<p>As a result, the current physical understanding is that nothing can ever travel faster than the speed of light, ever. There is no trick to get around the speed of light.</p>
<p>(Okay, there are things involving bending time and space using wormholes, but that is the shape of space changing to change the distance between different points in space. All the particles involved are still limited by light speed.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We cant break the rule.</p>
<p>The short version is that while we humans perceive space and time to be two different things, there are in fact the same thing, spacetime.</p>
<p>Everything moves through spacetime at the same rate, c. No exceptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the last 100ish years there have been a ton of experiments, at very tiny and absurdly large scales, that show C to be a constant.</p>
<p>But you never really <em>prove</em> something can never happen in the future, you can just say how surprised you’d be if it did, and how many textbooks would need to be changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where did the idea come first though?</p>
<p>From experiments? We do 100 experiments, all show the same speed. Therefore we assume speed is constant and incorporate this into future theories.</p>
<p>Or from theory? We realized that our calculations work only if speed of light is constant. Things make sense only if c is constant. Let's test this with experiments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What we can do, though it's observe back through time to virtually the dawn of the universe. Nothing observed by astronomers, no matter how far away (and thus back in time) shows any variation in the fundamental constants of the universe. If c had changed, other properties of the universe would also have changed, and the early universe would have looked very different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, M+M didn't prove c was a constant, but they <em>did</em> prove that the then accepted theory was wrong.</p>
<p>Galilean composition of speeds predicted c would vary with motion, Maxwells equations predicted it was constant. Physicists came up with aether to reconcile the two theories, and then M+M proved that this reconciliation was wrong. Then Einstein proved that Maxwell was right and Galilean motion wasn't valid for light.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Just to be clear, what we refer to as the speed of light is the speed of light <em>in a vacuum</em>; in other mediums, such as ice or water or other substances, the speed of light is different (slower).</p></div>		</li>
