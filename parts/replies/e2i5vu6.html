			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the study: <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/06/296343" target="_blank">Large and fast human pyramidal neurons associate with intelligence</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/BqzfITl.png" target="_blank">Figure 3: IQ scores positively correlate with dendritic structure of temporal cortical pyramidal cells</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/9x2jwGX.png" target="_blank">Figure 5: Higher IQ scores associate with faster AP initiation</a></p>
<p>Is it convincing? Eh, not terribly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems a bit simplistic. Cells also increase in size as well as activity rates during periods of aging, or neurodegenerative disease, just before they start to die off. Obviously that's associated with cognitive decline rather than increased cognitive skill, and presumably that's something the authors of such studies would try to control for. But it shows why we should be careful with reporting on these findings, if it were as simple as bigger cells/brains = higher IQ, then brain swelling or early stage Alzheimer's disease should have a positive correlation with IQ.</p></div>		</li>
