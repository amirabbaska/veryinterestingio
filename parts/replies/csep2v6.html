			<div class="markdown"><p>In that case the first limitation will stand.</p>
<p>In order to breathe you have to compensate the pressure of the fluid around your chest. When your chest is below 1 m of water, you need to compensate 0.1 atmosphere (water pressure is about 1 atm per 10 m). Diaphragm is just not strong enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried this a few months ago. The size and diameter of the pipe is irrelevant, even at a half metre its near impossible to breath in. Your lungs just don't have the strength to inflate. It's like trying to blow up a balloon by stretching it from the outside and letting the air rush in.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely crazy! I don't doubt this but it's just blowing my mind to think that only a few feet of water would make it near impossible to expand your rib cage. We (humans) just got even more fragile than I knew we were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly how your lungs work, actually.  Your diaphragm gives them room to expand, but it doesn't pump air in.  If there's a pressure on your chest exceeding your lungs ability to expand, then you can't breathe in.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>People can definitely do this under 1.6 feet of water.  I've done it in an above ground pool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would your exhalation really clog the tube?</p>
<p>If you are exhaling at high pressure it seems like it would want to escape the tube and circulate air in the process.  I mean you're screwed either way, but I feel like you're get a decent amount of oxygen  mixing into the tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't clog the tube, but CO2 diffusion isn't particularely fast, meaning that you constantly breathe in air enriched with CO2. Excess CO2 in the air you breathe in leads to all kinds of nasty things, including death and things that can cause death if they happen to you if you're under water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on the width of the tube, with a 2m tube about 1/3 would be exhalation, but if the tube is slightly wider, say about 3.5, then it would totally fill the tube.  The hight velocity would probably blow whatever is at the top of the tube out, but co2 sinks, so you would probably keep getting breath after breath of co2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's good you didn't get more creative.</p>
<p>True story (recorded in textbooks if you want to look):  A set of kids playing in an approximately 8 foot deep backyard pool decided to &quot;dive&quot; using a heavily weighted 5 gallon bucket.  They weighted it until it would sink to the bottom of the pool while full of air.  They then took turns diving to the bottom, sticking their heads in the bucket and breathing, thus staying underwater for several minutes at a time.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that sinking the bucket to the bottom of the pool caused the air in the bucket to compress (physics, the ideal gas law) according to the depth of the pool.  This decreased the volume of air and also increased oxygen concentration, so it wasn't a problem to get enough oxygen for the kids.</p>
<p>Everything was fine until one of them held his breath while coming up.  Divers know never to do this, because SCUBA tanks and regulators produce air at ambient underwater pressure, meaning at 33 feet underwater you will have twice the number of molecules of air in your lungs as you would at the surface.</p>
<p>If a diver holds their breath while ascending even a short distance, the reduced water pressure causes the air to expand with no where to go, which results in a pulmonary air embolism (popped lung) which can be fatal.</p>
<p>This is what happened to one of the kids, unfortunately.  He held his breath coming up after filling his lungs from the bucket.  The bucket air was naturally compressed by being at the bottom of the pool and as he ascended it expanded in his lungs and caused a fatal embolism.</p>
<p>Incidentally, divers are told to always breathe normally underwater, and never hold their breath.  This is because without a great deal of experience or some kind of solid object or rope anchored to the bottom (not to a boat) to hold on to a diver can quickly change depth without noticing enough to cause a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually knew about the compressed air issue, and that diving with it was dangerous, and my know-it-all-13-yr-old-self decided that this was &quot;safer&quot; :/</p>
<p>I should recant a bit on depth, I remember being able to inhale at great strength at the depth of the hose, but I used it more as an way to never resurface.  Most of the time I would go up until it was easy enough and then use it to inhale.</p></div>		</li>
