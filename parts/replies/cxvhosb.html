			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it depends on the rate of warming created by geothermal activity. The amount of heat lost to space by a planet is relatively small, so there would just need to be a balance between the two. </p>
<p>Remember also that you don't &quot;need&quot; a sky, a lot of volcanic activity could have a dual effect of localised warming currents and a global greenhouse effect. Not quite as effective when there's no sunlight to capture, but it would help contain heat and capture any light that there may be from a distant sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GHG's work on earth by trapping solar thermal radiation that would otherwise be reflected back into space. I'm not sure how much of an impact they would have on thermal radiation originating in a planet's core, although I would guess that GHG's also trap thermal radiation being emitted by the planet. They are not self warming though, so you would still need a gradient from the center out as /u/BeardySam is saying.</p></div>		</li>
