			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the most common thing people experience.  When there aren't noticeable other sounds to focus on and stimulate the hearing center(s) of your brain, the (seemingly) total absence of certain frequencies makes your brain trick itself into hearing them. It doesn't sound like you have what might be considered full-blown tinnitus, but probably the early stages of it. If it bothers you to the point where thinking in quiet and/or sleeping in quiet become difficult, having a small fan or noise generator can make a world of difference. Those wave/rain sound machines (also available through free smartphone apps) or white noise generators do a good job to providing enough aural stimulation to keep your mind from dwelling on the missing frequencies.</p>
<p>Just showed this to my wife, who added that there are some environmental triggers that can make it worse, such as things you eat (high sodium, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, artificial sweeteners), dehydration, some OTC drugs, and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>She also reiterated something I said elsewhere that getting your hearing tested by an audiologist is the best place to start. The audiologist can also do a tinnitus assessment to determine a number of things that can help you manage it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keeping in mind that correlation is not causation, I first experienced the tinnitus I have now when I was using in-the-ear noise cancelling ear buds. The sudden silence when the unit was switched on was complete. I wonder if this equates with that “(near) total lack of stimulation from the (auditory) nerve,” leading my brain to create the tinnitus noise as a panic reaction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah- you basically created the same effect artificially. You're right that &quot;dead hair cell&quot; is not <em>the</em> cause, but rather <em>a</em> cause of the actual cause. (Fortunately, this is ELI5, not AskScience =) .) The actual cause is your brain not getting signal when it thinks it should be hearing <em>something</em>, so you &quot;hear&quot; what your brain thinks it should. &quot;Dead hair cell&quot; <em>is</em>, however, the most common cause of tinnitus, especially for folks who are in their later years of life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. But if I’d had it before the noise cancelling earbuds it was never to the level of being conscious about it all the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont have hearing loss, I've had it since I was a kid or even before. My whole family except for my dad has it, and my mum's family had it too. I also get it constantly, even right now it's quite bad but there is lots of noise around me. </p>
<p>Edit: Why the downvote? Does this not contribute to the discussion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there are different types of tinnitus, like there are different types of diabetes. Same (or similar, anyway) net result, but different causes. The type I described is by far the most common. I do not know enough about the other types to speak about them from anywhere but out of my ass. =)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never bothered to research it to be honest. I guess it can be genetic in some sense. Don't know if it's related, but by brother is almost completely deaf in one ear, and my sister has also gone death in one ear due to the bones fusing? I don't have anything other than the tinnitus. </p></div>		</li>
