<p>and arrived within a few seconds of each other.</p>

<p>Is there an explanation for the difference? Why not at exactly the same time?</p>
<p>I understand that a few seconds difference for a journey of 130 mil years is amazing. But still, was the just the matter of precision in the experiment? Or because photons were absorbed and re-emitted on the way enough times to add this lag? Or was there something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The photons were not emitted at the same time (and location) as the gravitational waves. The theory on exactly how and where the gamma rays are produced after the merger event is not complete yet, but all reasonable ideas suggest that the photons were emitted at later times than the gravitational waves, from material that was originally ejected from the merger event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gravitational waves are created by the neutron stars tightly orbiting near each other.</p>
<p>The gamma rays are created by the neutron stars impacting each other.</p>
<p>So they're basically measuring different things. It's like hearing screeching tires and then seeing an explosion and concluding there was a car crash. You should expect to observe the two phenomena at different times because they happen at different times.</p></div>		</li>

I have never seen a car explode upon impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting theory. Light bends when space-time is warped (gravitational wells, etc.), so I could see its journey being longer than you'd expect from its line-of-sight distance if it had to bend around massive objects to get here. Do gravitational waves do that as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats simply amazing , so they actually do travel at the same speed of light , not 99% but exactly c ..
That's marvellous !</p>
<p>Thanks guys happy xmas!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is no coincidence, which is arguably more marvelous, in my opinion. &quot;Speed of light&quot; is a rather misleading name for c, because light is not the only thing that travels at this speed. In fact, anything that does not have mass travels at this speed, so it is commonly said that a more accurate name is &quot;the speed of massless particles,&quot; which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>photons (light)  </li>
<li>gravitons, hypothesized but not-yet-observed gravity carrier particle  </li>
<li>gluons, carriers of the strong nuclear force</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive seen c described as &quot;the speed of causality.&quot; Even in delayed-action quantum eraser experiments, even if it is unknown that the path of the data will be observed, information obtained by the presence or absence of superposition interference does not predict the future, ie. weather or not recorded path data is observed, since both events are within the &quot;light cone&quot; of causality. </p>
<p>Its a bit like arguing that quantum entanglement can transmit information faster than light. It can, but in order to know the entangled states, they have to start off in the same place, then they are separated at conventional speeds. Even though the information about one while observing the other is instantly known, the pair are still well within the light cone of causality, which widens over time at the fastest possible speed that they could be separated, c. So everything (we know exists) is bound to remain at or below the speed of light according to an observer's reference frame.</p>
<p>This is just a humble chemist's interpretation of some of the weirder things I recall reading at some point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this part of why particles with mass can't travel faster than the speed of light?</p>
<p>If they did, they'd outrun their own gravity waves, which seems a bit absurd. </p>
<p>As a particle with mass approaches the speed of light, do the gravity waves in front of the direction of travel start to build up, similar to how sound waves build up on front of a supersonic jet? </p></div>		</li>
