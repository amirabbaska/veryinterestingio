			<div class="markdown"><p>The term that the first three comments here are looking for is <em>acoustic impedance mismatch</em>. Acoustic impedance changes with the density (also molecular structure) of the medium a sound wave is traveling through. Sound is a compression wave carried by the molecules forming the substance of the medium that it is traveling through, so naturally, denser mediums have less attenuation (loss of sound over distance traveled) because the odds that the energy will be transferred to the next molecule in the substance is greater. (There  are some more complicated things going on here so don't rip me a new one. I'm trying to keep it simple.)</p>
<p>When two substances have very different acoustic impedance values, nearly 100% of the sound will reflect off the interface between these two substances. A gas to a liquid or solid will be enough to do this. That is why sounds from above the water are so muffled under the water and why you need jelly on the belly to get an ultrasound.</p>
<p>Also, our ears are shit for hearing under water by evolutionary design and trap more air in the ear canal creating another interface with a high acoustic impedance mismatch.</p></div>		</li>
