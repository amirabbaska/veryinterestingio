			<div class="markdown"><p>No one owns the entire internet, though some entities have a lot of power over local regions of the internet. For example, Internet service providers act as a central point where smaller networks like your house connect to before communicating with the rest of the world. They can cut, throttle, speedup your connection at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you do not have the backbone network of an internet service provider. I work for one of the Tier 1 ISPs in the United States and even when traffic originates from one of our customers there is a good chance that it will go over another ISPs network if that would be the best route for the traffic. In data centers, you will find something referred to as a meet me room. This is a room where peering happens between large network providers and that will allow traffic to route to other networks. Without this, you would only be able to visit places on your ISP's network and only through their network path. So if you wanted to pass traffic from Atlanta to Los Angeles but you have a network provider that only had a network going from Atlanta to Dallas to Minneapolis to Seattle to Denver to Los Angeles, that is the path your network traffic would take. It is not a realistic scenario but I think it helps understand why you cannot just use your own network. Instead your traffic might go to Dallas where through peering with another ISP it goes to Phoenix and from there it could go over another ISP to Los Angeles. It essentially allows the traffic to go more places and to take better paths to the same places. Very basic overview but I hope it helps you understand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it's better to think about it like you're &quot;choosing&quot; to peer with your ISP. Most of the time you probably don't have a choice but it's a similar idea to what your ISP would do with another network. You take your isolated home network and connect it up to their network of routers/gateways/etc so you can then talk to any other network they can route to. The protocols and procedures to connect your home network to their network aren't really the same as what they would use to connect to, say, another ISP, but the idea is the same.</p>
<p>ICANN probably has the most control over the internet of any org I'd say. Since they get to determine IP addressing and whatnot, though how much that really matters I'm not sure. Most of my knowledge is theoretical and the extent of what I do with networking at work is configuring devices on our intranet.</p></div>		</li>
