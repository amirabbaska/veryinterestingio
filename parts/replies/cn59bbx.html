			<div class="markdown"><p>So the simple metric, disregarding pedigree collapse, would be approximately 20 years per generation, giving 10000 / 20 = 500 hops for a 10,000 year ancestor.  Is that about right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's pretty clearly a set of genes that all inbreeding populations of people autocthonous to Korea got that people in Norway didn't get that people in Senegal didn't get, which has allowed all three in turn to look quite distinct from one another, and quite similar within one another's respective groups.  </p>
<p>Surely something similar happens on the level of whether Bob's children with Susuan and then his children's children resemble him more than his brother Carl's children with Mary and <em>their</em> children's children resemble <em>him</em> more.  </p></div>		</li>
