			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why there are two sets of &quot;primary colors&quot;. For things that emit light like a computer screen (adding color together), they are red, green and blue. For things that reflect light like paint (subtracting some colors from white), they are yellow, cyan and magenta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets really fun when you have to mix emitted and reflected light. Straight RGB LED lights will be able to trick the eye when looking straight at them, but when reflected off a complex object the object often looks really bad. High end adjustable color fixtures (like the kind used in TV and Theatre settings) use more than just RGB LEDs to smooth out the spectrum, using as many as 7 different color of LEDs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They each essentially absorb one of the additive primary colors. Cyan absorbs red and reflects the rest, yellow absorbs blue, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since no one else has mentioned it, the primary colors you are maybe most familiar with (blue,yellow,red) act very similarly to cyan, yellow and magenta as subtractive primaries when mixed as pigments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Primary colours are essentially arbitrary. In the case of cyan, magenta and yellow, it's because we can make cheap, vivid inks in those colours which can be mixed to show a wide gamut of color. In the case of red, green and blue, it's because those colors closely match the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell#/media/File:1416_Color_Sensitivity.jpg" target="_blank">peak sensitivity of the photoreceptors in our eyes</a>.</p>
<p>You can't actually represent all colors using just the &quot;primary&quot; colors. Some specialised printing processes use <a href="http://www.i-i.com/new-technologies-in-a-printing-world-extended-gamut-printing/" target="_blank">extra ink colors</a> to produce more vivid reds and greens than would be possible with CMYK. Some Sharp-brand TVs have an <a href="http://www.sharp-world.com/aquos/en/product/4_color_innovation.html" target="_blank">extra yellow subpixel</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, one of the reasons we use lasers is because they emit very specific wavelengths (colors) of light. Many sources (light bulbs, the sun) emit light with a very broad spectrum (imagine a very wide bell curve*). Lasers, however, emit in a very narrow spectrum, which can for many purposes be treated as a single color.</p>
<p>*to be clear, the emission spectrum of most (all?) emitters is not shaped like a bell curve. Just using it as a common example of a distribution with a broad peak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually emitters emit light (or rather EM energy across the whole spectrum) in the shape of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck's_law" target="_blank">Planck distribution</a>, which mainly depends on the temperature of the emitting body - the somewhat counterintuitively called &quot;black body radiation&quot;. Funny enough, Planck postulated the existence of energy quanta mainly as a weird mathematical gimmick to explain the curve.</p>
<p>There are situations where EM radiation (like the light) has different sources, like supernovae, or lasers. Or it passes through materials that absorb specific frequencies, so it has narrow gaps. The sun and traditional lightbulbs give the black body spectrum (lightbulbs being much cooler than the sun, a large part of their energy is in infrared so not visible). LEDs or lasers get their light from atomic phenomena with very specific energy, so most of it is focused around a particular frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You already got an answer about thermal radiators, AKA black-bodies,  but no one told you about lasers. Generally things like an ideal laser has what's called a Lorentzian lineshape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rpetre gave a great description of emitters and black body radiation. If you google black body radiation, you'll find some great images of the shape of the (idealized) spectra. </p>
<p>A big part of the science of spectroscopy is the measurement of the shape of a spectra which (depending on what you're looking for) can tell you interesting things about what is emitting or interacting with the light. </p></div>		</li>
