			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on a Therapeutic Hypothermia medical device where we could drop core temperature in 8 minutes by squirting several liters of very cold Saline directly onto the intestines via Trocar access to the abdominal cavity.</p>
<p>Then we would maintain temperatures via recirculation with heating and cooling as necessary.</p>
<p>The body is very good at resisting core temperature changes from <em>external</em> sources :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the rate of heat transfer from your extremities is what you feel as cold.  If you touch a block of wood, and a piece of metal that are both at room temperature, the metal will feel cooler because you are transferring more heat to the metal.  That is because the metal has a higher thermal conductivity factor than the wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't temperature we sense; it's heat (the flow of thermal energy).</p>
<p>Think of temperature as the <em>potential</em>, and heat as the energy that's actually flowing about. Two different temperature bodies in thermal contact will allow thermal energy (heat) to flow to the colder body. An electronics analogy would be temperature is like voltage, and heat is like current. </p>
<p>Your body's metabolism will produce heat constantly. There will always be a gradient so that we can dump heat into the environment at the right rate. It's the changes in rates of heat flow that we're able to sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love that analogy. Very easy for people to confuse the two terms; it's important to know that heat is a path function (meaning it depends on the path you take from the initial to final states) and temperature is a state function (depends on the state of the value, not on how that value was achieved).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have nerves that activate in certain temperature ranges. So if it is cold, nerves that are activated in that cold temperature's range would be active and send signals to the brain. Temperatures outside of that region cause less activity.</p>
<p>Its also worth noting that nerves will be more active during temperature changes. So if for example, a nerve is active at ambient temperatures of say 0 - 10C, when you step out into the cold from inside where it is nice and warm, that nerve would be very active. After a short period of time the nerve would become less active, but would continue to send signals saying that it is cold. </p>
<p>Hope that all makes sense. </p></div>		</li>
