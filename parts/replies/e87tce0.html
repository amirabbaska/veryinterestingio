			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong, and wrong.</p>
<p>Sashimi is made safe to eat raw by freezing, because fish parasites and worms can be killed that way.</p>
<p>You could flash freeze rainbow trout or bass or catfish and make sashimi out of them totally safe.</p>
<p>There is just no market for it.</p></div>		</li>
