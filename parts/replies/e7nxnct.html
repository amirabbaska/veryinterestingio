<p>Now something in technology like a phone or game, something with real intellectual property, that could be kept secret for competitive reasons.  But for car exterior design, no one cares.  What's Ford going to do if they know that the Corvette next year is coming out with three bumps on its hood instead of two?  GM just doesn't want <strong>anyone</strong> to know about it because they want a grand reveal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in the automotive industry and have been around pre-production and camouflaged cars for about 15 years now, so I was just speaking from personal experience.</p>
<p>This isn't an original question.   Here's an article from <a href="https://jalopnik.com/why-do-automakers-camouflage-pre-production-cars-1722233122" target="_blank">Jalopnik</a> on the subject.  Their two stated reasons are: </p>
<p>&quot;REASON NUMBER ONE FOR USING CAMOUFLAGE: Test cars are often not fully finished, and automakers don’t want you to see them in their pre-production stages.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;REASON NUMBER TWO FOR USING CAMOUFLAGE: What you want people to do, instead, is see camouflaged photos of the [car] so they get all these assumptions in their mind about what it might look like. Then they invest six months in waiting for it to come out. Then a year. By the time the production car is revealed, they’ve spent 18 months waiting for the thing.&quot; (i.e. Hype Machine)</p>
<p>And their addendum: &quot;Well, this, and the fact that all automotive test cars, before they are camouflaged, are the color of a tennis ball.&quot;   That last one ties in with the first one.  Unless it's getting <strong>really</strong> close to launch, the body in whites that they use are not finished, not painted shiny nice-looking vehicles.   The front bumper might not be finished yet, it might be missing roof rails, they don't have all their door and body panel gaps worked out.  The cars look like garbage.</p></div>		</li>
