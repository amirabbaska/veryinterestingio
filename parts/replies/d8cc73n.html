			<div class="markdown"><p>On a geologic perspective they will almost certainly fluctuate with time with the geologic activity of the planet (formation and subduction of ocean basins). But these changes would be over millions of years, so it would likely seem unchanged from our perspective. Other aspects of the environment are changing much faster compared to this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't sodium needed by every living being?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly in more complex organism such as animals and fish where its used in muscle cells, nervous systems, and osmotic regulation. But most of the biological production in the ocean is from single celled plants.</p>
<p>It is certainly possible sodium may play some small role in the biological function of these creatures. But relative to the other elements in seawater it is hardly anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude. Sodium is super important for prokaryotes too. At a minimum, they use sodium pumps to regulate their membrane potential, create ATP, and maintain osmolarity. All things that eukaryotes do too, they just do it slightly differently because they don't really have organelles. </p></div>		</li>
