			<div class="markdown"><p>OP: Note that the second example is lossy compression. It's compression that takes away <em>some</em> data that it deems unnecessary. For another example: </p>
<p>Say you have these graph values: 1,4,4,3,4,2,9,8,9,8,4,5</p>
<p>This wouldn't compress well with lossless compression: <code>1(1), 2(4), 1(3), 1(4), 1(2), 1(9), 1(8), 1(9), 1(8), 1(4), 1(5)</code>. This is longer than the original content. No good.</p>
<p>But when using lossy compression, you can decide to average out any data that doesn't vary by more than 1, <strong>for example</strong>.</p>
<p>You end up with: 1,4,4,(4),4,2,9,(9),9,(9),4,(4) - values in brackets have been averaged out. This string of numbers would print out a graph that's basically ALMOST the same as the original, and while not exactly the same it now allows us to much more neatly compress to: <code>1(1), 4(4), 1(2), 4(9), 2(4)</code>.</p></div>		</li>
