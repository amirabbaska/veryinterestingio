			<div class="markdown"><p>I also understand that cold (for some reason) mask sweetness, which is why ice cream tastes sweeter when it melts to room temperature. So you are comparing hot coffee with an iced beverage.</p>
<p>Some quick research suggests that a common North-American sugar packet is in the ballpark of 3-4 grams of white sugar, so three packets is 9-12 grams of sugar, so this would be notably less than the 30-some grams in a bottled drink. Question for those in the know: for the purposes of sweetness in this case, is all sugar equally sweet by weight? I know there are different types of sugars (glucose, fructose being common examples) - just curious if there is any possible discrepancy based on type of sugar.</p>
<p>Edit: Having googled Lactose-free milk for another reply (lactose being another type of sugar), I queried why lactose-free milk tastes sweeter than regular milk.</p>
<p>The response is that lactose-free milk is made by breaking the lactose down into simpler sugars - glucose and galactose - both of which taste sweeter than lactose.</p>
<p>I assume the lactose can't be broken down into MORE sugar than it started with, so that would suggest to me that different sugars can taste sweeter than others. As such, it is possible (I have no specific knowledge, but the concept is possible) that the 30g bottle has a a 'less sweet' type of sugar than what you get in the packets.</p>
<p>2nd Edit: You also have to look at the volume of the drink / ratio of the sugar. 3 packets in a small coffee is going to taste sweeter than 3 packets in a large coffee. However, looking up a 9.5 oz Frap bottle with 31g of sugar would be equivalent in volume to somewhere between an 8oz short and 12oz tall Starbucks drink size - so volume would not appear to be a factor for this comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different types of sugars are indeed at different levels of sweetness. I do not have a source at hand now, but that's what I've learnt in chemistry class.</p>
<p>Concercing ice cream tasting sweeter once it melts, maybe it's because the cold numbs the taste buds so they won't be activated by the different sugar molecules as often? Once it gets warmer, there will be less numbing resulting in a more vivid taste. That is just my speculation though.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness\#Examples_of_sweet_substances" target="_blank">Wikipedia has a table with many common examples</a>. Sucrose is usually the control for these comparisons, meaning it will have a value of 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different sugars absolutely have different levels of sweetness, you are correct. That is the idea behind making a sugar syrup for desserts or mixed drinks. Some people think it's just table sugar dissolved in water, but there's more to it than that. Table sugar is sucrose, a disaccharide (di=two, saccharide=sugar), meaning it's actually two monosaccharide molecules bonded together (glucose and fructose). When you make a simple syrup (2 parts table sugar and 1 part water, bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes) you're actually splitting the sucrose molecules into their component glucose and fructose molecules. The resulting syrup is sweeter than the table sugar itself, or if you merely dissolved the table sugar into the water without cooking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. That is why when you drink a soda sweetened with corn/high fructose corn syrup as opposed to cane sugar one tastes sweeter. The Cane variety. This is partly why in the USA corn syrup is used (aside from all the govt lobbying). You can drink much more soda with corn syrup and not get &quot;sweeted out&quot; than you can drink soda with an equal grams of cane sugar. </p></div>		</li>
