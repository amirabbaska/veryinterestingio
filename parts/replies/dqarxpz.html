			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it would make sense, but breeder reactors aren't really efficient <em>right now</em>. Such is the nature of long-term solutions, unfortunately. If they aren't immediately super effective, the market won't even touch it.</p>
<p>I would say the only real issue is that no matter how far down the &quot;usable fuel&quot; line you go, it never really becomes less awful as the final usable fuel product decays into radioactive cadmium. OH JOY!</p>
<p>Edit: my bad, it's curium I was thinking of. That is... Still not amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a straight decay chain though. That's not what happens in a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor#/media/File%3ASasahara.svg" target="_blank">breeder reactor</a> a constant cycle of enrichment and spending ends up in other transuranic elements. All still extremely toxic... But due to how much power can be extracted from one of these reactors over a long period of time, they're insanely efficient...but not immediately.</p>
<p>But I was incorrect as to which element is produced. It is in fact curium which is the final product of fission in this method... Which is still awful.</p></div>		</li>
