			<div class="markdown"><p>Not gay marriage.  Same-sex marriage.  You absolutely cannot force someone to somehow verify that they're gay before marrying without unlawfully discriminating against them.</p>
<p>If heterosexual Joe and his same-sex heterosexual roommate Andy want to get married to gain the legal benefits of marriage, they can.  Doubtful that'd be worth it, but it's a noteworthy distinction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this really true? If a private insurance company, which is not subject to the constitution, wants to deny a same sex couple certain benefits, don't they still have that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question - the United States is covered by the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination by privately owned places of public accommodation on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin. The right of public accommodation is also guaranteed to disabled citizens under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination by private businesses based on disability. The federal law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, so gays are not a protected group under the federal law. However, about 20 states, including New York and California, have enacted laws that prohibit discrimination in public accommodations based on sexual orientation. In California, you also can’t discriminate based on someone’s unconventional dress. In some states, like Arizona, there’s no state law banning discrimination against gays, but there are local laws in some cities that prohibit sexual orientation discrimination.<br />

<p>EDIT: short answer, it may be possible for private companies to discriminate against anyone not protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Announcing yourself as same-sex friendly might be a poor business decision in some parts of the country, so I disagree with your point there. They would get sued though and if it's a national company, I think they would probably net lose customers.</p></div>		</li>
