			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, radar and sonar use the same concept. Radar uses radio waves instead of sound waves, but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Radar uses electromagnetic radio waves, and sonar uses sound waves, and those differences generate a ton of practical differences in the design of components and systems, but theoretically they are similar.  </p>
<p>In fact Radar stands for RAdio Detecting And Ranging, and Sonar stands for SOund Navigation And Ranging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How exactly can a material absorb radar signals? I understand the deflection part as I know radars send out shit loads of signals so they get some back so reducing the amount returned can impact a radars visibility but how can a material absorb radio waves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radio is a like light, but on a different wavelength. Material with a black color absorb visible light. (Or rather, we see them as black because they absorb light)</p>
<p>In similar fashion you can make material that absorb waves in the radio spectrum</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radio is a form of radiation, so you just need materials designed to absorb the specific wavelengths of radiation.</p>
<p>If it's hard to imagine, just realize that light is also a form of radiation, and both can be acted upon in similar manners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One design is to have the outside have a series of small triangles, so it looks like the cross section of a sound-proofed room's wall. So once the waves get in, they're sort of trapped, in that they bounce around within the space. </p></div>		</li>
