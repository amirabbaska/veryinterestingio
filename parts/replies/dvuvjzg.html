			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;like a mirror&quot; is the &quot;flipped&quot; mode, so the effect is probably only applied to the preview. The actual image is &quot;normal&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stock camera app on iPhones shows the preview flipped for the user to see like a mirror, but saves the photo the correct way round. This means people don’t look strange in photos because facial features, etc are on the wrong side, and it also means text in the background (or foreground) is readable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately apps that implement their own selfie mode (e.g. whatsapp) save the picture flipped (same as it was shown on the screen). I believe the stock camera app on Android does too, but I’m not sure as I don’t have an android device.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S5) and the self-facing camera photos are flipped by default on the stock Camera app.</p>
<p>My girlfriend has an iPhone (6s, I believe) and I noticed that one of her selfies was flipped mostly due to text in the background being backwards, but I <em>think</em> she uses the stock app (or maybe it was via Facebook)... so I wonder if the default is also &quot;flipped&quot; for some iOS versions.</p></div>		</li>
