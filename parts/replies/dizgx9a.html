			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a bit of an overstatement. Europe in general is to the left of America, particularly in social issues and healthcare. So on these issues the moderate democrats might be to the right of the mainstream parties. With that said, in general the center right parties support lower taxes, lower spending, and less government involvement in the economy, but with a bit more moderation than the GOP. </p></div>		</li>
