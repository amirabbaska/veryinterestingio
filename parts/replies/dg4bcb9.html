			<div class="markdown"><p>One more potential criteria can be sort of a mix of point 1 and 2. Groups that faced some level of discrimination tended to form their own communities, either by force or by choice. Especially in cities where you tend to find more people identifying by heritage. Saying you're from new york may imply certain things of your upbringing. Saying you're irish/italian/Chinese/ect narrows that down in a different way. People who grew up in an &quot;irish&quot; neighborhood in nyc, boston, or philly have more of a shared identity than an irish and russian neighborhood in the same city.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely agree with you that facing discrimination  and forming separate communities is the key.</p>
<p>I have German and English heritage. With both sets of grandparents being born and raised in those countries. But I was raised without those cultural identities because they are the default in the American Midwest, and is especially in my state of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>So my grandparents were able to assimilate very easily and never needed to be cloistered in their own ethnic communities.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm just a bland european mix, but I see this a lot with some friends of mine who are of asian descent, but who have been here for generations.  When people ask where I'm from, and I tell them what state I'm from, the conversation is over.  But when they get asked, and they say what state they are from, people always get that confused look on their face, and say something like &quot;no, where are you from originally?&quot;  </p>
<p>The answer doesn't change of course, they're originally from the US.  But I would imagine that for some people, living their whole life with constant questions about whether or not they are &quot;really&quot; american would have some effect.</p></div>		</li>
