<p>Letting a creator go completely wild often ends in, well, the Star Wars prequels.</p>

<p>I would have gone with the Hobbit movie(s).  Somebody should really have said &quot;Look, you can have 3 hours and not a minute more.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Hobbit was a studio fuckup. Jackson was effectively dragged in at the last minute and was all but writing the whole thing as they went, having to fill time. The prequels are a better example because the studio DIDN'T say anything. No interference meant that a lot of really dumb shit got through that SHOULD have been stopped by a team effort. The Hobbit was stretched because of what the studio wanted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now this is just an assumption, but i would guess they like the freedom to be able to syndicate their tv shows at a later time, and by sticking close to Network tv times they keep the option.</p>
<p>Maybe in 5 years from now fox wants to syndicate house of cards, and at least Netflix has the option of cashing in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people would be experienced in telling enough of the story in 22 or 42 minutes I imagine.  Great to not need to fit into a time slot but one might observe that times will gravitate toward those numbers anyway for the immediate future until those accustomed in the old ways die or retire. </p></div>		</li>
