			<div class="markdown"><p>This is essentially the reason. A very rich person sees no reason to haggle over a 30$k on a  300$k car as their time is more valuable. A dirt poor 18 year old on min wage <del>can afford</del> may choose to spend the time to argue over a 30$ on 300$ car.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I install carpet and people living in 2 million dollar homes will order 15k worth of carpet without haggling and then try to haggle on the $1000 for install. </p>
<p>I live and work near Microsoft/Amazon/etc so a large portion of our customers are Indian. I assume that bargaining everything is cultural, and frankly I'm ok with that. What I'm not ok with, and what happens quite a bit, is people attempting to bargain after I've already told them the price and done the work. It's really cheap, because once a service has been completed my bargaining power has decreased. </p></div>		</li>
