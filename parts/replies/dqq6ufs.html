			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2</p>
<p>Where m is mass and v is velocity.</p>
<p>The best way to increase energy is to increase velocity (instead of mass) given the exponential relationship between velocity and energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Area of the impact also matters, as far as how the object is going to deform in absorbing that energy (i.e., will armor be penetrated). We chop down trees with axes instead of hammers for a reason. </p>
<p>What I don't know (and maybe someone can tell me) is whether the difference in diameter between a 9mm/7.62mm/5.56mm round is sufficient to make much difference in that regard, or if it's dwarfed by the difference in energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t forget barrel length. In general, the longer the barrel, the higher the velocity to a point. The pressurized gases have a longer time to transfer energy to the round before dissipating outside the barrel. It might not be a huge difference, but a ~5” barrel (92FS/M9) has a velocity of about 1171fps, and an 18” barrel (MP5) has a velocity of 1277fps. Both Federal 115 grain. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s an MP5 clone, so I’m guessing the longer barrel is to make it <em>not</em> a SBR. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm I've always heard that a heavier bullet moving slower will cause more damage (45 acp) vs a smaller bullet moving faster (9mm)? The advantage of the smaller is range and accuracy whereas the larger is impact damage? </p>
<p>(For the sake of the argument, both of these are fired at 20 yards.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For slow bullets, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference.</p>
<p>Past a certain point (around 2600 feet per second or 800 meters per second), however, hydrostatic shock becomes significant and starts damaging tissue outside the physical path of the bullet. All else being equal, the higher the velocity, the larger the area damaged by hydrostatic shock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how slow/fast. but typically, no.</p>
<p>Kenetic Energy is 0.5(mass)(velocity ^2)</p>
<p>Increase in mass is a very linear growth in energy. But increase in velocity is exponentially more effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh thanks for the reply, this makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>So a 5.56 would be more dangerous than a 7.62 at 100 yards? I get that it would have more kinetic energy but would that translate to more damage?</p>
<p>I have an Aug A3 CQC so I'm familiar with the 5.56 but don't have much experience with the AK47's 7.62. That NATO 7.62 though...  Holy shit what a round. </p>
<p>Edit: Interesting to note that the Russians went from the 7.62 to the 5.45. Makes a lot of sense now. </p></div>		</li>
