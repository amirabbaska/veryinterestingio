			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of roads in Madison, WI have speed bumps.  If the posted speed limit is 25 but you can't comfortably go over the bumps at 25 what's the point? Just make the speed limit 15 or not have the speed bumps. </p>
<p>edit: fixed a word</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't say I like speed bumps; but if the local government is going to insist on using them, at least the damn things should be maintained so you can see them properly instead of hitting them at speed.  Too many times I've seen speed bumps where the paint markings have worn down to the point that the bump doesn't look much different than regular pavement.</p></div>		</li>
