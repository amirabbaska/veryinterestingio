			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual phase for the majority of new cancer drugs</p>
<ol>
<li>Academic/university researchers identify a compound that (sufficiently selectively) kills cancer in a dish, OR is (sufficiently) effective in rodent models.</li>
<li>Academic researchers patent their finding and publish their work</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&lt;<PRESS RELEASE>&gt;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Academic researchers (and university patent offices) decide whether to start a company, license their patent, or sell their patent.</li>
<li>A pharma company R&amp;D obtains rights to take the research towards clinical-readiness</li>
<li>Pharma R&amp;D does extensive toxicity testing, efficacy testing, compound optimization, and more testing in animal and cellular models</li>
<li>Pharma R&amp;D does bioavailability and pharmacokinetic studies. Lab mice can be injected i.v. twice a day for months, but people can't/won't do that. Labour cost to have a nurse do that would be enormous even if the patient was willing to show up compliantly.</li>
<li>Repeat toxicity testing, efficacy testing, kinetics, etc..</li>
<li>Results from staff scientists need to be very good, very fast, and very reproducible.</li>
<li>For a small-to-midsize company: pharma execs and/or sales teams need to pitch externally in order to convince venture capital to invest enough money to fund the required research. For a large company: staff scientists need to pitch execs that this project will pay off (results are very good!) if they continue to invest in associated R&amp;D</li>
</ol>
<p>... somewhere here or prior, a small or midsize pharma companies need to get bought out by a large company. The next few steps are absurdly expensive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply to the FDA for permission to conduct a human clinical trial.
<ul>
<li>For cancer drugs and others that would be expected to produce unacceptably high rates or danger to healthy volunteers due to intended or side effects of the drug's activity, this may be done in a patient population. </li>
<li>For some drugs, a (smaller, cheaper) pilot trial is conducted first, with a (larger, more expensive) full clinical trial conducted afterwards contingent on results</li>
<li>For some drugs (not assumed to pose a serious health risk), a healthy set of participants also need to have the drug administered for toxicity and side effect monitoring. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consent eligible participants, conduct trial, and complete follow-up period. Analyze results.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&lt;&lt;GREAT SUCCESS! ANOTHER PRESS RELEASE!&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Submit results of clinical trial and other data for FDA approval. Allow FDA scientists, lawyers, and bureaucracy to do their jobs.</li>
<li>Develop pricing and marketing plan to have drug finally go out into non-trial patients</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&lt;<DRUG HITS MARKET. ANOTHER PRESS RELEASE>&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Often you won't see this one unless you follow business news and pharma stock prices, or are very interested in a particular drug/disease for personal reasons. All of the exciting science stuff saying that it works has already been reported, this is about money and patient access.</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin marketing the drug to doctors and other relevant stakeholders. Convince them to give it a try in their patients. Doctors always have treatment discretion over their patients, so some will be more receptive to trying something new while others may prefer to take a more cautious approach. Still other doctors may not keep up-to-date constantly, and it will take a while for them to become aware of the new drug.</li>
</ol>
<p>And then, for some drugs... Wild success is achieved to the point where new drug actually becomes standard of care, rather than a care option. This requires substantial data collection and lengthy follow-up.</p>
<ol>
<li>Drug is listed in clinical care guidelines by the American Medical Association or other medical professional association.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whats the point of that statement? A blunt way of saying that it's hard to find a delicate way to kill cancer cells? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That particular sentence is saying that there are lots of things that kill cancer cells in a petri dish that are useless as cancer treatment because they kill everything and don't have even minor selectivity for cancer cells. Bullets, explosions, high heat, 99.8% alcohol, etc.</p>
<p>The alt text</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Now, if it selectively kills cancer cells in a petri dish, you can be sure it's at least a great breakthrough for everyone suffering from petri dish cancer.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is pointing out that the body is very complicated, and that those complications matter very much so in practice. Something that selectively kills a certain type of cancer cell in a petri dish won't necessarily selectively kill that cancer cell in a body. Even if we assume there's a plausible mode of transport for the treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a simplified way yes. If you isolate cancer cell, a lot of things can kill it. Simple bleach can kill isolated cancer cells no problem, but we don't rush to make people drink bleach because it will destroy your digestive system. A lot of these announcements are to drum interest in the product/research as cancer research can be prohibitively expensive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then stage 5, you find out a really really rare condition gets hit up as a side effect, like some of the monoclonal antibodies for MS and Krons activated PML as a side effect that didn’t become obvious until they were widely released. Oops. </p>
<p>Edit: because it’s hard to tell someone died of PML, we didn’t even really know about it until the AIDS epidemic and we developed our first major immunosuppressive drugs. Almost everyone has JCV but we really have no idea how it gets activated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since these answers are seen by hundreds of people with little medical familiarity etc I want  to help ID these initialisms: </p>
<p>MS=multiple sclerosis</p>
<p>PML=progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy </p>
<p>JVC=John Cunningham virus (JCV), a common virus usually kept under control by the immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you kindly. Was on the phone and drunk earlier. Just throwing out an example where even after we successfully bring things out of trial and into the general circulation you can pop up with shit potentially years down the line. (Edit although this did flare up interest in the virus again after we got HIV pretty much controlled and know what to look for in chemo patients)</p>
<p>Also another aside, due to a lot of ethical issues things like our current AIDS treatment is both a blessing and a curse. To get a trial we have to basically have someone come off a medication that will nearly 100% keep the condition down so long as they take it every day of the their life for an experimental that may or may not cure them. So some conditions are an enormous pain where there is more than just a potential incremental advancement (worked on the same floor as the two major crisper papers on hiv excision from mice came out last year, one of the PIs is on my committee). I don’t and won’t work with HIV though, too crowded a field and not personally interested, I was working on JCV though until... things happened.... now in metabolic diseases. </p></div>		</li>
