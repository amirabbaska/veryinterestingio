<p><em>We have done some initial (published) studies on using a receptive fields/neural network approach to discriminate mines from clutter in holographic images.</em> <em>It works very well, and we fully intend to implement this.</em> <em>In the meantime, minimal training is required for a human operator to begin making good decisions.</em></p></div>		</li>
