Macrostrat is a great place to start: <a href="https://macrostrat.org/sift/" target="_blank">https://macrostrat.org/sift/</a>#/. Scroll down to the world map, and then zoom in on where you are. Or you can use the Rockd app which will plot the geologic information on a map. Both Macrostrat and Rockd have information about what fossils have been found.</p>
<p>Either before or after doing the preliminary research, get out and start looking. Roadcuts and stream beds are great places to look, but you can really look anywhere that sedimentary rocks are exposed. Some kinds of fossils you can find on the surface, like shells, but others require splitting rock open, like plants. Amateur paleontologists are allowed to collect plant and invertebrate fossils on BLM and forest service land, but if you find any vertebrate fossils, you need to leave them where you found them (you might record where you are and let the local field office know, though). And while you're welcome to look for fossils in National Parks, you need to leave them where you find them!</p></div>		</li>
