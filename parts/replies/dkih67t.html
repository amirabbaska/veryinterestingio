			<div class="markdown"><p>The way you worded that makes it seem like my comment was entirely about a really specific example I came up with to nitpick your post. Really it applies to the whole special case you mentioned. Also the &quot;this is ELI5&quot; thing people often say in counter to corrections and such is kind of ridiculous as your post is already way more complex than even the average educated adult's math capability can comprehend. But yeah, it probably didn't end up making a huge difference, just thought I'd point it out.</p></div>		</li>
