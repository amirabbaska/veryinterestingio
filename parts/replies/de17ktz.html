<p>On the other side, that Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund is huge and very well managed. Prime example of long term government planning and investment. The Saudis can learn a few lessons from the Norwegians.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>They've been engaging in massive stimulus for awhile now. That 30 year stall you mentioned is exactly why.</p>
<p>For whatever reason (it's hotly debated), they can't seem to get out, even though normal economic thought would say that much stimulus would've done it ages ago.</p>
<p>In the last or two, they've even tried zero and slightly negative rates,but it wasn't enough. Although those low rates mean that % of debt/gdp is a lot less scary than it looks, simply because they can borrow so cheaply</p></div>		</li>

<p>This site is pretty good, but it shows all countries</p>

<p>This one is a link for OECD countries, which is most of the developed ones, though stuff like China you'll have to get from the first link</p>
<p>It has a bunch of nifty options below the chart as well</p></div>		</li>
