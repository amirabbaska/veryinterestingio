			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Hangul is very well constructed and pretty easy to learn. It helps that it was literally designed from the ground up as opposed to something that sort of &quot;happened&quot; over centuries of unguided evolution like most writing systems!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/fEk0n" target="_blank">Here is the Korean layout on my keyboard and phone.</a></p>
<p>For people who wish to know what it looks like. </p>
<p>There's also a 9key layout, but I don't like that one. You have to build the vowels (ㅛㅕㅑㅐㅗㅓㅏㅣㅠㅜㅡㅔ) by using lines and dots (ㅣ . . would make ㅑ)</p>
<p>Edit: My work keyboard looks dirty when you use a flash. Gross.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'B' key has a somewhat interesting story. Following QWERTY touch typing rules, that key is pressed with left index finger. However in Hangul keyboard, that is a vowel key, so it is pressed with right index finger. Touch typists actually use different fingers depending on the language one is typing at the moment. Also, it complicates matters for those fancy 'split' ergonomic keyboards, because usually 'B' key is put on left side. When typing Hangul with such keyboard, people try to press on the empty space on the left side of 'N' key and get frustrated. Some split ergonomic keyboards sold in Korea has two 'B' keys, one on each side, for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The methods you described, are they really in use or do even exist? I've never seen it in my life. I've used Windows and Linux Korean IME (Input Method Editor), and they don't work like that. Keys are mapped to Hangul elements (no relation to how they're Romanized) and you just type them in order. ㅎ is mapped to 'g', ㅏ is mapped to 'k', ㄴ is mapped to 's'. So, you type 'gks' in Hangul input mode and it shows '한', 'dkssudgktpdy' shows '안녕하세요'. You just memorize the mapping, no need to remember Romanization rules or use context sensitive menus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, the first one? Korean Romanization rules are wacky, and it was switched to one from another in 2000. The new one even has ambiguities, like ㄱ, ㄲ and ㅋ in final position all being transcribed to 'k' and ㄷ, ㅅ, ㅈ, ㅆ, ㅊ, ㅌ to 't'. So, when you type 'nat', what does it convert to? 낫 (sickle), 낮 (day), 낯 (face) and 낱 (single) are all valid. Also, there's no way to type '안' as initial ㅇ is transcribed as 'nothing'. That simply isn't a viable method. I have to call bullshit on that one.</p>
<p>Even in the 'alternative' one, there's no context sensitive menu in Korean IME when typing Hangul. Those pop up only when converting Hangul to Hanja(Chinese characters).</p></div>		</li>
