			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, signals usually travel slower than <em>c</em> through cables. This is called the velocity factor. Fiber optic cables have a velocity factor of around 67%, and cat5e is around 64%.</p>
<p>SpaceX and some other companies are looking at building satellite internet networks in space. Because signals will be travelling at <em>c</em> through vacuum, and will usually see far fewer &quot;hops&quot;, latency can be kept pretty low despite the signal travelling up to space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite right. Except, those satellite networks will need to be in low Earth orbit for low latency. That severely limits the single hop distance. They need dozens of satellites to cover the Earth.  To bypass fiber they will often require multiple hops. </p>
<p>Geosynchronous satellites would require fewer hops, but have a minimum 250 ms latency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's 120 each way. 120 up, 120 down. Plus a little for the hardware in space and on the ground, but most of that is due to scheduler delay. The best schedulers for sat are still in the 10s of msec intervals. So what we need is datacenters in geosynchronous orbit to half the latency. :)</p></div>		</li>
