			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially this! This is what a mod said would be acceptable wording:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of your bathtub.  When you make waves in the tub the top is all wavy, but under is not as crazy.  Though you can still feel it on your toes a bit.  Imagine that your toes are the fish who are deep and your hands at the surface are fish who don't live as deep.</p>
<p>Something like that would be an analogy that isn't aimed at a literal child, but remains simple.</p>
