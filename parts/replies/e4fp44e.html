			<div class="markdown"><p>The screen works based on capacitance, not resistance. There's no electron flow through the screen and rubber.</p>
<p>Its entirely based on the thickness of the object between your skin and the screen. A thin pair of rubber gloves won't stop the effect, while a thicker pair of woolen winter gloves would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They decrease to threshold for what level of capacitance counts as a touch. Normally, it needs a strong signal and rejects weaker ones to prevent accidental input, so in wool-gloves mode they just make it more sensitive, the trade-off being an increased likelihood of accidental input.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the touchscreen increases the flow of electricity flowing through the capacitive layer. If an object that is capacitive comes close to the screen, it would be more likely to absorb the electric flow. The touchscreen reacts to the interrupted flow of energy and calculates where the finger is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last part.</p>
<p>At my work (a restaurant), we use gloves for prepping chicken. If I have a glove on (thin blue gloves, you know what I’m talking about), I’m able to use TouchID, the touch screen, everything, since the glove is thin enough to capture my finger as a capacitor. </p></div>		</li>
