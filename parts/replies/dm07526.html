<p>In the case of a nuke it would probably not be a steam bubble. A very significant part of the energy released by a nuke is in various forms of high-energy radiation, which would travel outwards faster than the hot gasses formed by vaporization of the core. This radiation is going to get adsorbed by the water, causing the water in a sphere around the bomb to turn into plasma as the electrons are ripped away from the water molecules. This means that at least the initial bubble consists of a high-energy plasma made up of hydrogen, oxygen and debris of the bomb.</p>
<p>In high-altitude airbursts it's also this cloud of plasma that's responsible for the generation of an EMP. A significant fraction of the plasma is ejected into near-Earth space, where it couples to the Earth's magnetic field, causing the charged particles to emit intense microwaves and radiowaves through synchrotron radiation.</p>
<p>In the case of a deep underwater explosion there will also be a weak EMP, this time caused by the fact that the electrons liberated by the radiation move much faster than the rest of the plasma, so they will expand outwards faster and impact water that has not been vaporized yet, causing secondary radiation. However, this radiation is quickly absorbed by the water itself since it's mostly in wavelengths that water is opaque to.</p>

<p>It creates a massive steam bubble, it doesn't last too long (not sure on actual time it is there for) but something interesting happens when the &quot;bubble&quot; is there. The gas makes the bubble expand until it reaches the maximum size it can as the pressure forcing the bubble to expand becomes weaker the water pressure causes the bubble to collapse on itself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted here that this overexpansion is caused by the fact that the water surrounding the bubble attains a large amount of outward momentum. This means that as the bubble reaches it's equilibrium pressure, the water keeps pulling it further outwards, overexpanding the bubble and causing the pressure in the bubble to drop below the ambient pressure. As the water eventually loses it's momentum to friction you're now left with a low-pressure bubble in the water, which causes the collapse. It's the same process that causes the bubble to expand again after reaching it's minimum size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Except Gypsy Danger probably would've been crushed/fried being close enough to the blast to be <em>inside</em> the bubble.</p>
<p>But it's a movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters. Rule of Cool is in full swing, and I'm okay with that.</p></div>		</li>
