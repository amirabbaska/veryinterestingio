			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the magnetic strip has a different security code. The three digit code on the back of the card is “CV2” and the one encoded in the magstripe is CV1. They’re calculated differently, and the CV1 is only read during a swipe authorization while the CV2 is used during an online purchase. </p>
<p>Chips have another CVC (card verification code) which is used during a dip authorization.  </p>
<p>Source: I work in the industry and embossing/encoding/chip personalization is my job. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... and it is how you can determine card present and card not present finance fees for the merchant.  </p>
<p>The extra fee goes into their insurance bucket for fraudulent charges.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Credit card security is built on 2 major rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people are honest, and most people will report any fraud before it gets too far out of hand, therefore losses aren't too huge</li>
<li>WHEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! WE'RE SWIMMING IN MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOHOOOOOO!!!!!! Oh, yeah, pay that guy back for the $200 fraudulent claim whatever I told you not to bother me during my money bath. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, but just keep in mind: card not present (i.e., over the phone or online authorizations) fraud was something along the lines of $3.1 billion in 2015. </p>
<p>So these companies are really swimming in money.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but most of that is carried by the merchants. I own a hotel - if someone disputes a charge, it comes out of my account, not Visa's. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your goal is perfection you've already failed</p>
<p>Credit card security has evolved through the years to counter new threats but it's important that the security cost less to implement than you would lose by not having it, and that it doesn't too heavily burden customers and make them not use credit cards</p>
<p>I'm not saying don't try to improve it, I'm saying that improvements must be weighed against their costs. Credit cards with biometric security and a strip search would be significantly more secure but it would hurt more than it helped</p></div>		</li>

<p>And that's why we have 75k people killed by guns every year, while japan has 10.</p>
<p>&quot;We have tried nothing and it didn't work, might as well give up.&quot; is the refrain from the ammosexuals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No such thing as a perfect bridge - <em>any</em> bridge can be destroyed by a sufficiently' strong storm or with years of wear.</p>
<p>No such thing as a perfectly-safe car - no matter how many airbags you add, no matter how big your crumple zone, there's always a risk of death in a crash.</p>
<p>No such thing as a perfect lock - any lock can be decoded, picked, or destroyed.</p>
<p>Perfection is not attainable in most design, particularly safety/security.  Doesn't mean you can't improve it though.</p></div>		</li>
