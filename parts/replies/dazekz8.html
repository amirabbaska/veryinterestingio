<p>What if I forget my wallet?</p>

<ul>
<li>Check wallet at apartment door</li>
<li>Keep the amount I have in mind for the first 3 minutes outside</li>
<li>Go through shopping list, making sure it's enough</li>
<li>While walking, check for your wallet in your back pocket constantly</li>
<li>1 min before entering store recall amount over and over</li>
<li>Check wallet inside store, reaffirm amount</li>
<li>Add items to basket, reminding yourself of price and target sum every time</li>
<li>Add item prices generously, $1.40 = $2, safety buffer!</li>
<li>Check money at register before putting items down (You could still bail! Safety!)</li>
<li>Feel relieve flooding through you as you are under your allotted amount</li>
<li>Repeat every shopping trip</li>

<p>I do this with everything possible, then move that leftover cost to savings in case of emergency. I don't want to be a money hoarder but I can't help it. Paranoia is rough</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can get CBD over the counter.  No it doesn't work well as CBD with more THC and the actual terpenes in it.  The reason for this is nebulous at best but the prevailing wisdom is the bouquet effect.  Essentially it is not just the CBD that is providing the benefit, it is the cocktail of terpenes, cannabinoids (of which CBD is) and other compounds that really provide the benefits most people are looking for.  Through study of individual terpenes we have come to realize that those terpenes provide benefits.  For example Linalool, found in lavender, coriander and others, exhibits anti-anxiety, antidepressant, sedative, anti-inflammatory, anti-epileptic and analgesic properties.  </p>
<p>CBD is found in cannabis and it is non-psychoactive.  </p>
<p>No, it will not show up in drug tests.  Drug tests look for the metabolites that are present when THC exists in your bloodstream.  Edit:  Caveat, if you are ingesting over the counter CBD it will not show up on a drug test.  CBD sourced from strains such as AC/DC, Island Sweet Skunk, Hawaiian Dream, etc do contain a sufficient amount of THC to create a positive result on a drug test.</p></div>		</li>
