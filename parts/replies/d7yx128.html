			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it gives me a headache trying to account for everything that could affect a spaceship's journey from one point to another. I think the scientists got most of that information down in the initial testing period. I guess it helps that they had a whole agency of bright people on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been so curious about how huge intellectually intense projects like space exploration or physics experiments are managed. Does the smartest one oversee the project and instruct other still very smart people to focus on different tasks? One guy takes care of fuel, another takes care of HOW much fuel, the other takes care of the gas can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSIRIS-REx?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">OSIRIS-ReX</a> mission just launched to the asteroid Bennu is going measure a similar effect called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky_effect?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Yarkovsky effect.</a> The orbital mechanics of most solar system objects is pretty well known, but the small thermal effects can deflect the orbits of small objects enough that it becomes more difficult to predict orbits long into the future. One of the goals of the mission is to learn the momentum change from this thermal emission effect to better predict which near earth objects are potential earth colliders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not claiming to have any brain at all here but give yourself a little more credit. You really can learn anything you want and when you get into stuff its not nearly as complicated as it once seemed when you didn't know the basics. I think the real key is just being obsessively nerdy about a topic so you naturally want to know more than most people care about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much of it is training. The authors of those string theory papers learned and expanded, they didn't know it immediately either. If you had the resources, interest and time to begin with the basics and work up, you could be one of them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What impresses me most is the accuracy here. The thing is travelling at 12.51 kilometers/second, or 45036 km/h. That's accurate on the fifth decimal, or Â±0.0022%.</p>
<p>Mmm, after doing the math, it doesn't impress me now as much as initially, but it's still damn impressive.</p></div>		</li>
