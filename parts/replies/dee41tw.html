			<div class="markdown"><p>The way they would interact with matter is interesting and unintuitive. You can solve the problem of a point electric charge interacting with a magnetic monopole. I list the highlights <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/59gvo8/can_magnetic_monopoles_violate_conservation_of/d9916dl/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Monopoles would fall off in strength as an inverse square. All dipole magnets are inverse cubes when seen from a distance, which is why there aren't really long-range magnets.</p>
<p>If you had a cheap powerful monopole magnet, the first application I can think of is pretending you're a Jedi by summoning your car keys from some distance away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't understand the second part of your question, but if the first part is asking why a monopole has different decay than a dipole, the (vague) answer is that the opposing poles cancel out each other's effects at the top order of decay. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you have a dipole (electric or magnetic)  then at large distances the two charges appear in roughly the same place and their monopole fields are opposite to each other so they almost cancel out (the 1/r² part).  what remains is a 1/r³ part (proportional to the charge times the distance between the charge = the dipole moment) . there are also higher poles like quadrupoles where the dipole part cancels and that fall off even more quickly.  see Wikipedia multipole expansion.    </p>
<p>it's just a matter of adding monopole fields of opposite charges that are close to each other. </p></div>		</li>
