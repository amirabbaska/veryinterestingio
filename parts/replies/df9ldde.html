			<div class="markdown"><p>Sharks have changed less some other animal groups, but they still have changed quite a bit.  The oldest sharks date back 300-400 million years, and the were very different...fewer teeth, slender jaws, shorter, stiffer fins, and many were freshwater species.  Modern sharks date back about 100 million years.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apologies for an ignorant question. If many of the shark species were freshwater where would they live? Streams and lakes? Neither of those seem like good environments for sharks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Modern&quot; sharks evolved in the Jurassic period, which was a golden age for sharks as much as it was for dinosaurs. This is around the time rays and chimaeras diverged from sharks also.</p>
<p>Prior to this, <a href="http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/evolution/ancient.htm" target="_blank">primitive sharks ruled</a>. There were <a href="http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/evolution/jaws.htm" target="_blank">key differences</a> between the early shark lineages and the modern shark lineages that arose in the Jurassic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between phenotypic (how something looks) stability and genetic change is really imports to be aware of.  Everything is constantly evolving and changing, but there are often environmental pressures that keep organisms looking the same (or make different organisms look like each other).  </p>
<p>Sharks, crocodiles, ferns, abalone, etc are all examples of this.  None of them are &quot;living fossils&quot;, they are <em>all</em> quite a bit different from their ancestors, but the <em>visible</em> aspects of that change may only be clear to an expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is terribly different because of the traced adaptations (morphological changes)</p>
<p>mammals varied in all it's categories, bone structure, size, weight proportions, time of gestation, social structures and i can go on and on.</p>
<p>&quot;sharks&quot; on the other hand survived all this time with minimal change, a little size here, an adapted organ there, a different eye shape, but nothing as radical as what mammals did, that is coming from basically rats to all land and sea animals we see today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, crocodiles and coelacanths and giant salamanders and hagfish and most creatures described as living fossils.</p>
<p>There are a few extant species that may have been around since the dinosaurs, but it is always tricky to try to determine if they are the exact same species as fossilized specimens.</p></div>		</li>
