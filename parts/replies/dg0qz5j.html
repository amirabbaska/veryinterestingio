			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on your username, I'm guessing you know what you're talking about. I have some questions if you don't mind:</p>
<p>Pomelos are older, larger, tastier, and less bitter than grapefruits. So why are grapefruits so much more common?</p>
<p>What's your favorite citrus cultivar? Do you have a preferred type of apple as well?</p>
<p>My orange tree isn't doing so hot. Half the branches are dead, the oranges are sour (they were once sweet), and there's fuzzy white growth underneath many of the leaves. Ants seem to like it. Do you know what might be wrong with it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>A few things I know for sure is that you should remove dead/ infected branches and take them far away. Spray the tree with a fungicide. If ants like it, it's likely they're using it to cultivate a fungus they like to eat. Which is bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangerines are the same as mandarins in the USA? This is the first I've heard of it, and I've been eating them all my life. Maybe it's a regional thing? In the stores I've shopped at in the Pacific Northwest, mandarins are the small, sweet oranges that you buy in the boxes around Christmas time, usually individuallyâ€‹ wrapped in paper. Tangerines on the other hand are bigger, about the same size and color as oranges, but with a slightly different favor- mainly they are more tart than regular oranges. Clementines are small, and basically are like mandarins. They seem to have come on the market more recently, and have stronger branding (cuties, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biological genus of Citrus plants has a lot of species and subspecies. Mandarine is Citrus reticulata and Tangerine is Citrus tangerina. </p>
<p>Now you have countless farmers cultivating them for several <em>thousand</em> years and sometimes generating successful hybrids with various features: Some come with a more sweet or sour taste, some are very tolerant to different climate conditions, some have seedless fruits, some have only few allergens for your allergy profile.</p>
<p>Some have the most profitable fruits, though: Easy plant and care, beautiful appearance and tons of fruits per tree, all ripe at the same time, they all come off when shown an empty basket and jump in or at least cheap migrant workers or slaves could pick them easily. They stay perfectly edible for months so you can ship them around the globe. These are likely to be those you will find at your groceries for a convenient price, but also cultivated with pesticides and herbicides. You are also likely allergic to some sorts of these.</p>
<p>They come just like our strawberries here: Beautiful strawberries taste awful. The <strong>best</strong> are fucking impossible hard to care for from planting to fighting pests and diseases and harvesting the randomly riping ugly, to-soft-to-touch fruits and the berries would foul away on the way from their twig to the local market stand. Another set of species on the brink of extinction, because of the lack of cultivation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Others have given really good gene-related answers, but here's an anecdote from my family...</p>
<p>My sister found that she couldn't eat large mangos, but she could eat small mangos. The large ones gave her an allergic reaction. I don't recall the exact substance, but when she was finally tested for the full panel of allergies, she was allergic to a pesticide. We eventually figured out that the big mangos came from a different place (at our grocery store) than the small mangos, and the small mango farmer didn't use that specific pesticide. We unfortunately discovered that they swap out farms and methods all the time, so that wasn't a reliable thing. But buying organic significantly reduced the risks for that specific pesticide. YMWV, people are all different. </p></div>		</li>
