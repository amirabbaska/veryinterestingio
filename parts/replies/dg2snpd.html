<p>They make more money if someone no-shows AND they still have someone on the plane</p>
</li>
<li>This only applies to no-shows, not cancellations that don't get replaced. Yes, most airlines have a cancellation fee, but the airline's out the difference between the ticket price and the cancellation fee.</li>

<p>Many times I've had to change flight plans the day of the flight. I'd call in and get rebooked on a later flight. Sure, I'd pay a small change fee, but it's not like I lost the value of the ticket.</p>
<p>Because the airlines knew that, on average, maybe five people on that route would have to do exactly what I did, they overbooked by four or five seats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As generally they still get to keep the passengers money they don't lose any money, they just lose opportunity to make more.</p>
<p>But from my experience this is more an American issue with its virtual zero consumer protections, never experienced overbooked flight anywhere else as many other countries have legal penalties/compensation for failing to deliver service as paid for, so when they factor that in not worth it to the airline to overbook</p></div>		</li>
