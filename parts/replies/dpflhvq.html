			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to extend the analogy a bit it's a little like you were sperated from your brother and only met a couple years ago (console release), so you don't know much about him yet. You'll be able to answer more questions faster after you've known him for more time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's... debatable, actually. It depends on what tasks you're looking at, but in a lot of ways computers are stagnating somewhat. But that's not really the issue in this case. It's more that console development has caught up with PC development.</p>
<p>Console emulators really started getting popular in the mid-1990's, and they were initially emulating things like the NES, which was from 1983. So you had a ten-year head-start in performance, and things worked reasonably well. As time has gone on, consoles have improved rapidly. They've started using more and more of the same components as PCs, with the last couple generations basically <em>being</em> PCs. But they also make more efficient use of the same hardware, since they're not trying to run a general-purpose operating system at the same time. So even when you <em>do</em> have a ten-year head-start, like if you want to emulate an Xbox360 or PS3, you need a really high-end computer to keep up with it. In a few more years, we should be able to emulate those fairly well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there any reason why we couldn't use x86 virtualization such as vmware? From what I can see, the only limitation would be decent directx/opengl support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not this as much as gaming consoles are basically computers that just do gaming very well. They may have the most up to date hardware on both, so thereâ€™s no difference in processing, like there used to be between older game consoles and newer computers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It greatly depends on when in the console's life you're comparing it to a PC, what component(s) you're comparing, and what price point of a PC you're comparing. If you compare a high end PC to an Xbox One, the PC is going to run circles around the console. If you instead use a PC at around the same price point, then it may be close depending on how good of a shopper you are. It would be hard to match a PC both in terms of machine cost and performance when it comes to an Xbonex.^1</p>
<p>The CPUs of the PS4 and Xbone have very poor per-core performance compared to a medium to high end i5 or Ryzen CPU. They're basically tablet CPUs except with more cores. This has caused many console games to be limited to 30 fps, even when the graphics processor, which is usually the limiting factor, might be powerful enough to handle 60 fps. Even with the console refreshes with mid to high end graphical processors, the CPUs are mostly the same, but at moderately higher clock speeds.</p>
<p>^1 Note: Once you own the machine, games are typically cheaper on the PC, and you generally don't need to pay anyone except your ISP to pay them online.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, that's subjective. First of all, up-to-date hardware can be vastly different in performance - Consoles want to be powerful, but they also need to be affordable. Also, their hardware becomes obselete fast. The general specs of a console are decided a long time before it hits store shelves in order to actually have games to run - and even then, a new set of, say, graphics cards generally come out every couple of years which are more efficient than the last.</p>
<p>So generally consoles lag behind in that regard, which does make emulation easier, but that's still delayed by both the time it takes to develop an emulator/make it efficient, as well as of course the need for better PC technology to be capable of emulation.</p></div>		</li>
