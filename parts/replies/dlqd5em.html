			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, how would I fit into your model? I fast some 16 hours or so a day, but I also eat a very sugar + simple carb rich diet (a tea of beans, cheese, and roast potatoes or pasta + cheese is fairly standard). Don't seem to get hunger pangs much, and I'd guess I'm fat adapted as a result. </p>
<p>I think there might be some long term adaptation the body can do even in the presence of regular sugar and simple carbs, provided it is forced to subsist off fat reserves on a very regular basis?</p></div>		</li>

<p>All my knowledge comes from reading papers, listening to fitness podcasts and experience. I, for example, could never fast more than like 7 hours. But then I did 6 months of super low sugar and general low carb, and ended up fasting through a few long weekends just because I was too lazy to get food. Nowadays I eat 4 meals a day to bulk and 1-2 to cut</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely so much easier to cut if you only eat once/twice. I couldn't imagine having to manage 1750 / day (hard cut levels for me) if I ate 3 times a day. But eating once a day it's not even that hard, I just cut out snacks, and still eat a huge plate of unhealthy crap for my big meal. Bulking i basically have to add in lunch because you can only really eat so much in one sitting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took 80kg at 20%bf for average.</p>
<p>And no, the body can downregulate to a thousand calories a day AND burn muscle too.</p>
<p>So, we carry 140000 kcal in fat and a few hundred thousands in muscle mass.</p></div>		</li>
