			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually happened somewhat recently, during a radio contest to see who could drink the most water without peeing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16614865/ns/us_news-life/t/woman-dies-after-water-drinking-contest/" target="_blank">Chick died.</a></p>
<p>Her name was Jennifer Strange.</p>
<p>You just can't make this shit up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Listeners including Eva Brooks had even called into the show to warn about the potential consequences of the game. &quot;Those people that are drinking all that water can get sick and possibly die from water intoxication,&quot; Brooks said, to which disc jockeys replied they &quot;were aware of that&quot; and that contestants had signed a release &quot;so we're not responsible.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cost the radio station's owner - Entercom - $16.5 million. So much for &quot;they signed a release.&quot;</p>
<p>Worst part. She didn't win. Came in second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this be gross negligence, though? It seems like the station made the risks known through the waivers and contestants were voluntary participants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All things being equal, it often tastes worse.  Humans prefer a taste for some dissolved ions (usually present to some extent in tap water), and also prefer if the water is oxygenated (shaken with air, or poured so it splashes within the cup, as tap often winds up before drinking).</p>
<p>Tap water can taste bad of course.  Growing up in Hawaii, where water is drawn from underground sources after percolating through the remains of lava flows (a fantastic filter), I thought that most of the time the tap water tasted better than bottled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distilled water enthusiast here.</p>
<p>Were it not bad for your health, I'd drink it all the time. I need those minerals though.</p>
<p>The taste is great. So soft, and yet weirdly metal-ish. I imagine it's how unicorn blood tastes. Pure, light, forgiving. So many places have terrible tab water. Either containing too much calcium, chlorine, or there's not enough oxidation making it too heavy and almost reluctant going down your throat. Distilled water is as close as you can get to heaven without becoming all 'moral gray-area' and stuff.</p>
