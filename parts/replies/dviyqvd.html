<p>It's the very small bits left over from the mass production of tea. It is part of the tea plant.</p>
<p>In cheap teas it's probably going to add to the bitterness. </p>
<p>If you want more information look up tea grades. Lower grade teas will have more dust and fannings. Higher grades will have less to none.</p>
<p>So squeezing the bags can be bad because of dust. But not in the way you're thinking. It's about flavor.</p></div>		</li>
