			<div class="markdown"><p>When I hear about the hydrothermal vent powering the food chain, I wonder how exactly.</p>
<p>Which animal is actually taking in the energy from the hydrothermal vent? Documentaries show worms, tube worms, crabs, shrimp, and such. They never really go into what's going on with all those things. The worms appear to be filter feeding. On what? Is that the start? Are they sucking in chemicals from the vent? Or are they feeding on some microbe or unicellular organism type thing that is directly feeding off the vent? Does something eventually eat the tube worm? Sometimes they focus on the crabs and it looks like they're picking at the worms, or the tube, or scraping, or grazing. What's up with that? And do any huge fish ever come by and hoover up the whole chimney's worth of crabs? They should drop a camera by one for a very, very long time. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to EL5 this one too, but it's tricky.</p>
<p>Plants also don't eat the same way we do, but live and grow - heck, for some, even longer and larger than us. They are able to do that because food and eating isn't really about food and eating, it's about getting energy to do stuff. When you eat a burger, your body breaks it down into the energy you use to move and Reddit and dance to Timberlake. It does so - at its most basic - by moving electrons around. (Note - this is a gross over-simplification of cellular respiration, metabolism and most of life)</p>
<p>Plants use sunlight to run a chemical process to change sun energy into plant energy instead of eating stuff. That, in turn, allows them to do particularly planty things, like stretch out their branches to try to gather as much sunlight as possible. This is done in profound competition with other plants. Forests, which may seem tranquil to use, are literally tree battlegrounds where each individual is fighting its neighbours for its patch of the sun.</p>
<p>Hydrothermal vent animals are basically the same as plants, but instead of using the sun for energy, they get the chemicals they need to change the energy trapped in molecules into tube worm energy from the hydrothermal vents. That allows them to do particularly tube wormy things. We're still learning about the ecosystems around the vents and other, similar places, but it does appear that there is some sort of predation of tube worms. We don't really know what eats them yet. </p>
<p>The process by which plants produce energy from sunlight is photosynthesis. The process by which tube worms produce energy is a form of symbiotic chemosynthesis. </p>
<p>Bonus nerdage- corals get energy in at least three ways. They contain algae that use photosynthesis to make energy from the sun and they supplement that energy by eating things. Deep water corals, which are a new discovery, appear to use chemosynthesis and eating things for energy. </p>
<p>TLDR: it's kinda like plants, but without the sun, so totally different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think this is an oversimplification at all - just a simplification. Life generates energy by generating a flow of electrons, a flow which is harnessed to generate energy. The flow is different than what you picture when you think of electricity, but that's exactly what it is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some vents the bacteria in the water use hydrogen sulfide coming out of the vent (which was made by geological processes) as an energy source.  Other creatures eat those bacteria and up and up the hydrothermal food chain goes.</p>
<p>The reliance on H2S is actually momentous.  The energy for all the life in the vent system comes from a chemical shooting out of the earth - all other life on the planet gets their energy that came from sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't you have it backwards? I'd imagine it's SO4 (or some other oxidized sulphur atom) being reduced to H2S, not the other way around. Oxygen isn't actually an energy source but an electron acceptor that powers respiration. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The whale shark is like 3x the weight of an african elephant, so I wouldn't say that it's average compared to <em>that</em> animal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good point. I was thinking of height and width-wise comparisons, but here I can see how much that doesn't work. Whale sharks are, after all, the largest living non-whale animals alive. Correction incoming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just looked up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_squid" target="_blank">colossal squid</a> hoping to supply that correction. No luck - it seems to be slightly longer than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark" target="_blank">whale shark</a>, but no-where near as large overall. I thought I'd mention it anyway, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7A-M4yyjwc" target="_blank">This video on YouTube</a> shows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale" target="_blank">sperm whale</a> hunting a &quot;colossal squid (giant squid)&quot;, and describes it as a battle between &quot;the two largest predators on Earth&quot;. I remember a documentary at one point (can't find it now) describing what happens to the sperm whale just swimming to that depth (lungs compressed to a tiny fraction of their original size) and on returning to the surface (they can get the bends), and also suggesting that the squid have some chance of killing the whales.</p>
<p>The video title has left me slightly confused whether &quot;giant squid&quot; and &quot;colossal squid&quot; are two different species (as I thought, and as the Wikipedia page suggests) or two different names for the same thing. I think different, and maybe the video title is a mistaken contraction of another name, &quot;giant cranch squid&quot;, that wikipedia gives.</p></div>		</li>
