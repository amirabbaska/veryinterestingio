			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if this has been asked, but what is going on if anxiety seems to speed up digestion? If blood is supposed to be diverted to more important parts of the body in periods of stress, why is &quot;anxiety pooping&quot; so common?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But diarrohea isn't effectively digested food. Stress stops regular peristalsis in the gut but can cause diarhoea and vomiting as your body preps itself for 'action'.</p>
<p>Also there's an important difference between periodic stress related to immediate events (where the effects have concievable benefits) and chronic stress which generally only has negative effects.</p></div>		</li>

This time last year my father was in ICU... Every time I was in the hospital with him and got the .. &quot;Let's discuss our options chat&quot; or anytime I was away from the hospital and I'd get a call that said &quot;We think you should make your way to the hospital asap&quot;..

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, this was a big thing for me when my anxiety was at its peak in my early teens, I’d get horrible panic attacks if I had to go out to eat with family, or eat around kids in the lunch room. The second I would put food in my mouth I would start gagging and I’d have to spit it out, I really isolated myself during that time in my life...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this too, the knot, the nausea, and then my anxiety spirals. </p>
<p>Sometimes it helps to have an ice cold glass of water when it comes on. The temperature shocks me into being more present, and the water seems to help reduce the nausea.</p></div>		</li>
