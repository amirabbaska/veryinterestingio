			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the math seems weird. However, he <em>did</em> say 14 hours were needed to decompress. My guess is that whoever did that used a non-rigid suit that was given pressurized air from the surface.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.deeperblue.com/ahmed-gabr-breaks-scuba-diving-world-record/" target="_blank">The record seems to be 332 meters, from 2014.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scuba gear doesn't necessarily need to be special. The ~100ft limit of recreational scuba is to avoid the divers needing a decompression stop, not because the gear can't handle it. I've done deeper dives without &quot;tec gear&quot; and as long as you know what you're doing (have tec training) and plan accordingly (possibly twin tanks/trimix/etc) the gear can go much deeper. Cheers :] </p>
<p>Edit: This is purely hypothetical. I do not suggest anyone with their padi aow reads a few articles and then tires this. Not worth the risk. All the pretty stuff tends to be in the top 60ft of water anyway. If you're drawn to wrecks take a tec course and hit me up.</p></div>		</li>
