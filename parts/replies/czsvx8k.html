<p>This is what makes the difference between a good teacher and a bad one. A bad teacher will take the material and talk at you, just hoping what they say sticks without any real understanding of the concepts or the information being given or given in a which will help people understand.</p>
<p>A good teacher will take the knowledge and make you understand it in simple terms, before giving you the details.</p>
<p>If only more teachers taught like this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you explain black holes the same way you explained mass in stars? I understand the basics but is a black hole really a hole or its it a very small, very dense star which collects matter? Does a black hole gain in mass, size, &amp; gravitational strength? What about hawking radiation? I've read that nothing escapes a BH, but this does? Thanks in advance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A black hole isn't truly understood. As of now we think of them as a singularity, or a single point of space of infinite density, surrounded by an event horizon. The event horizon is the point at which the escape velocity is the speed of light. </p>
<p>Think of trying to launch a cannon from the surface of Earth into space. If you launch the object fast enough it will exit the Earths gravitational field and never come back. The event horizon is the point where the escape velocity is the speed of light and so once crossed you can never get back out. Black holes can absorb mass and grow bigger, but they aren't cosmic vacuum cleaners. Gravity still behaves the same as it does normally. From far away, the gravity is the same as a star or planet of the same mass. For instance, if the sun instantly became a black hole, the orbits of the planets wouldn't change. It's only as you approach the event horizon that things get weird. For a sun sized black hole, the event horizon would be a sphere with a diameter of around 4 miles of so IIRC. </p>
<p>Hawking radiation is the result of so called &quot;virtual particles&quot;. I'll leave the explanation of that to someone with more knowledge though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hawking radiation occurs because space isn't <em>really</em> empty. A result of quantum mechanics is that matter can just pop into existence at any point at any time, however it usually collides with some anti-matter that can also pop into existence at any time and the pair annihilate. Think of the vacuum of space like static on a TV, where matter is always being created and destroyed but the <em>average</em> state is nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>Hawking radiation</strong> occurs when a pair spawns exactly on the event horizon of a black hole, with one particle able to escape and the other sucked in forever.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This ignores a fundamental difference between event horizons and ordinary escape velocities. It is possible to escape from Earth with even a very small speed as long as you provide a 1g thrust to counteract its gravity. In contrast, propulsion won't help you escape from a black hole, because once inside there are no directions that move you away from the center. In fact, propulsion will just make you reach the center faster (because the propulsion is moving you faster in <strong>some</strong> direction, and that direction is always toward the center). </p>
<p>Also, the singularity is not expected to exist in a correct quantum theory of gravity. When we talk about black holes, we normally look at their properties outside the event horizon and avoid talking about the singularity. For instance, the &quot;size&quot; of a black hole is not 0- it is the size of its event horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A black hole is a singularity - because there's no known force to stop the collapse, everything we know suggests that the mass literally collapses to a 0-dimensional point in space. The 'size' of a black hole is just its Swarzchild radius: the distance at which its escape velocity exceeds the speed of light (and therefore nothing that passes that radius can escape).</p>
<p>I'll let the other questions be answered by someone more qualified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the most interesting thing I find about black holes is that apparently the mass of a black whole is actually the surface area of the event horizon, divided by the planck length. So mind bogglingly the mass of a black hole is in the surface area NOT the volume.</p>
<p>Amongst other things this has led to the idea of reality as a hologram.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it's the radius of the black hole (or equivalently, square root of the surface area) that is proportional to its mass. The area is proportional to the entropy; maybe that's what you were thinking of?</p></div>		</li>

<p>In 1960, [...............] It was only in 2010 that the star was recognized as the most massive and luminous star known. Previous estimates had placed the luminosity as low as 1,500,000 L☉.[1]</p>
<p>R136a1 is the <strong>most massive star known</strong>, likely to be more than double the mass of Eta Carinae A, the Pistol Star, or the Peony Star.</p>
<p>At around 8,000,000 L☉, R136a1 is the <strong>most luminous star known</strong>, radiating more energy in five seconds than the Sun does in a year.</p>
<p>R136a1 is around thirty times the radius of the Sun (30 R☉; 21,000,000 km; 13,000,000 mi; ~1/7th of an astronomical unit) which corresponds to a volume over 20,000 times larger than the Sun.</p>
