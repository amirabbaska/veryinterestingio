			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that this only applies to cheap quality turkey like butterball. Higher quality deli meats will use whole turkey breast, often two of them glued together with a meat glue and then cooked in a round mold to retain that round shape. I've gotten meats from boars head and also a smaller company called Zoes meats and they both use whole turkey breast. You can tell because you actually see the grain in the meat and it's not just slimy.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that while water is added to keep it moist, it's really not all that much and doesn't add a significant amount of weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because boarshead is the one and only deli meat. I will never get anything else ever again if I can possibly avoid it. I just wish more stores carried it, I shop primarily at giant just because they carry it. I will never understand why Wegmans doesn't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>exactly, cheaper turkeys are either large chunks of turkey held together with ground up turkey, modified food starch and such.  Better turkey is whole muscle.  One thing to look for, if every turkey has a perfect, uniform shape, than its one with the fillers and has formed to the shape of the package that it was put in.  Better whole muscle turkey will be irregularly shaped, without additives other than some broth, spices and salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing you said is technically wrong, but it's far from accurate. I worked for a large deli meat manufacturer, if you've had sliced meat we most likely made it. It's a multibillion dollar industry with unthinkable amounts of money going into the research, development and marketing. A food scientist would be a great person to jump on here and shed some light. There are good videos on YouTube about how meat is made. It's not a simple as grabbing pieces and throwing corn starch on them. Your point about water is correct, it's part of the yield and in very fine detail the buyer (your deli or distributor) have agreed on having X percent weight by volume in liquid in each container. Your first fact about having to find something to do with all the leftover turkey is incorrect. It's a seasonal product that ramps up and then slows down based on the season, there is not a giant warehouse of product left over that must be somehow sold. Again, tons of money go into sales forcasting to avoid this. </p></div>		</li>

<p>For the average redditor, I would not recommend looking into how meat is made. It's pretty gross.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its actually various parts of the turkey ground into an enclosed container which then uses temperature and pH level to work it into a paste essentially and then formed into the logs your accustomed to seeing in a deli. Pretty much how all deli meats are made. Took a few animal protein classes in college. I love meats but knowing how they get the stuff to look/taste the way it does isn't something I would consider appetizing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of deli meat is whole muscles glued together with meat glue. You can tell when it is that cause even though it's perfectly round, the meat is still stringy (in chicken and turkey) or has areas with different amounts of fat and different meat textures (ham).</p></div>		</li>
