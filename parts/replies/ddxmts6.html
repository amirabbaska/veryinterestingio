			<div class="markdown"><p>We go on the assumption (which I think is safe) that for an environment to be suitable for life it must be capable of sustaining liquid water. Could there be conditions on an alien world which would sustain liquid water but inhibit carbon from making the bonds necessary to life as you described in your response (thus allowing another element to be the basis of life)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe really high pressures and temps that might favor polymers not based on C and with high UV that would degrade C bonds?  I think the other way to look at is if another 'solvent' could take the place of water and allow something like Si to take take the place of C.

Amazing how even under these extreme conditions- no light, killing heat- there is still life.  Some interesting differences, some amazing similarities. </p></div>		</li>
