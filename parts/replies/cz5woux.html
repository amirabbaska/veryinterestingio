			<div class="markdown"><p>Equivalent to the recent images of Pluto? That can only be done with a spacecraft flyby. A little back-of-the-envelope math here:</p>
<p>Prior to the New Horizons spacecraft getting an up-close look, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yZk5jVf.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> was our best image of Pluto. From Earth, the disc of Pluto spans about 0.1 arc-seconds.  At best, it spanned a couple pixels on the Hubble Space Telescope's imager, which has an angular resolution of 0.05 arc-seconds. You can get a slightly clearer image by doing a subpixel imaging technique known as dithering, but not much.</p>
<p>Now this new planet, if it really is somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 Earth-masses, probably has a diameter somewhere in the vicinity of 40,000 km, not quite Neptune-sized. When it's at perihelion (the closest it gets to the Sun), which is assumed to be around 200 AU, it should span about 0.25 arc-seconds. That should give us a 5 x 5 pixel image from Hubble...not great, but significantly better than the image of Pluto we had from Hubble.</p>
<p>The problem is that we don't think it's anywhere near its perihelion currently. It's aphelion (farthest from the Sun) is more like 1000 AU, which from Earth is going to span just 0.05 arc-seconds, about half the size of Pluto and right at the resolution limit of Hubble. We might see it as more than a pixel with dithering techniques, but not much. We could also wait for it to go from aphelion back to perihelion to get a clearer image...but that takes about 7500 years.</p>
<p>Sending a spacecraft is also pretty rough. Even if it were near perihelion, traveling at New Horizons speed a spacecraft would take a little over 40 years just to get there. Near aphelion, we're talking more like 200 years.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Wait 2000 years for a spacecraft to arrive, or 7500 years until it swings in closer to us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It took New Horizons 10 years traveling at 37 km/s to reach Pluto. For the sake of even numbers we'll say Pluto is 40 AU away. If Planet IX were near its perihelion of 200 AU, it would take ~50 years to get a similar probe there, at its likely perihelion of 600 - 1200 AU we start looking at 150 - 300 years to get there. Without great leaps in medical and cybernetics research, I'm afraid you're not going to see clear pictures if the planet exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just quoting something I read somewhere off the top of my head here, but 150 years is not a completely unrealistic lifespan these days. Some doctor predicted that the first person who would live 200 years had already been born.</p>
<p>No, I do not have a source ;-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dunno, I've read somewhere (a magazine years ago, sorry, no link) that probably there's some sort of &quot;genetic ceiling&quot; for our lifespans. That no matter what we do, we can't go far beyond 120. The next step would be <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11925154/Deleting-genes-could-boost-lifespan-by-60-per-cent-say-scientists.html" target="_blank">shutting genes down</a>, but I don't know how feasible is this on the short term and which other effects could have. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wildly naive to assume technology won't change.</p>
<p>Even if it didn't, the probe to Pluto is hardly the height of what we are capable of if more resources were available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it is. There are concepts for faster engines but at this point they are just that. Concepts. Theoretically those concepts can go to speeds up to 3 times that of New horizons i think. But the power source needed is on the MW order. So not practical for deep space exploration. </p>
<p>Also the extreme high speeds take a long time to accelerate and if you want to take decent pictures you need to slow down a little. I'm not even thinking about orbiting, because that would take even more time.</p>
<p>If i have to guess i would say that, in a decade from now maybe we could reach it in half the time... Maybe. If electric ion drives can get better at a decent pace, a really good rocket like falcon heavy is available and we can somehow manage the energy requirements. Even then it's still wishful thinking.</p></div>		</li>
