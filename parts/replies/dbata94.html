<p>If you have clean blocks of iron in a vacuum and you stick put them together they basically become one block, as there is nothing defining when one block end and the other begins.</p>
<p>This process is called cold welding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a bit misleading even for a five-year-old (who is not literally a five-year-old).</p>
<p>The proper way to explain it is saying that what we consider as &quot;touch&quot; doesn't mean the same thing in small scale because of the structure of matter, but we can still define &quot;touch&quot; in a way that makes sense as a &quot;hard contact between objects&quot; even in situations where there's always some &quot;void&quot; between objects.</p>
<p>An actual explanation would get in more complicated territory because it involves looking at the forces present on the interface between two objects as a function of range. The popular misconception is that &quot;touch&quot; is all about electromagnetic interaction between objects, but that's not really true - at certain range, there is usually an <em>attractive</em> electric force (van der Waals force, for example), which animals like geckos and insects and spiders use to adhere to surfaces.</p>
<p>Then there's typically a point where the force is zero - the attractive force and repulsive force balance each other out. This is often used as the meaningful boundary of &quot;touch&quot; in everyday world - this is the point where the pressure between two macroscopic objects starts to increase.</p>
<p>As the objects are pushed further forwards, the electric repulsive force rapidly increases, which is what is responsible for the pressure on the interface at this point. Increasing the pressure means the objects get a bit closer, until the electric repulsion is again balanced.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't mean you can push objects towards closer and closer. There is another sharp increase in the repulsive force as you reach a very small distance between the individual particles of the objects. And it turns out that this increased repulsive force is not produced by the electric fields of the electrons of the atoms, but rather by the Pauli exclusion principle which states that only one matter-particle can occupy a certain point in space at any given time (to be more accurate, two or more fermions can't have the same quantum state within a quantum system simultaneously).</p>
<p>This means that there really <em>is</em> a distance where we can say the atoms are &quot;touching&quot; because they can't really get closer to each other after they hit the distance where the Pauli exclusion principle kicks in. If you try to push them more together the force just increases further.</p>
<p>Or, alternatively, you increase the pressure so much that the atomic nuclei no longer have individual electrons and instead you're dealing with plasma on the interface. Which, unless you have something to contain it, will promptly escape from between the objects.</p>
<p>And if you can apply even more pressure to the plasma you can get the atomic nuclei so close to each other that they really do touch - but at that point it becomes energetically more favourable for them to fuse together into heavier elements, so the original nuclei no longer exist...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few corrections (not sure why this is so important to me):
Van der waals forces are predominantly repulsive, but some materials can have a significant attractive component.  Such materials are immediately obvious as they are sticky (the sicky being a result of the attractive component).</p>
<p>The Pauli exclusion principal comes 'somewhat' into play long before you are generating any plasma.   As you keep forcing against the repulsive van der waals you will eventually overcome the local chemical bond energy and the two objects will fuse (as the electrons re arange to ensure they have different quantum states).  If you keep pushing this rearagement will result in a plasma as you said,  but there are no chemical bonds left so insted of having two objects you now have a small firey sun (not quite but closer enough).</p>
<p>If you keep pushing you get the to the neutron degenercy pressure (after all the exciting nuclear reactions you mentioned). Our electrons have long since gone and the protons have become nutrons, all held apart by pauli exclusion. This is the higest possible density yet can also can be compressed further till you get a singularitly (or a blank hole if we take relativity into account).</p>
<p>Which leeds me to ask, why was the point of feeling van der waals forces not truly 'touching'?  I think it is the only definition that makes sense,  everything else is too destructive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the corrections!</p>
<p>And yeah, the crux of the matter (heh) is exactly that it makes perfect sense to define &quot;touching&quot; in atomic scale as something that doesn't destroy the atoms, or the objects the atoms are part of. So I jumped over a few steps towards plasma - you are absolutely correct that <em>interesting</em> things start to happen long before phase transition to plasma, and typically the &quot;touching&quot; objects don't survive most of them in a meaningful sense.</p>
<p>What I mainly wanted to express was that it's not &quot;just&quot; electric repulsive force that affects the contact force, and the misconception that there's no &quot;touching&quot; on molecular, atomic, or even sub-atomic level. Particles do, and <em>have</em> to touch each other. Sometimes directly, sometimes via proxy.</p>
<p>But here's an interesting point. At close range, electron interaction is relayed mostly by virtual photons producing the macroscopic electric force we all know (or whichever interpretation of field theory you wish to use). At long range, electron interaction is relayed by <em>actual</em> photons.</p>
<p>So, technically photons bouncing from one electron to another is, essentially, the electrons touching each other by proxy.</p>
<p>Which means that every time you look at a source of light, there is a contact by proxy between your retina and the source of that photon. While this may seem trivial for objects in our everyday life, try applying that to all the photons arriving to our eyes after travelling 2.5 million light-years from some particular atom from the surface of some particular star in Andromeda galaxy, touching a light-sensitive molecule in the back of your eye and triggering a visual detection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Perhaps you can clarify why this is untrue, since until the Pauli exclusion principle, you only talked about electrical forces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to be specific people say that it's all about a <em>repulsive</em> electric force caused by negative electrons getting close to each other, when in fact there is an <em>attractive</em> component to it as well, and the point where the objects can count to &quot;touch&quot; is actually at the neutral point between initial attraction that pulls nearby objects together, and the pressure you get when you push objects together. That's the most sensible rigorous definition of &quot;contact point&quot; in macroscopic physics.</p>
<p>The Pauli exclusion principle really starts to kick in at rather high pressures, and I think it's basically like trying to push the electron orbitals out of shape, so most of the time the chemical bonds within the object start giving out before that and you get deformation (squishing/bending/fracturing) rather than the interface between two objects getting any &quot;narrower&quot; after that point.</p>
<p>And then you got particle colliders, which raise a whole another level of questions about particles &quot;touching&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, nothing really touches. Everything fundamental, as far as we can tell, has no volume. Atomic radii are defined by electron clouds/orbits, nucleic radii are determined by the protons &amp; neutrons whose sizes are defined by their quarks which are sizeless points*. I guess you could consider two quarks being on the exact same point to be 'touching'.</p>
<p>Edit: * probably maybe. It's hard to tell but it kinda' looks that way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well the jury is still out on that one. Leading theories put it at either 1-dimensional (a line) or a point. We really don't the have the capability to measure which right now.</p></div>		</li>
