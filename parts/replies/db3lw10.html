			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it was a whole whack of Venera probes, and their progress <a href="https://medium.com/@hunterscott/what-a-soviet-spacecraft-on-venus-can-teach-you-about-failure-f74f9c970a45#.jgyyi838u" target="_blank">makes for an interesting read.</a></p>
<p>I especially like the comment about the lens cap popping off of one probe and falling exactly where the soil compressibility measuring device tried to do its task (they only got one chance to try).</p>
<p>So they sent a probe all the way to Venus and ended up measuring the compressibility of their camera lens cap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And their grand solution for the last probe was just to put a lanyard on the lens cap so it can't fall on the ground. Basic solution to a basic problem </p></div>		</li>
