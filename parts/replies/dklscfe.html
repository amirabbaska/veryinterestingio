			<div class="markdown"><p>Counter-point: 2D quasiparticles such as anyons behave as though they have non-half integer spins, where an exchange operation can shift the global phase by any unit complex number. In the case of s=2/5, you would have to exchange the particles 5 times to get back to the original state, and you would have cycled through the unit circle twice in doing so.
Obviously, you're correct in saying that all particles have half-integer spin, since all particles are inherently 3 dimensional, so using 2D quasiparticles may be cheating, but I think they most closely exhibit the effect OP was askng about...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Therefore, OPs can be reformulated for us physicist: What are the consequences if elementary particles with anyonic properties exist?<br />
To be honest anyons are a little bit to exotic for me. So what are their statistical properties? Can they also exist in three dimensions? </p></div>		</li>
