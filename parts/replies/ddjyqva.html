Communism fails not even because people are evil and want to hurt others (although we did have tyrants at the head of communist governments).  It fails because people are terrible at dealing with the myriad specific needs of their entire population.  One thing that technology has a potential (in the future) to do is be WAY better than a human could ever be at intelligently distributing wealth across the population.</p>
<p>Capitalism works because it delegates the authority to make personal decisions to the individual. This both works well with our psyche, and lets us at least try to ensure that our personal needs are met.  It doesn't, however, stop people from taking advantage of individuals, and there's an inherent inequality between those born to capitalist parents and those born to labor parents.  Capitalism also fails when the ability to compete starts to disappear, and the market for labor starts to disappear.</p>
<p>Communism wouldn't work because it requires decisions to be made by a person who can not possibly even be aware of all of the personal needs of all of the people they are trying to assist. Because of this, people get hurt, and are taken advantage of. </p>
<p>A computer is much better at certain kinds of decision making than humans are.  A sort of cyber-communism is possible as a replacement for a post-capitalist world, as it would be able to avoid the pitfalls of the capitalist systems we've previously seen in action.  But it's not likely going to be popular, not at first anyways.  It will be like self-driving cars though.  At first we will hate them because they will take away our freedom.  Then we will think it ridiculous that we ever didn't want self-driving cars because driving on our own is far too dangerous, and 10s of thousands of people were dying every year in the US because of it. </p>
<p>Capitalism is standard because factories make things, and people own factories because &quot;just anyone&quot; can't make them. Capitalism works as long as capitalists employ labor, and labor buys from capitalists.  This is changing, it's interesting what we will see happen in the future.  UBI is a likely first step, but we'll see from there. </p></div>		</li>
