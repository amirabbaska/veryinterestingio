			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little thrown off by your phrasing that Darwin and evolution were &quot;considered assaults on Christianity <em>because</em> of other unrelated stuff going on at the same time.&quot; </p>
<p>The things you go on to mention were certainly important; but there are any number of scholarly articles and books that detail just how/why evolution was controversial in Christendom -- and I don't think it can be reduced to Christianity having been made vulnerable by other earlier things. (Just to take one among many, check out the volume <em>Negotiating Darwin: The Vatican Confronts Evolution, 1877–1902</em>.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Einstein the father of modern Physics also believed in God! Granted 50 years later but that never interfered with his work or stardom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's primarily American Protestant sects that considered Darwin an assault on Christianity. The Catholic and Anglican churches were used to changing doctrine and dogma already, but the underpinning of many of the American protestants was that that changing doctrine was a corruption of the immutable word of God, handed down through the infallible sacred text of the Bible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, Catholics accept that, too.</p>
<p>Again though, in my comment I referred to the volume <em>Negotiating Darwin: The Vatican Confronts Evolution, 1877–1902</em>, which (among other related studies and volumes) charts the early Catholic reception of Darwin. Now, we might be able to speak of different attitudes here now in 2018; but you did say &quot;consider<em>ed</em> Darwin an assault on Christianity,&quot; as in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's often forgotten in these points that the 'disestablishment of Genesis' did <em>not</em> start with Darwin at all. These things - results from geology, fossils, the birth of geophysics and so on - started in the century before him. </p>
<p>It was the discovery by others that the world was far, far older than previously thought which enabled Darwin's theory.  Evolution doesn't work as an explanation if there isn't enough time to evolve the species we see.
This had been known to geologists for decades before Darwin, since the late 18th century. Even if the exact age was a subject of fierce debate at that time.</p>
<p>So there's a common misconception on the history of science when this comes up, but there's also a misconception on the history of Christianity as well. Because the fundamentalists want to pretend that their version of the religion is the original they act like nobody had ever doubted Genesis as a literal account of history before Darwin. Making him a target and scapegoat. When the truth is that there's been theologians throughout history - going back to early church fathers like Saint Augustine - who've held the creation story in Genesis to be allegorical.</p>
<p>Yet another point here is that, even if Darwin met with plenty of resistance from many (but not all) in the religious community in his day, ultimately rationalism <em>won</em>. Darwin's side won over most Christians. The Anglican church is not creationist, nor is the Catholic, nor the Lutheran state churches of northern Europe, nor are many of the USA's 'mainline protestant' groups.</p>
<p>The difference here is that America had a backlash against in the 20th century and turned to fundamentalist evangelical protestantism. The more moderate 'mainline' denominations are no longer the majority of American protestants. It's not just views on evolution that sets them apart. American protestants now subscribe to all manners of extreme ideas that most Christians in the West do not: demonic possession, speaking in tongues, the 'rapture', prosperity gospel, witchcraft, faith healing, scriptural support for the modern state of Israel, and that the end times are imminent. </p>
<p>It's saddening to keep seeing Americans raised in this environment who think that this is all what Christianity is, despite the fact that it's not only not what most Christians in the world believe, it's not even what most Protestants in the USA believed some 70 years ago, before Billy Graham, Pat Robertson and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the reason American evangelicals pretty much were the outliers is that Origin of Species came during the decline of the Second Great Awakening, and the Sothern Baptist Convention had formed only in the past few decades and already felt extremely threatened by reduced interest in religion, the changes to their wy of life that the abolition of slavery brought, the establishment of black churches, and the rise of other competing Baptist congregations. Other Christian sects that felt less threatened in general felt less threatened by evolution, but the Southern Baptists were in crisis throughout the 19th century.</p>
<p>(edit) forgot to say that the 20th century fundamentalism you mentioned was people turning to SBC churches and offshoots, which had held since the 19th century that Darwin was Satan in disguise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know I already responded, but you bring up another interesting element that people often overlook, fossils and what they meant to the creationist ideals. Fossils showed unequivocally that there were animals that used to live on Earth but don't now. Even if those animals were all created in 6 days and saved from the flood by Noah, that extinction happens at all is an affront to God's infallibility, as perceived in the middle of the 19th century.</p></div>		</li>
