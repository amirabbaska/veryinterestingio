			<div class="markdown"><p>I liked this post a lot more than the ones voted up above you. Dopamine also plays an important role in the intestines (see: mechanism of a medication called reglan). Always thought it was interesting how the enteric nervous system is like a separate brain just for your GI</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Since you seem really knowledgeable on this topic I wanted to ask you a question. I’m a soon to be neuroscience major graduate, and I just finished a class with a really intelligent professor on the biology of the neuron. In a brief section on dopamine, he reiterated over and over again that it is a neuro<em>modulator</em> and not a neurotransmitter. In a review session for our final I asked if that was a simplification he was making or is a hard rule, despite the fact that all the papers I’ve read have called it a neurotransmitter. He said Wikipedia has a lot of contributors who don’t do actual research and went on answering other questions. </p>
<p>Is dopamine really not a neurotransmitter, and is incapable of directly initiating action potentials? If not, what do you think would lead him to say that it is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscience PhD student here. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter and a neuromodulator (those two things are not mutually exclusive). It's a neuromodulator because it can't solely excite or inhibit by itself, it can only alter the ability of another signaling molecule to excite or inhibit (glutamate and GABA, respectively). Having dopamine onboard won't cause sufficient depolarization to cause an AP, but it <em>will</em> make it easier for glutamate to initiate an AP. Dopamine can bring the cell closer to the AP threshold but it can't get it over the hump. Same idea for a hyperpolarization and GABA. </p>
<p>Other neurotransmitters can also be neuromodulators, like serotonin, or norepinephrine. </p></div>		</li>
