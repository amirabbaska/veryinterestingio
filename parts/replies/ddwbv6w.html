			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a thing once that said birds have regional accents and that if you take a group of birds from one region and a group from another and make them live together they'll create a new accent. I've no idea as to the validity of it but I'll be impressed with the patience of the scientist who discovered it if its true.</p></div>		</li>

Mainly consisting of body language it is true. But the body along with the sounds..  Language. And we ALL speak earthling </p></div>		</li>
