			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? Interesting... I certainly wouldn't wanna fuck up those annoying CAPTCHA's from Google, the creepiest and shadiest company on Earth. </p>
<p>No no, why would I have any problems with a company that basically functions as ideological tool used to manipulate the masses. That and its also basically a branch of the NSA that spies on all of us.</p>
<p>Excuse my, I am gonna go and make sure <em>I don't fuck up those CAPTCHAs</em>!</p></div>		</li>
