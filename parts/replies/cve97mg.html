<p>If the federal government were to drop marijuana prohibition, would it simply &quot;magically&quot; become -legal- in states where it has previously decriminalized?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.  That would be up to the state government.  They may very well continue to treat marijuana offenses like traffic violations, levying minor fines. </p>
<p>Just realized, though, that there may be some issues here of federal preemption... Depends on how the law was written in the state.  It can't directly conflict with federal law, but I can't think deeply enough right now (too much wine) to consider if a fine would be enough of a conflict to the warrant a look by the courts.  I'll check back in when I'm sober lol.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, it would. In states that don't have laws banning marijuana use / possession, marijuana would become completely legal. In states that still have marijuana bans on the books, it would still be an arrestable offense under state law.</p></div>		</li>
