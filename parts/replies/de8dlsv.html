			<div class="markdown"><p>The fate of the Universe in standard cosmology is completely unknown even in bog-standard ΛCDM as the experimentally determined spatial curvature of the Universe is compatible with zero. It's a pencil standing on its tip; if it falls to the left you have the heat death, to the right a big crunch. And on top of that you have many popular extensions or modifications (which might lead to things like a big rip). And even if you have some confidence in a specific model believing it makes perfect sense for more than a few tens of billions of years is already cocky. This Poincaré-recurrence sort of times literally <em>crush</em> any reasonable time frame for the applicability of <em>any</em> physical model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recall the early example in physics lessons of the checker board covered in counters. A radom one is chosen to move one space (to an adjacent square). After many moves the distribution reveals the familiar pattern of equilibrium. An enightening and chilling moment. It all fades away eventually. Then again; as for what might pop up eventually? Anything.</p></div>		</li>
