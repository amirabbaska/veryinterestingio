			<div class="markdown"><p>Asimov's <em>Last Question</em> (unless I'm misremembering) is about the birth of universes, rather than stars. We have already observed huge numbers of places in the universe where new stars are forming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was about the whole idea of &quot;the sun will eventually burn out, so humans will have to go somewhere else, but those suns will eventually burn up too, we can force new stars into existence, but that requires more energy than the stars will produce, how can we stop and revert the entropy of the universe?&quot; It's an excellent quick read, I can't recommend it enough

<p>Aren't those places really far off though, ie. very much in the past? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Last Question in the story is how to reverse entropy. The final result of entropy is theorized to be the heat death of the universe, where all energy has been evenly distributed through the cosmos, giving no room for any sort of reaction to happen ever again.</p>
<p>You could imagine the energy in our universe as water in a glass. At the moment of the big bang, all the water was poured in and swished around for a bit. As it started to settle, it became less turbulent and allowed for the formation of galaxies, star systems, and life (where we are in the timeline). But eventually, that water is going to settle into a final state, after which it will never move again.</p>
<p>Whether the glass is expanding or not, the water will still settle. You'd either need a way to shake the glass from the outside or a new glass altogether.</p>
<p>Also for those who haven't read The Last Question, I'd recommend it.</p>
