			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer, and nice way of sneaking in multiple infiinities in your field analogy.</p>
<p>Here's my question: using your &quot;field of people&quot; analogy, the field (that is, space) gets bigger, but the people (particles, stars, etc.) don't. Does this mean that the quantization of space essentially got smaller (higher-res)? That is, if the apparent distance between galaxies (but not gravitationally-bound things within a galaxy?) increases after the big bang, doesn't that mean that either there is &quot;more&quot; space or that the fundamental units of space (at the Planck level) are increasing in size?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that we don't know enough about what a fundamental unit of space is to be able to answer this question.  For instance, we don't know if space and/or time is quantized or not.  If I'm wrong I'd love to hear otherwise though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, all indications are that space and time are quantized at least in that anything below the Plank unit of space or time has no meaning. If this weren't the case quantum mechanics would have a lot of 'splainin' to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be very wrong but I do believe that similar to gravity, larger objects are affected more. This means when the universe expands instead of the distance between two atoms increasing at the same speed the distance between two galaxies increases the galaxy superstructures are affected much more. I think this is because of the strength between the two objects. Gravity (the weakest physical force) is what holds superstructures of galaxies together but really the bond between these objects is relatively low, so low that the expansion of the universe is stronger than gravity and therefore increases the distance between galaxies. Quarks however are bound together by strong interaction (the strongest physical force). That is why they are not torn apart by the expansion of the universe. However the universe is also increasing the rate at which it expands at so one day the expansion of the universe will be faster than the speed at which quarks can pull themselves back together at. at this point the universe will essentially die because no interaction can ever happen between particles. This may not happen though because the universe may slow down the expansion and actually start to contract, but I know so little on that and all of physics really that I wont go into it. </p>
<p>Hopefully this isn't completely wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say the universe <em>may</em> be infinitely large and then use an infinite field in your analogy to explain the expansion of the universe. Haven't you already assumed the universe is infinitely large by that analogy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  In that case you can replace &quot;Infinite sea of people&quot; with &quot;Infinite sea of people as far as you can tell&quot; or perhaps &quot;So many people that you could never tell if it was infinite or not, no matter what tests you ran&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that help me though? If you tell me something is so big I can't tell if it's infinite, then I can imagine it like a balloon if only I analogize it so, in which case I would be implicitly assuming that it is not infinite. And if I imagine it is infinite...what does that even mean? How do you imagine something is infinite? That seems to me to be the very problem we're trying to solve, or at least on the same level of difficulty.</p>
<p>I'm being honest here, I don't feel any closer to understanding how there can be no center of the universe using the analogy of a balloon.</p></div>		</li>
