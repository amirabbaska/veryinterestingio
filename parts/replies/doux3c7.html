			<div class="markdown"><p>I know <em>a lot</em> about locusts, but not so much about other species of insect, so keep in mind that this most likely isn't true for all insects:</p>
<p>The exoskeleton isn't one single rigid structure, but it's made up of many different parts. All of these parts are connected by membranes, which allow the different parts of the exoskeleton to move relative to each other. A young female might for example have the bits connected by very tight membranes. When she matures and develops eggs (which can make up more than half of the entire body weight), the membranes will loosen, allowing the abdomen to expand. So to start of, their bodies are a lot more flexible than one might expect from an exoskeleton.</p>
<p>As for overeating, that's something that locusts just don't do. They're constantly eating until their gut is literally full. Once there's room for more food, they start eating again. Of course, their food is fairly low in nutrients (grass and bits of other locusts). I've never tested or read about what happend when you feed them on a very high-calorie diet, but I can only assume that negative feedback loops would set in before the animal would burst out of its seems.</p></div>		</li>
