			<div class="markdown"><p>We're fat (well actually I'm not, I'm a local driver so I eat healthy and get exercise) because there aren't many healthy food options for us out there. Not all of us can have a cooler in our trucks either for a variety of reasons. Some trucks have a built in mini fridge which is nice.</p>
<p>For some drivers, the company won't let them have plug in coolers, and grabbing ice everyday for your regular cooler isn't practical.</p>
<p>I had a camping stove in my truck with a built in mini fridge, the trucks that didn't have one, I installed one myself anyway whether or not the company allowed it. My health is not worth their shit policies. I was able to eat good (not healthy) as a result. </p>
<p>Truck stops have nothing but high carb, high fat fried foods, and the healthy food is flavorless and plain. It's quite literally on par with cafeteria or buffet food.</p>
<p>Basically, not much exercise, and shitty food. It makes you fat, raises your blood pressure, and eventually leaves you with more problems than you thought were possible in the end.</p>
<p>These wooly mammoth mother fuckers drinking sometimes literally a gallon of soda everyday doesn't help either. You should see the loyalty cup at truck stops, literally 1 US gallon at some.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any sort of muscular movement will, of course, burn calories (in addition to those normally burned during a resting state). In practice though, I'd be surprised to find that it's a meaningful amount. As in, probably not enough to log in a fitness app but likely more than if you were just sitting still at a desk all day (maybe compare it to sitting on an exercise ball)</p></div>		</li>
