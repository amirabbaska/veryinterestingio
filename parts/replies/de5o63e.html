			<div class="markdown"><p>No the constancy of the speed of light in all reference frames is literally the second postulate of special relativity: 1) The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, 2) speed of light is the same in all frames:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is always the same according to every observer. Your conception of distance and rate at which time pass change relative to others in order to make this possible.</p>
<p>This is because of the geometry of spacetime, where the equivalent for Pythagoras' theorem (a^2 +b^2 =c^2 ) which includes time is (a^2 -t^2 =b^2 ), note the minus sign.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The correct abbreviation is &quot;h&quot;, but people sometimes often it for hr because, unlike the K in Kelvin or m in minute, the h in hour isn't really pronounced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you listen to someone say &quot;heich&quot; instead of &quot;eich&quot; like the weird non americans do it begins to grate on you after a while so making them say hour instead saves sanity.</p>
<p>Otherwise I'm not sure theres a good reason besides just habit of use for everyone.</p></div>		</li>
