My Mrs screaming to turn it down means she needs to come in to the room and see the damn sex scene of course 'stop watching your porn!' She'll shout and slam a door - Then the baby wakes up and I turn it down too low and miss who John Snow's dad was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello fellow MCO. </p>
<p>I'm in community TV so our standards are around -12dB for everything. We don't air commercials but most of the PSAs we receive are in that ballpark. Though some shows come in only at -20. Each of our stations seems to have a different way of doing things. So yes, it's often the case of the show being too quiet rather than the commercial being too loud. But it's all relative as far as the viewer is concerned. Unfortunately (Gr)ass Valley broke our ability to adjust audio levels on the fly in the last update for our automation software. </p></div>		</li>
