			<div class="markdown"><p>And in the near future with ATSC 3.0, companies may buy towers to broadcast their digital content and deliver it to your phone/laptop/whatever via RF, just like you can with TV.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people are going to be pissed off because to get over the air TV, they'll need to buy an ATSC 3.0 converter much like when the US made the jump to digital back in 2005 and people needed to buy the boxes to decode the signal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I think most people can plan for a new OTA settop box (or new TV, if you want...) every 10-15 years, give or take.</p>
<p>I can't wait for ATSC 3.0. 4kp60 HDR sports and news will make a lot of people happy!</p></div>		</li>
