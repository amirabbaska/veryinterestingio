			<div class="markdown"><p>The Planck constant is the quantum of action in quantum mechanics, meaning in quantum mechanical processes we have only observed work in integer amounts of the Planck constant.</p>
<p>Our understanding of gravity is based on Einstein's (and other's) work on general relativity. These theories are incompatible with quantum mechanics and we don't yet know how to make sense of that problem. So we basically don't know what would happen at those scales, and we can't measure it because our instruments aren't good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It's a common misunderstanding that Planck units are some sort of quantum, some smallest possible value or unit. The truth is that Planck units are simply the units you get when you eliminate the universal constants by normalizing them to 1. Some Planck units like time and length are very small, but others such that mass and energy are quite large.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't know the answer to this yet. </p>
<p>First, there's really no such &quot;thing&quot; as gravity. Gravity is what we call a &quot;fictitious force.&quot; When you turn in a car and feel &quot;centrifugal force&quot; pushing you out toward the door, that is a &quot;fictitious force.&quot; It's a force that only exists in a certain observation frame where the laws of inertia don't hold.</p>
<p>What we do have is General Relativity which tells us being at one constant distance from a body (like standing on the ground) is <em>not</em> an inertial reference frame. Inertial frames are 'free fall' frames. Thus, there is a 'fictitious force' of gravity that comes about because of our non-inertial reference frame choice.</p>
<p>Anyway, the deeper underlying thing is what we call the &quot;curvature field,&quot; how much space-time curves in response to mass. This field <em>may</em> be quantized (in that there exist smallest possible particulate excitations), but we've neither a complete mathematical theory of how it would be, nor observations to guide us on how to best make that theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Changes in gravitation field propagate at light speed, as far as I know. So are they bent around curvatures in space, ie do these changes propagate in the same paths as light? </p>
<p>If a supernova went off but we couldn't see the light because of a black hole directly between us and it, would we still notice a gravitational change? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the answer to your first question. My guess would be yes. </p>
<p>The second question, at best we'd maybe see some gravitational waves from a supernova (but I think they'd be even weaker than the kinds we expect to see from orbiting black holes and the like). And I'd <em>guess</em>, again that they'd diffract around a black hole, but I don't know there either.</p></div>		</li>
