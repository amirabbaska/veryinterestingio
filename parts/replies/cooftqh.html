			<div class="markdown"><p>Another lawyer here (one who's taking the bar exam in a second state next week). There could be <em>mens rea.</em> As you pointed out, according to the definition of second-degree murder, one is guilty of reckless (Model Penal Code)/depraved-heart (common law) murder if he acts with conscious disregard of human life. </p>
<p>One cannot consent to murder. And the fact that the company discloses the risks and the astronauts assume the risk is relevant in tort, but not criminal law. (You can't assume the risk of being the victim of a crime.) </p>
<p>The &quot;good news&quot; is that the company can't be prosecuted for murder until any deaths occur, and can't be prosecuted for attempted murder because one needs specific intent to kill rather than recklessness to be guilty of attempt. (They could still be prosecuted for reckless endangerment.)</p>
<p>Sending the astronauts to Mars will almost certainly be both a but-for cause and proximate cause of their death. They will probably die of lack of resources (oxygen, food, water) or exposure to the natural elements (cold, dust, insufficient atmosphere). Both of these categories are foreseeable causes (in the case of exposure to the elements, arguably an intervening cause, but foreseeable nonetheless). </p>
<p>Even if one of the astronauts dies of natural causes (heart attack, cancer), that will likely be considered a foreseeable risk exacerbated by sending them into space.</p>
<p>They could also be liable in tort for wrongful death unless all their family members sign waivers. (There is intent in tort, because intent to kill can be inferred when one acts with the knowledge that the probable result will be death.)</p>
<p>Edit: also, &quot;reckless heart murder&quot; is not a thing. You're confusing reckless murder and depraved heart murder, which are basically the same thing. Reckless/depraved heart murder is not manslaughter. Manslaughter is either negligent homicide or voluntary homicide mitigated by some other factor, like provocation or imperfect self-defense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it applies to everything. The question in American law is whether the defendant's behavior was so reckless as to constitute a conscious disregard for human life. It's a question of fact for a jury (in America at least) to decide. The American law is this: if a reasonable juror could find that an activity was reckless and that the recklessness was the cause of death, then the a defendant can prosecuted and tried for murder. </p>
<p>There are plenty of dangerous activities that are not considered reckless. People have survived climbing the highest mountains. Allowing someone to climb K2 or any other peak could be done reasonably or recklessly.</p>
<p>It would not be reasonable to say that sending someone into space in itself is reckless. (Given that humans regularly travel to space.) I don't think any judge would allow the prosecution of a space travel company just because it sends people into space.</p>
<p>Nor is any Mars mission automatically reckless. Sending someone to Mars is <em>probably</em> not reckless, given that we've been to the moon and people have lived in space for as long as a round trip to Mars would take. The more tested the technology and more sound the theory (calculations, psychology) the less likely it is to be considered reckless. </p>
<p>Sending someone to Mars without technology demonstrated to be able to sustain them there <em>and</em> no means to return is probably reckless. </p>
<p>The Mars One project involves sending a lander to manufacture resources for the crew. We don't have a good approximation of the Martian environment, and the crew will launch before any meaningful amount of time has passed to be able to determine whether such a machine is viable.</p>
<p>I should add: Although they couldn't be prosecuted for murder until someone dies, Mars One could be prosecuted for reckless endangerment once the launch occurs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>My understanding of CL murder puts you spot on. </p>
<p>Depending on the state statute, they could also be found guilty of second degree murder as well. Punishable by being choked by llamas per the 8th amendment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Depraved heart murder&quot; is the actual name of the crime. Apparently there is a band called &quot;Depraved&quot; and they have a song called &quot;heart murder.&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swLMIALCshw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swLMIALCshw</a> (Warning: it's pretty bad.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if the person who wrote that comment was completely serious. Like he's a 13 year old kid that made a band with his friends and to him, new words are a &quot;first come first serve&quot; situation so he just claimed that as his new band name. And now, he's getting upvotes just reassuring him that the internet is now aware of his new found band name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure disclosing the risks, or even getting waivers, is enough. Criminal Laws are not subservient to a contract between a criminal and their victim so you can't waive something like criminal negligence/recklessness. The law does not say get permission before you negligently or recklessly endanger people's lives, it's says to not endanger people's lives. </p>
<p>This is not really different from deaths involving other forms of transportation. A bus company can make you sign all the waivers they want, but if they let a known drug addict drive a poorly maintained bus in a major snowstorm and a bunch of people die, they are still potentially criminally negligent/reckless. However, if despite taking reasonable precautions, an accident occurs, they would not be criminally negligent. </p>
<p>In this case I think it really depends on what it is that kills them. If a massive solar storm hits and kills the crew on the way there, that would likely simply be a risk of space travel and create no criminal liability. If, on the other hand, they build a spaceship on the cheap and it fails in some reasonably preventable way, I'd say they could be in a world of hurt. </p>
<p>Though, thankfully, there is zero chance of them actually getting off the ground. If anything they'll be facing fraud charges. </p></div>		</li>
