<p>Unrelated to sl(2,C) (to my knowledge) but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9702052" target="_blank">this paper by Tegmark</a> looks into the same question and approaches it from an anthropic angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I'm confused and maybe you can clear this up for me - doesn't general relativity require a warping of space-time, and that warping would happen in an additional dimension? That gravity forces are actually geodesics in a higher dimensional space? I thought general relativity necessitated a 5th &quot;spatial&quot; dimension beyond 3d space + time because of this. Is my thinking flawed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, curvature is an intrinsic property of a space (technically what we call a smooth manifold with affine connection) and curvature does not in any way require embedding into a higher dimensional space. Curvature measures the extent to which transporting data around a tiny loop in the space fails to bring it back to its original state. See the illustrations in the wiki article on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomy" target="_blank">holonomy</a> for a nice example of what I mean in the case of a sphere.</p>
<p>Geodesics are just the straight lines in the space, and represent the trajectories of particles without any forces acting on them (free-falling particles in physics lingo).</p>
<p>For example, on a 2-sphere with its usual metric (distance measurement) the geodesics are the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle" target="_blank">great circles</a> and these live on the sphere, not in some higher dimensional space.</p></div>		</li>
