			<div class="markdown"><p>My phone is the only USB C device I own, and came with a USB A to C charger. I bought a couple more USB A to C cables for my other chargers, but have yet to see any benefit from the change. I forsee a very long transition period because plenty of new stuff still doesn't have USB C. For example, my Kindle is really old but even the new ones still have USB micro. Are USB C keyboards a thing yet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with partial adoption like that, I think the C connector is a big improvement over the Micro USB connector - it seems less fragile, and it's reversible. That's quite enough to keep me happy about my phone while the rest of the industry catches up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does look like it might be less fragile, so that's a very good thing because I've worn out a lot of USB micro cables (even though I tend to buy decent quality e.g. Anker branded).  The reversible thing doesn't help quite so much because when I fumble for a cable there's a 50:50 chance it will be USB micro.  Thinking now I should have chosen different colour cables to make it easier to tell them apart.  Still, it will all be much better in the long run, and it's not any worse now.</p></div>		</li>
