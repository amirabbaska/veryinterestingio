			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes balls of steel to say &quot;No go&quot; on launch day - even for software that isn't mission critical. Because that is the last thing you will ever say while receiving a paycheck. It will be the right thing to do, but you will be finished in that industry forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it. She should not have been in that job if she was not ready to have that moment in her life. Every project manager eventually faces a situation where their project is fucked on launch day, and no one wants to hear it, but stopping the launch is their job. </p>
<p>In fact, a lot of people face that moment in their lives, and we all need to be prepared. That moment when your boss tells you to do something completely unethical, and you known that refusing is going to be the end of your career, and possibly even cost you your family, but it is the right thing to do. Eventually you get there.</p>
<p>I killed my career ten years ago by refusing to fire someone many years ago. It sounds easy. But in the moment, it is very, very hard to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Heavy is the head that wears the crown. Don't put the thing on unless you can take the weight.</p></div>		</li>
