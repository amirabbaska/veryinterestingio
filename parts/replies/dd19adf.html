<p>It's in situations like these I like to point to James Randi,</p>

<p>I would like to mention that IMO Randi himself is not an honest person. I was a big fan of his for years and spent a lot of time on Randi.org, but after a while it becomes obvious that he's just another person with followers. And he is certainly willing to bend the truth, if not tell outright lies, when it suits him.</p>
<p>For a balanced look I might recommend the chapter on him in this book: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/17715-the-true-believer-thoughts-on-the-nature-of-mass-movements" target="_blank">https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/17715-the-true-believer-thoughts-on-the-nature-of-mass-movements</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there specific criticisms you have?</p>
<p>In my limited experience he seems to employ experts whenever possible and provide as much evidence as is reasonable given the formats in which he is speaking. </p>
<p>That said, the idea that he might be twisting some facts to more closely align with his message would be disheartening. </p></div>		</li>
