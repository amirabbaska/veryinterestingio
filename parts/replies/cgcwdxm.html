			<div class="markdown"><p>A slight correction about &quot;electrolyte fluids:&quot;</p>
<p>It is true that &quot;hormonal&quot; effects, in addition to sympathetic and parasympathetic influences, will selectively constrict different regions of the body's vasculature. In an emergent situation, this can occur regionally in order to selectively maintain perfusion to essential structures like the heart and brain, while temporarily shunting blood away from less-critical processes (like reproduction and digestion). Once your total body water falls to a critical level, however, your kidneys will freak out (as the most vital purpose, that they will sacrifice all other filtering qualities in order to protect, is to <em>maintain the blood pressure</em>) and both release hormones to globally constrict your vasculature (raises the blood pressure) and also to limit the amount of fluid that it lets out as urine (keeps the blood pressure up)</p>
<p>After fluid is added to the body, whether by absorption through the digestive tissue or by IV injection, the distribution of this fluid between the body's fluid compartment and tissues is determined by the ingested/injected fluid's osmolality. This is due to the fact that large and polarized ions cannot easily pass through the plasma membrane of a cell wall. If you were to simply drink water, the water will easily pass through the wall, matching the relative proportions that are already established (~2/3 outside of the cells in what is called Total Body Water and ~1/3 inside the cells).</p>
<p>If you were to inject pure water by IV, this would very, very rapidly reduce the total osmolality of the blood (meaning it would dilute the particles that are in the blood such that they are now less concentrated). Due to the properties of osmosis, this would mean that a large amount of water would rush outside of the blood and into the cells, in an attempt to quickly make the solute concentrations in the blood and cells the same. Unfortunately, when this occurs clinically, so much water would rush into the brain that your brain would swell (called edema) and you would either suffer brain damage or just die (bummer).</p>
<p>SO that's why, if you are injected with just fluid, it's in a form called D5W (or 5% dextrose in water). When you first inject it, there's enough dextrose (a type of sugar) in the solution that the water is OK chilling in the blood at first and doesn't rush into the cells, which would make your brain swell. Your body like processing sugar, though, so that dextrose is rapidly metabolized. As the sugar is metabolized and it's concentration in the blood decreases, the fluid THEN passes into the cells, through the osmotic process described above.</p>
<p>BUT WHAT ABOUT SALINE?</p>
<p>Often, if a patient is not severely dehydrated, they will be given &quot;saline&quot; or salt water by IV drip. If it is &quot;isotonic&quot; saline, or saline that has the same concentration of salt that is in the blood, then the salt will not be able to pass through the membrane and the water that is associated with it will just chill in the blood. This will raise the amount of fluid in that's in the blood but NOT add any additional fluid to the tissues. Let's say you just cut off your arm and have lost a lot of blood, it makes more sense to do this in order to add more fluid to your blood, or <strong>raise your blood pressure</strong> so that the blood that you still have can go to critical areas (heart, brain, ect.).</p>
<p>Let's say, for argument's sake, that your doctor wanted to kill you and injected you will a large amount of pure water. As I described above, this will cause too much fluid to go to your tissues, and your brain will swell (which is bad). Let's assume that your doctor was promptly tackled by hospital security and your case was taken on by a more understanding physician, they would likely give you <strong>hypertonic</strong> saline, or saline that has a higher concentration of salt than is regularly found in your blood (alternatively, some ERs will simply give you bouillons of chicken/vegetable stock, the main point is to make your blood more salty). Again, the salt will not be able to pass through the cell membrane, and your blood will initially be more salty than your tissues (including your brain). Because water CAN pass through the cell membrane, it will rush out from the tissues, back into the bloodstream, until the blood is diluted to the point that it is again equally salty to the tissues.</p>
<p>This is the same principal that makes a high-salt diet bad for you: In addition to lots of details regarding how the kidney regulates your salt, a large amount of salt in your blood will pull a lot of fluid into your blood, raising your blood pressure (which has many negative health consequences).</p>
<p>Here's a nice diagram to explain my thoughts:

			<div class="markdown"><p>A caveat is that large volumes of isotonic fluids would have the same/similar effects as &quot;pure water&quot; if you are sufficiently dehydrated. If your blood is relatively hypoosmolar, then the body is going to try to correct that. And if you've been dehydrated long enough, your brain will produce idiogenic osmoles to protect itself, and once that extra water (even from isotonic fluids) comes into play, you will still get a rapid influx into the brain tissue/cerebral edema. It doesn't have to be pure water; isotonic crystalloids can also be bad if you've been hypernatremic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any way you could become dehydrated. Lack of water intake, water loss through vomiting or diarrhea, etc. An example that comes to mind is a cat who was accidentally locked in a room for 5 days without water or anything; we had to carefully rehydrate him while rechecking his sodium frequently to make sure it didn't drop too quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under <em>very</em> extreme circumstances (marathon runners who are extremely dehydrated chugging tons of water) then it can be bad:

<p>As I explain above, this is properly corrected by obtaining direct access to the blood with a needle and injecting either salt water (saline) or sugar water (D5W).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it would be negative to drink a large amount of water, especially if you have been dehydrated for a long period of time - more likely a scernario in the &quot;wandering the desert&quot; situation versus running a 10k or something. It takes your brain hours to generate the compounds that, while normally helpful, could invite swelling with rapid rehydration (whether oral or intravenous), so if you have become dehydrated quickly or less severely, it's less of a risk.</p></div>		</li>
