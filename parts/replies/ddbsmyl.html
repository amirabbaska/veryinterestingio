			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the one piece I'd like clarification on. If supplements are necessary, then a person with fat on their bones would die, but from malnutrition rather than starvation. Right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Many (most?) vitamins that we need are water soluble, so they don't build up in the body. That means you need to get them periodically or there will be some adverse health outcome. So if you have a lot of spare fat and starve yourself, you can die due to lack of vitamins and minerals that you need even though you have enough energy stores to keep going. It's a bit like a car engine that's full of gas but has no motor oil, bad things happen despite plenty of fuel.</p>
<p>For a similar reason, you will sometimes hear about outbreaks of scurvy on college campuses. Scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C, which is pretty hard to do with any reasonable modern diet. But you get people who eat nothing but pizza rolls and then wind up with a nutrient deficiency that could eventually kill them, even though they have more than enough calories.</p></div>		</li>
