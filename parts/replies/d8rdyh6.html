			<div class="markdown"><p>The corals are bleaching.  Most corals (but not all) have a symbiotic partnership with a type of <del>algae</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromalveolata" target="_blank">chromalveolata</a> called zooxanthellae, which lives in the tissues of the coral.  The coral protects the algae with its stinging cells and by generally being poisonous as hell, and the algae shares food that it photosynthesizes with the coral.  Corals are animals, though, so they can also just eat stuff, mostly filter feeding (some corals do not have zooxanthellae algae, they just filter feed).</p>
<p>When stressed, like for instance when the water gets too warm, the corals flush all their zooxanthellae out of their tissue.  Scientists are not entirely sure why they do this.  The zooxanthellae is where corals get all the <a href="https://cdn.reefbuilders.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/01/Jourdys-90-Zoa-reef-tank.jpg" target="_blank">ridiculously amazing colors</a> you see.  The zooxanthellae can also be killed by toxic substances in the water that don't kill the coral, leaving them without their algae.  Just to give you an idea, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Tomato_anemonefish.jpg" target="_blank">here's what a typical anemone might look like</a>, and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7259868-3x2-940x627.jpg" target="_blank">here's a bleached anemone with no zooxanthellae</a>.  The latter anemone is still alive, but it may not be for long.</p>
<p>When a coral bleaches, it's possible that it can absorb algae from the environment and start over.  However, that's not usually very likely.  Usually, once a coral bleaches, it slowly dies.  And once the living tissue is gone, pest algae species will grow on top of the skeleton and prevent new coral tissue from recolonizing it.  About 20% of the Great Barrier Reef is bleached out, meaning the corals are either already dead, or dying.  The algae is gone.  And since it's <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7859632-3x2-700x467.png" target="_blank">huge swaths of the reef</a> all bleached out, it's very hard for the corals to pick up zooxanthellae, because none of their neighbors have any, either.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for the GBR bleaching.  A great deal of it has to do with global climate change.  While a two degree average increase may not sound like much, you have to think about what kind of wild temperature changes it takes to swing the average of <em>the entire planet</em>.  Corals are very sensitive to temperature - because of how well water both reflects heat and holds onto heat, the reefs don't change temperature much.  But the increased average temperatures around the globe have created intense high spikes of temperature, raising the water temperature higher than what the corals can deal with.  <del>Again, it's not entirely known why they purge their zooxanthellae algae, but that's what they're doing.</del> See u/Saezeling's reply below!</p>
<p>Another significant problem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown-of-thorns_starfish" target="_blank">crown of thorns starfish</a>.  These starfish eat the <a href="http://cdn2.arkive.org/media/F5/F52673D4-7735-4495-A207-D5F56BEE5A6A/Presentation.Large/Great-star-coral-polyps-feeding-at-night.jpg" target="_blank">polyps</a> and tissue of corals, creating scars on the skeletons where tissue is missing.  That leads to the pest algae growth, competing with the coral tissue for access to the skeleton.  Also, believe it or not, corals can get infections.  The damaged tissue can let infections or parasites into the tissue.  Corals also occasionally do something called Rapid Tissue Necrosis, or RTN, for no apparent reason, but it usually shows up when the tissue has been damaged in one place.  Basically, one part of the coral starts dying, and then within a day or so the entire coral is dead.  Normally, crown of thorns starfish aren't <em>bad</em> for reefs, because they can slow down the fastest growing corals so the slower ones have a chance to catch up.  Like any predator, they protect the prey species by creating room for more of them to grow.  But for some reason - <em>probably</em> somewhat related to global warming, scientists think, maybe? - the crown of thorns starfish are reproducing and marauding around the Indo-Pacific reefs as massive colonies that devastate whatever reef they wander into, like underwater locusts.  It's not clear what's going on, though, especially since this seems to be a cyclical occurrence, happening about every 17 years.  So...it might be completely natural and just has very unfortunate timing to happen now while the reefs are already in really poor shape?  Or climate change may be causing an abnormal increase in their numbers?  Some combination of the two?</p>
<p>In any case, as the reefs die, the life around it dies, too.  There are a number of creatures that rely on corals for food or safety.  Angelfish and parrotfish both eat corals, and some angelfish are obligate corallivores - their diet <em>must</em> include corals.  Clownfish, obviously, rely on anemones for safety.  A lot of fish hide among the corals, using the stinging and poison of the corals to ward off bigger predators that can't get between the corals.  As the corals disappear, those fish disappear, too.  Then the bigger predators of those fish, like sharks and eels and whatnot start disappearing, too.  With no shelter, tangs like <a href="http://img.lum.dolimg.com/v1/images/dory_characters_0afa6e45.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1200%2C778" target="_blank">blue regal tangs</a> get picked off by the hungry predators.  Tangs are a vital part of the health of the reef, since they graze on algae that would otherwise grow on the reef, competing with corals for real estate under the sun.  The corals can't grow fast enough to keep up with the algae, so the algae chokes it out.  That kills more coral, which means less food for the corallivores and less shelter, which means fewer of those fish, and fewer and hungrier predators, which means fewer tangs, which means more algae...</p>
<p>The original (non clickbait) article was talking about the fact that because of the bleaching, large parts of the GBR are not expected to reproduce like they normally do.  Without making a long post even longer, corals coordinate their sexual reproduction and that time is coming up, but with much of the reef very stressed out, those parts probably won't be able to participate, which will just keep the reef from recovering.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Imagine the rain forest but all the trees are turning white and can't photosynthesize food anymore, so everything that lives in the trees or around the trees and everything that eats the trees and everything that eats the things that eat the trees...are all in danger because the trees are slowly dying.  So we definitely need to be careful, we definitely need to take care of the GBR, and parts are in <em>really</em> rough shape right now, but it's still a ways from being completely dead or completely unrecoverable.</p>
<p>Edit: wow this blew up. If you haven't seen it, check out u/Saezeling's comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/57ep0q/eli5_how_the_great_barrier_reef_is_now_considered/d8rkkp8" target="_blank">explaining why corals purge their zooxanthellae</a>.</p>
<p>Obligatory thanks for <del>double</del> triple gold!</p>
<p>EDIT: A lot of people have asked if we can simply douse the reef in new zooxanthellea, and the answer is...maybe?  There are experimental programs testing this in controlled environments to see if it'll work.  We would have to use the right kinds of zooxanthellae, and as others in the comments have pointed out, we don't even know why certain corals have the zooxanthellae that they have in the first place!</p>
<p>Several countries around the world and several organizations are also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/science/a-lifesaving-transplant-for-coral-reefs.html" target="_blank">attempting to seed new corals</a> into dying parts of the reef.  Hopefully the new ones will colonize and rebuild.  And we've been cultivating corals that are less heat sensitive, or at least less sensitive to the higher temperatures reefs are currently experiencing, so hopefully we can keep them alive!  It's challenging though, because some corals can be pests, just like any other organism.  Soft corals (those with no hard skeleton, they just grow attached to rock and whatever else) can be pretty aggressive at taking up real estate.  Off the top of my head, <a href="http://www.ultimatereef.net/uploader/2013Q1/20130328_154656.jpg" target="_blank">green star polyp</a> can really take over.  Another one, <a href="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y189/toddrtrex/65/FTS12_9_12.jpg" target="_blank">pulsing xenia</a> is notorious for overgrowing reeftanks.  So we have to be careful what we introduce so we don't cause more problems than we solve!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh! I can answer why coral will expel the zooxanthellae (dinoflagellates). The dinoflagellates perform photosynthesis normally, but this ability can be negatively affected by environmental changes--this can be temperature-induced or because algae growth limits access to sunlight by covering the coral.</p>
<p>If the dinoflagellate is not producing enough then the coral will expel it as an adaptive measure. In this sense it'd rather take the risk to try to acquire a new, functional partner instead of dying with the old partner. As the guy I replied to mentioned, often they don't find a new dinoflagellate and end up dying, which results in the worsening cycle we've been seeing.</p>
<p>It's actually been suggested that this process has evolved over thousands of years to allow coral to survive other great environmental changes. This also depends on the ability of dinoflagellates to adapt to all the new changes we as humans have been causing recently. It's likely we won't lose the entire GBR, just that a fraction of it will be able to adapt and proliferate in time.</p>
<p>If anyone's looking for a cool microbiology book that's pretty damn exciting, check out <em>March of the Microbes</em> by John Ingraham. It mentions this, among many other stories and applications of microbes in the &quot;real world&quot; that aren't just really esoteric examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just got back from the outer reef. The corals we went to were considered to be in fairly good condition,  but honestly, there's lots of algae at shallower depths. The nursery at agincourt reef was in real bad shape. Deeper down it didn't seem too bad, but the dive master said that the highest temp he recorded last year was 32. Way above ideal conditions. So yeah, the reef is still amazing but it's pretty clear to see how distressed it is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really great answer, but it missed another aspect of the recent <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6283/338?variant=full-text&amp;sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=1&amp;oauth-code=7f4cb8ce-0b22-45b9-bfc5-2e314babc194" target="_blank">Science paper</a> (paywall) analyzing possible trajectories.  The ocean is not only a heat sink but also a CO2 sink.  This combines to slow temperature increases and and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but at the cost of changing the temperature of the water (which is covered above) and the alkalinity.  As the pH of the ocean changes, life in the ocean is having greater and greater issues adapting with coral being an early harbinger of things.  While the GBR is the largest and most well know, they are seeing similar affects all over these days.  <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/survey-confirms-worst-ever-coral-bleaching-great-barrier-reef" target="_blank">The western barrier reef is showing 80% bleaching, not as bad as the GBR which only has 7% not showing signs of bleaching, but still bad.</a></p>
<p>While there is a lot of sad news here, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/some-relief-great-barrier-reef" target="_blank">there is a lot of work to save this system and some hope</a>.  Only <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/massive-bleaching-killed-35-coral-northern-end-great-barrier-reef" target="_blank">15% is totally dead and 5% is totally untouched by bleaching</a>.  With the massive efforts going on to save this there is a good chance of that happening, but a lot of the push is because of the World Heritage status.  Most of the worlds coral does not have that kind of press.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great write-up by /u/RhynoD, but his/her numbers are misleading and downplay the level of bleaching that has occurred in 2016. It isn't 20% of the reef, scientists have actually stated that it is at 93% of the reef, and only 7% escaped unharmed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's misleading is the study you cited. There are around 2,900 individual reefs, the study only surveyed 31% of the reef. Also the survey team seemed to focus on the most affected areas, of the 911 reefs 522 were surveyed in the northern part which is known to have been affected more than the southern sector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No 93% is the number of Coral Reefs that show bleaching found but it is only 20 - 30% of the total coral that has become bleached. </p>
<p>What is more worrying is that the cause Acidification and Climate change cant be immediately counteracted. They will take decades to reverse. </p>
<p>This is what prompted the articles of the Great Barrier Reefs inevitable death. Even if we changed the behaviour that has caused the Coral bleaching and die offs it will take decades for the Ocean to right itself. In this time it is entirely possible the Great Barrier reef will die completely. It is also possible that it survives if only barely and can regenerate from there. </p></div>		</li>
