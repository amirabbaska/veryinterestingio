			<div class="markdown"><p>adding to this, if we look at the extensor digitorum muscle which is responsible for extending our fingers (the opposite of making a fist), there is a more distinct separation between the tendons of the index finger and middle finger than there is for ring finger and index finger. </p>
<p>There's a diagram here:

<p>The tendon from the wrist lies partially below the tendon for the middle finger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, what are you referring to here?  I'm not understanding what you mean.  There are a lot of tendons in your hand/forearm area!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The middle finger position restricts the movement of the ring finger. If the middle finger is curled up (tendon fully stretched), the ring finger can't move.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can move my fourth finger if I completely contract my middle finger.  I just can't move it very well and can't move it in the scenario OP describes.</p>
<p>It looks like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juncturae_tendinum" target="_blank">this structure</a>, combined with the fact that the ring finger doesn't get a dedicated extensor muscle, may relate to why we cannot easily extend the ring finger when the middle finger is flexed.</p>
<p>Basically, the index and pinky fingers have a dedicated extensor muscle in addition to the extensor digitorum muscle (which extends all four digits), but the ring and middle fingers do not.  As to why we can move the middle finger more independently of the ring finger, I am not entirely aware of.</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm not trying to say that you're wrong or anything!  I'm just looking for a deeper understanding!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possibly due to the differential innervation of flexor digitorum profundus - ulnar nerve for little and ring fingers and median nerve for index and middle. So functionally, they are distinct and you can contract the fibres connecting to one digit without contracting the fibres of another digit. Pretty cool hey!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Please try to understand what I was getting at.  </p>

<p>So basically,</p>

<li>
<p>I don't understand your explanation and was hoping you would elaborate.</p>

<li>I wanted to know more, which is why I tried googling some things.</li>
