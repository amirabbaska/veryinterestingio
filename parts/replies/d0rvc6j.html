			<div class="markdown"><p>Professional women's matches generally don't last too long; they play to the best of 3 sets, so about 2 hours like he said. Professional men's matches are best of 5 sets and can last much longer, especially at the highest pro level where the two competitors are so evenly matched. </p>
<p>Edit: Apparently only the Grand Slams are best of 5 for men, my mistake. </p></div>		</li>
