			<div class="markdown"><p>We know that it's still expanding because even the things 'close' to us are moving away from each other. And when we talk about the Universe expanding we're not really talking about the 'edge' of the Universe expanding (though the edge of the Observable Universe <em>is</em> expanding as time goes on because light has had more time to travel to us). What we talk about is that all throughout the Universe there is more and more space between everything in all directions.</p>
<p>It's like putting dots on a deflated balloon and then blowing it up but in three dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The observable universe of &quot;the Earth 6 months ago&quot; is fully contained within our current observable universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm finding this point contradictory, or poorly worded. The universe visible 6mos ago has since expanded, so that the then-most distant <del>points</del> * are even farther away now and should be beyond our threshold of visibility. The way you worded this suggests that the outer visible limits of the universe are contracting toward us, that the limits visible 6mos ago are contained within our current observable instead of expanded outside it.</p>
<p>* P.S. I misused &quot;points&quot; and &quot;objects&quot; in trying to express my thoughts. Points at a comoving distance we can see now will always be visible, as we always receive light from progressively farther sources. OBJECTS can move from visible distances to invisible distances, as universal expansion is greater than <em>c</em> at large distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're confusing the expansion of the observable universe with the expansion of the universe as a whole. The universe as a while expands the way you think, but the observable universe is expanding simply because as time goes on, light from farther points of the universe that was emitted at the big bang begins to reach us, which couldn't before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you and I are in sync, and I'll restate my question at the end. Yours is the only reply to contrast the physical universe with the observable universe. You're saying the visible universe of January is within the visible universe of July because the July waves followed the January waves to the beach and the August waves haven't gotten here yet. Every month reveals new information from a farther location. The visible boundary is expanding to envelope more distant locations over time.</p>
<p>My contention earlier was based on the relative comoving locations of objects as spacetime expands. Is it correct to say that the OBJECT we see today may redshift out to a new location beyond our boundary, so that new data from the new location will never reach us? The old location will be forever visible, but the new location from expansion will not. That explains the notion that all other galaxies will redshift out of view in the distant future, even though their current pre-expansion locations will be within view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point was that the observable universe cannot shrink, and that your wording suggested that. Let me rephrase what little I know, then. From the Expansion of the Universe notes on Wikipedia, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;2Ã—1012 (2 trillion) years from now, all galaxies outside the Local Supercluster will be red-shifted to such an extent that even gamma rays they emit will have wavelengths longer than the size of the observable universe of the time. Therefore, these galaxies will no longer be detectable in any way.[3]&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, things we can detect today WILL be pushed beyond our detection far into the future. If that is true, then it conflicts with your point about the observable threshold of the past being within the observable threshold of the future. Can you help me better understand your point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So moving away from an object(ie distant galaxy at the edge of the OU) would never red shift out of sight as you move away?</p>
<p>Would it just become &quot;redder&quot; and it couldnt &quot;red itself out&quot; entirely?</p>
<p>I know this amount of redshift would imply great levels of expansion and be beyond the orbit of the planets motion, but if something were on the very very very very edge of being redshifted out of sight to the observer and then the observer moved further away, it wouldnt redshift out of sight? </p>
<p>It boggles my mind that once something is within the relm of the observed you.... cant loose &quot;sight&quot; of it? Am I wrapping my brain around this right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>How else could it be - every information that could have reached Earth back then could also reach us now (e.g. by someone writing it down back then).</p>

<p>I'm not quite following here. If the expansion of the universe is accelerating, then at some point in the future (in a big rip scenario) it would stand to reason that astronomers would conclude there is no such thing as a galaxy and that ancient astronomers were just incorrect (once the space between our galaxy and other galaxies begins to expand faster than light, they will conclude that their galaxy is quite literally the entire universe).</p>
<p>Then sometime later astronomers would conclude that the concept of solar systems was a fabrication of ancient astronomers, as the space between their solar system and other stars expands faster than light.</p>
<p>And then everything ends horrifically as atoms get ripped apart by the expansion.</p>
<p>But my point here is that there could be plenty of books that talked about all the beautiful galaxies in our universe, but at some point in the very distant future, due to the accelerating expansion, future astronomers would conclude that there is only a single galaxy in the entire universe--theirs, or more accurately <em>their universe</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It will just get more difficult to detect the extremely redshifted light from these galaxies. This is a practical limitation, not a theoretical one.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>We routinely observe objects where our distance to them always increased faster than the speed of light.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And then everything ends horrifically as atoms get ripped apart by the expansion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While we can't rule that out experimentally it is not supported by any observations. The more likely result is a constant acceleration which won't rip apart any atoms (or other bound structures today).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if the distance between galaxies is big enough so that the expansion rate between the two galaxies is faster than light, then you wouldn't even get the redshifted light, right?</p>
<p>And since the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating, doesn't it mean that the observable universe is getting smaller or am I misunderstanding what you initially meant? Because to me it doesn't make much sense that the observable universe of six months ago would fit in the observable universe of today since it's supposed to have shrunk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if the big rip scenario were the correct end case, then the rest follows doesn't it? If the end stage is the strong nuclear force not being able to overcome the force of expansion, then certainly well before that the force of gravity fails to hold macro objects together, and well before that fails to hold galaxies together, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh.</p>
<p>I guess I didn't appreciate what accelerating expansion means.  I had previously assumed it just meant that the farther galaxies were moving away from us faster due to more expanding space between us... but now I interpret it as the amount of expansion per xx space in yy time is increasing.</p>
<p>So in a universe where space is expanding very rapidly... what happens to the probability of finding a particle at one location?  Does it get spread out?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not what it means.</p>

<p>That is right. But the fact that it happens is not trivial. Without dark energy (or something similar) it wouldn't.</p></div>		</li>
