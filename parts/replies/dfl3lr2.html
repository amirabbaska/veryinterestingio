Whoever and whomever refer to the question &quot;whatever person&quot; or &quot;no matter which person&quot;. Whosoever and Whomsoever are used in the same way as whoever and whomever.

			<div class="markdown"><p>You a music fan?</p>
<p>Emphasis in music is a function of a single note (playing on specific beats, playing a note louder), a  small collection of notes (a crescendo, being proceeded by a grace note), or chords (playing the root after building tension with a V^7).</p>
<p>Similarly when speaking emphasis is  about calling attention to specific words or phrases that you want to stand out and there are a number of ways to this is. Vocal inflection, sentence structure, and word choice can all highlight certain words or phrases.</p>
<p>Rhetoric, to continue with the music analogy, is a function of the entire piece of music. It would be closer to a genre. Its about the idea you wanted to convey, the theory you chose to build your song around, and about the delivery of the piece as a whole.</p>
<p>Emphasis is a part of rhetoric, but rhetoric is more than emphasis. Its about your style and persuasivness as a speaker.</p></div>		</li>

If I ask you &quot;Which breakfast did you eat?&quot; You and I both know what options were available. If I asked you &quot;What breakfast did you eat?&quot; It could be anything.. the asker doesn't know what answer it may be.</p></div>		</li>
