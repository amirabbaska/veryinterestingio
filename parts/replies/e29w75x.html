			<div class="markdown"><p>Its interesting because I went camping once and brought one of those pop-up covers to put over the picnic table. Turns out it didn't block UV, so even though we were in the shade, we still got sun burned. The UV went right through the fabric!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There actually used to be (maybe there still are?) swim suits made out of a material like that, so that people 'wouldn't have tan lines.'  I just remember the infomercials that used to run all the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no real magic, though. They simply make the fabric so thin that it doesn't block much UV.  The thin fabric is so thin that &quot;Air flows right through the fabric.&quot;  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got one of those swimsuits once but it was no good. The majority of it was tan-through but anywhere there was a seam, the fabric was doubled over and stitched making it not tan-thru. So you still got tan lines, and really weird ones at that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shade is relative. If during a cloudless summer day you're somewhere where only half the sunlight reaches you, that may look dark but that's still a lot of light. And in terms of UV exposure, it means you get as much UVs if you stay there twice as long.</p>
<p>Fabric doesn't really have UV-protection, it's just a matter of how thick and dense the material is. It's a bit weird to talk about clothes and SPF in my opinion... I've never noticeably tanned under clothes, but the UV index gets to about 9 at most (summer solstice, noon) around here. If your skin is particularly light or you live somewhere where the UV index gets really high, then it's definitely something to take into consideration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is exactly correct. Though, granted, it is merely UV light as opposed to something more dramatic like XRays or gamma rays.</p></div>		</li>
