			<div class="markdown"><p>To predict the future climate?  We can notice regularities in the past climate -- the shape of the time series, sure, but also things like the reliable correlation between changes in CO2 and changes in temperature, which can help us understand exactly how sensitive the temperature is to changes in CO2.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know, &quot;correlation is not causation.&quot;  If CO2 and temperature are correlated, it could be that CO2 causes changes in temperature, or that temperature causes changes in CO2, or both affect each other in either positive or negative feedback, or something else changes both at once, or even a combination of these things.  It takes additional lines of evidence to figure out the specific changes in temperature caused by CO2 -- theoretical models of infrared absorption by CO2 molecules, research into feedback mechanisms, a detailed understanding of the climate system, lots of simulations, etc.  Good research is hard, and researchers know that.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just about the most practical thing they do in Antarctica.  We want to figure out how the earth's climate is going to change in the next few decades in order to plan for it and, eg, protect cities and find the right places to grow crops. To do that, we need to model  the climate effectively.  To do <em>that</em>, we need a long record of the earth's climate so we can see how it acted in the past.  So long records of past climate are really helpful.   </p></div>		</li>
