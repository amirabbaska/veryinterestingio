<p>I'm a VO actor and this is also how you sell 'commercial' brands. Think fast food brands, mid-level clothing, etc (as opposed to luxury brands which usually require either an &quot;attitude&quot; or a whisper depending on the product). </p>
<p>Ultimately the answer to OP's question is because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfy-T3R9Ju0" target="_blank">we're all acting</a>. It's the same reason why people adopt hushed sullen tones at funerals. We put on the face (or voice) we think is most appropriate for the current situation, and we've understood that average interactions with strangers for customer service purposes require pleasant, friendly attitudes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in retail in a college bookstore for a couple of years and even though I wasn't trained to do it I discovered for myself that smiling while on the phone helped so much.  I tried to offer the opposite of the customer service of my boss who was grumpy as fuck both in person and on the phone.  (To be fair to him, he had his reasons.)</p></div>		</li>
