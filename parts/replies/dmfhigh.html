			<div class="markdown"><p>As I read from the article below, spices stimulate the blood circulation and this causes an increase in body temperature. Also the over-spice can cause irritation in mouth which may make bacteria to infect damaged areas easier which is responded by immune system which's activity also increases body temperature. Here's the article: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/21/garden/eating-spicy-food-what-are-the-effects.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/21/garden/eating-spicy-food-what-are-the-effects.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that capsaicin, the compound that makes peppers hot, does in fact increase body temperature and sweating if eaten in enough of an amount (for instance a half raw jalapeno is pretty damn spicy if it's not picked), so I would imagine that this would help if you were somewhere in the breeze as thread-OP said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they do actually. This is one of the big reasons that spicy food is so popular in hotter countries like Mexico and India. While spicy foods aren't literally providing your body with more heat from the spicyness, your body still thinks its hotter and thus you sweat more, and when that sweat evaporates in hot temperatures it takes some of your body heat with it helping you cool down.</p></div>		</li>
