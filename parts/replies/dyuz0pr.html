			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Red is cold and blue is hot.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe he means the color? So a cold color is blue, is higher in the spectrum, and hotter in temperature? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is explained pretty well <a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35337/why-is-human-vision-restricted-to-400-700-nm" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
<p>Another factor is the energy carried by different wavelengths of light. The shorter the wavelength the stronger the energy, which is why long radio waves are relatively harmless in the quantities in the world but even small amounts of the shorter length X-Rays can be harmful. The wavelengths of visible light are short enough to carry enough energy to cause bio-chemical reactions, which is how our cells can interpret the light and send a signal to our brain.</p>
<p>The wavelengths of visible light are also about the size as the cone cells that detect color in the eye, which makes them more efficient at this scale. (This is probably just our bodies adapting to be best at seeing visible light, not the reason itâ€™s this range vs another since there is a wide range of cell sizes. Plenty of animals have adapted to see infrared light which requires a different size cone.) </p></div>		</li>
