			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly there’s not way of making sure there isn’t some genetic makeup from a different breed. Just like you may have detached earlobes, even if both your parents have attached. Genetics. Science is cool.</p>
<p>Fun fact: color plays no role in the nutritional makeup of an egg, both a brown and whit egg have the same nutritional makeup. Of course unless they’re fed different diets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: the color of the hen's earlobes indicates the color of her eggs.  If she has red ears, she'll lay brown eggs.  If she has white ears, she'll lay white eggs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main breed of layers in the US is the leghorn because of their high efficiency and the US needs to feed a lot of people, and they produce white eggs. So that’s what everyone sees in their groceries. Other countries that are seen are environmentally friendly, or even just rural places that don’t have a need for a high production will use different breeds producing brown or other colored eggs. Since everyone thinks the US is just one big ag factory farm, the brown eggs seem like a more “natural option” since smaller scale productions can sell brown eggs at a higher price and slap natural on it without a legit certification. </p>
<p>This might have turned into a rant, sorry lol </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. It’s usually just referred to as the earlobe. Another fun fact is white, brown, green and pink eggs all have white inner shells. Only blue eggs have the color all the way through. </p></div>		</li>
