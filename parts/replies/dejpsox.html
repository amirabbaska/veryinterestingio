			<div class="markdown"><p>Or lord knows pigs know how to get it on. Dolphins also apparently have pretty intimate and prolonged or violent sex. Some animals may have &quot;short&quot; copulations but may engage hundreds of times a day with many males for a week, such as in lions. There is some evidence that humans started out in the lions category as an explanation for the dichotomy between female and male... recharge times.</p>
<p>Just because in the process of sex (erection, intermission, and emission) that humans seem to have a long period of intermission... does not make our sex &quot;better&quot;. Surely a pig would look down on our silly human period of emission when compared to their half hour of mind blowing orgasm.</p></div>		</li>
