<p>At higher levels chess is largely considered a draw as there are many many ways to cause a draw  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's important to note that higher level computer chess games can be much much longer than human games though.<br />
<a href="http://puu.sh/wg1RM/eef48bcda7.png" target="_blank">Take this position for example.</a><br />
If both white an black play perfectly then white will checkmate 546 moves from now. Note that a full-time control game usually lasts for around 50 moves or less and rarely goes over 100.  </p>
<p>A comment by the chess legend Gary Kasparov on this.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The one thing for people to understand is that chess is, you may call, mathematical infinite game. The number of legal moves is more than number of atoms in the solar system. So machines cannot solve the game. You cannot expect machine to play e2-e4 at move one and announcing mate at 16,455 moves. But machines could work the game of chess from the end.  </p>
<p>Now we know that machines mathematically solved all positions with four pieces, like king and queen, versus king and rook. All positions with five pieces, all positions with six pieces, and now seven pieces.  </p>
<p>Seven pieces, it’s on the way. I’m not sure it’s all solved. We’re talking about 100 terabytes. Obviously, eight pieces will be already just insane number, and the game of chess’s ultimate endgame with 32 pieces. That’s why, maybe, machines will get to eight or nine moves, but that will probably be the end, even for the immense computing power that you can expect in next five, ten, twenty years.</p>
<p>. . . </p>
<p>In some of the positions, like there are certain seven-pieces positions, when the win — and we’re talking about a forced win — can be reached within 500 moves. Now, 500 moves, I remember, I looked at some of the positions. Even at six-pieces positions . . .  </p>
<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> It’s not intelligible, what’s happening, right?  </p>
<p><strong>KASPAROV:</strong> It’s no intelligence at all. It’s just pieces moving around. There’s a certain position with king, two rooks, a knight on one side, and king, two rooks on other side. It said mate in 490 moves, first mate.
Now, I can tell you that — even being a very decent player — for the first 400 moves, I could hardly understand why these pieces moved around like a dance. It’s endless dance around the board. You don’t see any pattern, trust me. No pattern, because they move from one side to another.
At certain points I saw, “Oh, but white position has deteriorated. It was better 50 moves before.” The question is — and this is a big question —<strong> if there are certain positions in these endgames, like seven-piece endgames, that take, by the best play of both sides, 500 moves to win the game, what does it tell us about the quality of the game that we play, which is an average 50 moves?</strong>  </p>

<p>So does that mean that whenever any game gets down to 3v3, with perfect play the result can't be anything but inevitable? They could just stop the game and feed the piece locations into a computer and find out who won to save time. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Assuming two perfect computers are playing each other then yes.<br />
When it comes to humans playing it's a whole 'nother story though since humans can't play perfectly and perfect play with some of the six piece positions result in &gt;500 move games which is unheard of in human chess (<a href="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1268705" target="_blank">the longest tournament chess game ever lasted for 269 moves and took over 20 hours</a>).  </p>
<p>Also from the interview with Kasparov:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I played, I guess, 182 games in the world championship matches, and many more games, hundreds of games, against other top players in different competitions. I knew almost all my opponents. I knew what to expect from them. I knew what to expect from myself.  </p>
<p>Human chess is a form of psychological warfare. It includes a psychological element because you should know how to play a game against a very specific opponent. Not very often, but sometimes, you may look for certain moves that may not be the best, purely from chess point of view, but they could create situation at chessboard that might push your opponent off balance.  </p>
<p>With machine, it’s totally different. The humans are facing an opponent that is not vulnerable to any psychological pressure and, moreover, an opponent that doesn’t care about what’s happened one move ago. In any human-to-human game, you always have — not necessarily blunders or mistakes — but inaccuracies because if we are reaching a winning position, the complacency is hard to avoid.</p>

<p>In fact, in computer v. computer matches, they <em>do</em> stop the game when the table base shows a forced win.  At least in some formats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain positions are pretty hard to pull off. Knight, bishop, and king vs king is a win for the person with 3 pieces, but just fiddle around with it for a bit and you can hopefully get a sense of just how hard it is for the player with the advantage to actually pull off the checkmate. In fact, with the 50 move draw rule, it's not always possible to do with optimal play by the person with just the king. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting, if I let stockfish or the new asmFish variant play against itself, it comes out to the usual 50-100 moves.</p></div>		</li>

Not sure if &quot;the number of atoms in the solar system&quot; is a &quot;large number&quot; since the machine  does not necessarily have to evaluate or enumerate any particular board position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify a bit, Stockfish is more or less the name of an algorithm, but it is limited by computing power. So if you had Stockfish running on your phone and I had it running on a powerful desktop, given the same amount of time to calculate each move, I would likely win—the desktop would be able to simulate &quot;deeper&quot; into the top move candidates to screen for any possibility of a disadvantage later on.</p>
<p>The way these algorithms work, at a simple level, is to look at win-loss outcomes recursively. </p>
<p>For example, it looks at moving piece A to position X, and assigns it + points if it captured any enemy piece (scaled to the value of the piece). It then runs itself on the opponent's move possibilities, to find the opponent's best possible responses to your move. Then it runs from your side once for <em>each</em> of those possibilities, to see what your best moves would be. Then it branches once again, looking at your opponent's possibilities for each of your possibilities for each of the opponent's possibilities in response to your initial move. And so on to some given depth, i.e. to some level of branching formed in this manner.</p>
<p>After a few short runs like this on all of your pieces' move possibilities, it trims away the worst moves from further consideration and re-examines the best candidates at a deeper level (it explores each branch more deeply), i.e. to more moves ahead for each simulated possibility. It may also do something like keep in a &quot;wildcard&quot; of the trimmed moves to reintroduce at this deeper stage, so as to prevent itself from getting stuck in a local maximum when a better one may exist (despite seeming weaker in the short term).</p>
<p>This results in the computer being able to rank the best available moves in terms of their &quot;score,&quot; given every possible (sensible) outcome from that move for the next, say, 20 turns. In other words, there is (very likely) nothing that the opponent could do over the next 20 turns that would result in a larger point loss for you (in terms of piece value).</p>
<p>This can run iteratively for weeks. The longer it runs, the deeper it can afford to go—both in how far ahead it looks, and also the certainty (i.e. depth) with which it calculates each of the moves along the way. Another way to say this is that the longer you run it, the better it safeguards you against a &quot;smarter&quot; opponent—that is, one who can see more moves into the future.</p>
<p>On a related note, there are websites that let you play in real time against Stockfish, as well as some &quot;cheating&quot; websites that tell you what your next move should be given some board layout (which also use Stockfish). </p>
<p>If you downloaded and installed a Stockfish solver on your own computer and started a game against one of these websites—e.g. using the cheat site to tell you what move white should make, and using your own downloaded Stockfish solver to calculate black's moves—you would very likely win if you let your downloaded solver consider each turn for even one minute, let alone 10 (compared to the couple of seconds at most that the webserver is spending). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how many nodes they process and the engine itself, some incorporate different features which can change things game by game. With no randomness factors then yes it will play the same move assuming the same processing time and efficiency since it's deemed to be the best move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If two different moves have the same 'score' calculated for them, I should think the program would <em>have to</em> incorporate a random call (pseudo random OK). In the things I program, I frequently need to call up a (pseudo) random number. We need to ask someone who programs these things if they every make a random call. </p></div>		</li>
