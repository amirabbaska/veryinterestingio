			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any good contaminants? I've heard Elon suggest dropping a nuke on Mars to terraform it... so it's not like we're trying to be gentle. I thought the &quot;primordial soup&quot; was what made Earth... Earth. My dumb brain thinks the more microbial life we bring from the enriched Earth to the dusty Mars- all the better for life to propagate! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aah but that is a different issue. Making mars livable for humans is a very different goal to finding out if there is life there right now. Contaminants now risk false positives, or worse, destroying the very thing we went hoping to find.
If we do find extant life, it would greatly change the ethics of colonization . It's unlikely we can make it livable for ourselves without making it unlivable to any Martian life. Are we okay with that ? Would it be incumbent to build reserves or Microbial zoos or something to preserve it ?
Nobody is asking this yet since colonization is still far off and we don't know if there is anything to preserve. We have time to find out and only afterwards would these questions, potentially, start to matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea isn't to actually drop the nukes on Mars, but to detonate them above the icecaps in space to use the radiant heat to melt the icecaps. This obviously needs big nukes and a lot of them which is a problem in itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be of interest that NASA once broke its own protocols and sent an unsterilized rover (Curiosity) to Mars. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2012-09-drill-bits-rover-contaminate-mars.html" target="_blank">Here's a short news article about it</a>.</p>
<p>According to my understanding, they sterilized the rover and planned the mission with that in mind. Part of the sterilization procedure meant that a box had to be sealed until after it arrived in Mars. Someone made an engineering decision to open that box on Earth. The breach of protocol wasn't discovered until after the rover was already launched.</p>
<p>It meant that they had to change the tone of the mission, such that Curiosity would have to basically run away from any water it might have found. They didn't really <em>expect</em> to run into any water, but it was kind of a bummer that they couldn't explore that possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sanitizing is important here. Until Phoenix, all Martian landers/rovers were <em>sterilized</em>. Planetary Protection standards were then relaxed a bit. Different parts of a rover will have difference tolerance. I.e.: something that comes in contact with soil that will be analyzed will have very stringent requirement. Circuit boards inside the rover that will never come in contact with test samples will have more relaxed requirements.</p>
<p>Keeping this equipment sanitized and clean on Earth requires continuous testing and sanitizing of parts and everything that comes in contact with it (tools, gloves, etc).</p></div>		</li>
