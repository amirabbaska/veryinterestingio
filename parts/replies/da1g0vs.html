<p>It would be on a megathrust subduction zone fault probably on one of the faults in the Pacific, and it would likely have to rupture much of the shallow part towards the trench which would generate a significant tsunami impacting all countries with coastlines along that ocean with Hawaiâ€™i right in the middle of the fun.</p>

<p>I was long ago at a location that had the name of something like Pacific Disaster Center. They described one of their &quot;unlikely fears&quot; as being something like one of the Hawaiian or other ring of fire volcanoes exploding like St. Helens. They said that if that happened, it would pretty much take out every coastal city on the entire western seaboard. This is, of course, very unlikely, as that is not the eruption pattern of such volcanoes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched a documentary that said that one of the islands in the Canary Islands could do that. The last time the volcano erupted, half the volcano began sliding into the sea, but stopped before it hit the water. Apparently if it erupts again, it could slide completely into the sea and make a huge tsunami that would devastate the east coast of North America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I knew about that one, too. It's pretty amazing how much force is in an island when it belly flops into the Atlantic. ;-P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Teide volcano in Tenerife has been erupting once every hundred years, as far as the records go. The last eruption was in 1909, if I recall correctly. </p>
<p>The island saw an insane amount of investment in the past 50 years, it went from a fishing village to a massive holiday resort in just a few decades. </p>
<p>Even a not-so-big eruption would cause billions in damages. Death toll hopefully shouldn't be too high, as there are seismologists and other scientists monitoring the situation. They should give an early warning and plenty of time for full evacuation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, an explosion eruption would be highly unlikely because the Hawai'ian islands are effusive, gentle giants. However I think what you may have been referring to is the possibility of large landslides like the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/12/031209080659.htm" target="_blank">Hilina Slump</a> [<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2003JB002411/abstract" target="_blank">Morgan et al, JGR, 2003</a>] which if it went into the ocean all at once would be about a M9 earthquake and might cause a tsunami of up to ~500 meters in height.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any way we could gently  chip away at the rock that would fall in such an event but do it in a controlled manner to prevent that kind of devastation?</p>
<p>Or is that one of those &quot;It'll never happen in our lifetime (hopefully) so why spend the money&quot; type deals?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When people talk about the height of a tsunami they don't mean the height from the base of the wave to the top of the wave, right? It's more in reference to how high above sea level the water ends up reaching?</p>
<p>I'm just thinking 500 meters is taller than most buildings in Chicago so I'm assuming it's not literally a wave the height of a city skyline crashing into shore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mt. Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes for that reason.  If it were to blow like St. Helens, it's much bigger and has a lot more glaciers so its lahars could very likely go all the way to Seattle and potentially kill hundreds of thousands of people.  It wouldn't destroy every coastal city, but the Juan de Fuca Plate definitely has the potential for future megathrust earthquakes since its last one occurred in 1700.  Another 9.0 or so from it would definitely cause a significant tsunami and endanger plenty of coastal cities, but it wouldn't completely wipe them out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of Rainiers previous lahars go to seattle.  They generally go towards tacoma.   Anyways only the oldest ones ever reached the sound and they have been weaker and weaker the more recent you go.  Basically just stay out of Orting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, we can map these out and make hazard assessments. For the San Andreas I would quote the following from the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/megaqk_facts_fantasy.php" target="_blank">USGS</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The magnitude of an earthquake is related to the area of the fault on which it occurs - the larger the fault area, the larger the earthquake. The San Andreas Fault is 800 miles long and only about 10-12 miles deep, so that earthquakes larger than magnitude 8.3 are extremely unlikely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However you may remember a paper [<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6308/88" target="_blank">Inbal et al., Science, 2016</a>] came out recently showing that parts of the San Andreas can experience brittle failure deeper than that 12 mile estimate, possibly down to 20 miles. Whether that deeper section of fault will actually rupture during the Big One and make an already large earthquake larger is not clear, but it shows why we need studies like that one to better quantify what may happen on the faults beneath our feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, the San Andreas luckily isn't part of the subduction zone on the west. It's a fault that will slide back and forth, not much up and down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Japan to Chile is &gt;40% the circumference of the globe, so thats almost literally the opposite side of the planet</p></div>		</li>
