			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the preventing pregnancy part wasn't the big deal to me, it's the preventing periods that I was talking about when I asked why it's not a huge deal. As far as I know there aren't any other methods of preventing periods, are there? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regular birth control (the pill) can also prevent periods. You just don't take the stop week pills. An IUD can also stop or lighten your periods.</p>
<p>The thing about all these methods is though that they are based on hormones and don't have a 100% success rate when it comes to stopping periods. One woman might not get her period while she has an IUD, another might get worse ones. Sometimes your periods only stop after some time. Sometimes there just aren't any changes (except, of course, not being fertile). So while all of these things are known to possibly stop your period, we also cannot advertise them as 'will totally 100% stop your period' cause we just don't know if that will happen for you until you are on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no medical reason that you &quot;need&quot; to have a period every month. Lots of birth control methods can be used to skip or stop periods all together. The progestin in whatever method you use stops the inner lining of your uterus from thickening each month, so it's not like you are building up extra period when you don't bleed. Actually, skipping your period helps prevent endometrial cancer, and if you also aren't ovulating, prevents ovarian cancer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It just depends on your type of birth control. If you have a birth control containing estrogen you will still build up a lining and therefore you cannot go forever without a period, you would need to take the placebos every few months. You can do progestin only contraceptives (mini pill, IUD, nexplanon, Depo Procera) continuously. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't remember where, but I read a study about women with fewer periods having fewer incidences of breast cancer, as well, whether through hormonal BC, pregnancy, extended breastfeeding, hysterectomy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My OBGYN has told me that it's still recommended to have them once every three to four months, though, to promote healthy uterine function. I also have PCOS, so I'm not sure if it was specific to those who are already disadvantaged in that department or wut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all done with hormones. Other hormonal birth control forms can and do prevent periods. Results can be inconsistent, depending on which specific pill/IUD/etc you are using.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to illustrate how many years we are talking here, it was first theorised that implants could be used for anti-conception in the 1960s, when silicone became available. The commercial first use of an implant based on leonorgestrel was in 1983; the first commercial use of an implant based on etonogestrel was in 1998. It was a big deal when it was first new, It's just that that is several decades ago at this point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all IUDs are hormonal contraceptives. Obviously, you're talking about those that are, but some people might infer that all IUDs are hormonal and have the same effects on menstruation, and that's definitely not true.</p></div>		</li>
