<p>Black holes as particle accelerators: a brief review</p>
<p>by Tomohiro Harada and Masashi Kimura</p>
<p>Rapidly rotating Kerr black holes can accelerate particles to arbitrarily high energy if the angular momentum of the particle is fine-tuned to some critical value. This phenomenon is robust as it is founded on the basic properties of geodesic orbits around a near-extremal Kerr black hole. On the other hand, the maximum energy of the acceleration is subjected to several physical effects. There is convincing evidence that the particle acceleration to arbitrarily high energy is one of the universal properties of general near-extremal black holes. We also discuss gravitational particle acceleration in more general context. This article is intended to provide a pedagogical introduction to and a brief overview of this topic for non-specialists.</p>

<p>As pointed out by multiple commenters below, it is possible to accelerate neutrons with magnetic fields, but why not just use protons and a more efficient acceleration technique?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, for one thing neutrons aren't the same thing as protons. Neutrons of controlled energy, such as might be produced by a beamline, would be stunningly useful in the analysis of materials and in chemical analysis. There are already well developed techniques which use neutrons (neutron reflectivity, neutron scattering) and I salivate at the idea of being able to do neutron spectroscopy with a continuously tunable neutron source.</p>
<p>Neutron beamlines do exist, most notably the one in <a href="https://www.ill.eu/" target="_blank">Grenoble, France</a>. They even produce polarized neutrons. But they can't give you neutrons of arbitrary energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, if temperature is kinetic energy, then heating them via laser should count as accelerating.</p>
<p>Isn't one of the crucial steps in nuclear fission the &quot;cooling&quot; of neutrons to &quot;thermic&quot; speeds so they can initiate another fission?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, although fission with only fast neutrons is possible with more enriched fuel. For neutrons you just do that by elastic collisions with light nuclei that have low absorption cross-sections. This usually means water (H2O or D2O) or graphite (C).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what i has recalled:
Acceleration of neutral atoms in strong short-pulse laser fields</p>
<p>A charged particle exposed to an oscillating electric field experiences a force proportional to the cycle-averaged intensity gradient. This so-called ponderomotive force1 plays a major part in a variety of physical situations such as Paul traps2, 3 for charged particles, electron diffraction in strong (standing) laser fields4, 5, 6 (the Kapitza–Dirac effect) and laser-based particle acceleration7, 8, 9. Comparably weak forces on neutral atoms in inhomogeneous light fields may arise from the dynamical polarization of an atom10, 11, 12; these are physically similar to the cycle-averaged forces. Here we observe previously unconsidered extremely strong kinematic forces on neutral atoms in short-pulse laser fields. We identify the ponderomotive force on electrons as the driving mechanism, leading to ultrastrong acceleration of neutral atoms with a magnitude as high as ~1014 times the Earth’s gravitational acceleration, g. To our knowledge, this is by far the highest observed acceleration on neutral atoms in external fields and may lead to new applications in both fundamental and applied physics.</p></div>		</li>
