			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to want to pick at “bumps” on my mate (pimple popping). I’ve always equated it with the grooming that chimps/apes do. I have absolutely no desire to touch strangers in the same way.  </p>
<p>Petting my dog is relaxing to me (and I’m sure for him).     It’s bonding, affectionate and just calming.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.</p>
