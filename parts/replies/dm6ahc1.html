			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a matter of walking slowly. It's a matter of the legs being crushed under the weight of the titan. They'd have to roll around, or maybe crawl. The excuse given is that they are magically 'surprisingly light' and even having parts be 'weightless' dependent on a sort of conscious/subconscious decision to add weight to themselves. They are only heavy when they need mass to destroy something. You can swing a feather at 300 mph but it's not going to crush a building.</p>
<p>Also, evolution has given us the Square/Cube Law, which precisely states that evolution CREATES this problem rather than fixes it. Assuming evolution was extremely in their favor, creatures this large and complex would need extreme genetic tuning to add skeletal structures able to support these masses, and then might not have enough room for adequate muscle needed to move these masses. Either way, these creatures run exclusively on magic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the titan's flesh described as incredibly lightweight, though? Surely such a composition would allow for a functioning titan. If the flesh is significantly less dense than human flesh, then there should not be much of a problem with the titan's functioning. I don't know if it's ever said that titan's need oxygen either. (Though, I don't keep up with the manga)</p>
<p>I don't believe the material the cables are made of is ever stated, is it? It could be some kind of more elastic material (even if it is some kind of unobtainium) I'm not saying that you're wrong, you're almost certainly right, but a more elastic material would make the 3DMG more possible.</p></div>		</li>
