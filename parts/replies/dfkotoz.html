			<div class="markdown"><p>You can ALWAYS sue, or lobby, or call congress, or drum up support for anything, forever. The limiting factor is generally the expense and the bad press. But this will make enough money for ISPs that it's worth fighting dozens more times if they need to. And they knew that the public was outraged about SOPA, still pretty mad about PIPA, mostly just annoyed now... we get tired of fighting this and the lobbyists do not. Sooner or later, this was inevitable. The best we can hope for is for a future congress / administration to try to overturn this with new laws. But it's harder to re-regulate than to de-regulate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can, but that would take campaign finance reform (i.e. taking the money out of politics) which neither party has any interest in doing. So as long as the electorate doesn't push for this, the vicious cycle of corruption will continue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me ask a question and I apologize if it was answered somewhere else, but I'm on mobile...</p>
<p>Are there ANY positives or benefits for the public, or is it purely the ISPs have so much money to lobby?  I mean, trying to be as unbiased as possible, what GOOD can come from removing net neutrality?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There straight up is no benefit to the common citizen unless you have a stake in internet providers. </p>
<p>Its a textbook case of corporations having more effect on policy than citizens </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does this keep happening: These so-called representatives keep trying to do things which are clearly horrible for the country and the citizens and are just favours to a very small set of corporate donors. Pushing hard every single time they try to take away our rights is missing the point. We need to attack this problem at the core.</p>
<p>[Get the money out of politics through the states. First sign the petition and then volunteer.]( <a href="http://www.wolf-pac.com/sign_petition?recruiter_id=42321" target="_blank">http://www.wolf-pac.com/sign_petition?recruiter_id=42321</a>) Money in politics allows corporations to buy politicians, plain and simple. Yes maybe we can beat them at this one fight. But to win the war, we need to eliminate the corrupting money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you really want to understand how it keeps happening (which I'm thinking you don't since your username is /u/getthemoneyout and you're trying to get people to sign a petition with your &quot;recruiter_id&quot; attached) then go ask your Congressman/woman. You'd be surprised at the points of views you might have failed to see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very unlikely that CEOs would donate even a fraction of the amounts corporations donate. They'd have to pay out of their own pockets and the extra bonuses wouldn't be enough to cover how much they would have to spend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But removing net neutrality will hurt websites like YouTube and Netflix. Without net neutrality, Comcast can go to google and say &quot;give us money or we will throttle YouTube&quot;.</p>
<p>Shouldn't google be able to out-bribe the ISPs since google is worth more money than they are?</p></div>		</li>
