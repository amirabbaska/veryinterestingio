			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Let's use Sweden as an example.</p>
<p>Sweden has an embassy in Washington that handles the major stuff with the US government. But they also have consular services in the embassy for people who live in the Washington, DC area. Sweden also has 29 consulates spread out across the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright Thanks!! I'm from Singapore so I usually only see the embassies and not consulates, so I didn't know there was a difference. The embassies here are kinda grand, and consulates are in some obscure office buildings.</p>
<p>And we only have either an embassy or a consulate of each country.</p>
<p>And I'm also glad that I've not seen/ stepped into my country's embassy during my travels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That this completely accurate response has loads fewer upvotes than the one above, which is totally wrong, just shows how dodgy it can be to rely on internet wisdom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You sometimes get both in one city! Brazil has both an embassy and a consulate in London for examples. The embassy handles the top-level diplomacy stuff, and the consulate does the daily business. They're in different parts of town and everything. </p></div>		</li>
