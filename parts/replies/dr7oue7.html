			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and that's discussed in the above linked article. I have to say though, living in a very dry climate, the nominal humidity does play a factor. My popcorn comes out of my very nice microwave consistently almost burnt every single time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Want to try an experiment?  Throw a paper towel with a couple drops of water on it in with the popcorn.  That should quickly get the humidity up and maybe improve the accuracy of the timer.  I don't know if this will actually work, but popcorn.</p></div>		</li>
