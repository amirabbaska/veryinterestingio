			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, all you need for black tea is boiling water, and boiling water is 100C/212F and can't get any hotter. As long as you nuke it until it's boiling, you get the same results. For herbal or green tea though you're supposed to be at about 90C so I could see why someone would potentially be a snob about it, since you can really change flavors by putting green into boiling. </p></div>		</li>
