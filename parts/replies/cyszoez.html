			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of related so I hope you don't mind that I piggy back...</p>
<p>I've only been in court once and I know tv exaggerates it ludicrously... But when an objection is made to something and it's stricken or withdrawn, why isn't that considered tampering in some way?</p>
<p>The jury can't unhear or unthink an inadmissible utterance and I feel like a good lawyer will straddle that line well enough to sway the jury's thoughts without admissible content.</p>
<p>How is this allowed? What's the rationale?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what comes out. Generally things in the flow of the trial are not major enough to cause an issue and the judge will instruct jurors to disregard. What you and jurors typically won't see is arguments over proposed evidence or other major information in a case. Whether these things may be admitted as evidence or even mentioned is usually argued outside the jury's presence and failing to adhere to the judges decision in regards to those matters can often lead to a mistrial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. </p>
<p>So if the bloody glove with the defendants initials was for some reason deemed inadmissible in private, but the prosecution is dumb enough to mention it specifically, we're looking at a mistrial.</p>
<p>But if they say something inflammatory but vague like &quot;and there was no evidence on your property?&quot; in a tone which telegraphs more meaning to the jury than the words and which the legal teams recognize as alluding to something inadmissible... That can be considered objectionable and disregardable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an example, there was a case where some guy attacked some people when in jail, and was on trial for it.</p>
<p>The were very much not supposed to mention why he was there in the first place (awaiting trial for murder -- <em>not convicted of it yet</em>).</p>
<p>At one point the government's psychologist accidentally let it slip (as a casual remark), and they had to redo the whole thing.  They were mostly just being extra careful (because an appeal could claim that the jury was prejudiced because of that), and they wanted to be damn sure to do it right and get the guy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a presumption in the law that juries will heed jury instructions. The judge will tell them to disregard such-and-such and they're presumed to do so. You have to overcome that presumption to establish that they can't/won't/didn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a balancing act. They are allowed to approach the line and step over it form time to time because it can work against them. They know if they cross the line and the defense fails to object an appeal for a mistrial is likely cause the lawyer failed to give a proper defense. It can also work to your advantage when the state is trying to prevent evidence that could support you from being entered your own lawyer can dance around the issue until they find a way to get it entered in. this generally happens by getting a witness to say something that would bring the evidence into question or made relevant by.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. In fact, if the witness' lawyer asked mostly leading questions, that could detract from the value of the evidence given by the witness. People are less likely to accept a witness' testimony if it seems like it was prepared by his or her lawyer. Opposing counsel might choose not to object at certain times and instead later point out that the witness gave little testimony in his or her own words, mostly agreeing with what the lawyer suggested instead of relying on his or her memory to recall and explain. Thus, we shouldn't accept that version of events because it's unlikely to be true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: meant to reply to jcoop, not colemab </p>
<p>Well as an attorney I can tell you that it's not the least important, though a form objection certainly falls within that category. &quot;Waste of time&quot; or &quot;cumulative&quot; is probably the most useless</p>
<p>Bottom line is that (1) police interviews are not court proceedings. Police can lie and scheme because there is no concern for misleading a jury , who would be tasked with someone's fate and (2) it's improper to lead on direct because it wrongly places the story telling/testimony function on the attorney, when it should be on the defendant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One other point - if you are in custody and the cops don't properly Mirandize you, almost anything you say will be inadmissible in court. Any evidence found as a result of this improper questioning is still admissible, but not the comments themselves. </p></div>		</li>
