			<div class="markdown"><p>The linked article says they would need an extremely powerful telescope to spot it. The only one capable is Subaru, which they are intending on using to look for it, the Astronomer who found it (Brown) estimates it would take 5 years to locate it. See the red triangular area in this image: <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline_colwidth__4_3/public/images/Orbits_1280_PlanetX2.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline_colwidth__4_3/public/images/Orbits_1280_PlanetX2.jpg</a> That is the area they will be searching (pretty large).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voyager 1, the farthest space probe from Earth, is about 133 AU away from us. This new planet would have a closest approach of around 200 AU, meaning Voyager 1 is about 2/3 of the way to the closest point in this planet's orbit. If you were to send a probe out from Earth today at the speed Voyager has been going at, you would get to its closest approach in about 58 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It ranges from 200 to ~1000 AU from the sun. Voyager 2 is 110 AU from the sun, and Voyager 1 is 130. </p>
<p>So no, not yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subaru is not the only one capable of spotting it. It's just that the other telescopes that are capable enough to spot it, have such a small field of view that probabilistically, it would almost certainly take very long to find it. </p>
<p>The reason Subaru is the top choice for this is that it combines two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>large enough to detect the planet</li>
<li>wide enough field of view to find it in a reasonable amount of time</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read they are working with some other teams watching a designated area of the sky for it with an estimated 5 years till official observation.</p>
<p>Maybe we will be lucky and find it sooner, like how Ceres was found since its the same concept of it mathematically being viable to exist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Piazzi discovered Ceres on 1 January 1801.[36] He was searching for &quot;the 87th [star] of the Catalogue of the Zodiacal stars of Mr la Caille&quot;, but found that &quot;it was preceded by another&quot;.[34] Instead of a star, Piazzi had found a moving star-like object, which he first thought was a comet.</p>
