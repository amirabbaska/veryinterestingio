			<div class="markdown"><p>Most missiles are both impact fuzed and proximity fuzed. They’ll explode on impact, but they’ll also explode when they think they’re near the target but about to pass/miss it.  The proximity fuze allows the missile to try to hit the target with shrapnel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basic principle for proximity fuse:</p>
<p>It is like a tiny radar, that only detects distance (done through a small feedback loop antenna, not unlike theremin, an electronic music instrument). As long as the distance gets closer, it's happy and does nothing, but as soon as the distance increase, it knows that it'll miss. This makes the missile so angry that it explodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of missiles are rigged up with proximity sensors; they don't need to physically hit the plane, they just get close enough and then explode, shredding the enemy aircraft with metal fragments.</p>
<p>That said, it won't help much. The missile has a finite amount of fuel, and the heat sensors can only swivel so much in the housing; even if the pilot hasn't successfully maneuvered away, the missile likely won't be able to physically get to the enemy plane following a miss. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Impact fuses are very simple and have been around forever.</p>
<p>Most air-to-air missiles are proximity fused though. When they are close enough to the target they detonate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous-rod_warhead" target="_blank">continuous-rod warhead</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright so a little bit of correction. You did a great job explaining the very basics of it but it is a little more complicated than that. So in stead of heat the missile is actually looking for IR signatures. Heat seeking missiles are what you hear a lot, but it is incorrect. IR seeking missiles are looking for a specific range inside the IR spectrum( 1-5 microns). So what flares do is try and produce a bigger signal within that frequency and propel away from the aircraft. At the same time pilots are trained to perform evasive actions to try and get the missile to track on to the flare then lose the aircraft. Also know that not all missiles track IR. Radar guided missiles are not affected by flares at all. Also we have new technology that works better than flares.

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, maneuvers are also used to beat the missile kinematically; if it has a great track, but not enough kinetic energy to catch you, who cares? I also spoke to countermeasures and tracking a little more at the bottom of the thread for those interested. </p>
<p>“You’re mostly right. A track is a collection of correlated data points, and creating more points can lead to false tracks or a dropping of the track entirely, while whatever sensor is tracking waits to collect enough new, correlated points to make a new track. Countermeasures are often formulated to either add more noise, making it harder to get a detection at all; create lots of new detections that are uncorrelated (don’t seem like they belong to a single target, and so don’t seem to the machine like something engageable); make the real target seem like something that is clutter (environmental and digital artifacts in detecting with any sensor that make it hard to detect and correlate in the back end) and so filtered out; or create entirely new, false targets. There’s a lot more to it, but there’s a paragraph primer.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also partially wrong. There are flares designed to confuse radar as well.</p>
<p>Though, they're not technically flares.. so I guess you're really right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your thinking of chaff my friend. It's little strips of foil cut into certain lengths to create false signals to confuse radar specifically . It is deployed the same ways as flares but are completely different.</p></div>		</li>
