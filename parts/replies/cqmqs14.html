			<div class="markdown"><p>This mostly correct, except it's 'Pinas or pilipinas, and it's not an english reason for the lack of philipino.  There's a deeper linguistic component.  The filipino language is almost completely phonetic.  This means there's only one sound associated with each letter.  This has the effect that letter combinations don't alter the sound of each letter.  So the reason that it's Philippines is as you said, the anglicized Felipe during the American period, but the reason it is Filipinos or Pilipinas is because that's how the language works.  In fact, before the americans came it was called republica filipina.  So maybe the deeper answer to the question is: that's how far the americanization of the philippines progressed.  </p>
<p>It's actually pretty interesting thinking about how much you can tell about a country just by its name.  USA, Iran, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the Spanish we didn't really have one big unifiying national identity since there was no big unifying force in our history until the spanish came. IIRC we were just a bunch of ethinic groups and city-states trading with surrounding south east asian peoples. Wikipedia should be a good place to read up on that. :)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this. Being colonized by Spaniards for hundreds of years, then  by the Americans in the early 1900's until after WW2, sometimes I feel like the Filipino culture is still very westernized. It is the largest Catholic country in that region. But you can not deny the huge influence of China and other Asian countries. Philippines might just be the place where you'll find the best of 2 worlds.</p>
<p>EDIT: O sige, the best and the worst of both worlds. ;p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never realized that Philippines had a rich Islamic history prior to the colonial powers even diplomatic ties with Chinese Muslims in the Ming Dynasty. I was wondering what is the views of those Muslim Sultanates in Philippines history. Second question what is your view on Bangsamoro and the MILFs, I hate seeing countries being divided but what is their problem?</p></div>		</li>

<li>Filipino - the OFFICIAL language</li>
<li>Filipino/Pilipino - the people</li>
<li>Pinoy - Slang derived from Pilipino</li>
</ul>
<p>Before Spain, there was no singular Pilipino identity. It was a bunch of trading tribal ethnic groups, with their own language, beliefs and culture...(with similarities, of course)</p>
<p>The Pilipinos of today descended from those tribes, mixed with Spanish, Chinese, Malay and American blood. There are still pure-blooded lumad (collective term used to describe the indigenous peoples) in some places such as the Manobos of Northern Mindanao, Mangyan of Mindoro, T'boli of Southern Mindanao, the Igorot of Mountain Province and the Aetas of Luzon.</p>
<p>I, for example, is a mix of Higaonon, Bol-anon, Spanish, Chinese and some Hebrew/Arabic (I believe). I have a Gaelic + Hebrew first name, a lumad middle name, and a Hebrew last name.</p>
<p>Edit: P and F, the quintessential Pinoy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Filipino does not only refer to the language, it also refers to the people. It depends on context.</p>
<p>The difference between Filipino and Pilipino is that Pilipino is used to say Filipino when speaking in Tagalog/Filipino because of the way the language is. If you look around, you'll notice that there is very few to almost no words in Filipino that contains the letter 'f'. Yes the Filipino alphabet includes the letter 'f', but it is mainly used for loanwords.</p>
<p>In the same vein, Pilipino is also used to refer to both language and people. Although it is mainly used to refer to the people, as Tagalog is often used instead of Pilipino to refer to language when speaking in Filipino.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading the names of the states in the Philippines before the Spanish came to it, still sound spanish. So upon reading some of it, I'm amazed that Luzon and Mindoro sounds highly spanish as a native speaker myself. I love history that has to do with the Spanish inquisition of all these countries. I can delve many hrs into reading all of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also used to be that &quot;Pilipino&quot; was the official name for the people, but in the 1980s it was changed to &quot;Filipino&quot; just as a way to conforming to the way the rest of the world pronounced it. Any modern usage of &quot;Pilipino&quot; is a remnant of that, or a political choice.</p></div>		</li>
