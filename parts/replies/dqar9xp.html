			<div class="markdown"><p>When I worked in the industry in 2008 digestive byproducts were either poorly regulated or over regulated by the EPA. In Maryland we have strict state regulations regarding discharging waste products into the bay.</p>
<p>At the time we were trying to promote wider adoption of anaerobic disposal systems at a time when most counties were considering expanding waste incineration processes. Opponents of both cited by products from medical waste and a lack of consistency in the slurry between companies. </p></div>		</li>
