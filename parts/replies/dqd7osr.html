			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible for the deepest stuff (see below), but unlikely for anything from the crust or upper mantle because there are processes that can bring intact samples of rocks up all the way up to the surface (e.g., tectonic uplift or more exotic proceses such as kimberlite pipes).  This is how geologists have samples of the mantle even though no one has dug or drilled that deeply to collect it in place.  The <em>deeper</em> mantle and core are not sampled (they would get altered on the way up, and the core is probably a fairly disconnected system), but their compositions are still constrained by lab experiments at comparable temperatures and pressures, geophysical data (e.g., seismic), and similar rocks from meteorites.  Surprises are always possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, unfortunatly.</p>
<p>We know the chemical makeup of the mantle, as well as the temperature and pressure there. From this, geophysicists and petrologists (scientists who study the chemical and physical properties of rocks) have worked out  what rocks and minerals exist there. These minerals are very unstable at surface conditions, so are very rare, but we do have samples of them. </p>
<p>Some of these minerals are ringwoodite, perovskite and diamonds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially, but we have a very good handle on the earth's composition through examination of rock types and also experimentation where we subject Base compositions to extreme pressure and temperature and 'make' tiny planets to find out how they turn out.</p>
<p>We have seen slabs of rock from very deep, brought up to the surface by tectonic activity, along with the results of magma from the mantle making its way to the surface, so overall we are fairly sure of the range of plausible rock compositions on earth. </p></div>		</li>
