<p>No, it is not theoretically possible to measure the force on two separated objects receding from each other because there <em>is no</em> force driving them apart.  An accelerometer at either object would measure zero acceleration.  Gravitational motion is inertial because of the curvature of spacetime, so an object that appears to be accelerating under the influence of gravity is actually just moving freely through curved space, not under the influence of any proper forces.  This is one of the defining principles of general relativity, called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle" target="_blank">equivalence principle</a>.</p>

<p>Two objects only get farther apart from each other due to the expansion of space when they are <em>not</em> bound together in any way.  Distant galaxies are not bound together, so they expand away from each other ... but within galaxies, matter does not expand because it is all gravitationally bound into a single system.</p>
<p>General relativity is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_independence" target="_blank">background-independent</a>, which means nothing is tied to any coordinates and you can choose any coordinates you want and the model/physics of the system does not change.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I tougth we are affected by the gravity of every object within the observable universe. And the reason why some galaxies accelerate away from us, is only because at some distance dark energy becomes stronger than the gravitational pull between the galaxies.</p>
<p>And the term gravitationally bound only means when the situation where the attraction gravity between the objects is too weak to overcome the expansion of the universe, which is a concept that predates the discovery of dark energy.</p>
<p>But dark energy should exist everywhere in space. Including between my head and my feet. But just too weak to make a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no gravitational force, and general relativity models dark energy just fine with no VEV, so I'm going to go with &quot;no.&quot;  At least, it is not necessary by Ockham's razor.  Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(1) Leptons <em>are</em> matter, definitionally -- for example, electrons are leptons; and, (2) I'm not explaining dark matter ... so ... I'm not sure I understand your question?  Dark energy is a totally different thing from dark matter, they just have similar names.</p></div>		</li>
