			<div class="markdown"><p>membrane structure and function is wayyyyyyy too techy for this question: it's about the water giving the alcohol added stability in solution, making it a more effective sterilant<br />
essentially with 70% alcohol 30% water you get a slower evaporation rate, giving the alcohol disinfectant a longer contact time and therefore a greater period of sterilisation when compared to alcohol alone<br />
100% alcohol will evaporate very quickly - for larger populations of bacteria the contact time of 100% alcohol wouldn't be long enough for effective sterilisation to take place.<br />
70% alcohol is a sweet spot, and there are reasons for that, but it's not that interesting unless you're a real micro nerd (I can find the paper if you like and if I have time. )        </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If one were to continuously pour 100% alcohol on the area, would that be optimal in terms of disinfecting (obviously not optimal in efficiency)?
Also the 70% sweet spot comment is intriguing. If you don't have time to find the paper, I will attempt to research that on my own! :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>straight up i know 70/30 in solution is not fully sterile because i got pulled up by a manager way back when i used to make vaccines in clean rooms; there were low level counts on the plates. so a constant stream of that wouldn't be ideal.  the evaporation is actually a step of the sterilisation process. not that it magically dissappears things, more that it removes liquid content that MAY allow SOME proteins to refold in solution in the absence of alcohol.<br />
100%, if you ensured that the contact time or immersion tome was the same as 70/30, the yeh it'd be a better sterilant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but is that true also for cleaning benches and hoods? I work in an oncology group, and for cleaning we always use 96% EtOH... If yes, It would save us money AND be more effective, like a win-win</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>man, i'm not gonna advise on running an oncology lab on reddit!<br />
for surfaces like benches i use 70/30 eth/water. for hoods i use virkon. i dont like the idea of soaking filters in the hoods in ethanol when there are naked flames around! but i guess torching everything ensures full sterilisation.<br />
i'm a prokaryotic dude, i can't really comment on the euks. i'd trust the 96% etOH was the result of a study, and not just middle management arse pulling, however. my guess would be you work mainly in diagnosis via DNA or research, and that may be why. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just an interesting side note, it is extremely hard to get alcohol past 95%.  At 95% ethanol with 5% water you have what is called an azeotrope.  The boiling point of ethanol is higher than the boiling point of ethanol/water (the azeotrope), which means you can't distill past that point.  You would need to use some type of dehydrating salt and then remove the salt somehow</p></div>		</li>
