<p>Otherwise, your explanation is pretty accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This^</p>
<p>The rating is a comparison of auto-ignition to a compound called isooctane. So 100 octane is the baseline (pure isooctane), and a reported rating of 91 would mean the fuel behaves like a mixture of 91% isooctane and 9% of a different hydrocarbon called heptane</p></div>		</li>

<p>the medium grade octane is truly for idiots isn't it?</p>
<p>I mean, you make an excellent case for 90% of us picking the cheapest gas.  The remainder have special cars that really do need that high stuff....</p>
<p>who the fuck needs the middle fuel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a car for a while that had all that computer stuff that gave me my mpg and fuel left and all that. </p>
<p>I did comparisons and I got the best mileage out of the mid grade fuel. The comparison was done driving the exact same route every day 7 days a week with little to no traffic to affect it. I also got my optimal MPG at 56 mph. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>probably old cars that get knocking on low test may be ok with medium.  They are just buying what they need to avoid predetonation, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Ive never heard of a new car that <em>requires</em> middle grade gas.  but I also havent looked at every single car :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I read it, it sorta is like this:</p>
<p>There are cars on the road that require it - you don't own one though.  You too poor.</p>
<p>Everything else..... either won't benefit at all or if it does benefit you could never justify the added cost, the benefit is small and insignificant.</p>
<p>That logic made medium grade fuel seem pointless.</p>
<p>That being said....</p>
<p>People that are years smarter about cars then I will ever be are making the argument that there might be cars out there with some issues where using medium can work out the issues and there isn't really a good reason to pay the price of premium.</p>
<p>I see the logic in that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spark plugs in modern cars fire before the piston reaches the top of its compression stroke. This is called advanced timing. It gives the fuel time to burn so to produce the greatest force on the (soon to be) downward traveling piston. As we learned in &quot;My Cousin Vinnie&quot;, the proper initial timing for a 327 Chevy would be about four degrees  before top dead center (BTDC). However, there is a mechanical advancing device in the distributor that will advance the spark up to about twelve degrees BTDC at higher RPMs.  Nowadays, all the timing is controlled by the car's CPU with the initial signal provided from the crankshaft, but the timing is still similar.  It advances more as the revs go higher, up to a point. Engines don't run worth a hoot with their timing retarded (firing after top dead center). Basically, higher compression engines will produce more power, all else being equal, IF the fuel/air mixture doesn't ignite before the spark (engine knocking), as you said. Higher octane ratings can be used in higher compression engines, as higher octane fuel resists pre-ignition/detonation/knocking better.</p></div>		</li>
