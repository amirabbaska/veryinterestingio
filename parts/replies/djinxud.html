			<div class="markdown"><p>It is highly unlikely. To be able to do this you would have a highly eccentric orbit, know exactly when it was captured, and be able to measure the precession of the orbit. Even then you're going to have to hope that it came from a fairly low-density region to be able to tell which of those systems the planet came from since they will have moved in the mean time as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not really from the orbit alone. To actually start orbiting the sun it would have to interact with a third body. This interaction then determines the final orbit. But if we see it approaching we could determine where it came from, or at least suggest some likely candidates.<br />
But anyway a rogue planet appearing in our solar system is extremely unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I may ask further, the requirement of a third body. Without that, would the trajectory of the rogue just be curved, rather than completely captured? </p>
<p>I know the question stems from random curiosity, but I appreciate you taking the time to provide an answer. </p></div>		</li>
