			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no scientist, but it seems to me that humans have an innate desire to SUCCEED.  Long ago, that meant not dying, not starving, finding a mate and hopefully reproducing.  All of those factors occurred during the entire stress of basic survival.  We didn't have money, bills, a huge group of relatives and friends, tons of people to compare our lives and successes to, and most importantly: time.  Now those &quot;success factors&quot; are the same, but they are more attainable, so accomplishing them doesn't give us the same sense of self-worth.  It's not SIMPLE anymore.  We have it easy compared to those ancestors, and also a whole lot worse.  Finding goals to measure up to within ourselves is not encouraged, we just have a barrage of outside expectations that aren't necessarily germane to our own lives and desires.  Putting the &quot;outside&quot; aside is one of the hardest things a person can do, but also the healthiest.  Sure, we have to adhere to civilization's norms (laws), but there's also an intense pressure to be something beyond yourself which is most-times ridiculous and impossible.  Sit down, alone, talk to yourself about what you like about yourself, the good things that you provide and give, even if trivial.  The goal of modern life isn't to survive, or succeed, it is to LIVE, live the life that you're proud of, not anyone else.  Dr. Seuss your shit: there is only one you in the world, and your Mark doesn't have to be any bigger than making yourself happy.  That can be because you're awesome at puzzles, or you can poop in under 2 minutes, or that you make the best fucking grilled cheese in the world.  Take pride in the little things that are especially YOU, and remember that time will march on without you, so have a fucking good time while you're here and delight in every little thing you can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always had my own definitions of whhat is good, interesting or great. I still have these views and enjoy lots of small things, but as a result after a few decades in this fucked up society im invalidated to the point of giving up on finding friends or even wanting to interact with other people in general. Good that im very thankful for places like this to communicate with people that know other options than to destroy anything that does not fit their tiny little made up world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is very much part of the problem. I personally deal with major depression, PTSD, suicide attempts / ideation, and anxiety (mainly social). My family and friends are largely very religious and are very heavy minded in the camp of &quot;suicide isn't normal, you're not normal, get normal.&quot; I've attempted 3 times in the last 6 months. My social and emotional support obviously is horrible  and so finding light in the endless dark is near impossible.</p>
<p>But it's the stigma and misunderstanding of mental disorders and thier seriousness is the true underlying issue. Sure the brain &quot;isn't working right&quot; in the eyes of survival of the fittest. But the idea that being suicidal and depressed and so on and so forth is &quot;not normal.&quot; To who? The people who don't suffer? As stated all over this thread its a solution not necessarily a biological desire to (or not to) thrive. I've been in and out of psych wards the last 6 months and heard it all. Nurses and doctors telling me it's not normal or ok to think this way. You're broken and not working. Just as many have told me it's OK to be existential, to think about death. The one thing they agree on is the fact that acting on said ideas is when it's &quot;wrong&quot;. But as I've sat down and discussed many of times with my therapist and psychiatrist is the simplifies labels people in general give mental disorders. &quot;not normal&quot; &quot;broken&quot; etc are horrible labels. Especially when so many people suffer from it daily, and almost everyone deals with the symptoms at some point in their life.</p>
<p>It does make it harder to come out and talk to people, (the responses so far are a strong tell as well) because a majority of people so label or stigmatize people so easily. I struggle every day to fight for life when all the people around me just say I need to get better because what I feel &quot;isn't normal.&quot; But when you suffer for 10 years dealing with it and no one was the wiser it was normal. But once I finally broke down and reached out, they turn thier backs, say sorry and tell you to get back to the old you. Not realizing that the old me was dealing with a lot of the same problems, but our solution at the time wasn't suicide. Now that it is, you're a social outcast.</p>
<p>I think mental disorders in general are just largely misunderstood and not talked about enough. Everyone knows and cares about cancer and throws money at charities left and right. But one of the most researched and unique illnesses on the planet is also the most stigmatized and unknown to the population. It's not just sadness and a death wish. It's a person's identity, world view, and way of life. Each victim of mental disorders is unique, no two cases are the same, and every case has its own unique approach to treatment. Blindly labeling them as broken or not normal to me personally is wrong. It's not normal in your opinion, but telling someone or labeling a group of people who deal with it on a normal basis do find it normal. Mental disorders are normal for millions of people around the world, but are broken in the philosophy of survival of the fittest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Came out to my religious mom about depression and anxiety. First thing she told me was &quot;go to church&quot;, &quot;pray to God and he will cure you&quot;. </p>
<p>Uhh, that made me feel even worse because my fundamental support system thinks the reason I have depression and have anxiety is because I don't pray to God and go to church enough. Sigh...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah God is the all saving and all seeing. I don't shun them for thier beliefs, but despise that they push thier beliefs on me. My uncle found God when he was suffering from suicide. Which is good for him, but inevitably became my crux when my family found out about my suicide attempt. &quot;if he did it through God, you will too.&quot; As I stated, every treatment and case is different from person to person. This has been the hardest thing to read to them. That and they're on the idea that &quot;get a job, ignore your problems, change your mindset and life will be good&quot;. But finding a job has been near impossible as my symptoms are so severe and I've lost 3 jobs trying to get on my feet. But it has been nice knowing it's not hidden anymore, just sucks that they cant empathize or try to understand because you've not brought thier higher power into the fold. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know your situation or your family, but maybe I can provide an explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;Go to church&quot; is possibly the best solution that your mom knows of.</p>
<p>A lot of other people offer advice like <em>socialize more</em>, <em>exercise</em>, <em>meditate</em>, or <em>go to therapy</em>. In fact, this advice is often given in mainstream and secular institutions as treatment for depression. These types of treatment also have a proven track record.</p>
<p>But if you look past the rituals and symbols, you'll find that churches, religious communities and praying provide some form of the treatment I mentioned above - other than for <em>exercising</em>, of course. Confession booths were not just invented so that the priests could know all your dirty secrets. All those teachings about forgiving yourself, helping others and putting some time aside for thinking probably has had some purpose for mental health, right?</p>
<p>Now, if you're not religious, there are still some things that you can use from religion. &quot;Finding God&quot; doesn't mean you have to believe in a guy-in-the-sky (well, for some people it does, but you don't need to care about that). It can also mean accepting that many things are out of your direct control, and by accepting your powerlessness you can possibly find some peace and a path forward on how to gain more power over your life.</p>
<p>So maybe your fundamental support system is not coming from a bad place - it's just clumsy and out-of-touch in its support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TBH, I think that says a lot more about her than what she thinks of you. For her, she probably has an incredibly difficult time relating to you and religion was how she was taught to cope with her negative emotions. For a lot of people religion is the only thing that allows them to deal with reality or comprehend things they do not fundamentally understand. </p>
<p>I would imagine your mom probably wants nothing more than for you to enjoy your life, and wouldn't care in the least how you accomplished that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not religious either, but depending on your parent's faith, talk to the leader of their church/temple/etc. That person generally just wants to help other people and there are few greater joys than knowing your parents who asked why you need medicine or therapy just got owned by their spiritual leader.</p>
<p>(Does not work for all religious and/or parents.) Math says that faith leader probably has a few spiritual people with your issue in their church, etc. Use that to your advantage and shame your religious parents into being your biggest advocates.</p>
<p>TL;DR- when discussing mental health issues with religious family/friends, ask to talk to their manager if they aren't helpful.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wish I could give you a kitty and fix whatever you want fixed, or like maybe a cake? Fuck. People suck. I hope you find comfort, people who listen and understand, and I think you're great just as you are. Thanks again for offering your reality and taking a stand for what is &quot;normal.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People do suck, and that's very hard to be OK with when you're depressed. It's still very hard for me to deal with, but I give hope and credit to people even when they don't deserve it. My therapist likes to joke how paradoxical I am. For example being extremely broken as I am, I'm very much worried about the people around me being triggered or hurt rather than be defensive and afraid I'll be triggered or hurt. Most of her clientele she says kind of fall in latter camp.</p>
<p>But I'm glad I came through to someone who us outside the afflictions. They tend to be the hardest to convey the view point too. I don't think they're incapable of it, I think it's tough to understand when you never dealt with it. My ex didn't quite grasp the gravity of my disorders for the length of our 4 year relationship. It was when she found me &quot;dead&quot; and suffered from her first panic attack and now persistent anxiety because of it that she finally understood it. And I feel horrible that I created that in her but it was also eye opening (not healing at all) for her. It's just not something you can describe because it's so profound despite being so small in words.</p>
<p>And cake sounds delicious, but sadly despite my love of cats I'm highly allergic sadly. Kittens are safe as they don't make the protien that causes allergies, but they're all claw-y. Thank you for your reply and words though it means a lot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two days after I attempted to take my own life I called and told my family. For the most part everyone was supportive in trying to figure out my next steps. When I called my mother, she told me to stop being depressed and &quot;walk it off&quot; I can still remember the knot that formed in my stomach. Not being taken seriously or being blown off about something as serious as ending your life is one of the biggest slaps in the face imaginable.</p></div>		</li>
