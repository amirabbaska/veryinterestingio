			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as we can tell p53 works the same way in all mammals, and probably in all animals. It is hard to tell what about the environment favored the duplication of p53, their may have been selection for increased body size and long lifespans which increased the risk of developing cancer, which then favors mutations that reduce this elevated risk. But in truth we will likely never know...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would hazard a guess that if they didn't develop this we wouldn't have big ass elephants.</p>
<p>Natural selection favored the elephants that had lots of these, those that didn't got cancer and died instead of reproducing.</p>
<p>Instead of &quot;how did elephants get this cool DNA?&quot; it's &quot;we're seeing the elephants that got this cool DNA because the ones that didn't died off&quot;.</p>
<p>Natural selection doesn't build cool animals, it kills the ones that don't work out off. We only see the tremendous successes (those that reproduce).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitively not, we tested two different kinds of cells (fibroblasts and fat) and placenta and only found three of the extra copies were expressed...getting elephant tissues is hard so we can't yet say where in the animal, when in development, or even if they other copies are expressed...</p></div>		</li>
