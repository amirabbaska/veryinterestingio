<p>How can that be? Even if one is stationary they're moving with respect to each other. If you have an idealized 2-particle universe, it is not possible that the chance of a collision is affected by whether one or both particles are in random motion. Can you provide a link, please?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an idealized 2-particle universe, the energy of the universe would increase if both particles are in random motion. Presumably the chance of a collision increases with energy, but it's been so long since I looked at statistical thermodynamics that I can't remember the exact equation, and it's possible this isn't quite right.</p>
<p>A bit of googling leads me to a calculation of the mean free path, which is associated with particle collisions: <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/menfre.html#c5" target="_blank">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/menfre.html#c5</a></p>
<p>Based on this, the average relative velocity increases if both particles are moving, which will lead to an increase in particle collisions. </p>
<p>Edit: I might have it backwards. In an ideal gas, the frequency of collisions actually decreases as the temperature increases. Of course, this doesn't exactly model the system of 2 particles in a constrained box, but I may have been too quick to dismiss the naive statistical approach: <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/frecol.html" target="_blank">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/frecol.html</a></p>
<p>Edit2: Another resource suggests the exact opposite: <a href="http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Physical_Chemistry/Kinetics/Modeling_Reaction_Kinetics/Collision_Theory/Collision_Frequency" target="_blank">http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Physical_Chemistry/Kinetics/Modeling_Reaction_Kinetics/Collision_Theory/Collision_Frequency</a></p>
<p>Intuitively, you'd expect collision frequency to increase as temperature rises.</p>
<p>Edit3: My second link doesn't automatically raise the pressure as you raise the temperature. If you use the ideal gas law you'd get an increase in pressure along with an increase in temperature, which accounts for my confusion. SAR-Paradox is correct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mind you i am using molecular collision theories as an analogy so the physical kinetics only remain true if we assume that the two people looking for each other are moving completely randomly.</p>
<p>At an abstract level: the frequency of collision increases when the total energy (kinetic) in both molecules (people) increases. So if both are moving then the total energy is higher and thus they are more likely to find (collide with) each other if they move completely randomly.
It is also worth noting that this analogy does not account for the mentioned &quot;vantage points&quot; or &quot;lines of site&quot; throughout the park. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So next question, if both are moving with speed v do they collide more often than if one is moving with speed 2v?  Or would you need an equal kinetic energy case, so one moving with sqrt(2)v?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question, thermodynamics considers the energy of the entire system (which we will define as the two people). Therefore, the energy can be derived from the sum of both of their velocities (v). So they don't have to have the same velocities and the higher the sum of their velocities, the higher kinetic energy and resulting probability of collision(s).</p></div>		</li>
