			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably have if you have gone on antidepressants, but I have to suggest it anyways. Have you tried maxalts for your migraines? Holy crap did they help me. I couldn't find anything to resolve them, and I can function with maxalts! I know the pain of migraines so whenever I see someone post about them I suggest them. Also I had to try a couple before I found one that worked and didn't make me sleepy, so maybe there is that as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have clinical manic depression/bipolar disorder. You're description of how you felt on antidepressants is exactly how I feel when my episodes are happening. Although I have tried many different medications, I've found that the extreme ups and downs are better than the numb and bad days on meds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frova is an abortive migraine agent and is a miracle drug. I have very bad migraines and that is the only thing that has ever helped me. It might be worth a chat with your neurologist if you've not tried it yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. &quot;Abortive&quot;, in this case, means it stops the migraine. It doesn't abort fetuses. Sorry for the confusion.</p></div>		</li>
