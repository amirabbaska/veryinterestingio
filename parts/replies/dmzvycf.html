			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the detailed response.  My question about corporate tax rates has always been, given that they create double taxation, why do they exist at all?  Why aren't the paper earnings passed on to the individual shareholders along with a payment from the corporation to pay what those taxes would be at the highest tax rate.  It just seems like people pushing for corporate taxes leave the fact that corporate revenues are taxed twice before they reach the individual out of the equation.  Is there something I'm missing here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Timing.  That's the big reason.  Consider that you're a 1% owner of GM (congrats, btw--I think that makes you a billionaire!).  Now, assume there are no dividends paid by GM during the year, and 1% of their revenue is about 950 million dollars.  You have a tax bill of about $40 MILLION dollars and zero dollars coming in.</p>
<p>Generally, people are only taxed when they get the cash.  There are exceptions for partnerships, S-corporations (treated a lot like a partnership) and certain single-member LLCs (called disregarded entities).  These entities are 'flowthrough' and their income is picked up by the owners with no deferral regardless of whether a dividend is paid.  Typically, a corporation is required if you exceed a certain number of shareholders. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you could pass a tax plan that drastically increases taxes on the top couple percentage of income earners, including their capital gains, as a part of eliminating corporate income taxes, I would support it.  I have no faith that will happen, though.</p>
<p>As it stands right now, those individual shareholders pay a really small tax rate on those capital gains, way less than we normal people pay on our earned income, so simply eliminating corporate taxes would be a massive handout to the richest in this country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes you think the top couple of percent aren't paying their fair share?</p>
<p>In 2015, the people who filed tax returns with income 250k or higher was a tiny percentage of the population (as one would expect.  However, their income tax accounted for 52% of all income taxes at an average rate of around 26%.</p>
<p>Those who made 50k or below (roughly 2/3 of the population) paid an average of 4% income tax, for a grand total of 5% of all income taxes in the year.</p>
<p>The rich are more than carrying their fair share of the tax burden.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most supported plan would be to greatly increase capital gains rate and eliminate corporate tax. Every plan (including what we have now) will have a bunch of loopholes that would take a while to eliminate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's timing and cash management, and is very logical. Individuals are generally taxed when they get cash (e.g. When you sell an investment). Corporations are typically taxed on accrual-basis income. </p>
<p>If you taxed individuals on an accrual basis they wouldn't have the cash to pay the tax bill. If you taxed corporations on a cash basis they wouldn't be able to invest capital in as much R&amp;D/payroll/factories etc. </p>
<p>Thus the solution is to split the tax bill across corporations and individuals to align it with their ability to pay, and with their individual goals/priorities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would disagree. Corporations are their own separate entity with different rules, benefits, and protections. It behaves as its own entity so should be subject to tax on its profits.</p>
<p>Don't incorporate if you don't want the company to be recognized by the IRS and taxed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a big part of why people accuse companies of &quot;avoiding&quot; taxes is that when companies, lobbyists, and politicians are whining about taxes and how they need a tax cut, they always cite the full rate without including the deferral. </p>
<p>If someone goes on and on about how high their taxes are and then it turns out they aren't paying you what you were led to believe because of some complex financial details you can't really follow, it's easy to assume they are being dishonest. They already tried to trick you, so dishonesty would be in character. And they established a certain tax rate in your mind as the &quot;real&quot; one, then turned out not to be shuffling papers in order not to pay it. They might be in full compliance with a good system, but they aren't in any compliance with the system they told you about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone asked this in another post here but I thought it was a good question.</p>
<p>What happens if someone has all their money say in the Cayman Islands, and then just uses a credit/debit card for all the purchases in the US? Isn't this a way someone could use their funds abroad but still reside in the US?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you actually comply with tax law . . . no.  US citizens and residents at taxed on their worldwide income.  Having it reside overseas isn't enough.  If you incorporate a Cayman company, and put all your stock and bonds in there, then you will still likely be subject to an anti-abuse regime for controlled foreign corporations (passive income is subpart F income and subject to tax immediately with no deferral).</p>
<p>There are some structures that people try using irrevocable complex trusts in certain jurisdictions, but these structures are really more predicated on the fact that these countries are havens and won't share information with the US.  These are always under attack.  Would NOT recommend!  Generally, these are vehicles for tax evasion, not tax avoidance (e.g. committing a crime of tax evasion).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a stupid question, but could you explain the difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance please? Both things sound like you're not paying taxes you're expected to pay for me.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the info in your other posts as well.</p></div>		</li>
