			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem! It also explains what others have written about above, when you use water instead of beer. Because there is no CO2 disolved in water,the vacuum instead just pulls the whole weight of the water back down with a huge amount of force-enough to break the bottom disk of glass clean off the bottle. Try it sometime! (In a controlled environment of course)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously you've never been to a college party: the bottle will definitely break with beer. CO2 doesn't outgas quickly enough to effect the dynamics of the beer's motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close, but I don't think that's quite right. After the gap forms, the bottom surface of the beer smacks into the glass bottom of the bottle. Water is very nearly incompressible, so all of that momentum is transferred in a very short amount of time. This is known as a 'water hammer' and is illustrated in this <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/6/" target="_blank">xkcd</a>. The force can sometimes be high enough to blow out the bottom out of the bottle. If the bottle doesn't break, it will create a very intense pressure wave that propagates back through the beer. It's that pressure wave that catalyzes bubble formation.</p></div>		</li>
