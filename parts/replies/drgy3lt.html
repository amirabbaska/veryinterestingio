			<div class="markdown"><p><em>completely</em> tangential and unrelated to the original post, but a random thing I learned in college through a research paper was that it's a minor historical mystery that the dragon, as far as we can tell, never existed, but it appears in similar forms in the mythology of almost every civilization.</p>
<p>From what I remember, the leading... theories, for lack of a better term (there's no way to test this) are either that ancient people happened upon the fossils of dinosaurs and their imaginations went wild, or (more likely IMO) they made up stories about giant scary things that had traits from lots of giant scary things in nature: big sharp claws and teeth from predators, mixed with the death-from-the-sky aspect of birds of prey, and in some cases they were snake-like to help play off of our instinctive fear of snakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh you too have heard of the dreaded Cat Bird Snake. Keep in mind those three are tops of the list for predators of everything from mammals to primates to humans. So one could say the dragon is a distillation of all predators that have hunted mammals to humans for all of lived existence.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dragons have generally been some kind of combination of a lion, an eagle, and probably most importantly a snake.  </p>
<p>These three predators and their ancestors preyed on our ancestors for millions of years.  To this day almost all mammals have instinctual fear reactions to hisses, the shape of the teeth and the eyes, and the jerky movements of snakes/reptiles (it's speculated that the kind of flat-eared, growl, hiss, and spit aggressive behavior in some mammals like cats is an adaptation that imitates the reptilian behavior to evoke a stronger fear reaction in others).  </p>
<p>Basically, the thinking is that dragons are this kind of collective ancestral fear of our greatest historical predators expressed through culture and art.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could also be a combination of both theories. Instinctive fear could have created the idea of a dragon, and then stumbling upon a fossil every now and then could have reinforced it and helped mold the concept into a more uniform image across disparate peoples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, wolves are seen to derive their strength from numbers, where as Lions are typically seen as solo animals suggesting that even alone they are still the most dangerous, where as wolves suggest that you must be among friends to have any true strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lions are not really solo.. in fact they are the only wild cat that lives in groups.  Usually a male with several females, but sometimes two males (usually brothers) and several females.  Or a group of bachelor males.  Tigers, cheetahs, leopards, and so forth, are solitary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were the &quot;lions&quot; that existed in Europe the same as African Lions?</p>
<p>There are mountain lions in the Pacific Northwest, and they are mostly solitary as well.  Also called cougars, but any big cat could have been referred to as a lion at some point in history.</p></div>		</li>
