			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhh can i ask something not about this topic?</p>
<p>I dont know if you have watched animes like Sword Art Online so i will tell you what's it in a short way; Users are connected to the VR gaming machine but when you enter game it's like you are paralyzed, they dont act with game just like brain does us to dont act with dreams, is that possible? Can some devices make us temporarly paralyzed or sleep-like condition but with concisness?(i wrote that wrong for sure, %100)</p></div>		</li>
