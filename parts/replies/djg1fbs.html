<p>I drink 3-4 16 ounce beers every single day, minimum. And I've drank like this for almost two years now. </p>
<p>On a scale of not-fucked to totally-fucked, what's my current trajectory?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not that far off. I'm not sure where OP got their numbers from, but the general guidelines are a bit different. Those are no more than 15 drinks a week, and no more than 3 drinks per day. No more than 1 drink per hour. That is to classify you as a moderate drinker.</p>
<p>The main thing you want to avoid is binge drinking. Your 3 drinks a day isn't awful, but if you do it every day you may want to cut back. What's much worse for you in both short and long term is when that 3 turns into 5 or more.</p>
<p>Now 90% of the people who break those rules are not alcoholics. They are not dependent.</p>
<p>The best advice is to try to cut back and see how you feel. If it's negative or you have trouble then you may have a problem. If you have trouble sleeping without it then there is something else going on that you should address. Self-medication is a huge reason for alcohol abuse.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be able to sleep without drinking, but I kinda suffer from what I call the Pringles Disease; once you pop you know you can't stop. So I can go all day without a beer, but as soon as I have one I end up drinking them in quick succession, especially now since it's hard to sleep without hitting a certain level of intoxication. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Stop drinking for 5 days. If during this you feel like you &quot;need&quot; to have a drink, seek help. </p>
<p>If it doesn't bother you: what's going to change in the next 5-10 years? Are you in college, or single without responsibilities? Do you plan on &quot;moving past&quot; this part of your life? If not, seek help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;...moderate drinking, which has been shown by many studies to confer health benefits...&quot;</p>
<p>This is a classic example of mistaking correlation for causation. People with severe health problems abstain from drinking, due to their health conditions. This abstention by severely ill members of the population skews the results in statistical analysis. Drinking alcohol does not actually confer health benefits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This NPR article does a good job of explaining it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/22/471416356/that-cabernet-might-not-be-good-for-your-health-after-all" target="_blank">http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/22/471416356/that-cabernet-might-not-be-good-for-your-health-after-all</a></p>
<p>It references a study where researchers reviewed 87 previous studies about the effects of alcohol on health and found that the earlier interpretation was mistaken.</p>
<p>Basically it comes down to early researchers not distinguishing between people who abstained from alcohol throughout their life (and were overall healthier), versus people who quit alcohol later in life (often due to severe medical conditions like heart disease).</p></div>		</li>
