<p>I love thinking about the fact that machines will likely soon qualify as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life#definitions" target="_blank">life</a>&quot; in almost every way, and there exists the possibility that such a form of life could outlast <em>us</em> and other cellular life (and/or migrate away from us). This means that at some point far in the future, the machines' distant descendants could be speculating about their own origins, and arguing about whether they were deliberately designed or if they came into existence via random chance. Which is exactly where we are right now...</p></div>		</li>
