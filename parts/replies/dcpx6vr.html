<p>Energy is not in general conserved in general relativity</p>

<p>Is there then a &quot;fictitious&quot; energy created to make up the deficit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, energy is not necessarily the same between reference frames. One person can see a photon as very blue shifted and high energy while another sees it as redshifted and of much lower energy. Both are as correct as the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give an analogy, someone tosses up a ball in a fast-moving convertible. If it drifts and hit someone else in the car, it isn't going to hurt too much because it has low kinetic energy relative to the car (and everyone inside). However, if it drifts out of the car and hits someone on the sidewalk, it will hurt a lot since it has a lot of kinetic energy relative to that person.</p>
<p>The key is to think about relative energy. We don't have a way to measure absolute kinetic energy. For example, how much kinetic energy does the cup sitting on my desk have? That question is meaningless without a frame of reference. It's kinetic energy is negligible compared to me sitting next to it, but it has a large amount of kinetic energy relative to the sun since it is moving at the speed that the earth is orbiting.</p></div>		</li>
