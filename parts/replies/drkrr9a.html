			<div class="markdown"><p>I is more about alloying element effects and temperatures and the close packed structure. Typically iron (ferrite) at room temperature is arranged in a body centered cubic pattern. A magnet will stick to this iron. When you heat mild steel up past the Curie temperature it goes through a phase transformation to what is called face centered cubic. This phase is called austenite and is not magnetic. Some allowing elements can cause iron to stay in an austenite phase at lower temperatures. Nickel which is a big component of austenitic stainless steel is oneof those elements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most common stainless steels (18/8, 100-300 series) are not highly magnetic. There are some 400-series stainless steel that are (these can also be hardened).  However, they aren't as corrosion resistant.  It's a trade off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>440C is a common stainless steel for making knife blades, and be made fairly hard based on the Rockwell scale. There are newer and better stainless steels for knives, such as S30V or S90V.</p>
<p>M4 is a tool steel which can be made very hard and is extremely tough, but is not stainless. Good for knife blades if maintained properly against rust.</p></div>		</li>
