			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested in this topic I highly recommend reading Martha Crenshaw's <a href="http://courses.kvasaheim.com/hist319a/docs/Crenshaw%201981.PDF" target="_blank">The Causes of Terrorism</a>. It's a little lengthy but a great starting point for anyone who wants to get more familiar with terrorism (why it occurs, how the process works, the social and political effects, etc.).</p>
<p>Page 386: &quot;The most basic reason for terrorism is to gain recognition or attention. [...] Violence and bloodshed always excite human curiosity, and the theatricality, suspense, and threat of danger inherent in terrorism enhance its attention-getting qualities. [...] Today, in an interdependent world, the need for international recognition encourages transnational terrorist activities...[a]s the audience grows larger, more diverse, and more accustomed to terrorism, <em>terrorists must go to extreme lengths to shock</em>&quot;. Attacking civilians in a country like Sweden would certainly garner a lot of international attention, and certainly comes across as a huge shock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those tactics , all make sense in the beginning. But it has a opposite effect on those terrorist people are afraid and start accepting that the government starts to hitting harder and will turn a blind eye on collateral damage(that these terrorist try to exploit as hey look how evil X country is. </p>
<p>Thinking about it, its a vicious cycle. We want them to get hit hard, we hit hard and kill innocent people, terrorist call that out get more recruiting power, then do another attack, then that get retaliation... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, there's just one important aspect that is hinted at in your answer but not made explicit. Terrorism is dependant on the media for spreading the message. Attack big audacious targets and get  press attention, media distributes message. Attacking military targets wouldn't get the desired level of media coverage hence attacking soft targets.</p></div>		</li>
