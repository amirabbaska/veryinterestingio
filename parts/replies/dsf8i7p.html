			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really fascinating to me, because it never occurred to me that vinyl was necessarily limited to mono below 250hz (although that makes sense); one of my favorite mixing tricks is to use an EQ in mid-side mode to cut all low frequency side-channel content from the stereo mix. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Those are not constraints of vinyl. Some albums may be mastered that way but it is in no way a limitation of the format.</p>
<p>For instance, the Telarc recording of the 1812 Overture has bass as low as 6Hz that can be played on vinyl, although you need a well setup turntable to not have it throw the needle.</p>
<p>On the high end, 23-24khz is quite common on good recordings.</p>
<p>This doesn't change the debate much, but a limited frequency response of vinyl isn't a point at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>is that not way beyond human hearing range? I remember learning a ballpark figure of 20-20Khz being the human range, and when we experimented with a frequency generator the highest frequency we could hear was around 17-18KHz. Maybe you can hear the difference in sounds with harmonics at those frequencies, but I doubt that many humans can hear sounds rooted at 23kHz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, it is way outside the range of even the most undamaged ears.</p>
<p>The point was high end frequency response is not a limitation of the medium, vinyl is capable of playing frequencies well above and below what we can hear.</p></div>		</li>
