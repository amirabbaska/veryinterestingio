			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in an area where there is a nearby risk of nuclear release (not an explosion, but a criticality or damage to materials or other nuclear release). The emergency management instructions for an event are essentially:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you're in your car, turn off the air conditioner and go straight home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're home, turn off your climate control and seal all climate controls vents and potentially leaking doors or windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you've been outside at all, immediately throw away the clothes you were wearing and shower (no soap, just a really thorough rinse IIRC). Do not wash the clothes, because you could contaminate your washer and drier. When you're done showering, rinse the shower out very well and let the water run for a while when you're done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not drink tap water or go outdoors until further instructions are received.</p>
</li>
<li>Take your iodine tablets until you're told it's safe not to.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there is a release of radioactive material (including, I would assume, an actual explosion where you survive), your priority should be AVOIDING contamination, not protecting yourself from it. Once the initial burst is over, most of that contamination would be in the form of things that settle on your skin or that you inhale, not anything that sunscreen would protect you from.</p>
<p>Edit: forgot number 5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They overload your thyroid with &quot;clean&quot; iodine and stop it from absorbing (and storing) radioactive iodine. My understanding is that if you survive the initial exposure (i.e. don't have fatal radiation poisoning), your thyroid is one of the most at-risk organs in your body for continued damage due to its tendency to accumulate iodine.</p>
<p>Obviously the best answer is to get away as quickly as possible, but given the situation where I live I would end up spending a lot of time (well, a couple hours) at home while awaiting instructions on whether to evacuate and which route to take (not to mention drive time in a potentially irradiated area while I get out), so it's a precautionary measure to avoid being poisoned while I make all the arrangements I need to make.</p>
<p>Fortunately the last criticality was in the 50s and I'm towards the edge of the danger zone. Still, it's not something you want to take chances with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3 &amp; 4 seem to contradict each other, in that if tap water is irradiated shouldn't you NOT want to keep running the shower water after done showering?  </p>
<p>I feel like the more you run water you'd deplete the non-irradiated water that was in the pipes/system and pull the freshly irradiated water in.  Am I not understanding the average water supply?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crank the temperature all the way up and you're really just depleting what's in your hot water heater, which should be safe. Although, I just looked at the most recent instructions and it says nothing about water usage. Maybe the prevalence of on-demand heaters has changed that requirement. Or I could have gotten something mixed up. Unfortunately for my life expectancy, this is not the first place I've lived where I've had to have emergency management plans memorized. The last one was chemical, this one is nuclear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's purified water with no minerals it should be fine. We were taught in Nuclear Biological, Chemical (NBC now CBRNE training) that the minerals found in water can become radioactive after exposure. If you distil the water you'll be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in an area where there is a risk of radioactive release, and instructions in the event of an &quot;event&quot; are to not drink tap water until you get an all-clear. I don't know exactly how it's affected, but it seems that it can be and will need to be tested before it's wise to drink it.</p></div>		</li>
