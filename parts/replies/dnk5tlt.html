From my understanding, locality isn't necessarily violated because the entangled particles are part of the same system that happens to occupy different locations in our three dimensional space.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But this is where you acknowledge Occam's Razor. Sure, it is <em>possible</em> we are in a simulation, but there is absolutely no evidence to suggest we are, and no real reason to believe that naturalistic explanations are not sufficient. Until there is good reason to believe the simple solution is correct, don't overcomplicate things. </p>
<p>I know you are not suggesting we are in a simulation, so don't take this as a challenge, it is just responding to the notion in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was talking about Bells theorem and the question popped in my mind because my physics professor (phys-1, basic stuff) said that we're almost certain that radioactive decay is entirely random. This isn't exactly what he said, but that was basically it.</p>
<p>I just don't get how Bells theorem makes sense, how can such a thing possibly be thoroughly tested.
EDIT:</p>
<p>What I mean is I can't wrap my head around how we can test for example that an invisible particle or field doesn't interact with the particle, causing the decay? This is an obvious example of what would be a hidden variable, I just don't understand how we were to disprove such a thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because it turns out that the existence of such a deterministic cause has measurable consequences (and when experiments are performed, they are consistent with no local hidden variables, and inconsistent with the existence of undetected particles or fields interacting with our apparently random system). You should read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_theorem#Overview" target="_blank">overview</a> of the wikipedia article about Bell's theorem, if you're interested. </p>
<p>It's not easy to understand if you don't already understand the concepts of quantum entanglement or complementarity, though. Such is the nature of quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, it is mathematically and conceptually very challenging, so even though it is supported by an enormous preponderance of experimental evidence, it's very hard to communicate effectively to people without substantial backgrounds in math and physics. </p>
<p>The best thing I can ask of you is to keep an open mind, and to be aware that this is <em>not</em> a philosophical question, but a scientific and measurable one: <em>we are able to perform experiments that rule out the existence of local hidden variables</em>, such as the examples you described. If you read that wikipedia article and don't follow, I don't think I can do a much better job, but I encourage you not to think, &quot;I don't understand this, and it makes zero sense to me, therefore I'm pretty sure it's wrong.&quot; That is a decidedly unscientific outlook, and you should rather think, &quot;that's so crazy! I don't understand it, but if I keep learning more about it, maybe I'll be able to.&quot;</p>
<p>Sadly, it's not reasonable to expect to understand the weirder features of complex scientific models like quantum mechanics without putting in the legwork to understand the basic framework, first. To put it into perspective, most college physics students will only briefly learn about Bell's theorem or never see it at all. It's not really covered in depth until graduate level coursework or in specialized upper level college courses (like quantum information theory, or something).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There might be a plain-language explanation of Bell's theorem that laymen like me can follow, but the Wiki overview definitely isn't it.  </p>
<p>I guess if something is missing for me, it's understanding <em>exactly what an experimenter would expect to see if local hidden variables were affecting one of these measurements</em>.  </p>
<p>Sometimes I think it's a shame that most layman's explanations are written by theorists rather than experimentalists. It's the physical, practical &quot;what-you'd-see-in-a-lab&quot; descriptions that really help clarify things, not equations, and not jargon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a recent episode of 3Blue1Brown on YouTube, where he went over an example of how you can go about &quot;disproving&quot; the idea that there could be some hidden variable or hidden state in a particle that determines its behavior in what would otherwise appear to be a random fashion. I'm using the term &quot;disapprove&quot; a bit loosely here; more aptly, the video gives a good intuition for how you could go about investigating this question through experiments.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/MzRCDLre1b4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/MzRCDLre1b4</a></p>
<p>The part in referencing starts at 15:30 but definitely watch the whole thing!</p>
<p>Basically, the example in the video involved looking at how light passes through various polarized filters. They were able to show that the amount of light passing through the  filters changes when you add a third filter into the mix. They demonstrate there isn't any way for the light to &quot;know&quot; whether it should or shouldn't pass through the second filter, since the probability changes when there is a third filter for it to potentially pass through. It supports the idea that the process is fundamentally random, and that's why the odds of events work-out the way they do.</p>
<p>Please watch the video I promise it will be worth your time! I admit my summary above does not do it justice and I may be misrepresenting some of the finer details, but the video does a great job at going through some of this quantum weirdness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like that video cruises past the idea that the polarizing filter will reorient light (within a certain degree of offset, otherwise the probability of being blocked increases) which makes the behaviour fairly unremarkable, without really addressing why that explanation doesn't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh I see. Yeah the details of that go pretty far over my head. From a philosophical point though, &quot;are there hidden variables?&quot; isn't a particularly meaningful question if one doesn't require &quot;hidden variables&quot; to influence reality. Physics (rightfully, in my opinion) deals only in things which actually have the ability to influence reality. In that sense, it's not surprising that one could then test the assertion that there are hidden variables.</p>
<p>Where I agree with you in confusion is the fact that all local (thanks /u/sticklebat) hidden variable theories must, for some reason, have shared predictions which can then be tested all at once. Hopefully somebody comes by who knows this better than me...</p></div>		</li>

More specifically, on the correlations between separated particles. I disagree with some of the other replies here that say you need a deep understanding of QM to get Bell's theorem or the CHSH. There are some fairly simple ways to demonstrate the meaning of them in non-technical terms and there are a multitude of YouTube videos that do just that. </p></div>		</li>
