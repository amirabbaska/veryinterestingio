<p>Amongst wild white-faced capuchins, infants will alarm at anything novel in the environment, but especially snake-like creatures. Adults teach infants to distinguish between novel and dangerous creatures by positively responding to alarm calls and, in the case of dangerous snakes, going and fetching infants and bringing them to look at the snakes while alarming at them. &quot;Snake events&quot; refer to events where members of the group will gather around, alarm at, and break branches over dangerous snakes. Pregnant monkeys don't attend snake events anymore than other monkeys, but mothers with small infants attend them at a much higher rate. Even non-mothers, such as adult males, will fetch infants and bring them to snake events. </p>
<p>As a side note, capuchins hate dangerous snakes so much, they have been known to mob them if one is attacking a monkey. They have <a href="http://www.ots.ac.cr/bnbt/25510.html" target="_blank">successfully saved</a> each other from snake attacks. </p>
