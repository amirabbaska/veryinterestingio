			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, they are a couple of the first sounds most babies can make besides just screaming and burbling, and which are not purely accidental.</p>
<p>Because mothers are generally spending more time with the children (especially if breastfeeding), and people come out wanting to communicate, and because humans naturally want to form relationships in our family structures, we ended up largely taking advantage of this fact by associating them with real things the baby should find important: their parents, and in specific, the parent who is there. And because languages are powerful due to their shared nature, culture forces normalization (ma is always the female parent). And because we want to focus only on intentional communication, we only accept repeated utterances (ma-ma).</p>
<p>So because parents want to be recognized, they treat the first things babies can say intentionally as that recognition, and the baby then catches on fairly quickly that it can get a response saying it. In reality, the only reason it's so common is that it happens to be one of the first things babies CAN say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do babies in cultures that don't use &quot;ma&quot; and &quot;da&quot; sounds for father and mothers make these first sounds?  Or do their first sounds correspond to the actual words for parents used in these languages?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. They are simple to say because of the shape the mouth has to make to produce the sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A theory for why &quot;ma&quot; is for mother and &quot;da&quot; is for father is that the &quot;mmm&quot; sound has a connotation of closeness and intimacy, as the mother is usually the parent holding the child. &quot;Da&quot; has pretty much the opposite connotation, as it is a harsher and sharper sound, which reflects the fact that the father is generally the more distant parent (at least during infancy).</p></div>		</li>
