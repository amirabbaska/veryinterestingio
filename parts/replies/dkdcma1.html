			<div class="markdown"><p>it seems the most correct answer is that the mug itself gets cold from the ice and it gets colder than a normal glass, and drinking from a cold mug enhances the flavor and bars would do this for other drinks too if they weren't so concerned about loss/theft of these expensive mugs so they choose to keep it a novelty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the opposite sometimes. Gazpacho and Italian dishes even Indian dishes I can taste more of the flavor profile when it is cold. Cheap saki is heated, and the good stuff is cold. Must depend on something in the beverage or food</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The colder the drink the less flavour it will have. Think Coors Light cold vs Coors Light warm. The cold one tastes better because it tastes like less of anything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The opposite is true for coffee.  As it cools and becomes tepid, you can taste all the nuances of the roast and bean, which is why most coffee cuppings actually return after the coffee has cooled past 170ºF, down to 70ºF ish.  The heat will embark the wet aroma, but mask subtleties (and problems) with the roast and extraction.</p>
<p>So I think it's safe to say... </p>
<p>As beverages approach <em>room temperature</em> their flavor is unmasked, whether that means heating or cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the effect here is the physical experience of drinking from a cold cup. The cup doesn't make the drink colder, it's the other way around. </p>
<p>This could make people happier because a cold cup feels &quot;freshly poured&quot;, or otherwise is satisfying because you know it's cold before you even drink it. </p>
<p>This may not have a direct effect on the taste buds, but it's part of the overall experience, which is more than just taste. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many beer places put their beer glass in a freezer. Also when making cocktails, the proper method is to &quot;ice the glass&quot; while creating the cocktail. </p>
<p>It's more a novelty than anything. We are suckers for marketing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well much less than if you were holding the cup obviously. The handle is still connected to the cup so there is some transfer. The handle sweats just like the rest of the cup does. At least the ones I own do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat transfer from your hand is going to be orders if magnitude smaller through the handle than it would be by touching the cup itself. </p>
<p>Conduction is governed by k <em> A </em> dT/dx. </p>
<p>Now, k is fixed, it's the conductivity of the material, in this case the copper. </p>
<p>dT is also relatively fixed. It's the difference in temperature between the cup and your hand. </p>
<p>But A and dx are the two variables when comparing using the handle and holding the cup in your hand. </p>
<p>A is the amount of surface area which is transferring heat. Obviously this area of contact is much smaller on the handle than if you were holding the cup in your hand. And from the above formula, a smaller A value means less heat transfer by the same factor as A is smaller itself. </p>
<p>Now dx is the distance that heat had to travel from the hot medium to the cold medium, which on this case would be from your hand to the liquid. For a hand on the outside of the cup, dx is just the thickness of the cup wall, but for a hand on a handle, dx could be approximated as the thickness of the cup plus half the length of the handle. And from the above equation, a larger dx will yield a much smaller heat transfer, by the same factor that dx is larger itself. </p>
<p>So, the combination of a small A and large dx means that heat transfer from your hand through the handle is essentially negligible when compared to heat transfer from your hand through the cup wall itself.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense, but it's not the right answer. u/stairway2evan posted the answer in another comment. In short, the mugs were used to sell vodka, which was new in the US market at the time. Basic marketing. </p></div>		</li>
