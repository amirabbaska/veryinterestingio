			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want your phones to sound like the real thing, you're going to need large bandwidth. Smart communication engineers discovered that using only the frequencies in the range of 330-3000 KHz in the speech spectrum makes the listener distinguish the individual speaker, the content of what is being said and requires little band (as opposed to transmitting the entire speech signal). Cutting the signal down also allows more users to be fit in the spectrum, which in turn earns a company more cash, combine that with outdated telephone wires, signal attenuation and other environmental effects, you get your shitty not-so-realistic voice on your phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You bring up bandwidth as though our present use of the term meant anything when telephones were developed. It did not.</p>
<p>Back when telephones were analog, cutting down the spectrum did not allow any more signals in the available bandwidth, because 330 Hz - 3000 Hz (NOT, as you wrote, 330-3000 KHz, which means 330 kHz - 3 MHz) was the available bandwidth and you could not fit more than one signal on a wire. This was surely a factor once digitization became a possibility, though.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the expense of a high fidelity signal was not worth the cost. By the late 1920s, though, radio broadcasts of reasonable fidelity (audio up to 8 kHz) became possible through the use of equalized balanced lines. Again, this was a special order that required the phone company to task more than one engineer with making THAT particular connection good enough for radio.</p>
<p>330 Hz - 3 kHz does NOT &quot;make the listener distinguish&quot; etc. It is barely enough to ALLOW the listener to distinguish details of speech. I have a company name with the initials B, D, G, T, F, and S, and I have to resort to words so listeners can reliably distinguish between F and S, and between B, D, and sometimes even T.</p>
<p>Why doesn't all equipment sound better? Because, in general, there's no cost benefit to it. I was listening to a couple of guys on the radio today, each in his own home with an internet connection, and the fidelity of each was spectacular. Why? Because they cared enough to have a hi fi connection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said, there are digital compression algorithms such as Speex that are efficient, fast, and preserve better audio while using similar or possibly even less bandwidth. I believe a lot of it has to do with the logistical hurdles of developing and implementing an entirely new standard without breaking backwards compatibility or losing the use of a lot of old infrastructure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who used to work at a radio station, our phone conversations were fed through a box that introduced a delay.</p>
<p>This way, if they swore or w/e we could push a button and blank out the few previous seconds.</p>
<p>Unfortunately all this equipment was old and introduced noise. Guess how many radio stations nowadays have the budget to re-do decades old wiring that still works or replace working obscure/expensive niche systems?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>cell phones are clear when both channels are using VOIP with high quality codecs(compare skype quality for example)....however interfacing with landlines requires a downgrade and bandwidth issues still persist.</p>
<p>Try VoIP LTE or run your own PBX like I used to do....experience the joy of your excellent call quality randomly tanking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't need to re-run the lines, just replace the modulation technology. In fact, they are doing that nowadays with DSL+VoIP.</p>
<p>The main design goal of DSL is <em>not</em> having to re-run old phone lines. It works best with a POTS line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about profit vs overhead.</p>
<p>I'll put it this way. In my job I have the responsibility of running an internal phone network over satellite links. Sat time is extremely expensive. For a single day of 4Mbit throughput it would take multiple thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Say I have about 200 devices that have to operate on that 4Mbit connection. I have a shitload of data that has to get pushed. So while voice- being voice, should have a priority because it's a UDP stream and is dependent on priority, that regular data also needs to be sent and received.</p>
<p>I have a choice. I can give the voice users amazeballs voice quality, or I can eke as much throughput out of my link by lowering the data rate on my voice calls.</p>
<p>In exactly the same way cell companies operate. Sure, they could absolutely give you amazing voice quality, but they also have to pass a massive amount of data over those wireless links and people are already content with voice quality. Why increase that bandwidth when there's no call for the increase?</p></div>		</li>
