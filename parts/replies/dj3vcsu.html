<p>There are few differences at the end of the day. The big outliers are things like bloatware and custom software. If you load a device up with more software then it'll have to swap memory out on a regular basis, which is really really slow. Some manufacturers like Samsung also run their own custom UIs which are again often significantly slower than the stock Android UI.</p>

<p>There's a few articles floating around that can back this up. For example, deleting Facebook can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/42kyph/uninstalling_facebook_speeds_up_your_android/" target="_blank">seriously help your battery life.</a> The easiest tweaks to getting better battery life and performance are to delete apps that hog it all, and to install something to manage the ones you need to keep like Greenify.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deleting Facebook's apps is one of the best things I've ever done. No more notifications with mandatory Pavlovian reaction, and significantly more battery life. Their mobile site is pretty good as well. For the messenger I use Disa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! Disa is pretty great - I need to integrate Telegram and WhatsApp as well, but I'm lazy (and don't want to lose my message history).</p>
<p>For Facebook I use Tinfoil, which works just fine for now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate that every android phone maker feels to need to redesign the UI and add a fuckton of bloatware. I've turned to a regular cycle with my phones, where I let the stock OS stick around until start to face major slowdown (usually within two years) and then I wipe it and reinstall a custom ROM with as close to a stock android experience as possible. I always prefer the latter option, but I don't want to void my warranty so I always wait to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you look at phones like the Huewei P9 and Honor 8 handsets which are considered the cheap asian versions of modern smartphones, they always put the most ugly horrible custom skin on their android versions, which also lag very far behind the update curve.</p>
<p>Hardware wise they're decent devices, and if they're trying to cut costs to hit that cheap market, surely they'd save loads by doing 0 android customisation! They'd be considerably more popular and competitive with stock android.</p>
<p>I'm glad google is starting to hit the pixel line of devices, I really hope their 2nd generation of phones start hitting samsung etc hard and force samsung to go stock android.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many custom roms also include customized kernels that disable features like logging or enables specific optimizations that may work for most devices, but could compromise stability or even the hardware when used wrong. Things like adding overclocking or undervolting.   </p>
<p>Sometimes stuff from newer kernels gets backported as well.  This is something the manufacturer cannot easily do as they have many devices to support and cannot just make a new release for every new optimization or feature.</p></div>		</li>
