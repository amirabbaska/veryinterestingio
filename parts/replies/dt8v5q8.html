			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying they have a good or bad pelvis is REALLY subjective. It's easy to measure diameters and outlet shapes on a skeleton but doing so on a person is really not a great standard to base major decisions on unless it's overwhelmingly apparent that the pelvis is not going to accommodate anything at all. Even then, putting &quot;inadequate pelvis&quot; without testing the process and the passenger robs the mother of the opportunity to try and hopefully prove us wrong. There are, however, a number of factors that go into the doctor or midwive's thought process for whether or not we'll call a section, we often make predictions early for our against a vaginally delivery. We love it when we think it won't work, but it does. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A doctor told me that they statistically needed less C sections when they stopped programming ones according to measurements. You basically can't really know the flexibility of all this (yes it moves and widens before birthing), which is the ultimate factor.</p>
<p>I even think that there was a psychosomatical aspect of this and they stopped telling to the woman if the odds seemed good or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You usually don't know, because the bones that need to separate far enough for delivery are internal. My sister in law was pushing for hours before she finally conceded to have a C section because the doctors told her her pelvis wasn't opening wide enough for the baby's head to come through. That's usually how it goes, you don't know until you try. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Young doctor, a better answer for your oral boards and for your attendings on when to call a C-section for cephalopelvic disproportion would invoke the following studies by Rouse <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10074971" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11576566" target="_blank">2</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29138035" target="_blank">Grobman</a> Otherwise I agree, clinical assessment is extremely subjective. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure it happens but most of the time we all want to at least give the pt a chance, if things don't move quickly or if the mom or baby looks a little sketchy then there may be a lower threshold for suggesting a CS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pelvic outlet is the space between the ischial spines and the pelvic inlet is the brim/hole made by the whole pelvis. Both are important factors in ease of labor but the outset is what is being talked about here moreso. Afaik at least. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding power - is the strength of menstrual cramps an indicator for how strong your uterus will contract during child birth? I.e does somebody with stronger menstrual cramps also have stronger contractions during child birth? Or is that completely different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Both types of contractions are thought to be mediated by prostaglandins. But there is no correlation to the two as there are many factors which affect ability to deliver a child. </p></div>		</li>
