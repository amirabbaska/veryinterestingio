			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it true that if i eat like 4 to 5 hours before bed...my breath doesnt smell bad in the morning or its just me...ive been doing that since forever and i always think that my breath doesnt smell bad compared to others..i also drink tons of water before bed and i assume that it pushes all the food in my digestive tract lower so now no gas or anything go through my mouth but instead my butt...is this method possible???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely more probable that by eating that far before bedtime it's simply that your mouth is cleaner when you go to bed and there is less material for bacteria to eat. </p>
<p>If you eat right before bed it's really easy to brush over food packed in between teeth or in the tooth surfaces. After hours though, even with no special attention, that stuff usually is no longer present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will help but people are failing to mention the lack of talking! I keep my jaw fairly locked down at night and if you do that for hours, your breath smells. </p>
<p>Source: I had a job with little interaction and would often get &quot;morning&quot; breath before lunch</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just don't smell it. Most morning breath is caused by bacteria between teeth (and elsewhere) breaking their food down and forming Sulphur compounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, most likely bad hygiene contributed to your bad teeth. I once thought my slightly-yellowish hue on my teeth was a genetic thing that I couldnâ€™t control. Nope, it was just me not brushing as much as I should have as a kid. Oh and cavities. Lots of cavities. </p></div>		</li>
