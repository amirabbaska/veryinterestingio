			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting read, thank you. Living in Europe, for me it's natural to have some restrictions like that to keep the racists from spreading their shit. But of course it can potentially be dangerous! </p>
<p>But you must have some sort of limits in the states as well? Isn't hate speech forbidden by law? Or does the freedom of speech trumpf that? </p>
<p>Then again you are not allowed to swear or use a certain type of language on tv and radio. How is that possible?</p></div>		</li>

<p>See, that's exactly the kind of thinking Americans are opposed to. Here, racists have the right to be racist and to say racist shit. I'm a liberal who loves diversity and supports causes that promote diversity and inclusion, but I support the right for people with abhorrent views to express those views, because it gives me assurance that if I one day have an unpopular opinion (and if the definition of &quot;hate speech&quot; is abused and shifts to be more broad, as tends to happen with human-defined categories), I won't be silenced or reprimanded by my government for it. </p>
<p>It's important to note that we do have limitations to our first amendment. The speech can't put people in immediate  danger. So While a racist can make a racist declarative statement &quot;I hate <em>x</em> race, and they're all going to burn in hell,&quot; you can't go on Facebook or any other soap box and say  &quot;I call on all my followers to lynch <em>x</em> group of people.&quot; </p>
<p>It's all about &quot;reals before feels&quot; as the internet sometimes says. Does the speech pose a real physical threat to people? Or is it merely deeply offensive, but will not result in any tangible harm? You don't have a right to not be offended, but you do have a right to reasonable safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live (Finland) people are also allowed to say and write what ever racist shit they like, but if they &quot;agitate against an ethnic minority&quot; (is the best way I can translate it), then it's a crime. Of course it is a bit hard to determine when the limit has been overstepped. In many other parts of Europe there are laws against hate speech.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is where it starts to get a bit tricky though doesn't it?  I'm not going to advocate one way or another in this discussion as I'm conflicted myself so just throwing this out there. The more racists continue to say racist things, especially now where the internet allows whatever it is they are saying be read by hundreds of people immediately and forever afterwards, you start to build an environment where, for some, its the norm to hate and vilify x community and can indeed lead to harm being caused to people even if the original statements didn't directly incite it.</p>
<p>You don't have to actually rally people to attack other people.  You could, as an example, repeatedly claim that someone completely innocent is a paedophile and the chances are in your favour that someone will try to attack them for it.</p>
<p>I think as Europeans, we're very aware of the consequences of allowing sweeping, derogatory statements about an entire race/religion/culture.  We've fought bloody wars and found millions dead because of it and it happened right on our door step. I know the US did get involved but I think its different when it happens so close by - especially when so many countries kinda just brushed it all off and ignored it for the longest time.</p>
<p>Restricting speech does make me uncomfortable, but I also recognise the reasons and arguments behind wanting to ensure the extremes aren't catered too and as I say, I always end up flip flopping on this issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your second statement is wrong/misleading </p>
<p>In 1969, the Supreme Court's decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio effectively overturned Schenck and any authority the case still carried. There, the Court held that inflammatory speech--and even speech advocating violence by members of the Ku Klux Klan--is protected under the First Amendment, unless the speech &quot;is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action&quot; (emphasis mine).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the laws are a bit different in different parts of Europe. Where I live (Finland) hate speech is not forbidden. You are allowed to say racist things (if for some reason you would like to), but what is forbidden is to agitate people against an ethnic minority. This can be a bit vague sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US constitution we have two sets of amendments, incorporated and non incorporated. Incorporated amendments must me enforced and administered exactly the same in each state but non incorporated ones may be different from state to state. The first amendment (right to speech religion petition and assembly) is an example of an incorporated amendment whereas the second amendment (right to bear arms) can be controlled individually by each state. A good rule of thumb though is that any federal law or constitutional amendment will be treated the same in each state.</p>
<p>We have no hate speech laws on the books in the US, A) because we hold our freedom to say what we want as a fundamental human right (no matter how deplorable) and B)because hate speech is an incredibly nebulous term and can be twisted to fit someones goals. </p>
<p>US entertainment is often graded on content. We don't limit what can be said done in movies/TV/radio we just give it a grade so if you want a pg13 rating in order to reach a younger audience you must limit what you say/do yourself. Now if you receive ANY federal aid you may need to fallow their rules and give up some of your artistic liberties.</p>
<p>Side note: there are exceptions on free speech when advocating violence or threatening someones safety ie. yelling fire in a movie theater. Also slander and defamation laws restrict you from lying about people in order to damage their reputation.</p>
<p>tl;dr: No</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting too that things like the MPAA ratings or videogame ratings are <em>not</em> compulsory; PG-13 and whatnot were devised in part to prevent government intervention. There's nothing illegal about letting a 7 year-old buy tickets to a Restricted (17+) movie, but most theaters as a matter of policy will not sell tickets to one who isn't accompanied by an adult.  Movies don't have to be rated by the MPAA either, but in practice no major theater is going to run an &quot;unrated&quot; movie. That's why you sometimes see &quot;Unrated&quot; versions of movies released on video, because they include material that was cut from the theatrical release. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the article rankings are focused on journalistic freedom. The US ranking is relatively low not because of content restrictions, but because of recent whistleblower prosecutions and the lack of protection for confidential sources.</p>
<p>It is a fair criticism of the US, but not really on point for the discussion. The content of any individual's speech in the US enjoys incredible protection.</p>
<p>Journalists are upset about ongoing US actions against whistleblowers. Frankly, the rankings are a bit absurd. Burkina Faso is ranked above the US and is considering a law banning public criticism of their president. There seem to be double standards in place in those rankings.</p></div>		</li>
