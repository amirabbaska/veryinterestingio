			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always sweated noticeably more than most others around me since I was a kid when working out, playing a sport etc., regardless of whether I'm &quot;more fit&quot; than them or not. I think some people's core temperature just runs hotter and thus they have to sweat more to keep cool.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sweat is one of your body’s primary means of preventing your core temperature from rising to dangerous levels. During exercise, the majority of the calories you burn actually generate heat instead of powering forward motion.</p>
<p>That heat has to be dissipated, so your body dilates blood vessels near the skin to carry some of that heat away from your core to areas where cooler air flowing over the skin can carry away some of the heat. Sweat makes the cooling process work even better, because as sweat evaporates off your skin it takes a lot of heat with it.</p>
<p>As you become more fit, you are able to work harder.</p>
<p>You start sweating sooner: Your body’s sweat response gets quicker as you gain fitness. This means you’ll see sweat appearing on your skin sooner after you start exercising than you did when you were a novice. These days, when you start warming up your body knows what’s coming next, so it ramps up the cooling process more quickly to stay ahead of the rise in core temperature.</p>
<p>Your sweat volume increases: When the house is on fire, you open up the spigots and get as much water on it as you can. For the fire within, we don’t want to extinguish it but we need to control it, and the more sweat you get onto your skin the more likely you are to be able to keep core temperature from rising out of control. So your body becomes better at creating sweat.</p></div>		</li>
