			<div class="markdown"><p>The impact of these changes was even more dramatic on death rates in many common diseases.  Something like 95-99% of the reduction in measles deaths from the levels seen at the beginning of the 20th Century happened prior to the introduction of vaccines.  This doesn't mean that the diseases weren't dangerous anymore though.  There were still millions of people being infected and many were left with lifelong damage as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Washing your hands more frequently prevents contracting disease in general. Cleaning shared surfaces like door handles and bathrooms prevents diseases from spreading. If a parent washes their hands after handling their sick child, then they certainly help prevent it from spreading to other children. </p></div>		</li>
