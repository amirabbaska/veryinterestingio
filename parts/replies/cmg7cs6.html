			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe so and that's when things like sweating happen.
Also should have mentioned that you can be losing too much heat and that's when you shiver for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an additional component to the explanation that plays a significant role in the perceived temperature mismatch, and it's caused by temperature differences between your core and your skin. Specifically, if core body temperature is ~37 C then (almost always) the temperature of your skin is several degrees lower. This is due to a variety of factors, but essentially it's just bc your skin isn't super metabolically active and is not particularly vascular. In either case, the reason one feels hot when ambient temperature and body temperature are the same is because the skin actually sensing the ambient temp is cooler; thus the heat from the environment flows into your skin/extremities and you perceive warmth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also when in a pool, if the water were 35ºC it <em>should</em> feel colder, but it feels pretty hot.</p>
<p>But even when it is like 13 ºC you don't feel like freezing, until you get out all wet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>28-29 degrees without clothing is a number i've heard repeated in 1st year Human Biology classes. Not sure where that came from though.</p>
<p>It would have to be lower than normal skin temperature, which is about 33-34, so it sounds about right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The set point is 98.6 degrees F or 37 degrees C. There are individuals with mutations in the proteins that sense whether you are too hot or cold that run at slightly higher or lower temperatures. However since temperature regulation is so important in life to keep everything working properly, it is very rare.</p>
<p>Edit: Took a look at your question again realized it may have been a different question than I first thought. It depends on a lot of things. Since different people have different amounts of fat, and fat acts as an insulator different people have different optimum temperatures. Naturally there are a number of other things that go into this like metabolism rates and such, but fat is a really big determiner. Also if I remember right men and women have different skin thicknesses with women having the lower thickness, which makes women tend to like warmer temperatures than men. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does water at body temp (like a isolation tank) feel like nothing then? </p>
<p>Maybe because of waters incredible heat transfer properties. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question. Strongly seconded.
People acclimate to warm water at body temperature but not air, and I don't understand why at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because air conducts heat much less efficiently therefore  needs to be much cooler than water to suck out the same excess heat.</p>
<p>Another thing: swim in a 95 degree water for 1 hour and you'll end up dehydrated. This because your body can't get rid of excess heat and makes you sweat like a pig. You can't realise it because you are wet already.</p>
<p>A fried of mine got severe dehydration in Death Valley that way. He spent the afternoon  in the lodge pool then collapsed at his first evening beer. Rangers came and stuffed him beer and salty stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disappointed with all the bad answers in this post. Yours is the most right, but I just wanted to connect some more dots:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your body maintains a thermal equilibrium because a lot of its machinery (proteins, diffusion of small molecules etc.) does not work well outside that thermal range</li>
<li>Metabolism in general is exothermic (produces heat)</li>
<li>Therefore, your body must shed excess heat to maintain the equilibrium (or heat itself up if it's shedding too much heat, e.g. when ambient temperature is low)</li>
<li>Your body can shed heat by radiation or evaporation (convection and conduction are generally negligible). Radiation only works if the surroundings are colder than the body. Evaporation works even if the surroundings are hotter, but requires extra work by the body.</li>
<li>So the point where your body feels &quot;just right&quot; is the point where it has equilibrated the heat loss: it's not working too hard to shed the heat nor to produce extra heat to warm itself up.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 ways you transfer heat:</p>
<p>Radiation</p>
<p>Evaporation</p>
<p>Conduction</p>
<p>This last one has a big influence when you come into contact with solids or liquids.</p></div>		</li>
