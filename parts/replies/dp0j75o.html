			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true. The fungi didn't &quot;eat radiation&quot; or grow faster when irradiated. The experiment was misinterpreted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Radiosynthesis' had been described as the capture and metabolic use of energy from ionizing radiation. Past literature (Dadachova, E., Bryan, R. A., Huang, X., Moadel, T., Schweitzer, A. D., Aisen, P., Nosanchuk, J. D., Casadevall, A. (2007). PloS one, 2(5): e457, and papers and patent following) has purportedly demonstrated this in fungi, wherein increased fungal growth was seen upon treatment with low-dose ionising radiation. Melanin was proposed as the agent of energy capture and transduction. </p>
<p>Examination of the previous work reveals a number of issues that call into question both radiosynthesis and a mechanism involving melanin. **Notably, the energy deposited in their irradiated systems was too low to show the amount of growth seen, and the carbon
sources provided in the media were sufficient to support the observed growth and proliferation. Further, the results often fail to show what they are claimed to show, or are misinterpreted. </p>
<p><em>Finally, indirect evidence provided does not support either radiosynthesis
or that the mechanism for the observed growth requires melanin. This thesis re-evaluates
past work, and concludes that radiosynthesis has not been demonstrated.</em></p>
<p>This thesis also proposes an alternate hypothesis: misinterpretation of the effects of radiation as though from a different stimulus, resulting in an expressional shift appropriate for that stimulus or a more generalized response. Finally, this thesis proposes that a micro-scale stochastic view may be useful for future research in examining the responses of fungi and single-celled organisms in low-dose ionizing radiation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a link to the thesis? I admit that the 2007 paper has very questionable mechanisms, but <em>Comparative Responses of Microscopic Fungi
to Ionizing Radiation and Light</em> (Karpenko, 2006) does show preferred growth towards sources of ionising radiation (which may be just heat, but would still be interesting)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the fungus is super good at actually absorbing the radiation it doesn't really matter. It is however very interesting and could lead to something that is super good at absorbing radiation. But even so it would just replace were lead is used already I don't think it would be a way to make the radioactive decays any quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me in an environment like that, the radiation must be a huge selective pressure. The fungus doesn't need to be efficient at absorbing it, just &quot;not dying from radiation&quot; - that environment is pretty much inhospitable to all other life, so it's not like they're competing for resources with some other species; Additionally the radiation is abundant and pervasive, so if the fungus is making use of it at any level, there might simply be enough supply to beat out any inefficiency </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right - but due to the radiation, there also isn't much left laying around for the fungus to eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, the most important question is how it is capable of surviving in that environment. It would be super interesting to study DNA repair mechanisms of that specific fungi, or any other processes associated with the protection and proliferation of genetic material. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand what radiation is exactly. I thought this fungus was taking the heavy radioactive metals and converting them into something safer? If this fungus isn't doing that, then what is it doing exactly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, there's radioactive materials. Radioactive materials are atoms which are unstable, and which will fall apart (=decay) after a certain time period.</p>
<p>Usually, when these atoms fall apart they release alpha, beta and/or gamma radiation. Alpha and beta radiation are particles, while gamma radiation is a form of light.</p>
<p>The fungus in question absorbs gamma radiation through melanin (same stuff that allows humans to tan) and uses that to provide it extra energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Feeding off of the energy/particles being released. Radioactive materials emit particles through radioactive decay. You can also get radiation through other processes such as nuclear fission inside of a reactor.</p>
