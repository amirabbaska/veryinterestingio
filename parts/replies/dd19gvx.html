			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha thanks, I just read the book a few weeks ago and have been waiting to deploy some of my newfound octopus knowledge. It was really a fascinating read and quite a touching story. I'd recommend it to anyone who is the least bit interested in marine biology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Byrne performed a number of brain-behavior experiments on octopus. She found lateral brain dominance, but was 50:50 in captive animals. A task taught to one side could be transferred to the other side but it took about a day to copy the memory over. Cut the connectives, no transfer. Pulpi have brains, not just ganglia. Smart as devils. A colleague up in Stony Brook lost a tankful of experimental mussels in his lab to a pet octopus who lived in a tank on the same table. Overnight, the devil fish, managed to slide open his cage, creep across the table, enter the mussel tank, and ate every damn one. Crawled back home, got back under his rock, and digested his harvest of seafood. Left a wet trail and didn't close up the top.</p></div>		</li>
