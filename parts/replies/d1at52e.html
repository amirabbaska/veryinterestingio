			<div class="markdown"><p>Buoyancy - if something is floating on water, it is displacing its mass of water, not just what is under water. </p>
<p>You can test this yourself with a measuring cup. Put water in, then put ice in and mark the level of the water. Wait for the ice to melt and look again. </p>
<p>There is a SLIGHT difference, but &quot;all the world's floating ice melting&quot; wouldn't make a huge difference considering the size of the oceans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may not make a huge difference to the oceans as a whole, but a few meters change in the depth of the oceans would definitely affect us.  &quot;Not much&quot; in the grand scheme of things can have severe consequences when you zoom in on where the change is happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not disagreeing with your general concept, but isn't Antarctica largely ocean ice as well? I was under that impression that while there is a decent chunk of landmass there, the vast majority of &quot;land&quot; in Antarctica was frozen water.</p>
<p>This is the image I'm going based off of:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By &quot;volume,&quot; maybe (at the South Pole, there is something like 4000 ft. of ice over the land,) and during local Winter, the ice cap does extend due to freezing ocean; but the &quot;permanent ice&quot; (the stuff that doesn't melt every year,) is mostly over land.  There are some parts of ocean around Antarctica that stay frozen near-permantly, but those are dwarfed by the landmass-ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try this map.  NASA has been doing a lot of studies in recent years on this very subject.</p>
