			<p>Ah, thank you. I thought it was one of those things where you had to be a meteorologist in order to be considered.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is something that's changed a lot over the past few decades. It used to be all about the Perky Weather Girl. Nowadays it's more about being actually knowledgeable. Probably goes hand-in-hand with the huge advancements in meteorology - when I was a kid, the running joke was that being a weather forecaster was the only job you could just go in and lie (because politician doesn't count). They were 50/50 at best, and much worse long-term (as in, a couple of weeks). <br><br>Nowadays they're usually spot-on, especially for the next few days, and not terrible a few weeks out. For a field with so many unaccountable variables, that's pretty good. <br><br>But, again, it's not required - as /u/Dodgeballrocks points out there are still Al Rokers out there. </p>		</li>

			<p>How many decades? Dick Albert was the weatherman for many, many years at WBZ in Boston, and even now after his TV days he's a consultant on weather issues, since he's a proper meteorologist. If you're hiring a perky weather girl (who is not a meteorologist) it's because you're not serious about news, just serious about ratings.</p>		</li>

			<p>If I remember correctly, weather predictions are usually pretty good (I usually get mine from the national meteorological office and they're really good) up to 5 days away, then it just becomes far too unpredictable and is mostly an educated guess. Long term trends are easy enough to predict (For example, &quot;this will be a wet spring this year&quot;) but saying &quot;the weather will be rainy on this day next week&quot; is likely to change as we get closer to the actual day.</p>		</li>

			<p>In the US we have the National Weather Service from the federal government.  For almost all news sources, if they just read the NWS forecast, they'd do as well or better than whatever other source they use.<br><br>Of course all of us could just go to weather.gov and get the forecast ourselves and use that TV time for... more sports?  More reports about men in Florida?</p>		</li>

			<p>quality local meteorologists can take the forecasts from the national services and improve the accuracy by a few degrees or get a little more accurate on precipitation forecasts. There are certain trends in local terrain that tend to create weather patterns that can cause deviations from what the national forecasts say. Other than that, you can probably just look at whatever the feds say.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's interesting, some TV stations intentionally make their rain forecasts less accurate than NWS by overstating the chance of rain.   This is because their viewers are the most unhappy when they say it's unlikely to rain, but it still rains.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yep, anyone who gives you a specific weather forecast further out than about 7 days is basically making things up (or running models out beyond the period for which they are known to have any skill, and just reporting the results anyway). Longer term it is possible to say things like &quot;November is likely to be wetter than average&quot; with some skill, but not to pin it down to specific rainy days.</p>		</li>

			<p>It depends very much on the region too.  Somewhere like the Pacific Northwest, you can get super-accurate data down to the exact square mile of where it's gonna rain during the day, and it will be very accurate.<br><br>In other parts of the US, though, it's not &quot;it's gonna rain exactly here&quot;, rather it's &quot;This region has a so-and-so percent chance of rain/snow.&quot;  So it varies depending on the region and the specifics of the weather in that region.</p>		</li>

			<p>That may well be an &quot;Only In Britain&quot; thing (; <br><br>Or a Market thing, really. When I grew up (and where I grew up) we only had one channel. So no competition. As soon as it opened up, Perky Weather Girls started showing up.<br><br>The funny thing is the one who took off was actually Handsome Weather Guy. </p>		</li>

			<p>The other one that you might consider is the emergency weather man. In tornado alley, people have a go to weather guy that they prefer over the other 5 weather guys, all of which are celebrities. That's not because they're attractive, it's because they're knowledgeable and might save your life one day. </p>		</li>

			<p>There are two degrees you can get in meteorology, a bachelor of arts or a bachelor of science. One teaches you how to read the news, but for weather. These people get jobs at news stations. The other teaches you how to predict the weather, these people get jobs at say a power company.</p>		</li>
