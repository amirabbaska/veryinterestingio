			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something that's changed a lot over the past few decades. It used to be all about the Perky Weather Girl. Nowadays it's more about being actually knowledgeable. Probably goes hand-in-hand with the huge advancements in meteorology - when I was a kid, the running joke was that being a weather forecaster was the only job you could just go in and lie (because politician doesn't count). They were 50/50 at best, and much worse long-term (as in, a couple of weeks). </p>
<p>Nowadays they're usually spot-on, especially for the next few days, and not terrible a few weeks out. For a field with so many unaccountable variables, that's pretty good. </p>
<p>But, again, it's not required - as /u/Dodgeballrocks points out there are still Al Rokers out there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, weather predictions are usually pretty good (I usually get mine from the national meteorological office and they're really good) up to 5 days away, then it just becomes far too unpredictable and is mostly an educated guess. Long term trends are easy enough to predict (For example, &quot;this will be a wet spring this year&quot;) but saying &quot;the weather will be rainy on this day next week&quot; is likely to change as we get closer to the actual day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weather predictions are for local areas.  They're pretty shitty in my area and always have been.  It's not that meteorologists aren't getting better.  It's that the weather in my area of extremely unpredictable.  Forecasts often change 3-5 times a day for <em>that day</em>.  10 day forecasts are useless.</p>
<p>Weather forecasts are only more accurate in areas with highly predictable weather.  And that only happened because of a greater accumulation of historical data upon which to base predictions.</p>
<p>We are still unable to reliably predict local weather in unpredictable areas because of the insane amount of factors that govern weather, only some of which we understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what it means to be the weatherman/woman. A lot of them do their own research and info gathering and prepare their own weather reports. But some of them get that info from someone else. Those people aren't really &quot;weathermen/women&quot;, but &quot;weather presenters&quot;, but the terms are loosely interchanged. </p>
<p>So you can be a meteorologist and be in front of the camera, or not in front of the camera and have someone else do it. I imagine there's plenty of news stations/outlets wher ethe weather report is just probably taken from wunderground.com or weather.com or some place like that.</p>
<p>A related case in point, the traffic reporter for the Fox station in Seattle doesn't actually do any traffic analysis -- they just read from the state department of transportation website.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, the basics of weather isn't rocket science. You've got temperature, humidity, low and high pressure systems, and some basic climate-based variables. You could study enough of it to be competent in a morning. </p>
<p>A degree in meteorology is definitely more complex, but that's a whole 'nother kettle of fish. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of it has to do with where you are.  If you are in SoCal, then the weather is pretty much the same, day to day.  You can get away with hiring perky eye candy to read the NWS report and point at a few maps.   </p>
<p>If you're in Minnesota, where the weather can literally kill you, and people are really depending on as much accuracy and detail as possible, then maybe you want an actual meteorologist, with their own tools and computers, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a resident of tornado alley (or alley adjacent) our weathermen better damn well be qualified to write their own script. Sometimes, the storm will be so severe, that the local station will usurp programming and commercials in order to broadcast weather nonstop. These are the times where shit's happening at a breakneck pace, and there's no time to fuck with a script. If it's severe enough, the guy literally says &quot;This storm is very dangerous, and has a history of causing damage. Area X, Y, and Z should go to their shelters now. If you still need information, turn up your TV so you can hear it from your shelter.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Before I graduated high school, two major tornadoes had done some pretty serious damage downtown and destroyed part of a local university. Then you have the yearly almost tornadoes that don't do too much damage, comparatively. If the person on screen during those storms doesn't know what's going on, people die. </p>
<p>It's weird living in a different part of the state now, where we don't really get tornadoes. People just like. Don't know what to do when there are big storms. &quot;Oh, you can see a funnel cloud from your dorm window? Better stand there and watch it, because you never know when you'll get to see one again.&quot; Jesus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in Southern California, I think the head weathermen for most of the TV stations has a meteorological degree. Some of the other weathermen have certificates from some meteorological organization. And then there's the plethora of pixie weathergirls who do the morning, noon, and late night news weather reports.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Today's knowledge nugget: Sometimes when you're watching a modern movie and an actor playing a &quot;local reporter&quot; comes on screen, they are often in fact real newscasters from Los Angeles. I've especially seen this in disaster movies.</p></div>		</li>
