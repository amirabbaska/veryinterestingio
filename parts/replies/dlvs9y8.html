			<div class="markdown"><p>I call BS on this until I see proof. There isn't a cognitively healthy person on the planet who lacks the ability to understand that things change. Unless these tribes-people can - for example - build something, come back and not remember they themselves built it, they <em>do</em> have a concept of the past. In fact if they remember anything at all, they have a concept of the past.</p>
<p>If they understand that they used to be smaller, and have grown, they have a concept of the past. If they understand that they used to have no children, and now they do, they have a concept of the past. </p>
<p>And if they think they would like to have another child, or build something new, or if they ever bring a fish back to the village to cook it, or if they ever make things for other tribespeople as a gift, or if they have a religion, then they have a concept of the future too.</p>
<p>What they only lack is a robust lexicon with which to describe these things - and even there I'm skeptical. I'd bet money their language has some sort of past tense and a future tense. How can humans communicate without a phrase like &quot;I will&quot;? </p>
<p>A person living like this would be so utterly solipsistic that they would basically not be conscious, much less sentient. The understanding that change can happen is fundamental to human intelligence, and inheres within it the concept of time. Past, present, and future. </p>
<p>All aside, IIRC the hypothesis that human cognition is strongly constrained by lexical factors has been considered discredited for many years. Lexicon only influences thought, but does not alter our fundamental understanding of the natural world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good counter point,  really made me think. My initial thought to the initial statement was that they have an idea of future and past, they don't deem it important. Sorta the purpose of meditation. But it's one thing not to acknowledge future and past and another to completely miss the concept of an inherent human idea</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to point out that neither I nor the article ever said that the tribesmen don't have a concept of time. I was merely pointing out that they have a different perception of time, because they don't have words for time in the language. You overstated my position, then proceeded to argue at a straw man.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is exactly what you claimed, though. </p>
<p>First:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>anything meaningful in our cognition will be encoded in our language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have discovered tribes of people deep within the rain forest that don't have words for past, present, future or even time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If 1) everything in our cognition is encoded in lanaguage and 2) they have no word for time, they must not have time in their cognition. This means they do not understand the concept of time.</p>
<p>By the way, all your replies with that BBC article are not appearing in the thread, but I did check it out. It doesn't support your claims. It says the tribe does not map time to the idea of physical movement the way most cultures do. Not that they lack words for past, present, or future. They <em>must</em> have those concepts in language because they can describe events in chronological order. You've made a huge leap. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes this was entirely a lexicon issue.  They simply don't categorize time into micro moments like we do they have an experience.  Of course they remember when they didn't have a boat and know that their next meal comes later after the work is done... but maybe they just think of it all as a whole experience.  </p>
<p>It is important to note though that the lexicon we have may inform our  reality as well as reality informing the lexicon we create.  For the tribe that doesn't have a word for the color blue but has 12 words for different shades of green, they can easily identify subtle green changes we'd miss and miss the changes to blue that we'd quickly see.   How prevalent something is in culture influences how large or amplified or more different from the background information your consciousness will &quot;display&quot; it for you because of CONTEXT it expects.</p>
<p>Much like why the MOON is actually never huge and small... the information about how big the moon is is always exactly the same BUT your consciousness DRAWS IT BIGGER when it is near the horizon.  It isn't actually bigger at all.  And it is NOT magnified magically by the atmosphere (people think that air is a magnifying glass?) or gravatational lensing (yeah... people say that)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to do a Ctrl+F for 'culture' to find this answer. In addition to the top comment, culture and language strongly affect the experience, meaning, and structure of time. </p>
<p>While I would disagree with some of their approaches or generalizations, here are a couple links that nonetheless introduce the concept that time and culture are very much intertwined:</p>
