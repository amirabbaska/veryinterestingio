			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to sleepwalk when I was a kid, but recently me and my wife are sleepwalking. One time my wife was sleepwalking to the kitchen, she made coffee at 3 am and came back to the bedroom, I woke up and found her standing with a cup of coffee in her hand and starring at me. That was scary as shit man!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, this can malfunction in the opposite direction and cause something called Cataplexy, where someone loses muscle tone temporarily, typically in response to sudden, strong emotion like laughter, anger or fear. It usually only occurs in conjunction with Narcolepsy and is thought to be related to REM sleep interfering into the waking state.</p>
<p>Sleep paralysis can also be related, along with hypnagogic hallucinations, caused by being sort of stuck between awake and asleep.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, can that be the reason I can dream while I'm awake? I've been on antidepressants for a while now and ever since I tried a certain one, sometimes I'll wake up while in the middle of a dream, and can just close my eyes and continue the dream. While conscious. Open my eyes, dream stops, close, it resumes. Very, very weird. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Like free drugs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid I usually woke up turned by exactly 180 degrees. So I always ended up not knowing where I was because everything got turned around.</p>
<p>Anyone know why seemingly people tend to sleepwalk more as kids?</p></div>		</li>
