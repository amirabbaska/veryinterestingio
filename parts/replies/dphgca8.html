			<div class="markdown"><p>This comments part about additional recording and blending of new recordings is probably the most correct one that addresses the OP's particular question. </p>
<p>Audio enhancement of particular tracks for a promotional campaign of a certain film is something that is being sourced out to professional media composers or trailer score houses that provide bespoke arrangements specifically for the use in the trailer. </p>
<p>The brief might say something like the lines &quot;We love the feeling of Sinatra's 'My Way' for this but we would like for it to essentially be beefier, bigger, more modern, etc.&quot; and it's then a technical problem solving headache for that specific composer. The company who is being hired to do the promo campaign will find the original recording and stems for the composer to utilize in their process to whatever degree they find necessary. </p>
<p>A more clear example of this is the use of Fleetwood Mac in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 trailer - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duGqrYw4usE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duGqrYw4usE</a></p>
<p>Fleetwood Mac's 'The Chain' this particular trailer has been 'encanced' by Hi-Finesse (<a href="http://hi-finesse.com" target="_blank">http://hi-finesse.com</a>) a production company who's specific focus is to write arrangements or original music for trailers exclusively. They provided similair work for Thor Ragnarok production campaign with their arrangement of Led Zepplin's 'The Immigrant Song'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone interested in the transition from time to frequency space should look up for Fourier transform and Fourier analysis as a subject. It's some fairly high level math, but it's super interesting to read about with some pretty amazing applications (including medical imaging, which blew my mind a little) </p></div>		</li>
