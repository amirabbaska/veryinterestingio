<p>Also, excellent ear, are you a musician?</p>

<p>I discovered this phenomenon by turning a tuner pedal on before plugging in my guitar. Always read A#. We had a sound guy over another day and he was complaining about a note my bass player kept hitting; it was rattling the speakers. He said its a Bb. I had also just done a ton of research before buying a gaming monitor and once confused operating frequency for frame rate. So when he said &quot;Bb,&quot; I sort of twitched and put all this information together all of a sudden and blurted &quot;I bet that's about 60Hz.&quot; Sound guy pulled out a device and said &quot;why do you know that?&quot; I could've saved a lot of time had I just had perfect pitch like OP. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being able to tell a note with no context requires a great talent for it, or a lot of time spent playing. Perfect pitch is exceedingly rare, where one can tell apart every note in a symphony. But the former, more common skill, is often called perfect pitch because people like to use the more impressive term. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The next B is at 123.47Hz, so really you're hearing something that is very much in the middle of B and B-flat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In music theory, a note is flat when it is slightly lower in pitch than the closest natural. So even though B♭ is 116.54 Hz in equal-tempered tuning, 120 Hz is still B♭ because the closest natural is B^† , at 123.47 Hz.</p>
<hr />
<p>†In a key where B is one of the notes, like C-major. In other keys and tunings, it may even be written in sheet music as B♯ (e.g. in B♭-minor key with equal-tempered tuning) or A♯ (e.g. in F♯-major key with equal-tempered tuning).</p></div>		</li>
