<p>Jokes do a bunch of things that set off alarm bells. </p>
<p>They’re surprising, and any kind of surprise is going to be cause for concern when the wrong kind of surprise can kill you. So when it’s a non-threatening surprise, out comes the false alarm.</p>
<p>Comedians frequently violate taboos. Discuss uncomfortable or socially unacceptable content and use profanity. It’s content that has the potential to upset or anger some people, which is potentially dangerous both socially and sometimes physically. So out comes the false alarm alert to let everyone no that these violations of social norms didn’t upset you and it’s safe. This is the reason court jesters we’re able to say things to rulers that other people couldn’t: They were intentionally made up and positioned to be non-threatening and unserious so that whatever they said didn’t need to be considered as a threat to the person’s rule.</p>
<p>Slapstick involves situations where someone could get seriously injured but is clearly fine or minimally hurt. So out comes the false alarm. Someone gets hit in the face with a giant hammer, rolls their eyes back, spins around and falls over before getting back up without s scratch? Funny. Someone gets hit in the face with a giant hammer and their skull caves in? Not so funny. For the more sadistic people who laugh at others getting seriously hurt, the “false alarm” isn’t about a lack of serious injury, but about the fact that the person who was injured is perceived as “not important” and therefore no reason to get upset about their injury.</p></div>		</li>
