			<div class="markdown"><p>The worst part is they often get money from the government  or subsidies to expand and simply don't. That's why when you saw google fiber or if lucky enough local ISP's starting to offer 1gb/s download speeds all of a sudden most of the bigger ISP's in the area increased their base speed and offered more speed options. Then on top of all of that bigger ISP's will spend millions to lobby for essentially a monopoly on an area. </p></div>		</li>

So they use that money basically for maintenance, and whatever they would have used for maintenance they pocket as profit, there's no requirement of expansion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have worked in the field. It is money. They want to maximize their shareholder's value. You as the customer are just a fuckwit to them that they scheme to make money. The more bullshit you deal with the better. The more they limit your options the better. </p>
<p>Don't feel bad though. This is the corporate model for everything. </p></div>		</li>
