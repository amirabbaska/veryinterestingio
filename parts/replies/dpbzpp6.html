			<div class="markdown"><p>Underwater earthquakes that deform the sea floor (or cause surface displacements through things like landslides) displace water and cause a <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/tsunami/info/faq.shtml" target="_blank">tsunami</a> so yes, they definitely can 'move water around enough to damage something'. Earthquakes (more specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-wave" target="_blank">p-waves</a> associated with an earthquake) can effect air in terms of making a sound (ground vibrates, creates compressional waves in air near the surface that can be audible) but these waves do not disturb the atmosphere enough to make any difference at the altitude of an airplane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The range of altitudes where you could safely fly given the swells typically present in the ocean, but be subject to any effects of a tsunami is so small as to be virtually nonexistent. </p>
<p>The arbitrary altitude you mentioned of 37 feet light be doable in unusually calm seas, but here is information on the average sea state of the pacific ocean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average wave height will be 11 ft (3 m). The significant wave height will be 17 ft (5 m). 10% of all waves will be higher than 18 ft (5 m). The average wave height of the highest 10% of all waves will be 22 ft (7 m).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, normal sea conditions already cut things dangerously close.</p>
<p>It is theoretically possible that an aircraft doing search and rescue or other low altitude operators, right over the location of the undersea earthquake, could be affected. But it's statistically unrealistic. </p></div>		</li>
