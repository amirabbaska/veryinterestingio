All living things are products of nature and nurture, of DNA and the environment that they live in, including the embryonic environment they develop in, the maternal care they receive and the food they eat. What's really exciting, is that scientists now realize that things like the conditions you experience in the womb, the cuddles you receive as a child and the food that you eat have the potential to alter, not the structure of DNA, but the way certain genes are turned on or off. What this means for de-extinction is that we can never create a de-extinct animal that is identical to the original. It may have (almost) the same DNA, but the way that DNA works is likely to be subtly different. This may be a pedantic point. De-extinction scientists argue that if the de-extinct animal looks and acts like the original, then where's the problem?
One thing to consider is that, for some animals, we'll be relying on the biology and good will of living animals to help them develop and teach them how to behave. If scientists manage to de-extinct the woolly mammoth for example, they'll have to use an elephant as surrogate mum, but elephants are hugely social animals. They live in large, extended families and youngsters learn key skills from their older relatives. But could an elephant teach a mammoth how to survive in the Arctic? We simply don't know the extent to which these key life skills are innate or learned. It's something to think about. </p></div>		</li>
