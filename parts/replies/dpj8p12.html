			<div class="markdown"><p>What he is referring to would actually be 2/2 or &quot;cut time&quot;  where each written note would get half of the marked value. Regardless of whether the conductor actually individually enunciates each beat in a measure, the time signature of the music is unchanged.  So 4/4 means there are 4 beats per measure (this is X) and the quarter note gets the beat (this is Y).  In something like 6/8 there are 6 beats beats per measure ant the eighth note gets the beat.  Similarly 2/4 means that there are two beats per measure and the quarter note gets the beat.  Just because there are 4 quarter notes in a measure, that doesn't mean that every measure consists of 4 notes.  A 4/4 measure can consist of any combination of rhythms you want as long as the total adds up to 4 quarter notes.  An example would be a 4/4 measure can have 8 eight notes, or 16 sixteenth notes.  So a combination of all those parts could be 4 sixteenth notes, followed by 2 eighth notes followed by 2 quarter notes:  4/16 + 2/8 + 2/4 = 1 or one measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take 6/8 time for instance. There are six beats in the measure. But what if the tempo is realllly fast?! A conductor will get tired after the first 30secs of conducting. Measures have accents however...Or tact. You can count it 1-2-3-4-5-6...or you could count it as <em>1</em>-2-3 <em>4</em>-5-6. The italicized numbers are arm flails (lol) now the conductor only waves their arms twice per measure instead of 6 times.</p></div>		</li>
