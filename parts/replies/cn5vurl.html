			<div class="markdown"><p>Well i guess there IS someone able to actually answer his question. Most of the time it seems like people just spew what ever information they have that is even remotely close to the question and ignore the fact they are supposed to answer it in an attempt to show case their partial knowledge. How ever in your case i do believe you have given the perfect answer. I wish every one knew how to answer a question.</p></div>		</li>
