			<div class="markdown"><p>That is incorrect. The top and bottom belts are rotating at the same speed as the cube. The flat sides of the belt remain parallel with the same edge of the cube with each rotation.</p>
<p>The different colours on each side and the individual rotation of each belt may have confused you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each belt has a period of two cube rotations, I think that is what he is talking about. The belts connected to the sides go above the cube on one rotation then below the cube on the next, and the top and bottom belts are having the parts on the sides of the cube complete half an orbit per full rotation of the cube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that makes sense. Because the end of each belt off the edge of the image does not rotate but the belt itself rotates 180 degrees away from the rotation of the cube, it takes two full rotations of the cube for the part of the belt that loops around the cube to go round it.</p>
<p>It certainly is a bit of a mind bender when you actually take the time to study the movements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The twisting of the top and bottom belts allows them to turn retrograde to the rotation of the cube, slowing to what appears to be half the rotation speed. If you focus on the connected portions, they do spin at the right speed. </p></div>		</li>
