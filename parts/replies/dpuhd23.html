			<div class="markdown"><p>Stretching for sport and exercise improves flexibility, which increases the ability of a joint to move through its full range of motion; in other words, how far it can bend, twist and reach. Some activities, such as gymnastics, require more flexibility than others, such as running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I can't do proper squats or deadlift without proper stretching. I spend 10 minutes stretching everything before any heavy workouts. and I do feel different if I don't stretch. The range of motion improves a lot when you stretch, which means lower risk of injury because the form would be better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might try this. Sometimes on my day between gym days (I go every other day when I'm being organized) I will get the urge to stretch a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see &quot;stretching creates micro tears&quot; quite often. How do people know? Have there been studies on animals or humans where they take an image of muscle before and after stretching? If so, I would love a link.</p></div>		</li>
