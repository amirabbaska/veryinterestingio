			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, they can only replicate so fast, so if you gain weight (fat cells, which grow more quickly) faster than your skin can keep up, you’ll get stretch marks, which are permanent weakenings in the connective tissue layer below the thin outer skin layer. </p>
<p>Edit: I’d like to clarify that stretch marks are a normal process that almost everyone goes through, whether during puberty or muscle growth or even losing weight. Your cells do not all replicate at the same rate, so there is bound to be some mismatch between tissue types. Everyone’s got stretch marks, don’t worry about yours!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pregnancy visualized to me how much less stretchy/responsive scar tissue is. I didn't get any stretch marks until the very end when the skin around my appendectomy scar could not keep up. Suddenly I got a starburst of stretch marks around it almost overnight. It was pretty comical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, this is a result of increased cortisol levels in the blood during pregnancy. Cortisol inhibits fibroblasts and chondroblasts in the body and therefore the skin that is stretched is unable to get repaired in a proper way leading to the stretch marks seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. 30 something male here. I have stretch marks on my stomach from high school. I was an awkward youth and spent a lot of time indoors doing....well, nothing really. I weighed almost 300lbs when I graduated. Joined the Army right out of school, lost almost 115lbs. Got new stretch marks on my thighs, calves, and biceps from muscle gain. Then I deployed. Wearing my vest more or less 24/7 made my upper back, neck, and chest develop, so now I've got an odd configuration of stretch marks on the tops of my shoulders. They only bothered me when I was that awkward teenager. Now I just tell people they're my battle scars when I get asked about em. They tell a story about me, just like every other line, wrinkle, and scar on me and even though I'm depressed and deal with a lot of heavy stuff regularly, I'm proud of my body and the story it tells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you tell us more about what it was like when you first got to boot camp and began your weight loss?  Like were runs extra painful or did you ever have to stop mid-training because you couldn't squeeze out any more energy?  Were you allowed to eat as much as you wanted or did the Army force you on a particular diet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well depending on the extent of growth, your tissue can return to normal (i.e you look skinny without excess skin tissue). There are many factors that play into whether your tissue returns to shape after losing weight like age, overall health, speed of weight gain/loss, outstanding medical issues, etc. </p>
<p>Generally, as your body burns more calories than it takes it, it uses your fat reserves for energy. If you can keep that up, your body &quot;burns&quot; fat and you get thinner. Most of the time the other body systems work in concert and you reduce the amount of skin, connective tissue, fat cells at the same time.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems real to me. But regardless is a good illustration of how the skin and underlying tissue can lose elasticity. Especially after prolonged periods of &quot;stretch.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
