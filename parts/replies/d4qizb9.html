<p>The atmosphere itself is thick enough to block practically all high energy particle radiation. Ozone is opaque to UV-b and UV-c, which is electromagnetic radiation and it would penetrate the atmosphere more readily if the Ozone layer were to vanish.  </p>
<p>It wouldn't end all life if it were to vanish, but it would definitely have an impact. Life did evolve and flourish way before there were any Ozone to even speak of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two are related. Climate change is affected by so many variables that it is difficult to explain the science. That's why so many people are 'deniers' (I hate that term - it implies ignorance). The fact is that climate is affected by plate tectonics, the sun's state, our planet's orbital status, the moon, geothermal activity and hundreds of other variables. It's why the whole 'Carbon' thing never gets off the ground - it's just one of many variants which need to be addressed. Unfortunately lots of non-sciencey people latch on to it because it's an easy subject - carbon=bad.</p></div>		</li>
