<p>I mean, it's still one of the best on the planet and is perfectly acceptable by almost any metric. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Some people say it's the media. Some say it's for legal reasons. Some say it's the normal people. But there is not one thing you can blame. It's all of society that allows this. </p>
<p>Simply put: Politicians do it because they can get away with it. Even if it's just a mistake it doesn't matter as long they don't strive to be better and if no one pushes them to do so then they won't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why, to me, the question made no sense to begin with. In the vast majority of contexts it's not illegal or even considered reprehensible to lie.  So what is there to &quot;get away&quot; with? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree it's not illegal but I would argue in most contexts in which politicians speak, it is reprehensible to lie.  </p>
<p>Regardless, it's how WE respond when they lie because with the exception of the new and naive to politics, we all know they'll do it given the chance.  </p></div>		</li>
