			<div class="markdown"><p>More misleading than straight lie. At the rate of diffusion, the parts per million the would be left from miles away from the source is high enough for a shark to sense it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So rather its saying they can sense very small amounts of blood which gives the illusion that they can smell blood from miles away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes a long time to spread that much through diffusion even, it'd have to be in the right direction of the stream to smell at long distance probably. Dogs can't smell at much distance either if the wind blows in the wrong direction, they have to be just at the trail to be able to follow it.</p>
<p>A carcass that has been lying in the water for a couple of hours though, it can probably sniff up from some distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. How far away can you smell a hot apple pie from? The answer is the maximum distance that a detectable number of particles from that pie can travel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way. </p>
<p>You can see stars millions of miles away but the reflected light still has to travel from the stars to you. It still takes time for that light to reach you but you can very well point to the source. When said star dies and no longer gives light it will take time for you to notice the dead star depending on the distance between you and star. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question to this, based on the answers that the sharks are actually sensing the molecules of blood that have spread from the source, at really low concentrations. Does anyone want to do the math and have a stab at what distance is the concentration sufficient for them to sense, let's say 1 litre of blood?</p>
<p>e.g. So if they can sense blood at 5ppm(?), and if I am injured in the ocean and have leaked let's say 1 litre of blood, what distance from the source can you reach before concentrations drop below their limit for sensing? This is more a question of mixing, rather than sharks.</p>
<p>I appreciate time would be a factor, but I'm not as worried about this. I also appreciate mixing is going to be strongly anisotropic based on currents, etc. But in theory could start with isotropic mixing over a half sphere (cos I'm at the surface) - I'd imagine the concentrations would drop very low over quite a short distance(?), to some thing like the blood would be channeled effectively by the mixing forces, so that the sufficient concentrations would actually be detectable over a narrow 'band', but for a considerable distance from the source.</p></div>		</li>
