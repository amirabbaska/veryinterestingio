			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, one more bullet- every hospital has a department called Infection Prevention. It is our job to stop the spread of infections. That is what we do 24/7, and we are on call 24/7.  we put all those measure in place, monitor they are being followed and monitor hospital acquired conditions to make sure there are no trends that need to be stopped. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something related.
A few months ago in Uganda 3 people died of Marburg virus (100% of those infected). It's similar to ebola I believe.</p>
<p>Anyways, the remarkable part of the story is that the victims were in a rural area and that the second victim had lab testing done to find cause of death. They found Marburg and a WHO team was deployed within 24h to the area where they traced back all the contacts and isolated them. In the end only three people were infected.</p>
<p>Uganda has made a lot of progress in recent years, but it's still a low-development country, bottom 30 or so for HDI. The fact that people dying in rural Ugandan villages get laboratory testing, and that this testing nipped a very deadly virus in the bud and therefore almost nobody knows about it... it's just incredible. The world we live in today.</p>
<p>People say the UN is a failed organization. some parts yes, but by the gods, the health side of the UN (WHO) has done incredible things</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who say the UNis a failed organization either are or are parroting someone with an agenda counter to the common good. It's not a failure when it's an ongoing process. It's not a world government. It's a place where even the most bitter of enemies can talk and take action on common cause. It's an astounding success. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Infection Prevention Department in the hospital I work at had our toilet brushes removed because according to them it spread bacterias from bowls to bowls. We were told to clean with our hands while the toilet is flushing. Toilets here flush very violently, could almost be used as bidets. No one wants to clean it that way so toilets aren't cleaned thoroughly. </p></div>		</li>
