			<div class="markdown"><p>Others have touched on this, but let me assert this theory more directly:</p>
<p>Humans actually benefit from longer child rearing times. Even if we were able to birth equally biologically complex offspring without the long period of cognitive development, the benefits of complex socialization outweigh the immediate survival of an individual. By virtue of these longer &quot;second-gestation&quot; periods, humans have reaped the benefits of building a crazy complex, non-innate generational knowledge transfer. </p>
<p>Language and social structure may exist due to offset survivorship bias, but these have enabled the more 'human' concepts like tradition and culture. In doing so, our lineage of primates found a 'hack' in the traditional evolutionary scale, vastly outpacing our biological adaptation with more versatile things like complex problem solving and tool making.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Being squishy helped us reroute to non-biological environmental adaptation, starting an evolutionary feedback loop. More plastic brains meant more social structure was needed. More social structure meant more plastic brains were needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Re-reading my phrasing I realized it wasn't clear that I was trying to re-frame points from other child comments. My intent was to supplement your original (well stated) point: that ranges of development happen post-birth, and other traits can compensate for vulnerability during this period. </p>
<p>My reply was for the further extrapolation of <em>but what advantage does this give the species?</em>. Something I've seen bandied about since ANTH 101.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true.</p>
<p>Even if you look at primates in the wild, they will be in family groups. This was deemed necessary in terms of coming together to raise children. The &quot;it takes a village to raise a child&quot; idiom comes from this concept. If you were to compare humans to deer for example, could the mother really provide for herself and her baby in the wild then be able to survive winter as well without some assistance? No. Since we have evolved as societal creatures, it enables us to take more time raising children and passing down knowledge.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some would say our society is so good at protecting each other that a person can now remain a baby his/her whole life.  Now if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go watch Transformers:Age of Extinction again.  The exploding colors and sounds never fail to entertain me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember our distinction between adult and infant isn't really binary. More appropriate is a gradient of our chances to survive and reproduce, which increases with age but never hits a guaranteed success rate.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm saying is...</p>
<p>No human has ever escaped the vulnerability that we spend our lives trying to mature out of. Watch your <em>Transformers</em> and know you're going to die and fail to reproduce indefinitely. You'll fail at something that every cell of your body has been created to prevent since the moment of conception. You'll fail because you're a complex collection of flawed, self-reproducing matter. You've been given a primal drive that frames your values; instinct that limits your ability to comprehend the nature of reality around you. </p>
<p>You'll fail because you are human.</p>
<p>Oh and watch <em>Revenge of the Fallen</em>. Much better colors and sounds.</p></div>		</li>
