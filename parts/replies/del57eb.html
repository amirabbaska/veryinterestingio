			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also a good explanation for why Intermittent Fasting, and fasting in general, is becoming such a hot topic. It's hard for people to put into perspective that we actually aren't that far from our hunter-gatherer roots because our lives are so different. But think about how quickly things change culturally. 20 year isn't a long time and yet I can remember growing up in a time where we didn't have personal cellphones or laptops. More and more this convenience makes us complacent in our diets and physical activity and it's literally killing us.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also helps when you have IBS and you're sick of putting up with your body's shit for a few days. Second day here, feel pretty good. I get the odd painful hunger cramp and gurgle here and there, but usually pretty easily remedied by some water. </p>
<p>Best part is, when I'm done fasting, I generally don't want to over eat that much, and the food I want to eat is for some reason a lot healthier, maybe because my options for &quot;filling food&quot; are a lot more wholesome. (Prob doesn't apply to everyone)</p>
<p>But yeah, no idea if it's good or bad for me, but I just started and I already feel a bit better. <em>shrug</em></p>
<p>Calorie tracking however has been hard for me to stick with, but after about 3 weeks or so of being good most days has got me into a place where I don't feel as bad every day. </p>

<p>Protip: loosing weight boils down to one equation: energy in vs out.</p>
<p>Everything you, the reader, eat and drink adds to the sum total of chemical energy stored inside you. You need to limit how much goes in and you need to become more active (cardio specifically) to increase the amount of energy burned off. Once that equation tips in favor of an operating deficit then your body taps into its fat reserves to make up for it. <em>BUT</em> it will only do that if you're active enough to force your body to make it happen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You need to limit how much energy goes in, not how much biomass.</p>
<p>Modern food science has made this a problem. Many of the previous sources of fiber we used to eat are now stripped from foods and turned into animal feed. Now in just a few bites you can eat hundreds of calories. The problem with so many calories in such few bites is it will not sate your apatite, leading to caloric over consumption. This one-two punch of low fiber high calorie food leads to a state habitual overeating. </p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to lower calorie consumption is by eating high fiber low calorie foods. They generally have a lower glycemic index, take longer to digest, and satiate your hunger for a longer period of time. The problem for many people is they are tougher to eat and don't taste as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fat is to blame as well. People eat too much fat in this country too. One of the problems is people eat meat with every meal, and those calorie dense fats add up. You can't just say carbs are the enemy when carb-rich proteins like beans are so much more feasible for maintaining a healthy weight than fat-rich proteins like nuts and meat, even white meat. I'm not denying pure sugar is shit for your body but don't think that fat doesn't have to be eaten in moderation as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The sugar industry did knowingly falsify scientific research to shift all the blame of making people unhealthy and fat to actual fat rather than sugar and carbs.  I believe this occured in the 1950s and it was until recent decades that it has become mainstream knowledge that sugar is primarily to blame for the the fatties in america, not fat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are never &quot;goals&quot; in evolution, there is no specific direction a species is trying to head.  </p>
<p>My point is, just because we don't need sugar and fat like we used to does not mean we &quot;evolve&quot; it away. That would imply that some outside entity were driving the changes in our species.  </p>
<p>In an overly simplistic sense, there are simply changes that happen to an environment and at a genetic level. If those changes are enough to change the reproduction or survivability of the species, well that puts a new  pressure on the species and may make certain members pass on their genes more than others.  </p>
<p>It's all relative though and it's not like animals are climbing some evolutionary ladder getting bigger, stronger, faster. Depending on the environment and other factors, being slow could make you more likely to reproduce and then all of a sudden being slow is useful instead of being fast. Perhaps the increased metabolism of faster animals is no longer  sustainable in their environment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've read recent studies about how exercise (for example) causes genetic changes to occur in your body, though. There definitely seems to be a relationship between environment and how genes are expressed, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if the pressure that we're putting on ourselves with all of the sugary and high calorie food and drink is causing long term changes to occur in our genome (generations from now, obviously).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more complex and nuanced than that. For instance, you also have to take into account how a parent with diabetes affects their children's reproduction. Disabled/sick/unhealthy/etc. parents might lower a child's chance of mating (social pressure, less money, more time spent taking care of parents instead of dating and so on.)</p>
<p>Any statistically significant effect on reproduction will influence evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well. There are plenty of other medical effects from obesity that decreases fertility. One of them being PCOS (Poly-Cystic Ovarian Syndrome) that is believed to cause a drop in fertility in obese women.</p>
<p>Edit: There are a lot of people claiming that PCOS causes obesity and not the other way around. That's not entirely true. It's true that peripheral insulin resistance is believed to contribute to both the metabolic syndrome and PCOS. Which explains causes of PCOS in non-obese women. But the fact is that obesity in itself causes peripheral insulin resistance increasing the risk of developing PCOS. This, at least, is what they teach us in medical school :P</p>
<p>A fun fact: Women with PCOS have a higher physical performance and build muscle much more easily compared to women without PCOS. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically it's possible, but given the time span for that it's far more likely that we discover a workaround through science. We already have diet programs that supposedly help decrease food craving and increase metabolic activity, we are probably less than 100 years off from more permanent and efficient solutions to these problems.</p></div>		</li>
