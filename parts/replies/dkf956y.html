			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Though many articles cite that some level of exposure, not just in regard to peanuts, have benefits when preventing different types of allergies. Most commonly in regard to children who grew up in <a href="http://time.com/4508613/farm-allergy-risk/" target="_blank">rural</a> areas, compared to their urban counterparts. This is particularly noticeable within the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kidsallergies-idUSBRE8431J920120504" target="_blank">Amish</a> community. Though in this setting, it may have some correlation with genetics.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the fact that people in rural areas are less likely to have allergies support the so called 'hygiene hypothesis', basically if you dont have contact with enough real bacterias etc during your childhood, your immune system will be a rebel teenager and start attacking harmless things.  Because of skewed Th1 / Th2 lymphocyte proportions possibly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude, the whole point of the article /u/Kush-Kween linked (which is about the 2nd study /u/Beartin linked) was to state that the study was a slam dunk - early consumption fixes the problem.  It's about as definitive evidence as you can get, especially in allergy literature, which apparently is all over the place.  Fuckin' &quot;86.1% relative reduction in the prevalence of peanut allergy&quot; compared to control.</p>
<p>That study single-handedly changed our pediatrician's office diet recommendations and I'm sure it's the same with pediatricians all around the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as many comments point out, it's pretty clear allergies are influenced by both genetics and exposure. It's phenotypical, not genotypical. It's not nearly so simple as you have the gene, you have the allergy.</p>
<p>In other words there are probably tons who carry the gene but do not express the allergy because of exposure at a young age (and thus pass on the gene to their children, who also may or may not have the allergy). Because of that the selective pressure on the allergy gene would be extremely weak, and even weaker when you consider advanced modern medical science and our ability to reduce the fatality rate of even extreme forms of peanut allergy.</p>
<p>So there is almost certainly no significant selective pressure happening.</p></div>		</li>
