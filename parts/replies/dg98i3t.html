			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a really old concern that goes back to the 19th century, when Charles Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, established the discipline of eugenics. We have thankfully rejected the racist and prejudiced interpretations of these ideas but the notion that intelligent people have fewer children has persisted. In part this is due to the fact that there is a connection between education and family size (i.e. more educated people tend to have fewer children) but it turns out that there is not such a clear relationship between education and intelligence. In other words, there are many highly intelligent people that are poorly educated and also some highly educated people who aren't as smart as you might think (not naming any names here!). So we really can't make the leap to saying that less intelligent people have more children.</p></div>		</li>
