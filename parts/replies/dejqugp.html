			<div class="markdown"><p>Pirate stations will often try to avoid detection by having their transmitter in one location,  the &quot;studio&quot; somewhere else and a radio link making several hops via other locations to the transmitter.  The authorities can easily find the transmitter and may disable/confiscate it, but will have more difficulty finding the studio. </p>
<p>In the UK it is OfCom that deals with pirate radio and they are reported to have shut down 400 pirate stations in the two years up to 2015.</p></div>		</li>
