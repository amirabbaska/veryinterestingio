			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does a coffee right before bed keep you awake then? If you're up late studying and you're getting too tired to focus, a coffee will keep you up. Wouldn't that run contrary to the explanation that coffee can't make you less tired, only prevent you from getting more tired?</p>
<p>Not trying to imply that this answer is wrong, I am just curious how this works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I have many memories of late night gaming sessions, midnight essay writing; just as I feel physically tired and want to close my eyes, 2 spoonfulls of instant coffee and within 20 minutes I feel alert and no longer tired.</p>
<p>OP's explanation does sound very logical, but as we know, mechanisms in the brain aren't always as simple as black and white. I want to know the reason why a coffee CAN negate the feelings of tiredness if it isn't replacing any of the adenosine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine can also give your body the feeling of &quot;alertness&quot; through increased heart rate, perhaps heavier breathing plus a mental expectation.  When you're already tired it doesn't actually make you more awake, but rather makes your body feel like it's more awake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bet it could have some to do with the expectation of energy from the coffee.  The smell alone could even contribute to a powerful placebo effect that may help you get a second wind. Iirc, caffeine takes longer than 20 minutes to have an effect.  That's why you can have coffee naps where you drink coffee, fall asleep and when you wake up, the caffeine kicks in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be the other affects of caffeine keeping you up as well. Personally, I have no trouble sleeping while caffeinated, I just sleep terribly. Meanwhile, energy drinks do a better job keeping me awake. Could be something to do with the other crap in them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was really depressed after some personal hardship, every time I would have coffee, my mind would always race towards this hardship and try to analyze it or talk it out with myself. I couldn't think or focus on anything else. I felt I was going mental at some point. Is this possibly a general reaction to stimulants while being depressed or extremely sad?</p>
<p>I felt like coffee was taking my current mental state and multiplying it into x100. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconding the other guy. It's a direct effect of caffeine. Not everyone experiences it, but if you have anxiety without coffee, you'll likely feel more anxious after drinking it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you first wake up, there is still a lot of adenosine bonded to those receptors (which is a part of why many people feel groggy/hazy upon waking). It takes 30-60 minutes for the &quot;waking up&quot; process to free up enough receptors for the caffeine to do its best work.</p>
<p>The more free receptors you have, the better the caffeine can do its job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine stops <em>more</em> adesine from bonding, it can't do anything about the stuff already there</p>
<p>So the best time to get caffeine is when there's not much originally, then it stops more from bonding</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it's best to have the coffee like 2 or 3 hours after waking up.  It makes for a bit of a rough initial morning, but then one cup will get you trough the rest of the whole day.  It feels so much stronger than if you just drink it right after waking up. </p></div>		</li>
