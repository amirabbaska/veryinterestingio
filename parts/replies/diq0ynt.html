			<div class="markdown"><p>From the conversations I've had with the police, they know there is a certain level of nerves by default when you are pulled over. Just try and be respectful, clear in your actions, and know your rights. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Nervousness is not enough to arrest someone.  It is enough to keep asking questions that might lead you to reveal potentially incrminating information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is intuitively correct but not actually the answer. They ask because answering the question truthful often results in an admission of guilt, something that will make their tickets stick. Example: an officer asks you if you know how fast you are going because he knows the court cases that give basis of technological ambiguity when he monitors your speed from a moving object (I.e., the radar on his car). If you tell him 75, he doesn't need to quibble with you if you contest the ticket (also he doesn't have to waste his time in court testifying against you). Department chiefs as well as police policy instructors drum this question because it greatly reduces department overhead and conviction rates easily. By the way, your answer in this scenerio should always be &quot;the speed of traffic.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be a dick, but this is not the real answer.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:The real reason is that theyre hoping youll get nervous and confess to something they didnt know about, like a suspended license or an expired registration, not because they want/need a confession that you knew you were speeding.</strong></p>
<p>The REAL reason they ask you if you know why youve been pulled over is because youll probably get nervous and might end up confessing to something they didnt even know you were doing, and now they can write you an even bigger ticket for that, or possibly arrest you.</p>
<p>Like, say a cop pulls you over because your tail light is busted, and when he asks if you know why youve been pulled over, you say &quot;Yeah I know I was going 15mph over the speed limit Im really sorry!&quot;</p>
<p>Well, up until now, he wasnt going after you for speeding; just for the tail light. But now, he can ticket you for the tail light AND for speeding. Even if you actually WERENT speeding, or if he had no evidence of it, now youve confessed, so thats all he needs to write that second ticket.</p>
<p>The reality is that officers dont care whether you admit to whatever they <em>actually</em> pulled you over for, because a confession to <em>that</em> is totally irrelevant. If theyve pulled you over, they already have everything they need to ticket you and hold it up in court, confession or no. A city cop will have either a VASCAR reading or will have been pacing you. A state trooper will have a reading from a RADAR gun, and <em>that</em> is the evidence theyll use in traffic court. But if you confess to something in addition to what theyve already got you for, thats just icing on the cake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I gotta ask. What r your tail lights in America made of? It seems to b the classic movie police stop reason. I think in all of my 40 years of driving I've seen maybe 1-2 (max)  busted tailights</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;busted&quot; usually means more like &quot;burnt out,&quot; as in the actual light bulb itself has simply reached the end of its life span and burnt out, resulting in the tail light not working, and thus one could describe it as 'broken' or 'busted' because saying &quot;your tail light is broken' is faster than saying 'the light bulb inside of your tail light assembly is no longer lighting up' and people understand what youre referring to either way.</p>
<p>Also, as for it being a movie trope, its because in movies, cops will use it as an excuse to pull someone over, even if its not true.</p>
<p>Like, if I pulled you over and told you your tail light was out, even if it actua.lly wasnt, its not like youre gonna know for sure. Your tail lights are behind you, so its not like you spend any amount of time looking at them, and its incredibly easy to not notice when one actually does go out. Plenty of people will drive around with a burnt out light for days or weeks before noticing that its out, simply because its not something the driver usually sees; its something OTHER drivers see.</p></div>		</li>
