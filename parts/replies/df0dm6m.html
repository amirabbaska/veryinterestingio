			<div class="markdown"><p>Even without the greenhouse gases, the air is warmed by thermal emissions from the ground, surface water, etc.</p>
<p>The longest day of the year, and thus astronomically, the dead middle of summer, is June 21 in the northern hemisphere. However, July and August are usually hotter than June, even though they receive less direct sunlight. The reason why is that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to heat all the thermal mass at the Earth's surface. The oceans and mountains haven't had enough time to warm up by June 21 -- they're still getting there. Which means they're cooler and they in turn cool the air. By August, they're warmer and they warm the air more.</p>
<p>You have the same effect in micro-form during an eclipse. You lose direct sunlight, but you're still standing on warm ground with air that's been warmed by all that energy that's been piling in. So you get a little cooler, but it's not like the only way you feel warmth is by direct radiation from the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air is a pretty decent insulator in realityâ€¦look at the heat capacities (yes we are making an ideal gas assumption) just as a reference compared to other materials. The loss of energy from the sun is a large amount but the amount of gas affected is also large and it'll resist changing temperature. Just a vastly large thermodynamics problem.</p></div>		</li>
