<p>Your description of camera + software explains how a camera can capture very dim light sources (potentially better than the human eye), but it does not explain how the eye without long exposure time and without image stabilization can detect sources that are more dim than a (consumer level) camera in the same circumstances (no long exposure time and no image stabilization). </p>

<p>Clearly cameras can benefit from software (and from long exposure time), but the eye does not do long exposure time nor does the brain have an equivalent of the required image stabilization software (it only does relatively short duration stabilization).  </p>
<p>I don't know how sensitive the sensor of an average digital camera is, but it may well need more than minimum 5 to 14 photons entering the lens in order to be detected by the sensor (a few photo receptors each being hit by 1 or 2 photons), as  the human eye does. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold#Vision" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold#Vision</a>  </p>
<p>So the difference wrt sensitivity between eye and camera (with same exposure time) probably is in the hardware and not in the software. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not over an amount of time comparable to long exposure times common in astro-photography; even only a few seconds would cause massive motion-blur. Also it would not explain how the eye is capable of detecting as little as just a few photons, as explained in the wiki article provided. </p></div>		</li>
