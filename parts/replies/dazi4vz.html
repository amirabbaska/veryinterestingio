			<div class="markdown"><p>Because, for most batteries, there is no surefire way to measure &quot;battery percentage&quot;.</p>
<p>A battery is basically a series of chemical reactions that move charged particles from one terminal to the other, creating electricity. How many particles move in between the terminals (the rate of the chemical reaction) depends on a number of factors, and it's far from being constant (including temperature, the current battery percentage, and how much current your device is drawing at the moment). This means that a battery's discharge pattern is non-linear, going from 12V to 11V doesn't take as much time as going from 11V to 10V or 5V to 4V.</p>
<p>You either have a system that is non-linear and not very useful (going from 20% to 5% would take as fast as going from 100% to 90%, for example), or a system that's mostly linear and not very accurate.</p>
<p>Now, most LiOn batteries use a different system called &quot;coulomb counting&quot;. When the factory releases a battery, it comes with two &quot;states&quot; that correspond to how much charge the battery has, which correspond to 100% and 0%. When you're using your battery, the system looks at how much current your battery supplies and it converts it into charge, which it matches against the pre-set values. When your phone is charging, the same thing happens. The issue with this is that some of the current is converted into heat and will not be used to charge your battery. Also, batteries tend to discharge on their own even if no outside current is drawn. Meaning, these measurements will drift, resulting in situations where if you haven't fully discharged your batteries in a while you might run out of juice at 10% or you might be able to use your phone for an hour at 1%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do; 0% isn't the &quot;damage point&quot;, it's the &quot;safe point&quot;. If shutdown happens accidentally above 0% (i.e. it wasn't programmed but rather jumped to 0% and triggered a shutdown) it's due to a bad estimate of the battery capacity by the controller. If shutdown happens deliberately at 5% (it was programmed or configured to do so), that's usually either because the computer is going to sleep and still needs some energy to keep the contents of RAM, or to give it some time to be able to safely and cleanly shut down the OS.</p>
<p>My laptop is configured to go to sleep at 5% battery life, to give me some time to plug it in (while it's asleep and using less power) before it completely dies. But my phone will run down all the way down to 1% and only shut down (cleanly) once it hits 0% (even 0% isn't quite the point where the battery controller calls it quits, it still has enough juice left to at least safely do a controlled shutdown).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wanted the special lithium ion batteries that don't get damaged when fully drained... but I guess no one was willing to pay extra for them. Especially not now, since people replace their phones every 2-3 years. :(</p></div>		</li>
