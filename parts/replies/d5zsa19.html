			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly off-topic, but that first researcher you cited, Nora Volkow, is a rock star in dopamine research, especially with respect to drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine, heroin, etc.). I highly recommend reading some of her work on that topic. Some of it is very eye-opening in understanding why drug addicts behave the way they do.</p>
<p>That's all. Have a nice day, everyone!</p>
<p>edit: spelling</p>
<p>edit 2: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC155054/" target="_blank">Here's a link to one of my favorite papers by NV.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Also slightly off-topic, Nora Volkow was born and raised in Mexico, is now an American citizen, and also happens to be the great-granddaughter of Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky.  Talk about an interesting heritage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is very interesting. Since Trotsky was exiled in Mexico where he was eventually assassinated with a ice axe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trotsky lived in the Coyoac√°n area of Mexico City at the home (The Blue House) of the painter Diego Rivera and Rivera's wife and fellow painter, Frida Kahlo, with whom Trotsky had an affair.[94][95] His final move was a few blocks away to a residence on Avenida Viena in May 1939, following a break with Rivera</p>

<p>So quite the background to grow up with. She must have heard some amazing and astounding family history growing up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm...let me look up some sources while I offer you my initial hypothesis.</p>
<p>I think that fatigue after sun exposure comes from a combination of factors including dehydration (water evaporates from your skin) and your body spending extra energy trying to maintain homeostasis. Because you are at a net loss of water and calories, you will tend to feel tired.</p>
<p>Edit: I found one <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18494920" target="_blank">paper</a> that linked sun exposure to feelings of fatigue, but did not establish a mechanism. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A significant increase in scores for subjective sense of fatigue was observed in the evening of all 3 days following sun exposure and on the fourth day, which had no exposure, as well as in the morning of the third and fourth days, as compared with those periods during the control week, which did not have experimental solar exposure</p>
<p>The results of multiple regression analysis of subjective feelings showed that fatigue caused by solar exposure was qualitatively different from that in the control week. These results suggest that brain function performance declined following solar exposure as did fatigue development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, I know that sunlight antagonizes the production of melatonin, a neurohormone your body uses to regulate sleep and wake cycles. Perhaps after long sun exposure and going indoors, there is a surge of melatonin causing one to feel tired?</p></div>		</li>
