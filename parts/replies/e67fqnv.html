			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the classic uses for bronze is in bell making. Bells are less and less common in the modern era but there are still several foundries that manufacture them. (I'm talking large carillon/church bells here). There was a great audio documentary I heard some time ago that talked about the historic cycle through the centuries in Europe of church bells being taken and cast into cannons during war time, and the cannons being cast back into bells during times of peace. I would love to find out again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like many other of the responses to other manufacturing questions here, musical instrument materials are selected due to a combination of tradition, workability, and mechanical properties, as well as visual beauty.  You'll notice that I didn't include &quot;sound&quot;...</p>
<p>John Coltman is probably the most famous researcher in the area, having spent significant time researching the flute.  <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/marl/Coltman/documents/Coltman-1.06.pdf" target="_blank">His most famous papers involved making identical flutes out of different materials</a>, one time even making one out of concrete.  The reality is that for wind instruments, you don't want the instrument to respond to the waves, just to reflect them (different from a string instrument where the resonance of the box projects the sound; resonance of a wind instrument is lost energy).  So if instruments of different materials are made to exact dimensions, they should have the same sound, and the evidence supports this. Some materials will be easier to shape to exactly the right dimensions.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is some thought that using expensive materials (excellent flutes are frequently made from solid gold or platinum) shows the seriousness of the maker to the detail of construction.  After all, it would be a difficult sell to put $15k of labor into making an instrument out of $45 of brass, even though the results would be the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brass flutes are common. Not as popular as a wood flute, but they're easy to find.</p>
<p>Brass and bronze both have a very unique and desirable tonality, which is why alloys of both are so commonly found in musical instruments. A <a href="https://www.blackswamp.com/snare-drum-titan-bronze" target="_blank">high end Bell Bronze</a> snare drum can sell for more than $1000, and no one who plays drums will tell you that it's not worth every penny, or that any material sounds the same (better or worse is debatable).</p></div>		</li>
