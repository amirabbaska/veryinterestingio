<p>Yes, &quot;age&quot; doesn't make any sense when talking about what galaxies are primarily made of: dark matter and hydrogen gas. Although we don't know what dark matter is, we have no evidence that it &quot;ages&quot; and, barring the possibility of proton decay on much, much, much longer timescales than the age of the universe, hydrogen gas does not &quot;age&quot;. Stars, however, being dynamic objects that fuse hydrogen into heavier elements and seed the surrounding medium with heavy elements via supernovae and <a href="https://www.livescience.com/60701-ligo-neutron-stars-heavy-metals-gold.html" target="_blank">neutron star collisions</a>, <em>do</em> &quot;age&quot;. The net effect of billions of stars forming and dying over time increases the amount of heavy elements in a galaxy and changes the galaxy's reserve of hydrogen gas, eventually affecting its morphology (gas-rich disk galaxies evolving into elliptical galaxies as their gas reserves are converted to stars). </p></div>		</li>
