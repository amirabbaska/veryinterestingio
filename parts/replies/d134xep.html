			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey look something ive got experience on.</p>
<p>I wrote a duplicate video and image finder for my undergrad project. The way I went about it was to calculate the histograms of the colour spectrum. Which is quite simple really</p>
<p>Three arrays one for each colour: Red, Green and Blue then use the colour value of the pixel as the array index and +1. After the histograms where generated I calculated several statistical properties of each histogram such as kurtosis, variance, deviation etc. to create a finger print. The finger print only acted has an index, or fast search and thorough search would compare the other values. If they fell within a certain threshold a match was found.</p>
<p>But ultimately there are multiple ways to do it each with advantages and disadvantages.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Forgot to mention that the system will (eventually, when video is included) be able to forensically tell if someone is getting beat up, raped, murdered, or abused.  This will usher a new age for humanity: cameras everywhere, making the prey finally, truly safe from the predators.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was all set to write a comment about how this might be how the Chinese porn-filtering systems work, then I just looked it up for the hell of it.</p>
<p>This is roughly what the Green Dam Youth Escort program in China does (or did, it lost its funding). It's a terrible piece of software, and it has a very poor record for preventing false positives (like pictures of pigs and non-nude people) and false negatives (it had trouble recognising pornographic images featuring dark-skinned people).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well all types of &quot;fingerprints&quot; and even more generally, the ways to solve a problem have advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Color histograms as you said have disadvantages and are in no way the panacea for image searching, which is a pretty difficult problem BTW. </p>
<p>Nevertheless they <em>can</em> give you a measurement of similarity of two images. How one will use it, how heavily depend on it, is a whole another thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Converting an RGB Matrix to greyscale with a gradient mapping is actually one of the most amazing things ever in image processing. At least in the ones I have done.</p>
<p>Because of this I could feed an image of really wide fuzzy crosshairs, blocked over the centre by some arbitrary shape,  with a fading luminosity from the centre outwards, with the cross at any angle, and automatically have the program tell me where the centre of the crosshairs was behind the object.</p>
<p>I just wanted to talk about that, it gets me excited.</p></div>		</li>
