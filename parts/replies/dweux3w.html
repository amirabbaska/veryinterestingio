			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically they collect a water or soil sample and extract the DNA from the sample and sequence all of it. Then they take the sequences and try to match them with the genomes of known microbial species. Usually they find that only a small percentage of the DNA can be matched and the rest is basically unknown. This field of study is called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics" target="_blank">metagenomics</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And only a small percentage of microorganisms can be cultivated in the lab, thus making it difficult for scientists to discover and isolate unknown bacterial species. This is because the environment that can be simulated in a lab could only support the growth of a small percentage of microorganisms. But metagenomics helps to bridge this gap. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically extrapolating from data. One way of finding new species is (nowadays, less invasive methods are preferred) to go to the kitchen (or any other biodiverse ecosystem) and find a large broccoli (which shouldn't prove much of a challenge), spread a large sheet beneath the broccoli and then gas the whole broccoli to send every (formerly) living thing flying down onto your nice big sheet. You can then easily classify every microbial species. Scientists would then find that a large percentage of the microbial species collected were previously unknown species. This process would be repeated on several other broccolis in the area, with similar results. From this, we can tell that there are a whole lot of microbial species we don't know about yet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most exciting things about metagenomics is that it is often used to 'discover' new species without having to isolate them. If your coverage is high enough, it is possible to piece together (possibly) complete genomes based on overlapping contigs. This has helped us find species that can't be grown in pure culture, such as obligate syntrophs and intracellular parasites. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>microbial species </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is <em>species</em> even a meaningful word in the context of microbes which reproduce asexually? The definition of <em>species</em> (there are many, but generally) depends on ability to interbreed and that's not a factor for microbes. I imagine that microbes can have a &quot;family tree&quot;, and can be grouped by similarity of genetics, but I'm confused by <em>species</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of bacteria, the universal properties of a species are held more by ecotypes. A typical named species of bacteria contains many ecotypes, each with the universal attributes of species. So a named bacterial species is more like a genus than a species I suppose. There are also subspecies and strains of Bacteria.</p></div>		</li>
