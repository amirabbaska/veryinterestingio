			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called a <em>tip-of-the-tongue</em> state. These things are <em>nasty</em>: they reinforce the link between what you're trying to retrieve your information with and the ToT state the more you stay in it! Your best solution to them is to stop trying to recall whatever it was and look it up on your phone or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, now I'm curious as to whether you're pointing out something that actually happens, or something that's a flaw with the model. </p>
<p>I feel like even if you don't mean either of those things, that it is one of the two. </p>
<p>edit: Was googling ToT state to try and figure out it's an actual phenomenon and found that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue" target="_blank">the wiki page for top of the tongue</a> is far more complete than I would have suspected it of being. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to ask, aren't there actually some studies confirming this model? I know priming, for example, is a major mechanism in both linguistics and psychology, and can be tested relatively simply. And priming is based on associative connections, that is, linked data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no matter what, we do know that memories are linked in our brains. I hear mamma mia by ABBA, and I always have involuntary memories of playing a level in sonic 2 because I was listening to the music while playing that level once. We don't exactly need studies to know that memory contains links.</p>
<p>But, is everything linked? Are two things linked just because you think about them? Are links basic building blocks, or something that sometimes happens? When we forget or lose access to memories, is it because the memories are gone, or because the links are gone? Are links <em>elementary</em> blocks? Are memories made only of links?</p>
<p>We know that there are at least extra rules to the linked data model, because I don't have a terrible amount of links associated with the word 'the' that I can consciously summon, but there must be a lot of them. </p>
<p>We know also that there are schema involved, do schema modify how links form? Are schema the basic building blocks, and a link a type of schema that occurs? Or are schema built themselves of links? </p>
<p>Is there one universal type of link, as many of these questions implicitly suppose, or are there different links with different rules? </p>
<p>Does priming work because it refreshes these type of links, or because it reinforces physical pathways in the brain? (Are they separate things?)</p>
<p>A lot of implicit things in the model are pretty hard to actually test, especially since it was built to follow what we know the mind does do.</p></div>		</li>
