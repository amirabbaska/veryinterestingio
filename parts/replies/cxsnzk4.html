			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have the time and date and a fix on cardinality, you can certainly fix the position.  </p>
<p>Two distant landmarks in the photograph is good enough to use apparent size to fix a position.  Rather accurately if you also know the weather data for the intervening atmosphere.</p>
<p>If the moon is one of them, you would need date and time.</p>
<p>You also have to consider lense distortion, or course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depeding on what else is in the picture, you may be able to calculate that.  What you really need is the ratio between focal length and sensor size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the position of the Moon in relation to the stars will tell you the latitude because at any position on earth the Moon follows a path across the stars that is specific to the location.  If you were, say, on the North Pole looking at the Moon it would cover up a slightly different part of the sky than someone looking at it from the equator.  This is akin to you holding up your thumb and looking at it through each eye independently. The parallax makes your thumb cover up different things in the background.</p>
<p>Now why you can't tell exactly where this was taken is because the Moon moves, and it could be covering up the same part of the sky for different places along the same latitude but at different times during the day.</p>
<p>I suppose if you had enough resolution you could calculate the rotation of the Moon to determine how far it was from the &quot;center&quot; line.  This would be incredibly small, though, and probably impossible to calculate with a normal picture.</p>
<p>Edit: If my math actually checks out, the difference in the moons rotation to the two poles is less than 2 degrees.  I used fuzzy numbers to get an approximation: the small angle of a right triangle with legs of 240k miles (distance to moon) and 4000 miles (radius of Earth) is just under 1 degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shift in the moon's position due to parallax is vanishingly small compared to the shifts caused by adjustable focal lengths.  You actually could not use this information in normal photography because the difference would be tiny, the field of view uncertain, and the stars would not show up.  If you were specifically taking astronomical pictures, this could be different, but even then you would want to set up a photograph specifically engineered to make it easy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can identify the stars in a photo, you can back-calculate the orientation of the camera.   For example, if you took a picture of the Big Dipper, you would simply rotate the picture until the stars in the photo matched the stars in the sky.  Since you know, or can look up, the right ascension and declination of the stars in the picture, you can work out the right ascension and declination of the center of the photo.  This will tell you exactly which way the camera was pointing in space, and at what angle the camera was to the celestial sphere.</p>
<p>By assuming that the camera was held in the normal position, the bottom edge of the photo would be parallel to the horizon. By comparing the angle of the horizon to the angle of the celestial declinations, you can determine the latitude of the camera's location.  By knowing the date/time, you would know the orientation of the Earth according to how the stars would have appeared at that time.  Combining those two should correspond to a single point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So you are saying that having the stars and the time will allow us to figure out the location?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep! That's how ships (and later, aircraft) navigated for centuries. If you can measure the angle of the North Star from the northern horizon, you can determine your latitude. If you can measure the angle of another star from the eastern or western horizon, and you have an accurate time and date reference, you can determine your longitude. It's why developing an accurate timepiece was so important to naval navigation, and it's pretty cool. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You can still glean some latitude information from just the Moon...see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3w20nz/is_it_possible_to_determine_the_location_at_which/cxsrppq" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>
