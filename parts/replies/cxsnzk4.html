			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have the time and date and a fix on cardinality, you can certainly fix the position.  </p>
<p>Two distant landmarks in the photograph is good enough to use apparent size to fix a position.  Rather accurately if you also know the weather data for the intervening atmosphere.</p>
<p>If the moon is one of them, you would need date and time.</p>
<p>You also have to consider lense distortion, or course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depeding on what else is in the picture, you may be able to calculate that.  What you really need is the ratio between focal length and sensor size.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it won't tell you the location from which the photo was taken.</p>

<p>You can still glean some latitude information from just the Moon...see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3w20nz/is_it_possible_to_determine_the_location_at_which/cxsrppq" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>
