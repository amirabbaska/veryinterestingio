			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I probably should have specified. This is with the hair being held vertically, suspended from the top (presumably someone's head, but it doesn't really matter). Each segment of hair has to hold up the hair below it, and at some point it'll break under its own weight. That point is when the hair is around 3 miles long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is amazingly close to three miles (assuming two significant digits, it <em>is</em> 3.00 miles). Which makes me wonder if the unit of a mile came as a result of some calculation based on Rapunzel's hair's tensile strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno, hair seems light. Lets work it out:</p>
<p>Based on the above figures,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.62 mg for a 4.5&quot; sample of hair</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Equates to 0.62mg per 11.45cm, which is <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.00541+grams+per+meter&amp;lk=1&amp;rawformassumption=%22ClashPrefs%22%20-%3E%20%22ClashPrefs%22" target="_blank">0.00541 g/m</a></p>
<p>Which for the 4832m max length gives us weight of 26.14g per hair strand.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://baumanmedical.com/qa/many-hairs-human-head/" target="_blank">first google result</a> for the number of hairs on your head, 90k to 150k, the total head of hair would weigh between 2352.6kg and  <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=26.14+grams+*+150000" target="_blank">3921kg</a>.</p>
<p>Around 1.4 to 2.3 small cars anchored to your head.</p>
<p>Dang, you are completely correct. :D</p></div>		</li>
