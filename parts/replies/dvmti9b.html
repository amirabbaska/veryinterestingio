			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAMA/LIBRA" target="_blank">DAMA/LIBRA</a> experiment at Grand Sasso. My understanding is that their detector rates fluctuate throughout the year, which they interpret as being consistent with Earth moving through a mass of dark matter. More sensitive experiments show that this likely isn't the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These experiments have been able to constrain possible sizes and masses of WIMPs lower and lower over the years, because if the particles had larger cross sections we would have measured them by now with current experiments (if they're what we think they are, which is another question entirely). One of the professors at my college runs a Xenon tank experiment and the main thing I got out of his talk was that we're getting closer to the constrained size of WIMPs being in a region that can be attributed to noise and error, so even if we got a signal we would never be able to prove that it was a WIMP.</p></div>		</li>
