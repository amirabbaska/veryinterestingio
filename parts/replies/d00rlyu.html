			<div class="markdown"><p>That down regulation happens with most drugs, really. It's a factor in tolerance developing, and part of why it takes time for your brain chemistry to get back to normal after prolonged use from pretty much any drug. It doesn't happen on a time scale relevant to protect from an overdose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that with other drugs, you can still achieve the same level of &quot;high,&quot; it just takes more of the drug to do it. </p>
<p>Lets call a single unit of feeling high &quot;1 uH&quot; (for &quot;unit High&quot;)</p>
<p>Suppose you take a gram of heroin and ingest it. You are now 50 uH. </p>
<p>Now, a year of steady use down regulates your receptors, so that a gram only gets you to 25 uH. To achieve 50 uH, you need 2 grams. The more you use, the more down regulated your receptors get, and the more heroin it takes to achieve 50 uH of &quot;high.&quot; But <em>you can always achieve the same level of high as the first time, by taking more and more.</em></p>
<p>With marijuana, lets say a gram gets you 50uH. Then, a year of regular use down regulates your receptors. So one day, (a year later) you ingest a gram. You only get to 25 uH. So, you decide to smoke 2 grams the next day. When you do, you find that you only get to 37 uH. </p>
<p>The following day you try 3 grams. But this only gets you to 42 uH. </p>
<p>So you try 4 grams. But you still only get to 42 uH. Same with 5 grams. And anything higher than 3. You physically are unable to get as high as you got when you first got high. </p>
<p>in order to reach 50 uH of high again, you must stop ingesting thc, and wait for your receptors to up regulate. Then a single gram will take you to 50 uH again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This helps to answer what I think is the most important secondary question: What is different about the mechanism of intoxication due to Marijuana from other more dangerous drugs like cocaine or heroin?</p>
<p>Is it generally true that intoxicating drugs cause an abnormal flood of neurotransmitters? Is there a limiting factor in THC that prevents it from getting the right neurotransmitter levels high enough to interfere with vital life functions?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no CB receptors in parts of the brain controlling respiration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can confirm.<br />
Source: my friend in highschool who would pass out after getting absolutely roasted, and snore like a fucking freight train. No respiratory inhibition there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously though, I'm guessing this is because the Endo-Cannabinoid System ramps up &amp; down throughout the day depending on the demand from the body for Cannabinoids, and so it wouldn't be good to have our most critical systems reliant upon it.</p></div>		</li>
