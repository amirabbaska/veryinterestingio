			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I had to write an assignment on the Great Leap Forward that I spend 3 days on. Absolute insanity and ignorance by Mao to the fact that millions were dying due to starvation SOLELY because of him.</p>
<p>His fellow CCP members didn't like the Cultural Revolution, they knew it wasn't working. CCP scouts who went village to village to see how everything was working out were afraid to report back saying &quot;people are dying because Mao's wasted all the food&quot; which is why people were dying, because Mao would have heard this personally and executed the scout. People in charge of checking rice and grain production falsified records and promised even more food (because left-over food was necessary and to be given to the communes not doing so well). If these people reported the truth, that hardly any food was being made, they'd be executed or imprisoned.</p>
<p>What also didn't help was Mao declaring war on pests like mice and birds which of course, people obeyed and of course, had severe repercussions. Killing all the birds meant that the locust swarms would be able to sweep through fields unharmed by birds and rats.</p>
<p>Mao didn't give a fuck. He even said it wasn't THAT bad and the worst that will come from this famine is the world will &quot;have a laugh at it&quot;. He was in complete denial, even cutting ties with the USSR because they straight up tried to tell him this would not work.</p>
<p>His colleagues couldn't say &quot;Mao, this is fucking stupid, we need to stop this&quot; because they'd be executed or sent to prison which is what happened to several members of the CCP. They had to play along with Mao who was living in his fantasy world that the people's communes were the very definition of Communism and he, unlike Khruschev and the Soviets, had achieved &quot;True&quot; communism so he was the best communist in the world.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One Mao largely didn't even know what was going on, for reasons you state, Officials were afraid to tell him what was going on, he actually had to sneak out himself to his home village to find out the truth.</p>

<p>Ehhh not really, the actual reason for this was sycophancy and competition between the collective farms, they would falsify their data (often by just adding in other food stuffs as &quot;grain&quot; and adding in food that was supposed to be for the workers) so they looked like the super bestest workers and the Official would get a promotion, one hilariously stupid one was they dumped all the fertilizer in a hole, spread all the seeds on top of it, and then held up children on top of the grain (they hidden inside the grain) took a photo and said &quot;this technique was so good that children can literally walk on top of the grain its so thick and strong!&quot; and the idiots at the top of the CCP, Mao, the Politburo etc from interviews I've read and listened too actually fucking believed it, they were like &quot;holy fuck we're geniuses, we're going to actually overtake the west!&quot;.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man you're bringing back memories of me face-palming reading about Mao actions throughout the cultural revolution. I had forgotten about the steel smelting he attempted, the idiot was literally forcing people to take any and all steel utensils they had to melt them down because he wanted to compete with US steel out put. The lunacy of his actions can only compare to the excesses of caligula, at one point he had state munitions factories completely open and was given out anti tank rockets, grenades rifles right off the production line to random crowds made up of various factions of the local CPC in cities so they could enact mini civil wars. </p></div>		</li>

<p>These poorly constructed mud furnaces had a tendency to just explode, and the farmers who were not killed by their own furnaces only produced essentially unusable steel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And my understanding is that to meet quotas, most of the steel was made from steel and iron material that they already had on hand, rather than from ore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The worst part about the quotas, as that they were exaggerated.  One guy would say, I could make X pounds, and the next guy would say X+ pounds.  This caused quotas to be raised because if everyone could produce so much more than the quota... etc etc.  Some of it was surely ore, albeit impure ore.  Some of the steel was made from stuff already on hand, while others were made out of highly impure stuff.  Both kinds of created steel were useless and resulted in a net loss.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The quotas were awful. In some of the interviews with local leaders during the period they did the same thing with food. They would store the &quot;surplus&quot; food, so as local leaders falsely reported they were producing more food, they had to give away more and more food as the locals were starving.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's pretty fucking funny man.</p>
<p>China was a quarter of the worlds population at the time, they didn't kill a tiny fraction of a tiny percent - and lets not forget similar macro-social programs run by the British killed FAR MORE than MAO ever did.</p>
<p>Think about that champ.</p></div>		</li>
