			<div class="markdown"><p>The body reacting to a tiny number of dead organisms is not an issue.  Live microbes are the problem because they than quickly multiply exponentially causing an infection.  So 0.1 percent&mdash;or any number&mdash;of live microbes are still a major issue.  Sterile gloves are the solution to this problem but tears are relatively common so washing remains important.</p>
<p>The real answer is that the longer and more thoroughly you wash, the more germs you remove or kill.  For surgery that's critically important and worth spending the time to do a very thorough job, even though it still won't be perfect.</p></div>		</li>
