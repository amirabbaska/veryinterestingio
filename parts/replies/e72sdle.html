			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any links you could provide to peer reviewed research on ASMR (or accurate summaries of the peer reviewed research)? Last time I looked into it was a few years ago and there was no actual science on it. It was frustrating because it's an undeniably real thing, but nobody had yet bothered to look into the physiology of it.</p>
<p>Given that the name for the phenomenon is just science-y sounding mumbo-jumbo that someone cooked up, it'd be interesting to finally see it get some scientific treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scientific reason I mentioned was simply that of the ASMR response itself. The same concept of middle ear vibration etc causing tingles of a sensory meridian response.</p></div>		</li>
