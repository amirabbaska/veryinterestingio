<p>But you're right, spheres and domes are really good at holding up distributed pressure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually? If they're under any kind of measurable pressure, I'm pretty sure they have to be rounded by law. Corners+pressure=bad times. Like San Bruno and a mitered pipeline bad. </p>
<p>It's fun to play &quot;can that truck kill everyone in sight?&quot; while driving down the highway. Trailer has cornered edges? It's probably a solid or liquid, not under pressure. It'll just be a bit of a show if it crashes. Maybe it's Skittles! Rounded tanker, or cylinders in the back with rounded ends? That's either one big bomb, or lots of little ones! And if it's got a flammable or combustible tag on the back, it can likely kill everyone in sight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I said you &quot;probably&quot; can't. If you are really strong, it can be done. Or if you pinch if with any finger tip in particular, that can crack it. But the shape is still very effective at distributed pressure.</p></div>		</li>
