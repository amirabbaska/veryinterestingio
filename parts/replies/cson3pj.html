			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, normal glass is &quot;greenish clear&quot; due to impurities.  It can be made perfectly clear, it's just a more intensive process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be both, depending on the reflective material used.  Aluminum is common and reflects less/absorbs more in the high-wavelength end of the visible spectrum (with the gradual loss of red giving a blue/green tint), while silver actually absorbs slightly less long-wavelength light and should have the opposite effect (see the reflectance spectra <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Image-Metal-reflectance.png/400px-Image-Metal-reflectance.png" target="_blank">here</a>).  <a href="http://www.uqgoptics.com/materials_commercial_sodalime.aspx" target="_blank">Soda-lime glass</a> absorbs more long-wavelength light and will also cause a green tint (remember that the range we are interested in is visible light at about 400-750 nm, that image covers a larger range but the effect is still visible).  You would need to multiply the two percentages together to get the net effect of a metal-backed glass mirror.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would only be for particular aluminium mirrors.  Different materials have different peak reflective wavelengths and can further be engineered for flatter reflection curves.</p>
<p>More important is that at 99% reflectance (the best possible case for an aluminium reflector), after 688 mirrors, only 1% of the original light would remain unabsorbed, after 1376 mirrors, only 0.01% would remain.</p>
<p>Not to mention that to see that far, you would need focusing optics which would limit you even more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a practical standpoint, the attenuation of the mirrors would prevent you from seeing yourself. Also, if the total distance is enough to cause a noticeable delay, you'd be too small to see. If we assume perfect mirrors and perhaps really, really high-magnification binoculars, sure, you'd see a lag.</p>
<p>Edit: There's a formula to calculate the magnification required to resolve details of a certain size at a distance, but I'm too lazy to do the research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The engineer in me must point out that the obvious solution is to use a camera, a high-definition display and a computer with A/V input and output and custom software to induce a delay. Much more practical than a million mirrors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good thought, but at the very least you'd still have the image attenuation so your reflection would be too dim to see. Unless you have an extremely bright light on you, one where you'd need a &quot;two million sunblock,&quot; as Sarah Connor would say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Followup question because I don't know physics: Does it take any additional time to reflect off a mirror? Like... is the speed of light in the glass coating any slower than the speed of light in air? Or is reflection instantaneous and there's no change in time of total distance traveled whether it's reflected or not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light in a medium is different than the speed of light in a vacuum.  It's about 1.5x slower in heavy glass (but varies by type).  But a the actual &quot;reflecting&quot; action doesn't take extra time and can be considered instantaneous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you have a million mirrors (assuming the reflective surface is behind the glass), the light has to pass through 2x the thickness of the mirror times 1 million, so I wouldn't exactly say that's inconsequential.  Plus, depending on your arrangement, if the reflection is not perfectly 90 degrees, the distance travelled through the glass is increased.</p></div>		</li>
