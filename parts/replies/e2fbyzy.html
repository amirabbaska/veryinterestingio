<p>Anyone with interest in art history like this and likes funny books should read Sacre Bleu by Christopher Moore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was fascinating. These kinds of processes are always mind boggling to me because the end product is so far removed from the raw materials and make me wonder how the first person ever came up with the idea. I guess it’s a lot of trial and error and using techniques that worked for something else similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah seriously. My first thought is usually &quot;Jesus, just.... the shit people used to come up with by pure trial and error, back in the days when there was simply nothing better or more instantly-gratifying to do.&quot; Imagine the sheer risk involved in wasting/diluting this rare, expensive imported blue stuff in the process of trying to get the pigment like this, with only a medieval knowledge of chemistry and no real understanding of how it works on a molecular level or anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lapis lazuli *is* at least blue. How did anyone come up with woad/indigo dyes? The plant is green, it gets simmered in rotting urine (urine is a common mordant, but used differently), the resulting dye bath is &quot;still&quot; green... and when you take it out it turns blue in contact with oxygen. Very light-fast color too, not very wash-fash, but compared to many other plant dyes it's great. Just an accident? Someone tried to get green and it somehow developed a slight blue tinge? </p>
<p>Like lapis blue it takes an insane amount of the plants to get good results, indigo is a lot better than woad, but it wasn't available in Europe for quite a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit, great vid. Had no idea how complex and tedious a process was required.... I basically always just assumed it was as simple as grinding up the minerals and mixing them straight into some regular oil paint or whatever. Fascinating stuff. </p></div>		</li>
