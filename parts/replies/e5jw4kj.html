			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they're very tricky drugs. I'm lucky enough to have found one after years of searching that works without awful side effects, but I've been on ones that have done nothing and given me side effects, and ones that have worked but given me side effects. And yes, the wrong medication given to the wrong person can have very bad consequences. But the opposite is also true, the right medication given to the right person can cause incredible improvement.</p>
<p>It's all very tricky and shouldn't be simplified to fit any narrative. (edit: except perhaps the &quot;reality is fucking complex and we got a lot to learn&quot; narrative, which is a personal favourite).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>SSRIs might have statistically significant effects on depressive symptoms, but all trials were at high risk of bias and the clinical significance seems questionable. SSRIs significantly increase the risk of both serious and non-serious adverse events. The potential small beneficial effects seem to be outweighed by harmful effects.</p>

<p><strong>ELI5 summary:</strong> the difference between the medicine and sugar pills is so small that no human can detect it (even highly trained observers).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alot of these drugs are hard to study, the brain is complex. Different drugs work for different people, if you give a uniform dose of one medication to a group of people you not going to get much effect as a whole. Also most studies are done ove the course of weeks instead of the months people usually take a drug that works for them. Its not as easy as something like ibuprofen, some.drugs work for some people, some people will require another drug. This is misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if the effect can't be seen in a highly controlled study environment, we shouldn't expect to see it in practice (generally the effect is smaller in practice than in studies). And if we don't have data from the studies on long term treatment, we shouldn't be giving long term treatment. </p>
