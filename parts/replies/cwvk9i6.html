			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation because it really gets at the heart of the confusion implicit in the original question. The answer to how a speaker can reproduce all of these sounds simultaneously is easy: its just the sum of all of the different parts put together at once. </p>
<p>The hard part and confusion is how the fuck does your brain untangle all that mess and isolate the individual pieces if the speaker is mashing it all together and sending out just the summed waveform. </p>
<p>Its easy to assume that a speaker <em>must</em> be doing something more complicated in order to create something that is so perfectly intelligible, but instead, it is just the simplest possible explanation and all the complicated stuff really happens inside <em>you</em>. </p>
<p>It can help to remember that at its base level, sound is just changes in pressure, and so the same way that two instruments playing together in a room can have their pressure waves recorded and then reproduced by a single speaker membrane, you can get exactly the same effect by recording them separately and then adding those waves together in some device and then reproducing the combined wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like, half of the top comments have some person replying that it's the best answer in the thread.</p>
<p>People, make up your minds! What's the best answer?  &#3232;_&#3232;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just sitting in the room you're in, you're hearing all kinds of sounds. But your brain can still pick up individual ones, simply because... it can! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason you can differentiate different frequencies is because different parts of the ear react to them. Basically hearing happens when tiny hair-like cells move in response to noise, which causes them to send an electric signal to the brain. These hair cells sit on a membrane which is very taught on one end and very loose on the other. Low frequency sounds move cells on the loose end of the membrane, and high frequency sounds move cells on the taught end. Depending on which cells move, different nerves are firing and your brain can tell what frequency sounds are present.</p></div>		</li>
