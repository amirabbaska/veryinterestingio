			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The chips on the individual components (graphics cards, network cards, hard drives) may retain weird state across the soft boot that they can't across a power off and on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is right. If you do a restart, each piece might go to an independent state before they resynchronize, or may even retain some of the synchronization without retraining any interfaces (when BIOS determines how to use the pieces connected through the mobo effectively). Doing a full power cycle is the only way to guarantee that everything comes up from step1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun story: Some ~15 years ago, a friend of me had a computer where the mouse (PS/2) would not work after a warm reboot from Linux to Windows (or the other way, can't remember). One operating system had configured something in a way the other did not expect on boot, and the only way to undo it was to always switch the machine fully off and then on again when booting Windows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes. And for a long time, it used to be the case in practice too. Nowadays, on modern computers, there's still a theoretical difference but I doubt there could be any a practical difference that would actually matter in normal use-cases. It <em>might</em> be so that some malwares <em>might</em> be able to use the fact that RAM is not necessarily entirely cleared to their advantage. The difference could also matter for software forensic analysis in certain cases, and only if the OS doesn't entirely clear the RAM before shutting down.</p>
<p>But in your daily use on a modern computer? No, there would probalby be no difference that you could actually notice in practice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ram takes seconds up to minutes to fade - that's how cold-boot attacks work - you can take ram modules out of the computer and read cryptographic keys from there. Only way to make sure ram is clear is to enable option in BIOS/EFI if possible, some OSes do it too when starting. </p></div>		</li>

<p>do you happen to know why, the last time I installed Windows fresh on a mobo that didn't have the cmos battery or a network connection that it not only knew my timezone, but was only two minutes off from the correct time?</p></div>		</li>
