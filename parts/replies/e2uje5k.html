<p>I like the Lush Ultrabland cleanser for blackhead reduction.  Massage it onto a dry face (water won't help here) focusing on the area in need for 30-60seconds.  Then remove the oils with a wash cloth dampened with warm to hot water (warm water helps open the pores for removal). You may even want to drape the warm/hot washcloth over you face for a minute before using gentle circular movements to remove everything.  Rinse washcloth and continue to remove residual cleanser.  It won't remove them all in one go, but consistent use keeps skin in good shape.</p></div>		</li>
