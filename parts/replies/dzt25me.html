			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't had misophonia confirmed by any kind of medical professional so I stop short of saying that I have it but I am extremely sensitive to some sounds. Eating sounds are the worst. My old boss slurped his tea and smacked his lips when he ate. He got mad at me once for wearing earphones while working. I told him it's either that or he stops eating at his desk. I have been made so physically uncomfortable by chewing sounds that I have had to leave the room. Sometimes a person could be eating just fine with their mouth closed but I hear the crunching or swallowing and can't stand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about misophonia, but it could just be that you have highly focused senses. I do at least. I can't really ignore things going on around me. When I hear noises I pay attention to them, when I see things in my peripherals, I pay attention to them, I'm constantly identifying any scents that come my way. So it gets annoying when I hear some people eat, or talk on the phone or something. Not because the sounds themselves annoy me, but because I can't fucking help but pay attention to them and I can hear that the person eating is open mouth smacking his food around like a slob, or in the case of phone conversations, I don't want to listen to it, and it's making it difficult to focus on a game/tv/book/phonecall of my own. Oh, god and book is the worst. Nothing worse than trying to read a book and not being able to ignore a jackass on a phonecall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have that with breathing and mouth noises, I have learnt to deal with it though and now it mostly just happens when there's no background noise to focus on. </p>
<p>But as a kid it was unbearable. I would be super irritable anytime I heard any of these noises. I would be really annoyed and all I wanted was to get out of there. That and the guilt you feel when people think they said something to offend you anytime it got too much for me and I had to leave.. It's straight up torture and it made me hate myself my whole childhood, and frankly still do a little bit</p>
<p>As you could imagine this led me to isolate myself, and it was not uncommon for me not saying more than 10- 20 words a day.</p>
<p>It's not fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never connected my own lack of speaking to my misophonia before, but after reading this it makes sense. </p>
<p>There are certain people and certain noises that trigger extreme reactions from me and I also feel extreme guilt at the rage I feel. </p>
<p>This guy I work with, we sometimes will be trapped in a small room together all day and he does this throat clearing thing like clockwork every .5 seconds and it honestly makes me eyeballs want to pop out of my skull and I have to exit the room often in order to not scream or strangle him. Luckily I can listen and to my headphones but I don’t want to sometimes because I want to be more present and accessible. I’ve also gotten shit from superiors for listening to my headphones too because it makes me come off as inaccessible/people won’t come to me with questions. I don’t even know how to explain it without sounding like a lunatic or an asshole. </p>
<p>Misophonia fucking sucks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>why not go get diagnosed officially so you can give your boss the medical papers? It will cause you to either a. work alone b. work a different position or c. be allowed to wear your headphones to help you work. Win win</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your reticular activating system in the midbrain is the one that differentiates the noises and determines if there is cause for alarm. It is where your alertness originates. If the noise is extremely anomalous, unidentified, or identified as a potential danger then it delegates to the specific region it needs to. </p>
<p>The amygdala is the part that is activated when  the noise is potentially threatening or simply abnormal causing you to experience emotion like fear. </p>
<p>So you're right in a sense, but the amygdala is not where the heightened alertness actually comes from, it's just the part that deals with the accompanying emotions associated with that alertness. </p></div>		</li>
