			<div class="markdown"><p>I should point out that there are many many algorithms for solving a cube. A beginner can learn to solve a cube by memorizing only a handful of algorithms, but these algorithms are simple transpositions or orientations of only a few pieces at a time. To complete the cube with only these algorithms in mind, a person typically needs 100 or more moves. To reduce that closer to the 20 moves that any configuration can theoretically be solved in, advanced solvers need to memorize the effects of many more algorithms, that accomplish transposition and orientation of a greater number of pieces, and predict how these algorithms will connect in a certain order to produce the final result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a certain position for it to be solved to start off as? What if the cube is already half way solved, wouldnâ€™t that make it easier for someone to solve at that point as opposed to someone who is in a position with more turns taken to solve it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the person trying to solve it is not familiar with the process, a &quot;half-solved&quot; cube is not really much easier to finish solving than a fully scrambled cube, depending on how you define &quot;half-solved&quot;.</p>
<p>The most common method of solving by a long shot is by layers. (Other methods do exist, but I'm not familiar with them, so I won't go over them.) The edge pieces in the first layer are solved first, followed by the corners in the first layer, the edges in the second layer, the edges in the third layer, and the corners in the third layer. The first two layers have a fair amount of room for creativity while solving them, as it doesn't matter where the pieces in the third layer end up. Once they're done, though, extra moves are needed to ensure they don't get messed up again while solving the third layer.</p>
<p>A cube with two layers solved and the last layer scrambled might look more than half solved, but it essentially requires knowledge of the necessary sets of moves to solve it.</p>
<p>Another thing to understand is that most people will go through essentially the same set of steps for any solve, making small adjustments to the steps to account for different positions of the pieces. If you take a solved cube, apply 6-7 random turns to it, and give it to me, it'll probably be faster for me to solve it by the regular process than by working out the series of 6-7 turns, even though the regular process would probably take me upwards of 50 turns to complete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this speaks to the fundamental misunderstanding I've had about it, which is that the only path from scrambled to solved is to unwind the moves made to scramble it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic layer method I know solves the 3rd layers corners first, then edges, and if the last two edges need to be swapped is a long set of moves to solve it. Is solving the corners last less overall? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's alot of good comments here but I feel like there's some gaps that I'm going to attempt to fill in.</p>
<p>OP, you are mostly right in saying that solving a rubik's cube isn't &quot;hard&quot; once you've memorized the formulas (called algorithms).  </p>
<p>Algorithms themselves shouldn't be thought of as &quot;Do this set of moves until the cube is solved&quot; but more of a &quot;if you see these patterns, do these moves to make these patterns instead.&quot;  The basic idea behind solving a rubik's cube is to progress from one state of a cube to another using some set of algorithms.  After some number of these progressive steps, the cube is solved.</p>
<p>However, there are many different sets of algorithms. There are Beginner's algorithms which were designed to be simple and allow a beginner to solve the cube over several minutes.  These algorithms often involve hundreds of sequential moves/steps despite the fact that a cube is only ever 23 moves or less from solved.</p>
<p>And so there are also more advanced algorithms that rely on more complex analysis of the cube so to solve it in fewer moves.  The cubing community itself is continuously developing newer and better methods for solving the cube, some of which are radically different from the others.</p>
<p>And in general the community likes to focus on solving it in the least amount of time, so of course being able to mentally and physically execute cube solving quickly is another challenging aspect of cubing.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Just solving a rubik's cube on its own is fairly straightforward with today's availability of information but learning to solve it quickly and efficiently is still a challenge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Competitions are done with a cube already scrambled in a set way. So every competitor is solving the same cube. There is also only so far you can scramble a cube. I think the number was 20 moves last time I checked. Any cube in any configuration will always be 20 or fewer moves from being solved. So you set your cubes to be 20 moves from solved and everyone going for world records must be able to think through a minimum of 20 moves to set a time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except theres only one way a cube can be shuffled so that it'll take 20 moves. There's a curve in the number of configurations with x amount of moves needed. Most configurations are around 12 moves needed, if i remember correctly. So as long as you aren't just shuffling randomly, optimal shuffle for competitions would be around 12 moves from solved.</p>
<p>disclaimer: I have no experties whatsoever in rubiks cubes, take my logic with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Source? I was under the impression cubes were randomly scrambled each time, and that there were rules around ensuring randomness. I've never heard of everyone at a competition solving the same cube arrangement. It seems like the logistics of that would be difficult for large competitions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well sure, but nobody is going to know those 20 moves. It took a Google supercomputer to figure out that the magic number is actually 20. What that means is every scramble is a maximum of 20 turns from being solved, IF you know the most efficient turns to make. They only discovered this from brute forcing it until they found that number to be true. No human can do this, it would take knowing billions of patterns.</p></div>		</li>
