			<div class="markdown"><p>The Turing test is based on a human tester's ability to know if it is talking with a human or an AI.  Supposedly the better the AI, the more often the human talking with it won't be able to distinguish.  Essentially, it's only good for conversational bots and not something that is universally applicable.  The whole test is centered around the idea &quot;Can Machines Think?&quot; and was originally intended to answer that question, not to investigate the individual merit behind each and every AI that we develop.  I currently work with developing and using AI in the area of machine learning and computer vision, basically getting machines to be able to see things in pictures and understand their environments.  As far as I know, there isn't much of a 'Turing test' alternative here because either the robot can see the difference between a stapler and an apple or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Turing test got beat by &quot;artificial stupidity&quot;, using a simple chatbot loaded with nothing but internet slang and profanity. The testers got so frustrated and offended they assumed a person was trolling them and quickly decided it couldn't be an AI.</p>
<p>A good test of AI would not have vulnerabilities like that. Also, I think Turing was incorrect to focus on conversation as the measure of AI sentience. Today, it's more accurate to view conversation as just one of many separate problems being worked on in the field of AI, and the real hard stuff is more about problem solving, computer vision, and spoken language understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Turing test works off of people. Someone talks to a machine the machine talks back using AI (not sentient AI yet mind you just programmed AI) and the person decides if who they are talking to is a computer or not. The fact that people are not an objective measuring stick is probably why he says it's lenient but I'm not sure how else you want to test if a computer can pass as a human or it without using humans. </p></div>		</li>
