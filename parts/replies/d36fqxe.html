			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear fusion is part of a star's definition. A black dwarf is technically a &quot;stellar remnant&quot;, not a star.</p>
<p>But it's not a planet. Part of a planet's definition is that it orbits a star or stellar remnant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are rogue planets not a thing then? I mean, I assume they had to be in an orbit at one point in time for the planetary accretion to occur-but I assumed a rogue planet was &quot;freed&quot; if it survived its sun's supernova. </p>
<p>Or do planets just not survive supernovas? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no reason why a star or stellar remnant cannot orbit a star or stellar remnant.</p>
<p>Bodies exerting gravity on one another have an orbital center that is not the center of either body, so a binary star system is two stars orbiting eachother.  Disproportionate mass would have one being the &quot;dominant&quot; body, and thus fit the definition without ambiguity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black dwarf stars would be held up by electron degeneracy pressure.  Its going to look something a bit more like a &quot;diamond&quot; roughly the mass of the Sun, compressed to the size of the Earth.  Ballpark for the surface gravity would be something like 300,000 times the surface gravity on Earth.  And since it is literally the dead core of a Star, and the object used to sustain fusion reactions, I would argue you really can't call that kind of object a &quot;Planet&quot; by any useful definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitions are pretty arbitrary things, but once interesting version is formation environment. Did your object coalesce out of a more diffuse molecular cloud environment? Then its a star. Did your object form out of an accretion disk surrounding a protostar? Then its a planet.</p>
<p>The problem then is what if you have something that collapsed out of a cloud that's Jupiter mass? Or something that formed out of an accretion disk that's big enough for fusion to occur? Additionally you have to consider that when you see something today, it can be hard to determine whatever the formation environment was.</p>
<p>It's similar to the definition of a planet vs a dwarf planet, we have to draw a line somewhere, even though there is a smooth continuum between the two groups.</p>
<p>edit: I'm talking about the brown dwarf vs star vs planet distinction. Black dwarfs are totally different, but they're the result of an exploded star, placing them firmly outside the bounds of what a planet is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black dwarfs won't ever be cooler than the Cosmic Microwave Background, which is currently about 2.7 kelvins, but the CMB is cooling with the expansion of the universe and we're talking about the distant future anyway, so they'll approach absolute zero in the long term. Although if there's a such thing as proton decay they'll all radiate away at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's put it this way. There is a thing called the Cosmological Decade (C<del>D</del>). It is a computation of the universe's age in terms of exponential years. This means each CD is ten times longer than the previous one. This is useful because the different ages of the universe occur over much larger time scales than the preceding ages. It's like a well-oiled, nearly frictionless flywheel that starts out spinning very fast, but takes a very long time to stop spinning. It spends a lot more time spinning very slowly than it does spinning very fast. The more energy it loses, the longer it takes to make another revolution, and the next revolution will be even longer than the one before it. In the universe too, the older it gets, the longer it will take for anything new and interesting to happen.</p>
<p>Right now we are in C<del>D</del> 10 or so. It has been a little more than 10^10 years since the Big Bang, or to be more specific, 1.37x10^10 years, or 13.7 billion years. The earth has been around 'only' for the last 4 billion years.C<del>D</del> 11 starts at Big Bang + 10^11 (100 billion) years, or 86.3 billion years from now. C<del>D</del> 12 starts at BB + 10^12 (1 trillion) years. At that point, the universe will be almost 73 times older than it is now. Scientists estimate new stars will stop forming between 1 trillion and 100 trillion years after the Big Bang (C<del>D</del> 12 to 14). If the universe makes it to C<del>D</del> 14, it will be nearly 7,300 times as old as it is now.</p>
<p>After 100 trillion years, the universe will have no more free gas or expelled material with which to make any new stars. All the stars that exist by that point will be the most that will ever exist from that point on. They will all go dark after enough time. This is the beginning of the Degenerate Era.</p>
<p>The stars that are left will last at most another 20 trillion years.</p>
<p>In C<del>D</del> 25, the universe will be 10^25 (10 trillion trillion) years old. It will be 800 trillion times older than it is now. By this time, the Sun (if it hasn't fallen into a black hole or collided with another stellar mass) will have cooled off to 5 degrees above absolute zero.</p>
<p>By C<del>D</del> 40 (10^30 years from now), the universe will be almost 8x10^29 (800 thousand trillion trillion) times older than it is now. By this time, all the stellar masses in every galaxy have either fallen into their galaxy's central black hole or been ejected into deep space. Of course, none of the galaxies that exist now will still be around, because on this time scale they are flying around like bullets crashing and merging and ripping each other apart. All the local galaxies (Milky Way, Andromeda, SMC, LMC, etc) will have merged around BB + 460 billion years (C<del>D</del> 11), when the universe was 46x10^30 (46 million trillion trillion) times younger than in C<del>D</del> 40.</p>
<p>In C<del>D</del> 46, the universe will be 10^46 years old. It will be one million times older than it was in C<del>D</del> 40, and nearly 7.3x10^35 (7.3 hundred billion trillion trillion) times older than it is now. This is the earliest estimated point at which all protons in the universe will have decayed. The upper limit for this, if proton decay is real, is C<del>D</del> 53, which will be 10 million times longer than C<del>D</del> 46.</p>
<p>Either way, the completion of proton decay indicates the beginning of the Black Hole Era (in which black holes are the only significant objects left in the universe). The Black Hole Era will last until about C<del>D</del> 106 (Big Bang + 1 million googol years) which is when all black holes will evaporate. Thus begins the Dark Era, and eventual heat death or maybe the Big Rip or another Big Bang, who knows. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A black dwarf will behave like a solid, actually, since it's composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter#Electron_degeneracy" target="_blank">electron degenerate matter</a>.  Their white dwarf progenitors start out in a fluid-like state, but they start crystallising as they cool off, at least if they're carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (which means that they convert into a degenerate latticed state similar to diamond, but <em>much</em> denser).  The pulsating white dwarf <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPM_37093" target="_blank">BPM 37093</a> seems to be about 90% crystalline at this point, going by astroseismology measurements.  There was another WD discovered in the last few years that, IIRC, is cool enough that it should have entirely crystallised by now--I can't remember the name, but it's a binary companion to a neutron star.</p>
<p>Brown dwarfs are also partially electron-degenerate, but not to the extremes of white dwarfs. The degeneracy is confined to their interiors, so their upper layers remain gaseous, even as they cool <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf#Spectral_class_Y" target="_blank">to the point where they stop emitting visible light</a>. The degenerate matter there should be in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen, much like it's thought to be in Jupiter and Saturn's interiors, seeing as how BDs never fuse hydrogen-1 into heavier elements like stars do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Despite the fact that they're still small objects compared to the sun, they're also cold, lacking in the necessary kinetic energy to have the particles more than slightly wriggling along. If you've ever put a balloon in a freezer, the memory should give you an idea of how incredibly <strong>Dense</strong> they are. At that level of gravity, their attraction easily outpaces tensile and compressive strength limits in all known compounds, and even in the smallest dwarfs, it starts to overcome the intermolecular forces. The gravity itself imparts enough kinetic energy to the atoms that make up your craft and body to literally smear you and it into a thin paste across the surface. You almost wouldn't even feel pain, as the molecules responsible for it's receptance and transmission are themselves breaking down at the same time. Assuming you're approaching at freefall speed toward the object, the only pain you'd have a chance to feel would be tidal forces, and that would be microseconds before you hit the surface, if that.</p></div>		</li>
