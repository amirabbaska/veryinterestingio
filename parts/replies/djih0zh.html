			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with TIG, welding aluminium is different from welding steel. You actually have to reverse the polarity of the electrical arc, and you're supposed to change the shape of the tip of the welder from a point to a ball. I'm less than a novice welder, but it really is a different thing with a slightly different skill set. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few small corrections </p>
<ul>
<li>Aluminum oxide forms quickly, in a very thin, basically invisible layer. This layer is unlike the the oxide that forms on steel, which is flaky and porous. Aluminum oxide forms an impermeable layer that prevents further oxidation.</li>
<li>The acetone removes oils from the metal before welding, not aluminum oxide.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of people saying that aluminum oxidizes really easily compared to steel. Why does the weld/welder/me care about that? I'm a plasma physicist, so I don't really understand this as it's not in my field. </p>
<p>EDIT: This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6k10gk/why_was_it_so_much_harder_for_a_welder_to_weld_my/djix22a/" target="_blank">post</a> below answers the question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a place that had both TIG and MIG aluminum welders. The only difference I saw between the mild steel MIG and aluminum MIG was that on the aluminum, the feeder spool was small and actually attached to the 'gun'. The TIG welders were absolute artists with their beads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be done, but is more difficult. It often results in overheating of the alumimum, burning through, and some very ugly welds. Mig welding aluminum can only be done on thicker materials. And indeed you do need a push pull wire feed system and a spool gun. This is to keep the very soft wire from bending and getting tangled. </p></div>		</li>
