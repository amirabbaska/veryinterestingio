			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I was in the trades in my 30's. I felt that I was probably at my strongest around 40. Now, in my mid 50's, I've been lifting for a few years and I'm back baby! I feel strong at 55. Pretty good muscle mass. My grip is still off the charts. Look at someone's forearms for a guess at grip strength. I've got Popeye hooks.</p></div>		</li>
