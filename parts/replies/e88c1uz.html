			<div class="markdown"><p>Across species, big species age more slowly than smaller species. Humans live a bit longer than expected based on mammalian size-longevity curve (but many bat species and naked mole rats are even higher above the average curve) and dogs are about average.</p>
<p>Within species, the trend is the opposite, with large-sized individuals tending to age faster. This is especially noticeable in dogs because there is a &gt;50-fold difference in size (chihuahua vs mastiff) leading to a ~2-fold difference in aging rate.</p>
<p>So dogs age more quickly than humans because they are usually smaller, but that doesn’t really answer the “why do smaller animals age faster” question, or “why do big dogs age faster than small dogs question”, and of course cats tend to be even smaller than dogs and tend to live longer, so clearly there is more at play.</p>
<p>The short answer is that we don’t exactly know the answer. We do know a lot of genes involved in body size (like IGF1) are also involved in aging in both dogs and humans, but it seems unlikely any one pathway is responsible and more likely that the aging rate is a general life history strategy that is optimized to account for different tradeoffs. After all, a dog can be sexually mature within a year of birth and a human takes over a decade, so a faster senescence rate in dogs is to be expected overall. In general, I would not expect such life history traits to be well suited for CRISPR-type interventions because they likely involve a multitude of loci, but then again dogs are surprising for the amount of complex traits that are controlled by just one or a few large-effect loci, so who knows what the future holds. </p>
<p>I do think dogs are uniquely suited to help us understand aging. The intraspecific difference in aging rate is really fascinating, and the ability to study aging in an organism that shares our environment and ages quickly enough that you could do a complete longitudinal study in just a couple grant cycles makes it a pretty compelling area of interest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought life span was more directly related to how fast the organisim matures, with the longest living animals having longer development time in the womb/egg and as adolecents; as opposed to just size. Your second paragraph is much closer to what I've learned but I'm in biotechnology so my perspective is almost entirely based from the viewpoint of DNA and there's probably many factors im missing.</p>
<p>From what I've learned one of the closest factors relating to an extended lifespan is Gene expression (like IGF1) due to DNAmethrlation. Studies have shown that with severe calorie restricted diets can significantly extend the life expectancy of animals and they also showed that the DNA is methelated for longer in the restricted diets as opposed to average diets of the same species. </p>
<p>If ageing is more directly associated with Gene expression then crisper is unlikely to be of much use since it is an interaction of tens or hundreds of genes. This is why we prefer working with bacteria DNA, so much less factors that can play a role. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the moment, Embark is focused on unravelling the connection between shortened longevity (and other life history parameters) and inbreeding in dogs. For example we have a collaboration with the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study to look at the effect on inbreeding on some of their dogs, and spent a great deal of effort refining how inbreeding is optimally measured in dogs (see our <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/07/315770" target="_blank">preprint in the biorXiv</a>). I also have colleagues at U Washington that run the Dog Aging Project and are doing some really exciting work looking at aging interventions (like rapamycin) and how they work in dogs.</p>
<p>We do have a few studies at Embark and Cornell where we are looking at old, healthy dogs. They are exceedingly useful for mapping studies to identify the genes involved in late-onset diseases. Although the immediate goal is for these samples to be used as controls in case-control mapping studies, the longer term goal is to see if there are any genetic (or environmental) similarities between dogs that reach old age in good health and those that succumb early to various age-related disorders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wish I had known this a few months ago. I had a retriever mix that lived to just shy of 16 and other than a benign tumor that started to grow in her later years, she was very healthy! I would have loved to have submitted her DNA (or gotten a clone of her!!) </p></div>		</li>

<p>My dog is going on 19 years old was extremely healthy until she got Cushing’s at 16. Comparatively, she is still very healthy even now. She still runs, plays, and is very vivacious. </p></div>		</li>
