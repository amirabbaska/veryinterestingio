			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is different to what OP is asking as this requires a clue to jog your memory. I sometimes experience a similar thing but without the reminder. The best example of this is when you're leaving a friends house and you are standing at the door, just about to leave and you can feel that you have left something behind. You don't know what so you can't remind yourself but there's a clear feeling that somethings been left behind.</p></div>		</li>
