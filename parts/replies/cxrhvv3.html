			<p>Absolutely. Your body has metabolic limits, you have limits on the resources you can take in through diet. With multiple wounds those resources are split. How split and how much that slows you down depends on all the usual factors - general health and diet primarily. </p>		</li>

			<p>When it comes to diet/nutrition and how it impacts recovery, what are some of the more/most important macro or micronutrients one can ensure one takes to maximize healing efficacy?  Let's say I'm already taking a multivitamin and hitting my normal RDA for macronutrients and micronutrients.  Is there any benefit to increasing supplementation of certain micronutrients?  Is there any benefit to changing my macronutrient split so I incorporate more of one type - say, more protein or fats versus carbs?  And lastly, how does the answer change for the type of injury?  For example, if a muscle is torn, it would seem protein is very important; if a bone is broken, it would seem calcium is very important.</p>		</li>

			<p>OK, hitting the edge of my knowledge here so take the following with a pinch of salt. <br><br>Upping your intake of vitamins and macros can speed your recovery. One pretty famous example is vitamin C can accelerate your recovery from a cold, however that is from a single questionable paper. Certainly upping general intake is a good idea. Your body is performing all it's usual functions + wound repair, so increased intake is almost a no brainier. Subject to common sense. If you have a paper cut doubling your intake is just going to make you fat. <br><br>As for biasing towards a certain type of nutrient, cells need everything. Lipids (fats) make up the cell wall. Proteins make up the machinery. Carbs and fats are burned to put everything in the correct configuration. <br><br>Relating it to the advice from the NHS on donating blood - the 12 weeks between donations isn't to replace the blood, but for your body to replace it's reserves of iron it used replacing the blood. <br><br><a href="http://www.woundcarecenters.org/article/living-with-wounds/how-your-diet-can-aid-in-wound-healing" target="_blank">http://www.woundcarecenters.org/article/living-with-wounds/how-your-diet-can-aid-in-wound-healing</a><br><br><a href="http://www.blood.co.uk/resources/leaflets/male-donation-frequency/" target="_blank">http://www.blood.co.uk/resources/leaflets/male-donation-frequency/</a></p>		</li>

			<p>But depending on what injuries you have, it's likely that your body isn't performing all its usual functions. I mean if you usually jog 5 miles every morning you won't be doing so if you have a broken leg. Having multiple serious injuries is quite likely to reduce the amount of daily activity.

My injury didn't stop my day to day, just made it more painful and less convenient.

			<p>I think the major thing we're forgetting here is that the body has metabolic limits, as well. You can't just up everything and expect maximum efficiency. Everything the liver can't metabolize is seen by the body as excess and excreted through urine or stored in adipose tissue. You should especially be careful with exceeding the recommended intake of fat soluble nutrients because they can become toxic in excess. Upping macro's is generally fine in normal ratios of fat:carbs:proteins.<br><br>Source: bachelors degree health sciences </p>		</li>

			<p>Depending on the food intake, of course you could... but healing bones takes far fewer calories than moving muscles, and it gets difficult to move them with broken bones, so I think it would get more than offset by the reduced mobility.<br><br>Of course you could go the full chop-chop way and just get rid of both hands and legs.

			<p>This is very interesting but I am not so sure of the accuracy of the author given several statements that are currently heavily disputed in the nutritional world (emphasis mine):<br><br>&gt; It is at this time that the patient should be urged to increase his dietary protein to at least three-quarters of a gram of protein per pound of body weight. This author prefers a one-to-one ratio: one gram of protein per pound of body weight for the first 5 to 25 days following the injury, again depending upon the extent of the damage. If possible, the protein should be ingested four to six times a day as opposed to the standard American regimen of three times a day. The reason for the recommended frequency of dosage is that <strong>the body can only metabolize 20 to 35 grams of protein per meal</strong>, and, if the patient is ingesting the recommended high amounts at two or three sittings, much of the dosage will be wasted -- undigested.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're correct, it's pretty outdated and wrong about a couple things. We do know that protein, zinc, vitamin c are still important though, as well as specific amino acids like arginine.

			<p>You're probably right as this was written 25 years ago, and I believe more research is coming out that disputes those protein bioavailability cap numbers.  But regardless, injured tissues generally need more protein available.  Depending on the injury (not including severe burns), I believe its to the tune of 1.4-1.6 g/kg/body weight.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually your wrong.

Fracture healing time really isn't affected by this.

			<p>Absolutely. I recall all the advice from my back injury (seriously, don't text and drive because the next person to crash into me may get murdered) was centred on good diet to provide the nutrients to rebuild and exercise to keep the blood flowing, especially around the wounded area. Really difficult since at first I could barely move my head or lift my arms above my head, never mind go for a run or lift weights. Had to make do with heat packs and physio at first. <br><br>There's also the scar tissue formation. Since my injury was entirely muscular, rather than say getting stabbed, keeping it moving forced it to heal back to muscle rather than forming a ball of scar tissue. In the end it did both, but if I hadn't kept moving early on I wouldn't have full range of motion now. </p>		</li>

			<p>When we talk about healing from cuts, we're, on the most basic level, actually talking about the cells in the area of the injury multiplying to fill in for the missing cells.

			<p>NO. They would all be healing at the same rate.

			<p>Except your body isn't <em>one</em> item being damaged. It's trillions of individual cells. When you're cut in multiple places three separate <em>groups</em> of cells begin healing.<br><br>It is true that you can overload your bodies capacity to heal (i.e. not enough resources to heal at the optimal rate), but that generally takes significant maiming / cell destruction to reach. The most common occurrences of this are full body burn victims.<br><br>If you do hit that rate, there's no predictable manner for healing rates. Say 4 million cells require replacement, but your body only has resources to repair 2.5 million....the first cells to receive those resources will begin replicating to repair the damage, whether they're unified or spread around. Even then, this isn't accounting for surface area (a long thin cut is going to heal much faster, since more cells are exposed to the wound vs a small serrated cut), transport rate, etc.<br><br>It's all very complicated and impossible to predict without a full body simulation, so the simplest answer is &quot;one minor cut will heal at the same rate as the same cut, in triplicate&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think peroxide gets less use because hospitals have a more specific tool at hand.  Like washing out debris you'd do with saline and a basin.  Since you're wondering about how tough cells/tissue are, I'll leave you with this - when doing infected revision orthopedic surgery (patients knee replacement got infected, needs to be pulled out, infection killed, then reimplanted later) lately we started using bleach. Pull the metal out, do all the washing like usual, then pour in the Daikens Solution (10% bleach 90% saline) and let it sit in the wound for ~3m.   Also, ivory soap works better as a scrubbed topical antibacterial than any pharmacutical version that costs 100x as much. (notice I said topical antibacterial scrub. v specific).  Lots of simple stuff works really well. </p>		</li>
