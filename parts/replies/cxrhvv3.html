			<div class="markdown"><p>What if the damage is serious and massive?  Not a paper cut (I hope) but say broken bones.  Say it takes someone two months to heal a broken rib; what if they break ten ribs and both legs?  Would it take longer for the ribs to heal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Your body has metabolic limits, you have limits on the resources you can take in through diet. With multiple wounds those resources are split. How split and how much that slows you down depends on all the usual factors - general health and diet primarily. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to diet/nutrition and how it impacts recovery, what are some of the more/most important macro or micronutrients one can ensure one takes to maximize healing efficacy?  Let's say I'm already taking a multivitamin and hitting my normal RDA for macronutrients and micronutrients.  Is there any benefit to increasing supplementation of certain micronutrients?  Is there any benefit to changing my macronutrient split so I incorporate more of one type - say, more protein or fats versus carbs?  And lastly, how does the answer change for the type of injury?  For example, if a muscle is torn, it would seem protein is very important; if a bone is broken, it would seem calcium is very important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually your wrong.  Yes your body does have metabolic limits, but it's been my experience as an orthopaedic surgeon, who's done a lot of trauma, that this isn't the case - at least for fracture healing.  Fracture healing time really isn't affected by this.  Why, because when people have multiple injuries, they tend to move around less thus consuming less energy, and their muscle, fat and other nutrient resources are utilized  as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But would one cut (identical to the 3) alone heal faster than 3 identical ones (that heal at the same rate) as the bodies healing resources would only have one location to worry about instead of 3. I dont think he was asking if they would heal at the same rate but would less injuries heal faster than more injuries since the healing resources have less diversions. </p>
<p>You gave good info but I dont think you interpreted the question correctly. :) hope the above cleared it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we talk about healing from cuts, we're, on the most basic level, actually talking about the cells in the area of the injury multiplying to fill in for the missing cells. So the response is mostly local and unless the injuries are so big that they use too much nutrients from blood, don't affect healing on another area of the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NO. They would all be healing at the same rate. The rate limiting step would be the amount of collagen, cofactors (like Vit C/zinc/growth factors, enzymes, etc.), and cellular entities (Neutrophils, platelets, fibroblasts, etc.) to lay down the necessary components to initiate the wound healing by primary and secondary intention as has been described already in the comments. </p>
<p>TL;DR As long as you have the components for wound healing, your immune system is healthy, and your body isn't overwhelmed with massive tissue destruction, 3 separate wounds would heal at a very comparable rate as 1 wound alone.
Edit: Grammatical error. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except your body isn't <em>one</em> item being damaged. It's trillions of individual cells. When you're cut in multiple places three separate <em>groups</em> of cells begin healing.</p>
<p>It is true that you can overload your bodies capacity to heal (i.e. not enough resources to heal at the optimal rate), but that generally takes significant maiming / cell destruction to reach. The most common occurrences of this are full body burn victims.</p>
<p>If you do hit that rate, there's no predictable manner for healing rates. Say 4 million cells require replacement, but your body only has resources to repair 2.5 million....the first cells to receive those resources will begin replicating to repair the damage, whether they're unified or spread around. Even then, this isn't accounting for surface area (a long thin cut is going to heal much faster, since more cells are exposed to the wound vs a small serrated cut), transport rate, etc.</p>
<p>It's all very complicated and impossible to predict without a full body simulation, so the simplest answer is &quot;one minor cut will heal at the same rate as the same cut, in triplicate&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question!
Does the application of an antiseptic and antibiotic (i.e. peroxide and neosporin) decrease the time that the body spends sterilizing the wound, effectively healing faster? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some antiseptics disrupt the cells doing the healing, especially when used excessively (ie washing a wound with antiseptic at the beginning is sensible, vs washing the healing wound three times a day, which just harms the cells trying to heal your wound).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard hospitals in the US have stopped using peroxide because it actually causes lacerations in the wound. I was told its only used when debris need to be &quot;lifted&quot; out of a wound for example eating shit hard on asphalt to the point your wound in impacted with dirt/rocks.</p>
<p>What part of these statements are true?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well peroxide actually damages cells it comes in contact with so I wouldn't advise it and neosporin is more of a barrier than what you are thinking of as sterilization. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no. peroxide is toxic to tissues and the body doesn't 'sterilize' the wound. neosporin is worthless. in the event you need a topical antibiotic ointment, Bactroban (mupirocin) is the way to go.  In fact it is used to eliminate carriage of MRSA. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not useless, but is not as effective as many think and doesn't cover the full spectrum. Mupirocin is sweet because of its effects with MRSA, but generally isn't needed as an every day ointment </p></div>		</li>
