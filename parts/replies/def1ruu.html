			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy" target="_blank">color constancy</a>. You could replace the strawberries in the picture with plastic balls and they would still look red because we are adjusting for the lighting, not (only) using knowledge or strawberries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing about the checkershadow illusion is that it actually shows the success, rather than the failings, of the visual system - that's what its discoverer Ted Adelson says at least.</p>
<p>His argument is that the purpose of the visual system is to come up with meaningful perceptions, rather than simply to act as a light-meter - if it was a real checkerboard then tile A is darker than tile B, and that's what we need to know to distinguish objects/detect edges etc under varying lighting levels. Being able to detect objects in our environment is obviously vital, and indeed that's why we have colour constancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, except that was a more ambiguous situation. Here almost everyone sees the strawberries as red, but the amazing thing about the dress is that some people saw it one way and others saw it another, and that split was about 50/50 in the population. Vision scientists think this might be something about the prior experience you have with different light types that biases people in different ways, but last I checked they hadn't figured out exactly what drove the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a similar phenomenon.</p>
<p>Your brain knows that white things can look blue-ish when they're in shadow. Your brain also knows that dark things can look gold-ish when they're in bright sunlight. In the photo of the dress, it is obviously a sunny day, but it's not clear if the dress is in shadow or in the light.</p>
<p>The actual pixels of the dress are blue and gold, which you can verify with an eyedropper tool. If you think the dress is in shadow, your brain compensates by lightening the blue to white, and the dress looks white and gold. If you think the dress is in bright sunlight, your brain compensates by darkening the gold to black, and the dress looks blue and black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the same reason why there was a blue/black vs. white/gold debate about that famous dress that went viral a few years back.</p>
<p>The dress was blue and black, but the (yellow?) lighting in the picture turned the pixels white and gold. The picture was taken in such a way as to put it right on the cusp, so some peoples' brains were filtering out the lighting and seeing it as blue and black. Whereas others were seeing just the pixels and their brain didn't do the math for them, so they saw white/gold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally the room was lit in such a way and combined with the flash it could be viewed two ways. The most common adjustment we're used to is seeing a light object under a shadow, and that is white/gold lookers perceived the dress. It looked like it was being shadowed in a brightly lit room. The blue/black lookers interpreted the camera flash as to having flushed out all the color and applying a yellow filter to everything. By changing perspective between the literal pixels and an adjusted perception of the flash, one could see it both ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely perceived it (and until now thought) it is a blue and black dress shadowed from an incorrectly white balanced photo or yellow hour. Never thought about a flash giving it a yellow tint (that also seems like bollocks, flash doesn't make things yellow. Most flashes are white or slightly blue, never seen a yellow flash the helL?) And yet I can't make myself see it white and gold no matter how I try or what I think about...</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>In many ways, it doesn't just seem to. When you're 4 years old, 1 year = 25% of your life. When you're 20, 1 year = 5%. It actually makes sense that every year is shorter, because proportionally it is.</p>
<p>Edit: Thinking about it, it actually parallels the image that OP posted really well. We perceive colours in relation to the colours that we know (around them). In a similar way, we perceive time in relation to what we know (time we've already experienced). So, every moment of time we experience in the future is slightly shorter as a proportion of every other moment we've already experienced. If that makes sense. Which it did in my mind before I tried to type it out. Now I'm confused. I think I should get off the internet at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that's because of temporal constancy. It's an example of subjective constancy and a feature of the human time perception system which ensures that the perceived span of time remains relatively constant under varying temporal conditions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try zooming in using photoshop. Each pixel on the strawberry is grey. The green contrast next to the grey causes your eye to over compensate and see the image with an equal amount of red to try and correct the white balance. </p></div>		</li>
