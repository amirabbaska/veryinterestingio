			<div class="markdown"><p>Simpsons didn't actually start out that way. True, Homer has always been schlubby looking, but if you go back to very early episodes he's actually the one trying to rein in his crazy family, including Marge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair. To clarify, I don't think the theory is perfect (and I didn't think of it, so don't want all the credit/blame).  There are definitely things it doesn't fit. </p>
<p>But, if I were inclined to defend the theory, I'd say that the problem with using those as examples is that they are deliberate spoofs of the classic sitcom format. The Simpsons is just the Flintstones in the modern day, and the Flintstones were basically just the Honeymooners in the Stone Age. Family guy is, itself, sort of a meaner, dirtier take on the Simpsons. </p>
<p>Honestly, the one that sticks out as inconsistent to me is the Dick Van Dyke show, which is a classic with a goofy (but damn attractive) husband, and a long-suffering, beautiful wife.  Honestly not familiar enough with the show to really know how much it goes against, though. </p></div>		</li>
