			<div class="markdown"><p>You can still be dehydrated without any obvious symptoms like the ones described. Hunger becomes much more noticeable long before it's a health concern, unless you have diabetes or something.</p>
<p>It's still a good question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thirst is a good enough indicator for most people. Special care might need to be taken if you are in a warmer climate than usual but the sense of thirst is well developed, enough though the Coca Cola company would like to have us think otherwise (&quot;stay hydrated&quot; anyone?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what most people don't realize is that you can get a lot of hydration from your food alone. It's not exactly enough to not have to drink, but if you have access to food (especially moist food, obviously), you also have access to a source of hydration.</p></div>		</li>
