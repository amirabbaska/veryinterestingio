			<div class="markdown"><p>The so-called laser broom has been forwarded as an idea. One way to make it work faster is to turn up the power until you are vaporizing the surface of the object on a side; this produces thrust. It may also be possible to run such a system from the ground, so you can even avoid launch costs. Either way there is still a problem of object detection however. </p></div>		</li>
