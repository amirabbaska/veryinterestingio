<p>Also most popular recreational drugs increase dopamine levels so there is that option too, but with unpleasant side effects as well. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that is that dopamine itself doesn't cross the blood brain barrier.
You have its precursor L-DOPA which is a drug typically given to sufferers of Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>Also be aware that an abundance of dopamine can cause some pretty bad side effects, the main ones being schizoid; and norepinephrine imbalance, as dopamine is first and foremost a regulatory neurotransmitter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, while dopamine itself does not cross the blood-brain-barrier, L-DOPA, dopamine's precursor, does. L-DOPA is typically given with Carbidopa, a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor. Normally the vast majority of the dopamine given IV (PO dopamine gets digested by the enzymes in your stomach before absorption) is metabolized by the above enzyme in the periphery before even making it to the blood-brain-barrier. In fact, dopamine itself given IV is usually used as a pressor in cardiac situations like shock or heart failure. If given dopamine alone to produce a level of high, you would probably suffer an arrhythmia before you even feel a slight buzz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup this is the &quot;correct&quot; answer to OP though may not be what he was really asking. </p>
<p>You could potentially inject dopamine into the spine but I doubt anyone has volunteered for that </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Working out does increase dopamine and can even create euphoria. Exercise induced euphoria is well observed in runners. Once you get past the initial hurdle working out can be extremely enjoyable. Yes dopaminergic substances will make these activities more enjoyable as well while the substance is in your system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually without any drugs at all you can do this. Simply by doing an activity reliably for a certain amount of time (typically 3 months) you actually train your brain with your natural dopamine to like those activities.</p>
<p>Your brain basically goes, &quot;I keep doing this so I must like it. I should release dopamine to ensure that I keep liking this activity.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
