			<div class="markdown"><p>if it is minor corrections by the rider that keep the bike upright, what happens when the rider comes off the bike and the bike continues riderless? Bikes can go for quite a while like that - certainly longer than it would remain upright if it were left unsupported while stationary.</p>
<p>It seems like there is some inherent mechanism that tends to keep the bike upright</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bike 's construction makes it correct itself like riding with no hands. If you lean in a direction on a bike, it steers that way. So if the center of gravity (the broom) leans left, the bike's front wheel (the hand) steers left and so keeps underneath the center of gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thinking is: if the bike tilts to the left, the front wheel turns/falls to the left too, but a bit more. This pulls the centreâ€‹ of gravity back under the bike, maybe even overshooting it slightly, which causes the same thing in the other direction, averaging out to roughly straight.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that when you're riding a bike, to turn left you must actually turn the steering right very slightly to cause the left lean to start. (This is called countersteer, and is why it's so hard to get a bike out away from being hard against a curb.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think similarly - if the bike turns slightly left, centrifugal (centripetal? I always forget the difference!) force counteracts the turn and rights the bike. Point being, it is not manual corrections that keep the bike upright - it is inherent to the bikes behaviour.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I have heard this before, and while it makes sense, I tend to think that it is more a case of shifting weight that rolls the tyres onto the edge, and hence initiates the turn. It is the conical nature of the sides of the tyre that causes the bike to turn, not the angle of the wheel. The wheel steers to follow the turn, not the other way around. The steering on a bike is entirely different to the steering on a car</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your source does not back up your statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the broom example, where you have to think in order to push the handle under the center of gravity, the bicycle does this for you automatically. If the bicycle starts to fall over to the left, the front wheel steers left and the bicycle drives its wheels under the overall center of gravity. The bicycle returns to upright all by itself, even when you have no hands on the handlebars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason that the bike is stable is that when it leans left it steers left which applies a force that rights the bike and causes it to be stable. The wheel turns because the center of mass of the front assembly is lower than the center of mass of the rear assembly, this causes the front to fall a bit faster than the back which adds a force to the front wheel in the direction it's falling, turning it that direction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>...and since there is <strong>no force</strong> on the center of mass (i.e. the rider) the rider will continue going straight.  Since the rider started to the left of center (i.e. leaning left) but is now going straight while the bike is going left, the bike drives back under the rider by going left. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that I follow. This works whether there is a rider or not, it doesn't matter. There would also still be a force on the rider. If the bike is leaning the center of mass is falling in that direction. </p>
<p>If the center of mass is even slightly off it starts to fall. The bottom of the tires is the fulcrum point, gravity pulls down on the mass but the forces into the ground are at the angle that the bike leans causing a net force pushing the bike and rider in the direction the bike is leaning.</p></div>		</li>
