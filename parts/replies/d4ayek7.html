			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, seeing that graph really puts it in perspective. Didn't realise that Netflix was getting screwed over so hard by the major ISPs. This ruling sounds like a great thing to happen, especially for Netflix and its users!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's really scary is that conceivably, they could do that with literally any website.  Thinking about switch services from Comcast to Google Fiber?  Well...for some reason whenever you go to the <a href="https://fiber.google.com/about/" target="_blank">Google Fiber</a> info page, it won't load.  Or, maybe Comcast partners with Microsoft, and Bing loads <em>really super fast</em> but Google seems really...sluggish, so yeah you'll just use Bing.</p>
<p>Netflix is just a perfect example, though, because they could then charge you money for a &quot;fast lane&quot; that would make your streaming service run &quot;better&quot; with Netflix.  So you have to subscribe to Netflix, which makes sense, and you have to pay Comcast for internet, which makes sense...but then Netflix has to pay Comcast for <em>your</em> internet service, <em>and</em> you have to pay Comcast <del>for Netflix to work at all</del> for &quot;improved service&quot;.  Comcast gets paid <em>three times</em> for your access to Netflix.  So in order to make money, then Netflix has to increase their subscription so they can pay Comcast's <del>protection money</del> additional service fee, so your subscription goes up to $15/month, and then you have to pay your additional fee so $35/month, plus whatever you already pay for cable...Ooooooorrrr you could just go with Xfinity for an extra $15 to your cable/internet/phone bundle!</p></div>		</li>

<p>ISP: &quot;Nice service you have there, Netflix / (insert new innovative startup). Shame if anything happened to it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
