			<div class="markdown"><p>I just found this paper in which researchers used transmagnetic stimulation to noninvasively induce sleep spindles in patients and improve sleep. This is amazing</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have one question, there are some sites (like mynoise) who claim they can create sound frequencies that can stimulate certain brainwave. Would there be some kind of background noise like that can make you less sensitive to other environment noises, even at low volumes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This theory of sleep spindles is not about sound .... you don't hear the sounds associated with sleep spindles .... your brain perceives patterns written on these ulta low frequency waves .... it's the pattern that our brain  is sensitive to and needs to hear for good sleep according to this robust theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive my ignorance, but isn’t 11-15 Hz below the threshold of human hearing? I just don’t understand how the spindles would “cover” other noises if humans can’t detect the spindles in the first place? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot; The sleep spindle is a thalamocortical rhythm manifested on the EEG as a brief 11–15 Hz oscillation&quot;. It's an electrical signal, not a sound.</p></div>		</li>
