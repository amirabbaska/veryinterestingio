			<div class="markdown"><p>it also applies to most of the human microbiomes. Your gut is full of e. coli, but only the strains that don't make you sick. The introduction of other types of bacteria or other strains of e. coli have to overcome competition from existing bacteria before they can spread effectively as an infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a segment in “defense of food” about this. Human breasmilk contains an oligosaccharide that babies are unable to digest. Turns out there is only one bacteria found so far that is able to digest it. This bacteria will coat the inside of the baby’s gut which prevents pathogens from colonizing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why taking a ton of antibiotics for an extended period puts you at risk of c.diff, a spore that already exists in your gut but can cause painful colitis when there isn't a bunch of other flora/bacteria to compete with. </p>
<p>It's become depressingly common in hospitals among older folks stuck taking IV antibiotics for some infection, then &quot;catching&quot; c.diff and having to stay another week or more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also applies to beer making. </p>
<p>The sweet wort (unfermented beer) is just a sugar solution which would be ripe for spoilage. Introducing yeast after the boil allows it to have a head start over the faster growing bacteria that would spoil the wort. Once the yeast bringing fermentation, sugar concentration drops and alcohol concentration increases, making it less friendly to pathogens</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only does it get a head start, it is pitched at an outrageously high cell count. It is very uncommon for any other bacteria to take over until the fermentation of the original pitch has subsided as commercial strains typically leave a fair amount of sugar and nutrients.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The cheesemaking tradition is so old that I doubt that this has been done intentionally, most likely a happy accident, to have good mold entering in the cheese and making it better. For sure afterwards people did it intentionally but not the first time </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the modern prejudice comes from the fact that if they didn't know the why, they couldn't have figured out the how. The key of course is that these techniques were built and refined over countless generations.

			<div class="markdown"><p>well sure. after the first time someone discovered that moldy cheese could be alright to eat, but only sometimes since certain species of mold are very toxic, they started taking chunks of the mold off of previous cheeses and using it to innoculate the new cheese, because they knew that there were good molds and bad molds. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They bake a loaf of bread until it is black on the outside. Then it is left to go mouldy. They take the hollow black loaf into the middle of the <em>cave</em> and smash it. Mould spores fill the room... getting into the cheese... and making it into food of the gods.</p></div>		</li>
