<p>No, a computer cannot perfectly simulate itself in addition to something else without violating basic information theory: there exist strings which are not compressible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an extremely important lesson to learn.  One of the most profound lessons in computer science is to know that no compression algorithms always compress all data -- some executions of the algorithm must create larger data instead.  You can't keep compressing to a .tar/.gz or .zip and expect to get a smaller file every time.  The math behind the application becomes revealed and our understanding becomes more clear.</p>
