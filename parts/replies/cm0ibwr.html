			<div class="markdown"><p>It's incredible to me to think that this comet was on its way since Earth became earth. Before the first chemical reactions that led to life. </p>
<p>This comet just was on its way for probably billions of years. Every thing that ever happened on earth and with earth happened in that time. </p>
<p>And now, we see it. Perceive it, measure it, get knowledge and meaning from it. </p>
<p>Breathtaking </p></div>		</li>

<p>This morning I was sitting at my tech support job, watching live images transmitted by a box of melted sand and metal that works by flicking the power on and off really fast, of people on the other side of the planet telling me about this little chunk of melted special rocks that they launched with a giant tube of explosives when I was in third grade, that is <em>just now</em> landing on a giant chunk of rock unimaginably far away, which will then transmit images through a vacuum so that we can see that rock up close, all because one day a pink monkey wondered where it came from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comet is not &quot;on it's way&quot; as you say. It's not headed anywhere it's just in orbit like any other object, like the planets but smaller. It's just there, going around in ~circles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comet was created in the early days of our solar system and it pretty much hasn't been altered since then. The structure and composition are like ancient fossils. We might learn something about water, and that's very important knowledge, considering the habitat in which we humans find ourselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at oxygen isotope ratios can help inform the debate if earth's water came from comets crashing into us or if it was already present in the forming earth. Also, how useful comets might be for future long term space missions as sources of water and fuel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're going to look at chemical compositions. </p>
<p>So for example maybe there will be signs of water, and signs of organic reactants that might lend to the theory that life was brought to earth from elsewhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantity and composition will be different than on Earth. That will give us clues as to the initial conditions under which life developed and possibly how we've changed it since then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a theory that comets hold the keys to life on earth.  They may contain the molecules needed to produce amino acids (the building blocks of life) upon impact with the earth during it's initial creation.  They may also have delivered up to 50% of the water on earth today.  This mission could help pave the way to understanding how life on earth started.</p></div>		</li>
