<p>What would be a better shape? I'd assume either a circle, or a triangle. I'm guessing a triangle has the advantage over a square that a third rather than a qaurter of the troops can defend in any given direction.</p>
<p>Or would we want something like a star shape?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'points' of the star shape would be extremely vulnerable.  However, you'll notice that fixed fortifications were often designed in star shapes because they forced attackers into narrow arrows where they could be attacked from two walls.</p>
<p>A circle would probably be the ideal shape, since you could have an entire half of the circle direct fire on any incoming vector.  But it would be fairly hard to get infantrymen to form up a circle and your infantrymen would have to swivel to face the incoming attacker as opposed to already facing them.</p></div>		</li>
