			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that because of common name recognition? As in people just have always called it Downs Syndrome, so it stuck? </p>
<p>Someone mentioned AIDS above, and said it was a disease now but they didn't change the name. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of AIDS, you are correct. It really was a syndrome when it started, and now it is a disease, although the name was not changed because everyone is familiar with the old syndrome name. With respect to Down's syndrome, I don't know the history.
EDIT: OK, I looked up the history, which confirms that Down's was a syndrome when it started, and now it is a disease, but the name did not change to reflect the change in status. &quot;Down syndrome gets its name from the British doctor, John Langdon Down, who first clinically identified the condition in 1866. The actual chromosomal nature of Down syndrome did not become documented until 1959 by Dr. Lejeune. However, Down's name remains associated with condition.&quot; From the Down's Syndrome Association of Central Oklahoma website.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Autism cases are rife with these kinds of contradictions, if you want to drive yourself crazy looking through them.  Aspergers is a syndrome, although it's now also being included in the autism spectrum disorder.   Although people are debating whether autism itself should be labeled a syndrome, since it could have a number of causes, including diseases and/or genetic disorders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AIDS is still a syndrome because it is a collection of symptoms. The underlying cause is known to be the disease HIV, but if the disease is treated, the syndrome won't happen.</p>
<p>Most HIV people don't have AIDS, because they don't display that set of symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely right, but I left that out for ease of explanation. The point I was making is true irrespective of that.</p>
<p>Edit: And furthermore, the etiology is always genetic, even if there are variations in the precise cytogenetics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a disorder is not understood fully, how would one distinguish between a disorder and a syndrome? Both would appear to be a set of symptoms, which may correspond to any number of diseases we discover in the future. How can we then even speak of a disorder if we don't know for sure that it corresponds to a single as-yet-undiscovered disease?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A <em>syndrome</em> is a collection of symptoms and the cause of those symptoms is not understood. So when AIDS began, it was named Acquired Immunodeficiency <em>Syndrome</em>, because the patients had a lot of the same symptoms, but nobody was sure that they all had the same underlying physiology. Today, it's understood that those patients have all been infected with the HIV virus, which causes the symptoms. So AIDS is now, technically, a disease, although the name didn't change. </p></div>		</li>
