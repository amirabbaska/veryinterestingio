			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, there is a book called &quot;The Ghost Map&quot; that traces Dr. John Snow's quest to find the source of a major cholera outbreak in London in the 1800s. It details exactly why his ideas of tracing patient zero were both revolutionary and practical, and they helped to contain an outbreak of one of the deadliest  diseases in the world. I highly recommend it, if anyone is interested in learning more about why epidemiology is an important field today. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He is considered the father of epidemiology (and a significant figure in public health).  But his disabling of the pump was likely too late to have any effect on that particular outbreak:</p>

<p>Still, it's a major milestone in science and his map of the deaths in the neighborhood is one of the most significant in history.  His name came up on the first day of my public health class.</p>
<p>There are a couple of good tv documentaries that you can find on youtube if you want to learn a lot in an hour.</p>
<p>He died without being certain what caused cholera, (he figured out it was something to do with the water but didn't know about the bacteria), but at least his ideas were way better than the &quot;miasma&quot; theory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you've ever gone to a convention or conference, you're probably aware of the phenomenon known as &quot;concrud&quot; or &quot;confluenza&quot; or something else.  This is an illness that gets transmitted through a good portion of the people at the convention, and which has an incubation period of a few hours to a few days.</p>
<p>I'd had the idea that it might be a good thing to use social media to find people who complained about feeling ill in the few days leading up to a convention that they were going to, and then following that up with tracking what other social media users who went to the same event later complained about coming down with something.  This could help to identify the economic impact of convention-transmitted illness, as well as provide a practice bed for Big Data algorithms to identify affected people.</p>
<p>But I'm not an epidemiologist, and it wouldn't surprise me if I learned that other people have already come up with this idea.</p></div>		</li>
