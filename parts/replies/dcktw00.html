			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, there is no way to produce a perfect sphere, so even though to us it may look like one, it almost certainly has tiny imperfections which could, presumably, cause noise.</p>
<p>Of course, the kilogram is the exception to that, though I'm not sure that is actually a perfect sphere or &quot;as close as humanly possible&quot; to one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw on a documentary that if you equate that kg sphere to the size of the earth, the difference between the tallest peak and deepest valley is only like 20 meters in elevation. That's pretty damn near close to a perfect sphere  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Even though a bowling ball seems pretty round it's far from a perfect sphere. Tons of tiny impacts make the sound. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather than imperfections in the sphere I'd say it's mostly due to imperfections in the surface the sphere is rolling on, causing it to move up and down a bit so surface vibrates, producing a noise. </p>
<p>It's a combination of both of course, but the more perfect both the surface and the ball is, the less noise you will hear. They can never be completely perfect because at the end they are made of atoms, but I believe a solid metal sphere rolling on a thick solid metal surface actually makes very little noise. The thinner the surface the more it can vibrate due to the rolling ball, producing more noise, even if the surface is just as flat.</p></div>		</li>
