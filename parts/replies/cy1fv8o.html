			<p>Well, that is almost exactly what I was going to say.  I'll just add that the (unfamiliar) equation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 is valid for both massive and massless particles.  For the photon, it simplifies to E = pc (momentum times speed of light.) <br><br>For a massive particle, if the first term is must less than the second, a first order approximation returns E = mc^2 + 0.5*mv^2 which is rest/mass energy plus traditional kinetic energy. </p>		</li>

			<p>They do! The expansion is not exact, taking it to first order is an approximation.

			<p>Nah, hyperfine splitting comes from up and down spins having different energies in a magnetic field.  So the smallest transition for an atom is to change spins.  That's why we some people look for hyperfine transmissions in space; people think other life that knows about atoms would use this transition to send a signal!  <br><br>They even put this fundamental transition on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record#/media/File:The_Sounds_of_Earth_Record_Cover_-_GPN-2000-001978.jpg" target="_blank">voyager</a> (bottom right) as a way to explain fundamental distances and times!

			<p>It's caused by the interaction of spins between the proton's and electron's spins. While the magnetic field felt by the electron depends on the position which is affected by the momentum correction, the correction would be miniscule for 3^rd order. Hyperfine without momentum corrections is already small enough. So it affects, but that's splitting hairs at that point. The main cause is spin spin interaction, not Relativity, so it's not really given by third order Relativity corrections</p>		</li>

			<p>The v^4 term, although it would be expressed as p^4, is used when you must account for special relativity. For example, an electron orbiting the Hydrogen atom doesn't behave entirely classically and the extra precision from the Taylor expansion is used to estimate the fine structure of Hydrogen's energy levels. This process is commonly called the relativistic correction.</p>		</li>

			<p>Pretty much. Energy isn't invariant under velocity transformations; this is true if you're just talking about kinetic energy in classical physics too.<br><br>If you get into the maths of special relativity, the important quantity is the energy-momentum 4-vector. The length of the energy-momentum vector is the same in all velocity frames, as is the sum of all energy-momentum 4-vectors. Since the length of this vector is the rest mass, this is basically the same as the conservation of mass.</p>		</li>

			<p>E=pc=hf, p is momentum, c is speed of light, h is a universal constant, f is the frequency of light. 0 momentum means 0 cycles/second frequency, meaning that your photon has a wavelength of infinity. Basically it's an impossibly low energy radio wave.</p>		</li>

			<p>Interesting! Would the velocity of the zero - energy photon still be the speed of light, or it would the photon slow down? <br><br>Also, how can you calculate the momentum of a photon? You can't use p = mv, because photons don't have any mass, and the momentum would always be equel to 0, which doesn't make any sense.

			<p>Well, infinite wavelength ~ zero frequency would correspond to a DC electric an/or magnetic field.  Both of these are acceptable solutions to Maxwell's, are physically realizable (just not in free space), and require no energy to maintain, which is consistent with zero energy.</p>		</li>

			<p>Pretty much everything you learned in basic physics turns out to be approximations that work very well in ordinary life. So yes, for objects with mass that are moving slowly p=mv. (Projectile motion is another example; if the earth were actually flat projectiles would move along parabolas. It isn't, so they actually follow ellipses. Close enough.)<br><br>If you know the Planck-Einstien relation (energy of a photon is the planck constant times frequency) and the full expression for energy that /u/fishify provided, you can solve for momentum. The expression you get is the same as the de Broglie wavelength of a massive particle: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave</a></p>		</li>

			<p>You are thinking of p=mv, which only applies to non-relativistic particles (i.e. that move much slower than the speed of light).  In general, the momentum of something depends on the total energy of the particle and it's rest mass as shown in the equation E^(2)=p^(2)c^(2) + m^(2)c^(4) mentioned by the others in this thread.  For a particle like a photon, which has no rest mass, that equation simplifies to E=pc . The energy of a photon is given by its frequency, f, as E=hf, where h is Planck's constant. So the momentum of a photon is p=hf/c (this tells us for example that blue light has more momentum than red light).</p>		</li>

			<p>To actually calculate momentum follow the advice of the other responses.<br><br>If you're just wondering a formula for momenta that's not the standard p=mv which would obviously be zero if m equals zero, here's where we learn that p = mv only works at low velocities relative to the speed of light. The full expression is p = gamma<em>m</em>v, and gamma approaches 1/0 as the speed v approaches c. Massless particles must travel at the speed of light, so for massless particles we find p = (1/0)<em>0</em>c. (Please note I'm kind of abusing notation here - physicists and mathematicians wouldn't want to talk about momentum of a massless particle this way because it's not helpful for solving equations or anything, it's purely helpful conceptually - also writing 1/0 just doesn't really make sense so that's a pretty silly abuse of notation) Anyway, (1/0)*0 or simply 0/0 is indeterminate. Which means we don't know it's value (as in it could theoretically take any value - well sort of at least, don't take that statement too seriously but it means that momentum could have an actual nonzero value). So we find that momentum for a massless particle isn't actually zero.<br><br>Through other experiments and derivations we find that the momentum of a photon is related to its wavelength, but that's another issue.</p>		</li>
