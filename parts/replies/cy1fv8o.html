			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that is almost exactly what I was going to say.  I'll just add that the (unfamiliar) equation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 is valid for both massive and massless particles.  For the photon, it simplifies to E = pc (momentum times speed of light.) </p>
<p>For a massive particle, if the first term is must less than the second, a first order approximation returns E = mc^2 + 0.5*mv^2 which is rest/mass energy plus traditional kinetic energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking E^2 = p^(2)c^2 + m^(2)c^(4) and factoring out the m^(2)c^(4) term yields:</p>
<p>E^2 = m^(2)c^(4)( 1 + p^(2)c^(2)/m^(2)c^(4))</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>E = mc^(2)(1 + p^(2)c^(2)/m^(2)c^(4))^(1/2)</p>
<p>To first order, the taylor expansion of (1 + x)^(1/2) ≈ 1 + x/2 for very small x, so we have:</p>
<p>E ≈ mc^(2)(1 + p^(2)c^(2)/2m^(2)c^(4))</p>
<p>E ≈ mc^(2) + p^(2)c^(2)/2mc^(2)</p>
<p>E ≈ mc^(2) + p^(2)/2m</p>
<p>Since p = mv: </p>
<p>E ≈ mc^(2) + m^(2)v^(2)/2m</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please help me understand this part: E = mc^2 + 0.5*mv^2</p>
<p>Since velocity is relative, how does this calculate out?  If a fast moving object is annihilated, would it seem to release less energy if I observed it while moving at the same velocity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Energy isn't invariant under velocity transformations; this is true if you're just talking about kinetic energy in classical physics too.</p>
<p>If you get into the maths of special relativity, the important quantity is the energy-momentum 4-vector. The length of the energy-momentum vector is the same in all velocity frames, as is the sum of all energy-momentum 4-vectors. Since the length of this vector is the rest mass, this is basically the same as the conservation of mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>E=pc=hf, p is momentum, c is speed of light, h is a universal constant, f is the frequency of light. 0 momentum means 0 cycles/second frequency, meaning that your photon has a wavelength of infinity. Basically it's an impossibly low energy radio wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! Would the velocity of the zero - energy photon still be the speed of light, or it would the photon slow down? </p>
<p>Also, how can you calculate the momentum of a photon? You can't use p = mv, because photons don't have any mass, and the momentum would always be equel to 0, which doesn't make any sense. Could you use the fact that (for a massless particle)
p = (hf)/c?</p></div>		</li>
