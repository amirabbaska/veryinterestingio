			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought ice isn't slippery. It get slippery because when you step with your warmer shoe on it, the top layer melts and creates a little pool of water on top of ice right under your shoe, causing you to slip. My source was some video of Richard Feynman on youtube, I remember I was looking for an ELI5 of electromagnetism (Richard Feynman is kind of the founder of ELI5) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s some info about this in another thread of this conversation.  It turns out this is not very settled science.  It isn’t the heat from your shoe, it’s the heat from the friction and pressure.  This get’s to a point of semantics in sayin that a property of water ice is that the top few molecules of a mass of it will liquify with friction causing a very low friction coefficient before immediately re-freezing.  Ice isn’t slick, until you try to slide something on it, then it’s very slick but not ice anymore, but only while you slide something on it because when you are done it turns back into ice and is no longer slick.  If it is how ice always behaves and it turns back into ice when done, then is slick or not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can easily see this being at least part of the case, but ice still has some seemingly slick properties like being smooth, shiny, and relatively uniform. Surely it’s a combination?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe they've proven it by trying it with really cold ice. If it were cold enough, the friction wouldn't be enough to melt it right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the reply. I agree with the friction of the shoe, thats a more reasonable explanation. But why don't birds slip when the walk on the ice? I guess they don't create as much friction as we do, so ice only behaves slippery when there is the right amount of friction is added, so I don't agree by claiming ice is slippery because human shoes causes the friction which makes it slippery. </p></div>		</li>
