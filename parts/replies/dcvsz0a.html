			<div class="markdown"><p>With no blood supply the inflammation and redness will begin to subside.  As the skin desiccates (dries out and contracts) the pore may even open up and resolve the source of the irritation in the first place.</p>
<p>So, the pore blockage may go away and the skin certainly stops responding to the blockage, so your acne should abate somewhat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The redness won't subside much because there's no blood flow to take the blood out of the swollen inflamed vessels.  That's one way we can tell an antemortem injury (before death) from a postmortem injury (e.g. if somebody is injured, dies, then is dragged to a new location, the scrapes would look different).</p>
<p>Blood will settle due to gravity after death(livor mortis), but eventually the red cells break up and the hemoglobin stains the surrounding tissues, at which point livor becomes fixed and won't move with repositioning the body.</p>
<p>Depending on the temperature/humidity, the skin can either dry out (mummification) and shrivel up, or it can get wet, start slipping off in layers, and really get putrid as the body bloats.  I wouldn't count on blocked  pores opening up and self-resolving in either situation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, while you're technically right, your local forensic pathologist would greatly prefer you to pass in a cool, dry location where somebody finds you within a day or less.</p>
<p>A hospice/hospital bed surrounded by your loved ones including grandchildren would be even better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man these questions are hilarious and absurd - I love it. I think to make pimples artificially you'll first need artificial <em>skin</em>, which is a complex structure composed of hair follicles, sweat ducts, sebaceous glands, skin cells and fibrous tissue. Then you'll hook it up to a blood supply, yes. Then you'll have to make sure the skin gets all the natural exposures - bacteria and other crud. Hormones also play a role in pimple formation, so you'll have to supply these too. </p>
<p>I suppose if you're a mad scientist hell bent on creating pimples it'll still be very hard, mainly because we can't make skin completely from scratch. However, if you take a piece off a living person and then keep it alive in a tank, hooking it to blood and hormones, I imagine it <em>should</em> form pimples eventually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you had some sort of skin condition that allows more blood flow during such periods? Would newly already developing pimples grow slightly and would it be possible for completely new pimples to <em>begin</em> to form?</p></div>		</li>
