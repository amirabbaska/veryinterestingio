			<div class="markdown"><p>A bad post could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personal anecdote or experience</li>
<li>Something totally unrelated to the topic</li>
<li>Something that is not science related</li>
<li>Trolling, memes, circlejerking, etc.</li>
<li>Bad science (which most of the time isn't removed, we just make sure someone addresses it)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are anecdotes allowed provided they're clearly labelled as such? Ie. if someone has an anecdote which suggests some phenomena, can they say &quot;hey I have this anecdote, could anyone attempt to explain this phenomena?&quot;</p>
<p>For example, most people have seen what appears to be empathy in animals (dogs being sad when their friend dies, mothers being <em>heartbroken</em> when their children are taken/killed), are people allowed to share a personal experience like that and ask for a scientific explanation should say empathy in non-human animals not be recognised scientifically? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no. really we don't want anecdotes at all. It's very difficult to know whether or not it was actually related to the topic at hand. Followup questions are always allowed, but we prefer personal anecdotes to be left out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there may be a bit of confusion. 4207 wants to know if they can ask questions initiated by an anecdote, not if someone can answer a question with an anecdote.</p>
<p>If a question inspired by an experience during the day is NOT appropriate, I suppose I have misunderstood :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems kind of strange to me. Most of my questions arise through anecdotal situations, furthermore, I would love to see discussion about the merits/pitfalls of attempted scientific explanations of such anecdotes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely allowed to ask about personal anecdotes. However, you're not allowed to ANSWER with personal anecdotes. So, for example it's fine to ask: &quot;I noticed my dog is much more affectionate than my cat, are dogs always more affectionate than cats&quot;, but it's not ok to answer that with &quot;my three dogs are much more affectionate than my cats so it must be true species wide.&quot; We're fine with questions about every day life, we just really don't want speculation masquerading as scientific answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Asking about anecdotes is kinda murky territory actually. Often anecdotes are too personal for a panelist to give a good answer, or sometimes they're just plain weird. For example, something like: &quot;I've noticed my fridge smells a bit funny if I leave chocolate in there. What is the scientific explanation for this?&quot;. It's just not a very answerable question. Anecdotes in questions aren't <em>always</em> bad of course. But they can often only be answered by major speculation, because we don't know all the details of the situation, and because the OP may not be describing the situation accurately anyway.</p>
<p>You can use them a bit for illustration, but they can create questions that won't produce high quality comments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, asking a follow-up question is not only allowed, it is <em>encouraged</em>. Bringing up the anecdote as context and background is all right in that case.</p>
<p>My understanding is that it's the use of an anecdote as the <em>answer</em> to a question which is bad.</p></div>		</li>
