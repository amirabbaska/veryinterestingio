			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell you what, my grandmother just passed away a couple of weeks ago. When she took a turn, everyone flew out to be with her. She hung on, unresponsive for about two weeks, she wasn't eating or drinking anymore, as crude as it sounds, everyone was really more or less just waiting for her to pass away. I don't know why assisted suicide has such a negative stigma to it, there's what, maybe a 1% chance she snaps out of it? And even then, what is her quality of life after several strokes a week? My grandma is just my personal experience, I know people have it much, much worse</p>
<p>I wanted her pain to end, I wanted my family's pain to end, and I absolutely knew she didn't want to be alive anymore.</p>
<p>Death is sad, it hurts when someone you love passes away, but, it is inevitable, so running from it when you are at the end seems miserable.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure a lack of aversion to death is <em>pretty</em> unhealthy. Those folks have higher mortality rate you know.</p></div>		</li>
