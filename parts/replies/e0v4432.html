			<div class="markdown"><p>There is such a lack of a market for thorium, that it is discarded when mined with 'rare earth' elements.  </p>
<p><a href="https://investorintel.com/sectors/technology-metals/technology-metals-intel/800-pound-gorilla-room-rare-earth-sustainability-north-america-thorium/" target="_blank">It's even a problem</a> for REE mining, since thorium is radioactive, there are environmental issues with discarding it. This is why mining REEs in the West isn't profitable. Companies that own these mines would love for there to be a market for thorium, as then they could make money processing and selling their waste product.</p></div>		</li>
