<p>When I come across those, I always make the answer the last word of the question. My password is unique and secure enough.</p>

<p>Your password might be secure enough, but using the last word in the question as the answer to a secret question is a terrible strategy for security, given that these questions generally override your password.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I said, if you want me to have 4 passwords, I'd rather be asked to supply 4 passwords. I know my strategy is not secure, but I also have nothing to lose. Maybe if it mattered I'd consider it a bit more.</p>
<p>I'd much rather have to use 2 factor authentication which can aide in password recovery as well.</p></div>		</li>
