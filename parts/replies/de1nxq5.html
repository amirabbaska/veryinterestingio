			<div class="markdown"><p>Nononono - double red cell donation is way better than whole blood. A neg, B neg, and all O should do this (and I'm O-). You only go half as often, and in dire situations someone can get blood products from only one donor (ie they need more than one unit). You also stay hydrated as you get your plasma and white blood cells back.</p>
<p>ProTip: The higher your iron, the quicker the process goes. If you're borderline, take a slow absorbing iron pill every night! It helps a lot. Also you need to be above 5'3&quot; and 150 pounds, regardless of gender. boooyah!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I need to gain 40 pounds so I can finally do double red.  It's the only way I'll be able to earn that badge on my Red Cross Blood Donation app!  </p>
<p>...unless I can convince someone I weigh 150.  They don't weigh you when you donate.  Unless maybe they <em>do</em> if they think you're lying... I do not know.  Also maybe that would be a terrible choice for me health-wise (-_-).  Maybe I could just gain 20 pounds and <em>then</em> lie.  Split the difference.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many other factors in blood compatibility, which have to be taken into account for some uses. At least a dozen different factors are identified in the default tests blood banks use nowadays. As a type O, I've been asked to (and did) donate platelets to treat a specific patient who happened to match me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Type O is the most common blood type, they probably had an abundance of O blood that day/week/month and were trying not to overstock on one particular type. Your plasma is good for a year if frozen fresh, which most are, so that's probably why they recommended it</p></div>		</li>
