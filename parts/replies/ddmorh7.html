			<div class="markdown"><p>Just think about the next time you have an situation where you're around people and it's been quite for a while, and you get to dig into your coversational library and pull out:</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, have I ever told you how a penguins foot is like a testicle?&quot;</p>
<p>The good times will roll.</p>
<p>Also, patients LOVE that story whenever I have to do something uncomfortable and they just need someone to talk them through a difficult medical intervention. Nothing makes wound debridement easier than listening to a story about penguins and testis.</p></div>		</li>
