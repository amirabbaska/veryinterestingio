			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for shedding extra light on the writing part. I am convinced with the 'horse wrangler' comparison. I feel betrayed when a character trait is not an actual trait but just something the writer put in to advance the plot.<br />
Game of Thrones being already said, I would also like to mention House of Cards. If whatever you said is to go by, HoC can also be considered as an example of wonderful writing.</p></div>		</li>
