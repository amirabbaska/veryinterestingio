<p>Being rude to strangers based on the pile of dirt they happen to be from isn't very polite at all. &quot;I don't like the how the leader of this stranger's country does things. I know! I'm gonna go out of my way to be a fuckin' prick to this guy!&quot; Yeah, that makes sense and is totally rational adult behavior.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from Montreal and I can agree with this. Montreal has an attitude because of the English/French divide. We're not all like that but it is a big portion of the city. It may not event be an &quot;American&quot; thing, there's a good chance it could also be a &quot;your English&quot; thing. </p></div>		</li>
