			<div class="markdown"><p>Can support this with direct observation. City buried a water main deep under a corn field here. The corn is always shorter by feet than the rest. You can see the path of the main quite well from the crops. The roots can't develop near as much over the main. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they thought maybe that, but used same soil they dug up, and corn root system goes much deeper than that main. So the roots have to be stunted to an extent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Top Soil and nutrients wash away year by year especially on the edges. If you were using any sort of till year by year that only promotes top soil disruption and the cycle continues. One of the many reasons large scale agriculture is a downward spiral. Sure we have corn syrup for days, but that's about the only thing that will grow in that plot of sand and clay that has lost its nutrishous topsoil years ago and was only feed roundup and heavy ferts since.
*I am an organic farmer and fixed the issue described above with a high break wall near ditches,thicker  treeline around property and fields and let the soil build over time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, most Urban Municipalities restrict agricultural gardening in the front of homes &amp; buildings. </p>
<p>In the short term if your Urban farming/gardening aspirations exceed available space then consider using intensive gardening techniques such as vertical gardening. </p>
<p>In the front of the house, The North American bred version of Honeysuckle blue is a great perennial to have. Lots of flowers and a harvestable edible berry crop. Very cold hardy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah ok, thanks. I don't know what the situation is in the UK. In WW2 we grew loads of veg in public spaces. I've definitely seen a few veg pots in front gardens - peppers, beans, carrots, lettuces - so if it isn't allowed then it's not enforced very well which is nice. </p>
<p>I think it would be a great thing if lots of us grew our own veg! Cheap, no food miles, no pesticides, no packaging, great!</p></div>		</li>
