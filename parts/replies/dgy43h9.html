			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for laying out those requirements.</p>
<p>You're right that it is incredibly hard to prove loss of $ as a result of Trump's comments. if anything, revenue might have boomed because of him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate a little,  some very slanderous things have been said,  hinted at, and propagated by those news outlets towards Trump.</p>
<p>I don't like the guy.   But if more or less any outlet ever tried to sue him he'd have more than ample grounds to sure them right back,  and probably win.  Since he's referring generally to actions of a company while they are targeting a specific person with more easily discernible details. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You you are also have to prove that he's lying. Most of the time when he calls them fake news he's speaking about a specific thing that they said that was fake period and they do that quite often. They  either directly about something or deliberately spin a story to  mislead people.</p>
<p>Donald Trump could have a better case for libel against them then they   against him</p>
<p>notice that the media  hardly ever reports on  Democrat   presidents  . Most people wouldn't even be able to name Obama's press secretary l or 3 executive orders from him without  Googling it. That's because it's in the best interests not report heavily on democrat because the media works for the Democrats</p>
<p>not to mention the countless times that CNN the Washington Post and other  Democrats outlets  outright  lied about him</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus , the flip side would be that in the suit it could be/would be proven that CNN MSNBC (and others) do in fact engage in fabricating news. Having a stamped verdict giving weight to that fact could put the final nail on their coffin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly- it also amounts to the fact that calling CNN or MSNBC &quot;fake news&quot; simply isn't slander. While they don't usually outright fabricate things, &quot;fake news&quot; could well be interpreted by a reasonable person to mean &quot;misleading news,&quot; which they are guilty of (e.g. cutting off people who voice opinions contradictory to their narrative repeatedly with 'technical difficulties,' lightening George Zimmerman's photo post-processing to make his skin appear more white, editing the audio of his phone call to 911 to remove the part where the operator asks him to describe Martin so that all that's left is Zimmerman saying 'I think he's black' without context, reporting on the white chicago teen who was kidnapped by black teens and tortured by saying 'the kidnappers used the n-word repeatedly and referenced donald trump'... the list goes on and on). The truth is it's absurd how much these media outlets distort the truth and Trump is well within his first amendment rights to call them fake news. You may not agree with him but he simply isn't breaking the law or slandering them by expressing that sentiment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You need to prove that the statement would be taken as a factual statement, not a statement of opinion. You can't defame someone with a pure opinion or an interpretation of true facts. To be actionable, the statement must imply something about a matter that is provable true or false. And the statement has to be such that a reasonable person would listen to the statement and think a specific false assertion was being made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a regrettable coincidence(?) that Trump has insulated his filthy mouth drivel from litigation by spouting so many directly opposing opinions within hours of each other, so that no one can say with certainty anymore that he means or believes any of it. It's a pitiful precedence. A lessening of the standing of the office. </p>
<p>If Trump has accomplished anything already in his first 100 days, it's that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont much like Trump buy I bet you could argue he is actually good for the bottom line of the news corporations.  I would say their profits have probably gone up since Trump came onto the scene. </p></div>		</li>
