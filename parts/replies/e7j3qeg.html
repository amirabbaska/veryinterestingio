			<div class="markdown"><p>Our coolant ends up in the E-3 uCi/mL range for H-3. So, well above the limit you'd want to drink.</p>
<p>I'm also the license holder for our plant's potable water system. We get our drinking water from the lake where we discharge.</p>
<p>Our lake hovers around 10,000 pCi/mL (NRC limit is 20K). Since the activity is man-made, our drinking water is a reportable pollutant if it were to go onto adjacent property (NRC rule there as well). The Clean Water Act (EPA) says the water is fine, however.</p>
<p>Different rules from different departments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they using normal anion/cation filters and demins to process or something different? I'm a radwaste operator at a US plant and was curious as to how they are treating the water. They obviously aren't worried about silica or TOCs or anything that would keep the water from being feed water quality, but I'd like to know how much activity they are knocking out of the water. I'd imagine it's pretty crapped up after being circulated to cool down a melted reactor core, especially after the seawater injection.
It's a shame they can't discharge the water, since it's probably cleaner than the seawater it'd be dumped into, minus the dose aspect. I can see how it's a sensitive situation for them to discharge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sort of restricted on how much I feel comfortable saying, as I can be pretty easily dox'd from previous comments and I'm working with one of the companies that is doing some clean-up there on a project that is pre-patent that will ultimately used in Fukushima. We are going to be testing the equipment on a tank that we crapped up in the 1990s and is somewhat similar (highly buffered wastewater with residual radionuclides, primarily Co-60 with some arsenic and Cs-137 that got thrown off a cation bed when they tank got processed through it before they realized 500 gallons of 50% caustic got drained into the tank, hence the &quot;highly buffered&quot; water.) Our water is also filled with silica cobalt colloids as we are one of the unfortunate plants that got Boraflex spent fuel racks which throws silica into the pools continuously. We maintain around 20,000ppm silica due to the Boraflex. Anyway, I digress, if we can clean that tank, cleaning up hot seawater isn't much different.</p>
<p>I will say, that from what I have been told by people that have been there, the lower level of the plant has effectively become the recirc basin. The water, after treatment is supposed to be below pico-curie range and that the isotope of concern is primarily Cs-137. From what I was told, the fishing industry has effectively blocked the discharge of any waste with any level of radioactivity, even though the water in Fukushima at this point has a lower activity than natural seawater. The fishing lobby is apparently very strong in Japan.  </p>
<p>EDIT: I realized I never answered you. There has been resins that work to remove specific isotopes in buffered solutions for years, they are just expensive.  </p>
<p>One that we've used for some of our systems that have chemical treatment (component cooling water, for instance) is <a href="https://resintech.com/products/specialty-resins/sir-600" target="_blank">ResinTech SIR-600</a> which is really not a resin, but zeolite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tritium is not a major problem with Fukushima. BWRs produce significantly less tritium than PWRs. </p>
<p>I have a tritium issue at my plant, but it’s still not worth attempting to remove it considering how little is made, 800 Ci/yr in our case. About half ends up released as a gaseous effluent either through evaporation or direct from our stack during gas release. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was only really highlighting that it's not in the difficult or expensive camp. It's not that big a problem in the majority of fission plants, the current  tech was mostly designed for ITER.</p></div>		</li>
