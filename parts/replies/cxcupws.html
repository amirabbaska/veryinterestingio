			<div class="markdown"><p>There's so much history you're unaware of. To be honest, I thought the same thing until I started studying the history of the English language for fun. After the Norman invasion of 1066, the French language became the preferred (perhaps mandated) language of nobility in England. All matters of state were conducted in it (though iirc the church continued to use Latin). French was still preferred by the time Chaucer was writing around the end of the 14th century. He was a big advocate (haha French loan word) of bringing back the English tongue. English was still spoken during this time, but typically by commoners/the poor. I assume nobles knew English as well, or he wouldn't have written stories to/for the court in it. A massive percentage of the English language today originated from French, far more than the Old English or Norse we retain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no such thing as European English. There's British English and American English.</p>
<p>The only country (To my knowledge) in Europe that officially speaks English, other than the United Kingdom, is Ireland.</p>
<p>The rest of us just learn the language, because we like to be able to communicate across countries, and for some historical reasons this has become the language we use.</p></div>		</li>
