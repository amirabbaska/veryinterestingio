			<div class="markdown"><p>The rain may seem to come in waves due to the wind gusts often occurring in downpours.  There's also likely turbulence based clustering that you see, especially near the surface and in intense rain.  In stratiform situations (think steady rain all day) these &quot;waves&quot; of rain are likely less prevalent due to less wind and turbulence.  </p>
<p>Going further into your 3D question, rain absolutely varies in the vertical.  Within  cloud due to the rain drop growth processes and terminal velocities.  Small drops are formed first, but also have the lowest terminal velocity and dominate the rain drop size spectrum near the cloud top.  As you go further down into the cloud the spectrum broadens and you get larger drops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah it's due to the wind. Just like sounds waves are repeted patterns of high density air and low density air, wind can cause the same thing. As the pressure wave travels through the air, the areas of low pressure expand and pushes the rain drops away from each other, and areas of high pressure contract and pulls the rain drops twords each other.</p>
<p>Think of a wave traveling through a slinky. Pull a slinky out horizontaly and suspend it in the air. Then pluck one side. You'll see as the wave travels along the slinky you'll get areas where the coils are pushed together and more dense, followed by an area where the springs are pulled apart and less dense. The wave isn't really a moving thing. IE. The slinky rings aren't moving along the whole slinky. The rings are more or less in the same place and just move left and right every so slightly. The same thing happens with the rain. The sheets of water you see aren't actually moving all the way across, the rain drops are just moving ever so slightly left and right. It's pretty darn cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a related question to clarify a thing or two.</p>
<p>Randomness means what everybody think it means, right? But is it <em>true</em> randomness or is it because we lack the means to get accurate measurements? And what do you mean by <em>slight deviation from randomness</em>, that some predictable patters start to appear?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm going to try and explain this the best I can.  It's not my area of research, but I have a rough understanding from a few classes and talks I've been to.  </p>
<p>From what I understand, determining non-randomness is difficult for a few reasons.  Of course measuring the location in space of a bunch of raindrops at a specific time is super crazy difficult.  Once you have that, because the classical assumption is a random Poisson, to prove non-randomness, or preferred patterns, you have to disprove the Poisson distribution assumption.</p>
<p>So, not only do we have a hard time collecting information about several raindrops' position in space at a given time, we need enough of that data to definitively say that raindrops fall in a preferred pattern and that any patterns seen in the data aren't due to noise (e.g., lack of data and certainty, effects of wind/turbulence, etc).  Most studies, therefore, use statistical methods of determining whether the drops follow the Poisson assumption.  Recent studies, such as the one I linked in my original response, show that there is deviation from the Poisson assumption, and that there may be some preferred patterns.  What these preferred patterns are and why they occur is a topic of future research as far as I know.</p>
<p>In theory, if there is a preferred pattern and we know why it exists, we could work on predicting individual drops behaviors.  That said, weather prediction models don't model individual drops, but use simplified (although still complex) equations to roughly represent what is occurring in a big (think 5km x 5km x 1km) box.  Since our prediction models are &quot;tuned&quot; with these equations, reformulating these equations with a non-Poisson distribution (even if true), will likely result in a less accurate forecast - at least until more model &quot;tuning&quot; can occur.</p></div>		</li>
