			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. Burj Khalifa is about 830m. So if we built an equivalent copy on the Moon, with its six times weaker gravity, it would be like 5000m. I wonder what the difference in gravity would be like between the top and bottom of the structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since it's tidally locked (same side always facing Earth with a slight wobble) most meteors hit the far side.   The near side definitely still gets hit,  but if a building was built on the Earthward side it would be safer,  but why build a 5 km building on the moon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like a building on an asteroid might as well be a space station depending on the size of the asteroid since I doubt an asteroid even a few hundred metres across has a significant gravitational field.</p></div>		</li>
