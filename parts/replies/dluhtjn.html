			<div class="markdown"><p>Roughly speaking, any waves with a wavelength smaller than the gaps in the cage can pass through it.</p>
<p>You can make the holes as small as you want, until you have solid metal. The gaps between the atoms are much much smaller than any radio wavelength.</p>
<p>Wavelengths comparable to the sizes of atoms are all hard X-rays and gamma rays, which can penetrate just about anything.</p></div>		</li>
