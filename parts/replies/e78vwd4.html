			<div class="markdown"><p>Jet fuel is highly pure and consistent kerosene.  Both jet fuels and kerosene can be used in diesel engines, but lack the lubricating component that diesel fuel has and will therefore damage modern injectors and pumps in short order.  We have a diesel forklift in the shop that we use with jet fuel from the helicopters, but we add a type of oil to the fuel so the engine doesn’t self destruct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s more like kerosene with additives to increase its cetane number and lubricating properties. You gotta somehow make those trucks and trains run in winter above the Arctic circle.</p></div>		</li>
