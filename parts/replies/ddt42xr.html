			<div class="markdown"><p>If great whites don't work out then how does a whale shark work at the Georgia aquarium? </p>
<p>Edit: my thoughts were focused not so much around the predation part of the whale shark vs great white but the required living space.  A whale shark travels far and wide like a great white, but is also 3 times the size.  Yes the tank at Georgia is huge... but in retrospect, it would be like keeping me in my house for the rest of my life, unable to access the outside world.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For one thing, whale sharks are nonagressive filter feeders (like baleen whales - hence the name). They aren't prone to eating their tankmates like big predatory sharks.</p>
<p>They are also very slow, unlike white sharks which are always on the move. While whale sharks also have to keep swimming at all times in order to breathe, they do so at a much more leisurely pace (no ramming into the glass).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first part is extremely important--- the tank is as big as a football field. It is immensely costly. Because of how no aggressive the whale sharks are, they keep an unbelievable number of species in that tank. </p>
<p>You wouldn't want to make a tank like that just to house one great white shark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me tell you about the Georgia aquarium's whale sharks. They have several of them in a huge tank, but that tank still looks miserable for them. I've done their SCUBA swim program in the tank and those poor whales are swimming laps constantly. It's like keeping a human trapped in a cell. They really shouldn't have those beautiful things in that tank. </p></div>		</li>
