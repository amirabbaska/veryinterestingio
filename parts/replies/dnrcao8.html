			<div class="markdown"><p>Chimpanzees also commit systematic warfare. They are the first species to have been observed feuding in groups over a period of years until every single member of one of the groups was murdered. Not so much serial-killing, but still unique murderous behaviour that was thought only to exist in humans. Jane Goodall was very upset by those observations when it all began. </p></div>		</li>
