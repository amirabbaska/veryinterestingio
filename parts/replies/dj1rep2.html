			<div class="markdown"><p>Carpet fiber is a polymer. The newer stuff is typically made of non-woven material that is designed to do exactly what you described. Depending on the fiber orientation, thickness and bonding method these fabrics can be extremely strong and durable. I know what you mean when you say &quot;advanced polymers&quot; but you gotta remember all the other aspects that go into high output production... For example, cost and ease of manufacturing. With respect to most textiles car carpet is pretty damn strong.</p>

<p>Edit: woke up to quite a few questions so I'm going to edit this comment to address some of them. -Still on mobile so bare with me</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>B.S. stands for bachelor's of science (good ole Reddit)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This carpet isn't perfect. If you don't want the Minnesota winter destroying your car after 120k miles get some extra floor mats. I mentioned earlier that cost is a big deal. I'm sorry but a Toyota Camry or something like that isn't going to have high dollar carpet in it... Let alone something that can stand up to the abrasiveness of snow, ice and most importantly salt. Remember, they use all sorts of abrasive materials to assist drivers when the road is shitty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carpet does play a big role in damping sound but nowadays cars have different kinds of damping materials to keep road noise down. Similar to subflooring or other types of insulation. This material is non-woven like the carpet and can come stock or be added in. </p>
</li>
<li>Vinyl and rubber options (jeeps, trucks etc) are available but in the past carpet was considered to be the premium option and evolved into the norm. </li>
</ol>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, since you've got a BS in it, maybe you can explain then why most cars in my State (Minnesota) have pretty universally destroyed flooring after about 10 years. Vehicles in milder climates may very well last &quot;30 to 50&quot;, but up here, hell no -- by about 120k miles or so, the driver's side of most vehicles up here are shredded, discolored, ripped, bare, etc. People have to go above and beyond to keep the floorboards looking right. I've got a Protege with only about 70k miles on it -- bought it from a Jewish guy. there's two track marks where the feet are and the carpeting has been obliterated. That's an unusual amount of wear, but nothing I haven't seen before. Dude was like 65 and a college professor... his house was immaculate... he wasn't sanding down the floorboards or anything. o.o </p></div>		</li>

<p>Huh. How delightfully esoteric. I never woukd have thought that that was a thing. I mean, <em>of course</em> it's a thing, but who amongst the general populace gives thought to such things? The products of your field are critical to modern life, yet so ubiquitous as to be functionally invisible.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carpet is also pretty high in friction with most footwear, which can help an a variety of ways.</p>
<p>-makes it easier to sort of prop your foot in a way to hold tension on the throttle without wasting a lot of muscular force on constant pressure.</p>
<p>-easier to brace the whole body or position one's self in the seat (adjusting body position or bracing to steer, shift, etc)  This may not sound important when putzing around town but in a pinch it can come in very handy.</p>
<p>-easier to get in and out </p>
<p>On all carpet, the only way I've ever lost traction is in the dead of winter when ice/snow can melt and build up on the carpet and end up as a slick surface, and that takes a lot of build-up to do.  Other surfaces such as plastic/rubber floor mats become slick much sooner, some even with just wet shoes....even when said material is texurized.</p>
<p>It's also sound dampening(which makes it great for keeping sounds out as well as making a stereo sound good, the most popular vehicular entertainment) and a good temperature insulator, good for AC in the summer and heat in the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll find rubber floors in work vehicles and some &quot;sports oriented&quot; vehicles like the Honda Element.  It kind of sucks though.  It's slippery when wet and dirt transfers to anything you put on it like an old dirty shop floor.   The only way to make it look new after it's seen a bit of wear is to armorall it or use a silicone product that makes it slick as snot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to hyjack your comment but the sound proofing in cars is actually really interesting. The carpet itself is usually the full size of the passenger compartment with holes cut for the seats and stuff. On the bottom of the carpet is a dense foam which acts as both padding and a noise insulator. There are engineers constantly working on the formula of said foam to make it reduce the noise in the passenger compartment as much as possible.</p></div>		</li>
