			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, and is likely a feature of early human evolution. I don't think it has anything to do with development rates of males vs females though.</p>
<p>On a macroscopic scale, a society with few men is theoretically fine, but a society with few women is in trouble. That is common sense as a male's reproductive role is finished after sex, whereas a woman must be pregnant for almost a year.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you have 50 men and 50 women, and 30 of the men die because they experimented with something stupid, or because they were killed by an animal/other tribe, the tribe is still okay because the number of women determine how good the future is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't that imply the exact opposite? If men are so expendable, while women are not, then one would expect for women to mature slowly because there is less risk in that. While guys could mature super fast at higher risk for problems, but who cares, only a few need to actually make it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, the &quot;point&quot; of women biologically is to reproduce. If women can start reproducing at the age of 12, that is &quot;better&quot; than at the age of 17. This isn't taken to extremes because women clearly also needed to be smart, be helpful, etc. So the compromise that nature came up with between growing up really fast and growing up a bit too slowly was to grow up at their current speed.</p>
<p>Yes, guys could mature super fast - and in many species they do - if their only reason for existing was just to have sex. However, in early human society it is clear that men did a lot of hunting, fighting, etc. and in turn men were likely prided on their physical abilities and problem solving, both of which are going to take time to develop.</p>
<p>I won't go further because then we're getting into &quot;why do humans grow up so slowly&quot; which is another difficult question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole thing seems like pure speculation to me.</p>
<p>The difference between male and female reproductive age is small (a couple of years), especially considering they'll have so many decades to reproduce. If it's about getting reproductive ASAP because you might die early, then again it would make more sense for the males to develop faster. Hunting, fighting, etc. is dangerous and might get you killed, so let's get it done while you still can. While females are relatively safer, so they could afford to wait for an year or two and still reproduce successfully. Yet we see the opposite.</p>
<p>Also, I don't see why developing physical abilities and problem solving would slow down sexual development. Exactly the opposite, earlier onset of puberty would mean faster physical and cognitive development. If you have to fight so much as a male, getting that testosterone explosion an year or two earlier would be a huge boon. I don't see why it has to be delayed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it bluntly: there is plenty of time to die; there is never plenty of time to be pregnant.</p>
<p>Remember that evolution does not happen at the species level but the individual level. Every individual is &quot;trying&quot; to maximize their inclusive reproductive fitness. It's not that only a few men &quot;need&quot; to make it, but that the situation incentivizes men to be risk takers. Doesn't mean they need to go off and die as soon as possible (after all making a person is expensive, male or female), and since they don't need to get to the task of being pregnant ASAP, they can afford to take a little longer to grow and learn. </p>
<p>Also remember that this discussion by definition fixates on how men and women are different. They are similar in perhaps many more ways than they are different, but that main difference is that women gestate children, and it is significant.</p></div>		</li>
