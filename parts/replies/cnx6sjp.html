<p>Playing with a clock also helps games not be infinitely long for people that don't play with this rule.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's just a draw, not a stalemate.</p>
<p>Stalemates are a specific category of draws, when the player whose turn it is doesn't have any legal moves.</p>

<p>As has been mentioned repeatedly elsewhere in the thread, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefold_repetition" target="_blank">this isn't true</a>. The Threefold Repetition rule grants the ability to <em>claim</em> a draw. It doesn't 'force' a draw if neither player wants it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true as others mentioned - a player could claim a draw at that point but it's not mandatory.</p>
<p>Along similar lines is the 50-move rule. A player can claim a draw if there are 50 rounds of moves (50 moves by each player, or 100 total moves) without either a capture or a pawn move.</p></div>		</li>
