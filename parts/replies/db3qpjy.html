<p>Source, while no longer in radio, I spent about 18 years in it up until 2014.</p>
<p>The only thing I'd like to add, Nielsen does not count all PPM holders as their audience. Each person who is given one, is used as a sample for a certain demographic.</p>
<p>For example, I get a PPM to track my listening habits. I also fill out information that gives them as much detail about me as possible. Whatever listening habit info they get from my device, is then multiplied.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Radio is a white, married guy in his mid-30's, living in the suburbs of (city name). He is self-employed and makes about XXXXX a year... blah, blah, blah&quot;</p>
<p>Nielsen then makes an estimate of how many people fit my demographics in a certain area. They then divide by a number and send out PPMs to a small sample size.</p>
<p>&quot;there are 300,000 people in Mr. Radio's demo in New York. We'll send out 30 PPM devices to people in that demographic.&quot;</p>
<p>TL;DR: While PPM is real-time, super-detailed info, Nielsen still estimates how many people actually listen to different media. TV works the same way.</p>
<p>Want exact user habits, digital baby! This is why I started my own digital agency.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It should also be noted that this type of device also picks up all media consumed while walking through the mall, subway station, restaurants, and so on.</p>

<p>PPM is one of the main reasons radio sucks now.  No company is willing to take any chances, or program outside the box, because those PPM numbers = money.  Ad rates are based on the ratings, and even though you might hate pop music, if you're wearing a PPM and walk into the mall and the pop station is playing everywhere, it counts that as you listening to that pop station.  Radio isn't about connecting and developing active listeners anymore, it's simply about how many ears can they get their broadcast into.  It's terrible and I hate it.</p>
<p>A radio station used to be run by the programming department, now the sales department runs the station.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's not dead, it's just not what it was in its heyday.  There are still plenty of people listening to the radio, but of course there are so many other alternatives.  The thing that radio can give you that podcasts and your own Spotify playlists can't, is live and local content that speaks directly to you.  The sad thing is, due to people's listening habits changing, and due to the PPM-style programming model influencing how people listen, radio companies have stopped the live and local broadcasting, and have instead gone to what I like to call &quot;plug-and-play&quot; radio.  You can inject any jock into any day part on any station and the station will still sound exactly the same.  This is why the higher paid talent is all being fired and replaced with no and low talent workers.  And it's backfiring, hugely.  There aren't any talented personalities or producers or writers coming up to be the next generation because the training grounds, the small markets and the overnight shows, are all voice tracked or being phased out completely for syndication or repeater stations.</p>
<p>That's a wall of text I know but fuck, I could talk about this shit forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Dead&quot; is a gross overstatement. Sure, programming quality and listener engagement may be down, but according to Neilson, 93% of all Americans are still listening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one thing podcasts can't provide you is content that is local and live and happening right now.  Sadly radio has gone away from that model, partly due to PPM-style programming, and the listeners are leaving for other alternatives.  I still argue to this day that people will put up with commercials and songs they don't like if the personalities and the content is engaging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is very interesting, but I think I'm missing something here. So one guy wears this PPM and he just walks around and the device picks up the code from the radio and all the places/people near him where that station is being played? What about people who listen in their cars or in their homes or not near the PPM? How would one account for that? (sorry if that sounds stupid and I'm just not getting it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A PPM is more or less the same as a diary but it eliminates a lot of the subjectiveness.  It's meant to capture each person's listening habits as a part of the whole population of a market.  Nielsen will take all of the PPMs in a market and extrapolate what ratings looks like as a whole.  </p>
<p>So if /u/Helix_C is a PPM holder, you wear it around and it picks up those silent signals in your home, car, office, grocery store, wherever.  Nielsen assumes that if you're a white, 25 year old male, your listening habits are equal to x amount of <em>other</em> white, 25 year old males and they determine ratings from all that data.</p></div>		</li>
