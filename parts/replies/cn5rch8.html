			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon dating is based on the proportion of radiocarbon 14 to carbon 12 in the organic tissue, and there is not enough left to accurately date objects over about 50,000 years.  Rocks can sometimes be dated by using isotopes of other elements, but the date would indicate when crystals in the rock formed, not when it was turned into an artifact.  Ancient human sites are dated by using traditional stratigraphic methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This gets to a question I've had for a long time that maybe you can shed some light on. How can we be confident, using stratigraphic methods, that the layer of soil containing an artifact wasn't exposed much more recently? Right now, you can find exposed soil all over the world that is tens of thousands of years old, yet here it is, out in the open as a result of wind or water erosion. I could drop my watch on the ground and next year someone could find that watch in a layer surrounded by million year old fossils. In the articles I read, it always seems like it is assumed that layer after layer is simply placed over the top of each other neatly and in order, but it is clearly more complicated than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geoarchaeologists study the soil and rock layers to identify the order of deposition.  You described the law of superposition,  which assumes that all things being equal (no bioturbatio n (rodents), tectonic activity (earthquakes), overturned material,  removal,  etc) the layer on the bottom of the soil or rock is older than the layer on the top. The law of superposition is the basis for relative dating,  which is what scientists used to date sites before absolute dating methods were invented.  There are lots of ways to study and date the soil or rock layers: visual description,  dating (radiocarbon is best known,  but stops at 50k as another commenter said. There's also potassium - argon,  argon - argon,  osl, soil carbon,  etc etc), chemical tests,  and soil description being just a few.  Stratigraphy is the base of all these analyses,  and you still have to have your interpretations in order for your absolute dates to make sense.  However, all archaeologists/paleontologists/geologists use absolute dating methods to get a specific date now that we have the technology available.  The exact absolute dating method you use depends on the material available for dating at the site. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your example, you drop your watch on a layer of eroding material and it becomes buried as it erodes further.</p>
<p>In that case, your watch would be found downhill in a layer of mixed material. There would be million year old fossils, which might initially confuse or cause wrong dates to be estimated for that layer. But as they investigated further they would find dust and pollen and leaf bits from modern day, as well as material from other layers that washed from further uphill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You bring up an interesting point. When it comes to dating soils, it is not only a matter of using geochemical analytical methods to date them, but also of degrees of weathering and preservation, context, and fossils present. The last thing you mention is a really interesting topic in paleobiology, called time averaging, that is currently a big topic of study by notable paleontologists, including Rowan Lockwood (William &amp; Mary), Sue Kidwell (U Chicago), and Mike Kowalewski (U Florida). There are a number of good books and articles to read more on these. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rocks are not the only elements used for saying rocks, or any other material. There's an entire host of different radioactive elements with varying half-lifes. Elements with a shorter half life are more precise, but decay more rapidly so they can only be used to date relatively young specimens. Elements with a longer half life can be used to get dates from older specimens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a whole smorgasbord of other technical methods to constrain dates as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrochronology (tree ring analysis) can tell exactly you when wood grew, if you're in an area with an established tree ring record.</li>
<li>Thermoluminescence can establish the last time a crystalline object was either heated (for pottery, igneous rocks, etc.) or exposed to sunlight (for sediments). Essentially, all crystals have defects; some of these defects can trap free electrons when the material is exposed to ionizing radiation (natural radioactivity or cosmic rays). When a material is heated or exposed to sunlight, these trapped electrons are freed. Therefore, by heating an object in the laboratory under carefully controlled conditions (thus releasing the free electrons) and comparing it to a similar control object for calibration, archaeologists can discover how long ago an object was last heated or exposed to sunlight.</li>
<li>Amino acid racemization can help to date organic material. All living things use amino acids to build proteins, etc. Every amino acid except for glycine is a stereoisomer - an asymmetric molecule that can have either &quot;D&quot; or &quot;L&quot; configurations (they are asymmetric in the way that a glove is asymmetric; no matter how you rotate a right-handed glove, you can't fit it onto your left hand without turning it inside-out which is cheating). While living, organisms almost always maintain their amino acids in the L configuration, since D-amino acids can't ordinarily participate in biological chemical reactions. After death, the amino acids will &quot;racemize&quot; - change from L to D configuration - until they are in a 50/50 mixture. The rate at which this occurs is predictable, though quite sensitive to environmental conditions, so scientists can test the organic material in the lab, discover its racemization ratio, do some fancy math, and come up with a date at which the organic material died.</li>
<li>I vaguely recall something involving moisture content in amorphous materials (mostly volcanic glass i.e. obsidian).</li>
<li>Tephrochronology can help to establish dates for when sediments were deposited. Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of tephra - volcanic ash - into the air, which then settles. Each volcanic eruption produces a tephra with a unique chemical signature. Since geologists have a pretty good idea of the chronology of major volcanic eruptions going back quite a while, if you happen to discover your find in a stratum that has a thin layer of tephra on top, you can send a sample of the tephra off to the lab and learn which volcanic eruption it came from and when.</li>
<li>Stable isotope geochemistry can be helpful in dating, and sometimes in determining the geographic region that something came from. Oxygen-oxygen ratio is a good example. Through various natural processes, the ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in seawater changes, both locally and globally. (Happily, the &quot;various natural processes&quot; tend to make the oxygen-18 ratio track global sea level very closely - so you can take a graph of O-18 ratio over time, make sure it's aligned and proportioned correctly, stick a scale in meters on it, and call it a graph of eustatic sea level over the past few millions of years.) In certain cases, you can measure the oxygen-oxygen ratio of your find or something associated with it and get an approximate date. Since the ratio also varies slightly by location, in certain other cases you can use it to determine <em>where</em> something came from - I read about a project that used oxygen isotope ratios to determine where some immigrants to ancient Rome hailed from (mostly north Italy, some from north Africa).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can, yes. The amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere has varied slightly over time, so they have used alternative dating methods to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating#Calibration" target="_blank">calibrate</a> it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't date leather or wood in a 1Ma axe: it's not there to date and would be out of range for C14 dating. You can sometimes date the rock using thermoluminescence, which will get you back to about 50ka for flint. The reset event is the burning of the flint before it was worked. </p>
<p>With less accuracy, you might also be able to  date sediments above and below the axe using optically stimulated luminescence (or phosphorescence, but I don't think that technique got very far). </p>
<p>My basis for this is working on OSL and OSP in the early days (left 25 y back), and also some zircon TL dating. My lab also did flint dating, but I was not directly involved with that, so please don't ask why people burned flints! You might find older papers by Joan Huxtable on the subject in <em>Ancient TL</em> or <em>Archaeometry</em>. </p></div>		</li>
