			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely right.  To do into more detail, I'll try to keep this succinct.  Walking is known as gait, one gait cycle is one complete stride.  So heel of left foot then right then heel is one stride.  Gait has two phases, swing and stance.  Stance starts when your heel touches the ground.  Then your forefoot hits and your other foot is swing right about now.  The foot which absorbs a ton of shock as well as slight knee flexion goes into a pronation moment, which essentially means it spreads out and absorbs the load of your bodyweight plus momentum.  Pronation is a coupled motions, dorsiflexion, eversion and forefoot abduction.  Think of this as your inner arch behind your big toe flattens and your foot rolls inward a little bit.  After your opposite foot in swing phase passes your stance foot, the stance foot begins to supinate, the opposite of pronation.  This is to make a strong solid lever to push off when your heel comes off the ground at the end of stance phase.  People who have non functional arches commonly break the bones in their feet.  There are also very few animals that walk flat footed.  Anyway, I also wrote a song for a presentation about this a couple weeks ago so thanks for keeping it fresh for me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question for you! I've often seen walking being recommended as a &quot;healing&quot; exercise and for basic general fitness. I've seen it recommended for both genders and basically all weight classes except for the most extreme. </p>
<p>Also, since shock absorbtion is a key a factor, should we have in mind our &quot;natural habitat&quot;? Wouldn't the African savanna be &quot;softer&quot;? If so, wouldn't modern shoes at the very least mimic this softness? </p>
<p>Also, you mention that few animals don't have a a flat foot but wouldn't certain birds like a duck count? And our hooved friends, horses, are well known for their endurance over distance. They're both heavier, have a small surface area, and literally have metal shoes. </p>
<p>I'm skeptical that simply &quot;walking is hard on the body&quot; is the only reason or biggest reason for the arches in our foot. </p>
<p>I'm thinking maybe the arches in our feet could be better explained by perhaps our ancestors used our feet to grab more or as tool manipulators. Or the way we generate force is different and we get more power by having stiffer feet and thus being able to flee quicker. </p>
<p>Or perhaps walking upright has some con I don't know about. From what I understand, bipedal movement is more efficient over distance than having four legs. Can I infer that since we're more efficient locomotively, I can say that we use less energy and therefore sustain less wear and tear? For example, if you run your car at 1500RPM VS 6000RPM for 15min, which causes more damage? </p>
<p>Just asking. Idk shit about feet lol </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, outdoor walking is typically cushier and shoes definitely help absorb shock on the hard surfaces that we have created for ourselves in the last few thousand years. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>...few animals don't have a a flat foot but wouldn't certain birds like a duck count? And our hooved friends, horses...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know much about gait in animals other than humans, but I don't think ducks are a good example of efficient long distance walkers. If we compare humans and horses, horses literally walk on what would be our toe nails, which is pretty much the opposite of flat feet.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't know much about the evolutionary reasons, but I can say that arches help absorb shock; make the foot adaptable (can be soft one second for shock absorbing &amp; rigid the next for power); and help us store energy for more efficiency, all of which are advantageous. </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure other apes don't have arched feet and I'm not sure our ancestors did either so I don't think is had to do with grasping.  </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Consider that the energy is all being put through two legs instead of four. Maybe this alone created enough evolutionary pressure for us to develop arches and also our relatively huge knee joints</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting! I honestly don't know if bipedal movement is more efficient or not, I know the theory is that it allows the hands to be used for holding tools or weapons, and the area directly hit by overhead sun is reduced, not the entire trunk, mostly just the shoulders and the hairy part of the head.  I know that for sprinters, they want inserts that are essentially immobile, keeping their feet supinated, whereas marathoners need supple, shock absorbant interfaces as orthotic inserts.  So, ducks don't really do their travelling by walking, I think a better example would be ostriches or emus, now I want to see how they get around.  And yes, the more active a person is, within reason, the better health they will generally experience. Within reason. I wouldn't expect someone just out of spinal surgery to walk 10k steps a day, and immediately start dead lifting, that's unreasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that the distance between your heel and your toe were as about long as your shin, and that you always walked around on your tip-toes.  That joint at your heel acts as your shock absorber.  <a href="http://wallpaper-gallery.net/images/horse-image/horse-image-3.png" target="_blank">Now look at a horses' hind leg</a>, and you'll see a similar configuration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So should I start trying to run on my toes and build strength, using the foot like most animals (tetrapods)?  My feet are flatter than most, and now my left is more flat since when I was in high school I fractured my left arch.  I have always heard you should run and land on the front of your feet, but what if you run not using your heel at all?  I never realized it before, but it almost seems like an advantage to move this way, as awkward as it may sound, since the human body is amazing at adapting and you would build the strength to continue like that more easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are high level runners that use both techniques. Really it's just whatever is most comfortable for you. If you have flat feet, I would recommend physical therapy to strengthen the intrinsic muscles of your feet and using orthotics to help shape your foot to a more biomechanically functional position.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of different answers here, but I haven't seen one saying to land on the OUTER side of your foot (below your pinky toe), and then roll your foot down so you land on your heel slightly after the sole behind your big toe.  It's hard to explain but here is a video of a barefoot runner <a href="https://youtu.be/7jrnj-7YKZE" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/7jrnj-7YKZE</a> just watch the first few seconds and see how he lands his foot.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of landing below the big toe first and trying to role back and I sprained that area, but since adjusting to the outer side I've reduced the strain on my knees tremendously and haven't had ankle or foot pain!</p></div>		</li>
