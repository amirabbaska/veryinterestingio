<p>The place is constantly bombed (for discutable reasons more often than not, at least, seen from foreign press). Is isolated. Yet it's Palestinian territory. How is any status quo holding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: I am not a history expert, and a lot of this happened when I was too young to get involved in national news, this is my uneducated opinion/internal narrative:</p>
<p>The Gaza Strip was a an area of land that was pretty comparable to today's West Bank, except far smaller, and a <strong>lot</strong> more violent. Roughly 10 years ago Israel's PM Ariel Sharon ordered a unilateral retreat from the territory essentially letting the Gazans &quot;work stuff out themselves&quot;. It did not go well, the terrorist cell Hamas took over and started running the place exactly how you would expect a terrorist cell to run a people (the stories that Israeli soldiers tell of how Gazans are treated by Hamas are absolutely gut-wrenching). One of their many actions were to launch rockets at Israeli cities.</p>
<p>And here we come to the focus of your question- the bombings. I want to make a some points very, <strong>very</strong> clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Justification- These is no nation on earth who would not retaliate against constant, violent attacks against its citizens. When the first major Israeli operation started in Gaza, Israeli population was overjoyed because we have had it with being pushed around for 6 years. Countries like the US or England would have carpet-bombed the entire strip at the first threat to their citizens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humanitarianism- Israel is often touted among the most ethical armies on earth, and that's no joke. In all of these bombings, civilians are never the target. Many missions were cancelled, even last-minute, because of massive risk to civilians. You want to know why you hear so many sob stories from Gazans about Israel destroying their homes and institutions? It's because Hamas hid weapons in those buildings, and <strong>Israel phoned the people inside and told them to evacuate</strong>. The Israeli army is not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike" target="_blank">US</a> army, and prides itself with minimal civilian casualty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Enemy- I hinted at it a little above, but I think I will go into more detail here: Hamas is not above anything. They put weapons in hospitals and kindergartens, knowing that Israel will have to secure these building with infantry. They force civilians of all kinds to shield weapons with their bodies, holding their loved ones hostage. Hamas is <strong>ruthless</strong> and is easily doing more damage to Gaza than Israel ever did. Any operation against Hamas is, in my opinion, a net gain for Gaza.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology- An argument against the bombings I hear a lot is that, since Israel has technological superiority to Hamas, that somehow de-justifies any counterattack Israel might execute. I try to be civil in this post but I refuse to give this argument any more attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Lies- One thing you have to keep in mind is that nearly all of news reports from Gaza can be traced back to <strong>a terrorist organization</strong>. They aren't above using civilians as cover and they are definitely not above lying. They regularly inflate the number of casualties they sustain, as well as the identities of these casualties. About 60% of the buildings destroyed in Gaza were destroyed by badly aimed (or worse, well aimed) Hamas rockets. Not to mention the international community loves to bash on Israel and pounce on every unsubstantiated claim against it, please take everything you hear from Gaza with a pinch of salt.</p>
</li>
<li>The World- Okay, truth time, a lot of the Israeli population has just stopped giving a shit how the world portrays us. It's very clear the international community just doesn't care about facts and just want to hate on Israel with <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/19/top-violator-women-rights-around-world-it-israel-says-un.html" target="_blank">frankly hilarious amounts of obsurdity</a>. We're ethical for our own sake, and we protect ourselves for the same reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure how an outsider would see this, but I want to be clear, <strong>I am not a radical on this issue</strong>. This is a ranging opinion in Israel and is, in my opinion, reasonable and justified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 100% on board with this. As much as I try to drive these points home, people just don't listen. I don't even bother trying to argue any more. </p>
<p>It's even worse in my country (Ireland), as there's a <em>massive</em> pro-Palestinian bandwagon that draws upon historical parallels between the Palestinians/Irish and Israelis/British. This is even more apparent for me, since I was born and raised as a Catholic in Northern Ireland. We were, historically, completely under the heel of a regional government run by a Protestant majority in Belfast and a national government in London that simply didn't give a shit. The consensus here is that, if you don't support Palestine, you're not that far away from Hitler or Stalin. </p>
<p>I understand these parallels, and efforts to bring people in from NI to mediate discussions have happened once or twice, because we got our peace, and it's holding (albeit shakily at times). However, since I have a brain, I can also spot the differences in the scenarios, and I know that you can't apply the NI Peace Process effectively in Israel/Palestine. </p>
<p>I empathise with the Palestinians, I really do; but I can't find it in myself to support regimes that either openly partakes in terrorism and calls for genocide, or one that has pissed on perfectly good solutions and prolongs suffering by throwing jet fuel on the fire. The Palestinian people are being led by absolute dipshits that use their suffering for either political gain, world-wide sympathy or just straight up use them as human shields. If they die, it's the IDF's fault. </p>
<p>That's not to say Israel is a shining paragon of virtue, of course it isn't. Bibi is a cunt, and his government isn't doing the peace process any favours either. The IDF, while I greatly admire them, has made mistakes (one thing that comes to mind was the terrible incident a few years ago when a patrol boat shelled kids on a beach in Gaza).  </p>
<p>It's a really shitty situation, I really hope we don't have to see people endure this shit for decades to come. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading something that really put a lot of this conflict into perspective for me.</p>
<p>Imagine if the Palestinians had the capability to completely annihilate the Jewish people in Israel. Imagine that they had the technology and war-making ability to make that a reality. Is there any doubt that they would use that chance to do just that - to wipe out Israelis?</p>
<p>Well the Israelis DO have that capability. And they have the capability to defend themselves against neighboring countries retaliation, even if their allies turned on them for it.</p>
<p>And yet they don't. The Israelis have that option - to completely annihilate the Palestinians. But they don't.</p>
<hr />
<p>As for the two-state solution... When you look at it from the longer-term, Israel is playing the game smart. Israel isn't looking at this situation from a year, or a decade in the future. They're looking at it from centuries in the future. They can keep slowly taking over Palestinian areas, slowly encroaching, slowly taring down and rebuilding, all the while allowing every Jew around the world safe haven and citizenship in Israel.</p>
<p>And eventually they will win. It's the slowest war in history. And when the last Palestinian will be removed from Israel, who knows, but it will happen. And Israel is perfectly fine with it taking centuries.</p>
<p>The only way for the Palestinians to avoid such a long-term game is if they get organized. If they come together, form a stable government, have a working economy, and civilize their population enough that they can be controlled long enough for Palestine to take a seat at the peace table (e.g. Grow up). But they have a very long way to go - and every rocket attack sets them back to square 1.</p>
<hr />
<p>The question I always had... Why do they stay? Why wont their Arab neighbors take in the Palestinians? Instead of building ludicrous skyscrapers and subsidizing airlines that treat each passenger like a sultan for pennies, why not build apartment buildings and fill them with Palestinians? Get them in your workforce - get them working for your economy in a way that isn't oil-related so you can survive the inevitable worldwide switch away from oil?</p>
<p>You end the bloodshed and you massively boost your international standing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still don't understand how, all past claims aside, that a nation that has conquered (or was given, whatever), protected and defended its land is still debated as to whether they should be there or not.</p>
<p>Israel has won the war multiple times. To the victor go the spoils and all that. How is it that this is true throughout history, but in this case, it's just accepted as part of the argument? I really don't get it.</p>
<p>I know it's simplistic, but I really think it should break down to: Israel won, Palestinians lost. Game Over.</p>
<p>Further, I think Israel has shown massive restraint in its dealings with the Palestinians. Any other nation accosted as such would have full right to go in there and clean house, civilians be damned. ...But they don't, and Hamas (et al) continue to use civilian locations as military operating points and cry foul when Israel blows the shit out of them (even when trying to warn ahead of time that they're coming).</p>
<p>Any and all argument (or sympathy) the Palestines may have had has gone out the window in how they've chosen to conduct themselves from the get-go. Now I just feel like they get whatever comes to them, and kind of hope Israel finally gets fed up and handles the problem once and for all.</p></div>		</li>
