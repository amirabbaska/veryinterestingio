			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, Mass movements are basically like peristalsis, but more powerful. And rather than just occurring in a small segment of the GI tract, they cover a larger area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! Mass movements are just a sweep from the cecum to the rectum. Smooth muscle is crazy! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass movements are usually thought to be a direct result of colonic wall distention, rather than a baseline constant &quot;wave&quot; as is the case with small bowel.  Similar to how the bladder distends resulting in an urge to contract, the resultant colon distention causes a local contraction, propelling contents forward in discrete units.  When observed in the 1960s and 1970s with barium (which lights up on an x-ray) it appeared to the observers that there was a sudden &quot;mass movements&quot; of the contents.</p>
<p>Three major contributors of colon mass movements are sleep (which greatly slows the movements), activity/exercise (which greatly increases the movements), and opiod medication (which blocks the electrical signal to contract in a coordinated fashion to allow for mass movements).  </p>
<p>For these reasons, people with chronic constipation are often encouraged to avoid opiod pain meds, get regular consistent sleep, and exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand the difference is, that peristaltis is a wave of depolarization, that spreads along the GI tract. As it spreads, it causes contraction (either through action potential or not). Mass movement is specific for colon which can't contract peristaltically, since it's musculature is arranged in teniae. Colon contractions therefore form haustras, which contract as separate units. When a larger segment loses this haustras for a moment and contracts as a single unit, the contraction is called mass contraction. Hope I was correct and clear, I'm currently studying physiology and we just finished GI last week. </p></div>		</li>
