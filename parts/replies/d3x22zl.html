<p>not so sure about that, both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighter_than_air#Methane" target="_blank">methane and hydrogen</a> - chief components of ass gas, are lighter than air. so over time we would expect them to rise into the upper atmosphere or perhaps react with O2 eventually. Although air is also a component of fart, so I guess it's possible.</p></div>		</li>
