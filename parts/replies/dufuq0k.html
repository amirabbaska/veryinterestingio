			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly doubt that has anything to do with it.  Population estimates don't tend to be made with census-like measurements, for one thing.  For another, while 40% population growth in a decade is a lot, it's not unprecedented.  The entire PLANET had a ~20% population growth per decade from 1960-1999 (leading to a doubling of world population in that period).  For a smaller area, 40% population growth could be achieved by some combination of lower rates of infant mortality and better medical care for people in middle and old age. </p>
<p><strong>Interestingly, Africa as a continent grew from 948 million in 2005 to 1,287 million in 2017, for an overall population growth rate of 35% during that period.</strong> So Ethiopia's not even much of an outlier. </p>
<p>Looking at Ethiopia specifically, the birth rate has actually been dropping since about 1990, but medical care has made the infant mortality rate drop far faster.  Just from 2005 to 2017 the under-five infant mortality rate dropped from 123/1000 to 88/1000, and the rate had been dropping for some time before 2005.</p>
<p>To look at it this way using rounder numbers for simplicity: for every 1000 live births you use to have ~880 make it to their 5th birthday.  Now you have ~930, so you've net gained ~50 people.  Of those ~50 people, ~25 will be women, who will go on to have ~4 children each (the birthrate in Ethiopia).  So a &quot;crop&quot; of 1000 births used to produce 440 women who would in their lifetime have 1760 children.  Now, that same crop produces 1860.  So your population increase has gone up 13% (1000 births used to yield 760 &quot;extra&quot; people on top of replacing their parents, now they yield 860) just from that drop in infant mortality.  Add onto that increase longevity so that more generations are living at any one time, and the fact that those 13% of extra people also go on to have 13% more people in an exponential fashion, and this kind of population increase isn't unbelievable. </p></div>		</li>
