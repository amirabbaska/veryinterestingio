			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder how different their sense of vision is from ours. We are so used, at least sighted people are, to think of an image and the thing seen as identical but perhaps in insects, vision only is for detecting movement and they do not have mental maps based on visual input -- they don't see &quot;things&quot; but rather just react to light by moving.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it seems plausible that some insects might have a visual sense closer to our own -- bees might be an example. It is hard to imagine that bees can learn from observation (as amazingly they apparently can) if they merely &quot;react&quot; to light.</p>
<p>(I realize the foregoing may not be very clear but I had just now thought how different vision might be in insects based on the OP.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans can see at least 400 'FPS' as well, though the term is slightly inaccurate when describing human vision. Look up fighter pilot vision testing. They'd be shown a 'static' image on a very high refresh rate monitor (over 300 Hz / fps IIRC, some as high as 600), and one frame would have a plane added. The pilots could reliably say when the plane blinked, and often could recognize the make and model off of it's silhouette for 0.25 of one percent of one second. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We think of an image and a thing as identical because we learned to think of the &quot;thing&quot; as what we see. We lose a lot of information relying on vision, and an hypothetical being with different senses could just as well look down on us with something like &quot;they only see the waves in a very specific wavelength and react based on that, I wonder how that is&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we clearly understand that the thing we see and touch are the same thing. This is a sophisticated sort of realization that one might think some creatures can't do but at the same time, apparently they can -- how can bees watch other bees do something and then do it themselves without understanding that they are watching bees and they too are bees - kind of amazing when you think carefully about this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, spiders seem to have &quot;main&quot; eyes as well as smaller eyes and I suspect that these small eyes are only to alert the spider of movement -- they do not &quot;mean&quot; to the spider than an object is there. This is all speculative in the extreme, I understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very informative, thank you for that response! Itâ€™s great to hear that the movie version of insect vision is wrong, I always wondered how that had any evolutionary advantage.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard something about this once before, but it didn't really stick. Yours was a very clear explanation, with a good example. Thank you! </p>
<p>However, I am incredibly curious <em>how</em> we know this. I can imagine studying the insect eye through a microscope, looking at its anatomy and chemical composition. But to find out how the signal is formed, you'd have to shine light into the (presumably non-dead) eye and measure the signals through the nerve? (do insects even have nerves like we do?). And then you still wouldn't know how this signal is processed by the brain, i.e. how an actual image is formed. </p>
<p>Very interesting stuff! </p></div>		</li>
