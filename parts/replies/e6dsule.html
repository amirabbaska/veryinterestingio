			<div class="markdown"><p>My firstborn son was a quiet baby. We could take him to nice restaurants as an infant. If he was fed and changed he wasn't an issue.</p>
<p>My next and last kid, our daughter, I was surprised she couldn't crack glass with how loud she could get. She'd scream loudly, then get louder, then louder, then louder until it was practically unimaginable.</p>
<p>I thought maybe the wife and I were just spoiled by how silent our son was. Then we took her for her first day of daycare and she started screaming, and in a building full of infants and toddlers other teachers came out of their rooms to figure out what the hell was making all that noise.</p>
<p>She's 8 now and an absolute angel to be around. But man those first few years were rough. </p></div>		</li>
