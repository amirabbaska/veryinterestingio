			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add there is a commercial launch company Orbital ATK which can launch small satellites from the belly of an airliner.</p>

<p>The advantages here being that an aircraft is controllable (vs balloons) and also has nonzero velocity, though small compared to orbital speed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rockets carry their oxidizer, jet engines don't. By using a plane you get to eliminate a bunch of oxidizer weight from the entire launch system, and the weight of that support structure and and weight of the oxidizer of fuel to carry that weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the energy saved by a higher starting position then you're entirely right that it's trivial.  However there are two effects that make starting from higher up a good idea.</p>
<p>First you don't have to worry about atmospheric drag on your ascent.  The pressure of the atmosphere has to be overcome by the rocket.  This takes fuel and the structural load means that the rocket has to be sturdier taking up more weight.</p>
<p>Also rockets generally have higher performance in lower pressure.  Looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(rocket_engine_family)" target="_blank">Merline</a> rocket engine used by SpaceX it has a thrust of 756 kN at sea leval and 825 kN in a vacuum.  And the version with an extended bell specifically designed for vacuum use has a thrust of 934 kN.  This is all for the same fuel flow so you would need 24% less fuel for the same impulse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how much of the liquid oxygen would be left after spending hours climbing to launch altitude? You'd be stuck with solid rockets or hypergolic fuels. Not all that practical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's a good reason not to use balloons.  There are really a whole host of reasons.  </p></div>		</li>
