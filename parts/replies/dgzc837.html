			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I've pondered before is when will we &quot;run out&quot; of melodies. There are only 12 notes. So there are 12 one note melodies, 144 two note melodies, 1,728 three note ones, up to about 61 billion 10 note melodies. </p>
<p>That seems like a lot, but consider that not all melodies are harmonious. A significant number of them can probably be discarded out of hand as being unusable. Too, considering the amount of music being generated, its not hard to imagine that at some point, every melody will have been used at least once in some song.</p>
<p>On a related note, I've often considered a form of copy right trolling where you use a program to generate all possible combination of English words of a given length, and (again, with a program) copyrighting each of them, and then suing basically everyone for copyright infringement. This would be time consuming to do by hand, but trivial with a program. It seems you could so something similar with music </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Single-&quot;length&quot; melodies quickly become amateur and boring.</p>
<p>When they do appear, they are usually offset by another thing, like played under a fast tempo, being the background support, or doing an arpeggio (notes of the chord; more emphasis on harmony than melody).</p>
<hr />
<p>Sing happy birthday with each syllable being the same duration. Annoying and unmemorable.</p>
<p>Now knock the song out on the table. Everybody recognizes it, despite no real melody. Pure rhythm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They all have the same basic rhythm, but the tempo continues rising, making each of them unique and fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If each song is 3 minutes long, and you listened to music 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for 100 years, you'd only hear ~17 million songs.</p>
<p>Realistically if you listened to four hours of original music every day for a 40-year career as a music producer, you'd barely hear a million songs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trent Reznor accidentally took the melody from David Bowie's &quot;Crystal Japan&quot; (a rare single he released in Japan in 1980) for the NIN song &quot;A Warm Place&quot;, thinking he came up with it. He was beside himself when he realized. Bowie didn't care, said he made that mistake all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, to be fair, the &quot;melody&quot; is just a natural climb up the scale, with a commonly employed slight repeat of the &quot;top notes&quot; at the end of the measure. i bet there are a lot of examples of it, just using a different instrument(s) and key. Bowie likely knew it, and could easily empathize. He was cool, after all.</p></div>		</li>
