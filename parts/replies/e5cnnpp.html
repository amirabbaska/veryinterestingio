			<div class="markdown"><p>I've probably used the wrong terminology, is acrylic lacquer more specific? I only meant to emphasise that clear coating works as a permanent solution.<br />
Or do real rock-hounds not clear coat at all? I haven't done it as a regular hobby, just for specific rocks I happened across and and wanted to keep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way to shine a rock is without any clear coat. Sand the fucking shit out of it, then polish. But rock polish isn't like nail polish and it's kinda dumb that we use the same word for them. Rock polish doesn't stay on the stone, its just a substance that you use to &quot;sand&quot; down the rock when you get to grits that are so high, sand paper becomes useless or impractical. As opposed to clear coat like nail polish. </p>
<p>The reason it's usually preferred is because it makes the rock shiny like, inherently. After polishing you have a shiny rock. Full stop. It might get scratched or something, but the surface of that rock is now so smooth it shines. After applying a clear coat you have a rough rock that looks shiny, but is actually covered by something that isn't rock. It's still a rough rock. Boil it, put it in alcohol, rub it too hard, and it'll lose the clear coat and thus it's shininess. Do the same to a polished rock and it'll still be shiny, though possibly temporarily made matte because steam and alcohol can be cloudy. </p>
<p>Wood needs lacquer after sanding and polishing because wood is soft and weak. Also, wood is way more porous than rocks, at least the rocks that look good shiny. And you need to fill those pores to make it really shine. But because rocks are hard and usually not very porous, they can be made just as shiny without the lacquer.</p>
<p>At least that's why I prefer it. All that said, rock hobbyists generally don't clear coat, but you can do whatever you want to your rocks. Given that sanding and polishing is a shit ton of work, it's reasonable to just coat them.</p>
<p>Edit: as to terminology, varnish and lacquer are different substances, so which to use when would depend on which of them you actually use for the finish. It's weird because they are both nouns and verbs. But if it's acrylic, it's a varnish. Finishing/clear coat are more general and probably better terms to use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The entire basis of enjoying rocks is because they are natural. They take a polish very well so tumbling or cabbing/faceting is the way to bring out the vibrance (though some &quot;purists&quot; may even dislike this). To put varnish on is to basically make it plastic and devalue it, let alone the nicer rocks would be assumed not authentic</p></div>		</li>
