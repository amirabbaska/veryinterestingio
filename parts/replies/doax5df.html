			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been 3 past eruptions, 2.1, 1.3, and 0.63 million years ago. That's 0.8 million between first and second, and 0.7 million to the most recent. Idk where you got 560,000 years from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response. I've read about the general warning signs that precede an eruption. In the case of mt. St. Helen highly unusual activity for the volcano was observed for two months prior to it's major eruption. I'm curious about the Yellowstone specific observation set that volcanologists would consider unusual and indicative of a pending eruption. For instance I've read that it's normal for Yellowstone to experience periodic earthquake swarms (2k+ over 1mo.). Most of them are bellow 1mg. What seismic activity would be considered abnormal for the area? Is there a visualization of the data set available to show trends in the regions seismic activity over its recorded history? Is similar information available for the deformation data? Geothermal outliers and trend data? </p></div>		</li>
