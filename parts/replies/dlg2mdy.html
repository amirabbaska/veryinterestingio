			<div class="markdown"><p>I have suffered from migraines for at least 15 years (I'm 29 now). I have to take 2 doses of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproate#Medical_uses" target="_blank">Valproate</a> a day. This does not stop the headaches but seems to reduce frequency and intensity. Personally I went from 3 or 4 migraines a week to 3 or 4 a month.</p>
<p>When I do feel a migraine coming (seeing spots, difficulty reading, difficulty holding my balance, ...) I have to take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolmitriptan" target="_blank">Zomig</a> ASAP or I will be out for 24-48 hours depending on several factors. After the migraine attack it can be difficult to concentrate up to 3 days after.</p>
<p>All this to say: migraine != headache. Don't confuse the two and be happy you don't suffer from migraines, only from headaches. :)</p>
<p>How do you know it's a migraine and not a headache? You can't really... Simplest is to just take an aspirin. Does it help? Congrads! You don't have a migraine. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait what? There's diet changes to help migraines? Why don't I know this!</p>
<p>I've had at least 1 a month for the past 5-6 years. I'm pregnant atm which means I can't take anything for them but they also become more frequent and more painful (higher blood volume). I need to learn these diet tricks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My neurologist gave me a 'migraine diet' which is basically a long list of foods to avoid and almost all of them are amazing.  I'll go find it and update this.
Okay I got my ass off the couch and found the list:
Common triggers include:
Cheese
Chocolate
Citrus fruits (fucking orange juice man - made that mistake before!)
Hot dogs (and other foods with nitrates)
Aspartame
MSG
Fatty foods
Ice cream
Caffeine
Alcoholic drinks (especially red wine, beer, brandy, whiskey)
Soybeans
Nuts
Yeast
Sauerkraut and other aged foods</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apart from the caffeine, I hardly have anything on that list if at all.
Even my caffeine intake has been drastically reduced (used to live on coffee, can't now I'm pregnant) but I will look up the nitrates. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea google it, you can find some easy stuff to avoid, or certain products to buy. Bacon is one - make sure if you eat bacon, to only buy bacon that says &quot;no nitrates or nitrites&quot;. Same for salami or cured meats. There are more, and you can experiment to see what works.</p>
<p>Also, I was surprised to find that taking hot showers helps - instead of cold. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard at a talk by a headache doctor that migraine is connected with the hormones. Thats why you suffer more as young, and why the attacks can follow the rythm of menstruation, and stop when they stop at a certain age.
And I got the impression that theres other kind of headaches, not all are variants of migraine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not quite right.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatriptan" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatriptan</a></p>
<p>&quot;Activation of these receptors causes vasoconstriction of those dilated arteries. &quot;</p>
<p>That and anecdotally I used imetrix injections and nasal spray to abort cluster headaches routinely. You don't get much time to know a cluster is coming on. Less than 5 minutes from first symptoms to full blown. Abortives were my only option and imetrix worked well for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2pm everyday for over a month. I could set a watch when I had a spell with cluster headaches. But the speed at which they come on is incredible.</p>
<p>I could never get the injections or spray from my doctors.  Asked about them loads but never offered them.</p>
<p>'for a while'  spot on for all treatment I've ever tried.</p></div>		</li>
