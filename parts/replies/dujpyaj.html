			<div class="markdown"><p>(Somebody please correct me if I am wrong), but I believe it is a similar story - It doesn't cause infection because it is <em>your</em> poop. Your body has encountered all those bacteria before and knows how to deal with them. </p>
<p>Try it with someone <em>else's</em> poop, and it I imagine it would be a different story. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone once asked this question on the explain like I'm five subreddit, and iirc the top comment was basically that in that area, your body knows there's poop &quot;just around the corner,&quot; so your immune system is on high alert there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's not true at all. Most UTIs are caused by your own poop getting into your pee hole. When my son was a newborn, this happened and it got all the way into his kidneys and blood.</p>
<p>The real reason poop doesn't usually cause a problem when it gets in a small cut is because most people have healthy immune systems that immediately kill the poop bacteria when it gets in the wrong place, even if it's yours. Blood also helps to flush it out. You can still get an infection if you get poop in a larger wound, or if your immune system isn't very good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In part thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_pressure" target="_blank">possitive pressure</a>, same way stuff from underground doesn't usually leech into the main water system. Since your body is constantly pumping blood, when you get a superficial cut the blood comes out of your body, instead of shit going in (most of the time, exceptions do happen of course) </p></div>		</li>
