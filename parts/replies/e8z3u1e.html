<p>These supporting cells do replicate more frequently than neurons do</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies neurons do replicate, even if infrequently, which also implies that a brain tumor made up of neurons is possible. Even if it is much more unlikely, has it ever happened? Would it be much different from the more commonly seen brain tumors involving glial or other supporting cells, or just be basically the same thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually doesn't occur in the brain, but actual neuron tumors do happen. Usually its in the hands/limbs and it is reportedly very very painful</p>
<p>Edit: Upon reading comments, rereading through my genetic disorders class notes, and doing a bit of research, it seems I have mixed a couple things together. </p>
<p>1) Neuron cancer, which is truly rare, usually exists in fetuses, where neurons are in normal cell cycle, which likely kills the fetus.</p>
<p>2) The guy with the hand pain was a metastasized cancer which grew a tendril into a nerve.</p>
<p>3) Adult neurons can exit g0 cell cycle if there is a genetic disorder/mutation.</p>
<p>Hope this clears everything up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The truth is, we aren’t really sure yet. At least in humans.</p>
<p>It has been shown that mice produce new neurons well into adulthood in two separate brain areas with two different methods of synthesis.</p>
<p>However, when these same studies are attempted on humans to determine if we produce neurons during our adult lives, the results have been more ambiguous.</p>
<p>So as for a tumor deriving from neural cells appearing in an adult human brain? That would require adult neurogenesis in humans and that’s something that’s still being researched and debated to this day.</p>
<p>I’m currently in an adult neurogenesis class and could provide some sources on the subject if anyone’s interested</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Just posting my reply further down this thread with sources</p>
<p>I finally got home so here's some context.</p>
<p>Two papers from <em>this year</em> have drastically different results.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324237643_Human_Hippocampal_Neurogenesis_Persists_throughout_Aging" target="_blank">Here</a> is a paper that claims to &quot;find persistent adult neurogenesis in humans into the eighth decade of life.&quot;</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/human-hippocampal-neurogenesis-drops-sharply-in-children-to-undet" target="_blank">this paper</a> concludes &quot;that recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans.&quot;</p>
<p>So yeah, there's a huge interest in understanding how neurons could be manipulated to help treat many major cognitive diseases but unfortunately, there's a long way to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This neuron tumor do happen called neuroma and neuroblastoma. But its usually in children. Most of neurons form during embryonic period.  Some neurons still replicate until 2-3 years of age thats when brain development stabilized and we just have more synapsis formation in-between preexisted neurons for the rest of our life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurons in particular exhibit what is called „neural plasticity“. While the cells don’t replicate, they can form new connections to other neurons by establishing new synapses, old connections can be broken down, and the strength of synapses can be altered. For example by changing the protein composition of the „receiving“ end of the synapse, the strength of the signal caused by neurotransmitter molecules can be altered in either direction.</p>
<p>These processes are actually the basis of learning and memory formation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain environmental conditions can changes in gene expression as well. I can't speak to the extent that, say, a neuron may change, but x binds to y on the cell which causes a signal cascade in which a portion of DNA is transcribed and translated resulted in a phenotypic change (or rather a change in what proteins are expressed/prpduced and to what extent)</p></div>		</li>
