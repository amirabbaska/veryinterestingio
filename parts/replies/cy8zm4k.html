			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much in line with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysSgG5V-R3U" target="_blank">benign violation theory</a>. Also worth noting that control over environment as you illustrated above is possibly the root of fear as well, which has been postulated as a negative response resulting from ambiguities in environment. It drives us away from things that are too out of our control. Contrast that with laughter, which drives us toward things <em>in</em> our control. A lot of it seems to be about security. Those who are most secure survive to pass on their way of intelligently responding to the world around them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for that. I often forget how important the idea of Control is in your psyche, so a reminder that it is always about control helps me connect pieces I wouldn't normally relate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The false alarm concept makes so much sense. I like the analogy of farming humor. So stand up comedy is, the evolutionary equivalent to, french fries. Free samples at Costco are, the equivalent to, a laugh track. </p>
<p>I wonder if the visual appearance of danger, when someone is stabbing at your rib cage, but not hurting you, gets us to send the message of laughter out to our people so they won't feel the need to beat the tickler in the head with a rock. Unless you're my wife who, normally docile, will somehow manage to kick you in the face if you try the old tickle monster routine on her. The more I think about it, having tickley ribs is probably just a side effect. Ha! Get it?! A side effect! (Because your ribs are on the sides of your body.)    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you have a very good point! Why do we get ticklish?</p>
<p>I could imagine that without a tickle reflexes, touching other people could be risky. You come up on your good buddy Greg and give him a good rib tickle. Instead of feeling light pleasure and laughing at this obviously harmless display, he feels, instead, a THREAT ON HIS LIFE, so he turns and bashes you in the head with a rock. But we're social people. Killing people you're supposed to be close to kind of ruins the advantages of being social, so I imagine those that had a way to distiguish between threatening touch and non-threatening touch did better. And so, this habit of laughing when someone tickles us perpetrates until it's just a species-wide phenomenon.</p>
<p>Then you get those, like you're wife, who take major offense at being tickled. I imagine in their past, some unwitting participant probably tickled them to the point of discomfort, and they subconsciously relate tickling to that unfortunate experience. Now, to avoid feeling discomfort, they revolt against any act of tickling.</p>
<p>But why, then, can some people seem to control their reaction? I've known several people who couldn't be tickled, except by certain people. Could it be related to trust? If you trust a person, you don't expect harm, and so you allow the false alarm to ring true. But if you don't trust a person, that threat exists, and it prevents you from feeling the tickle as you should, instead you're subconsciously waiting for the threat.</p>
<p>My sister, when I was younger, used to be able to get me to laugh just be making a tickling motion at me. Even at a distance, it would get me to laugh. I wonder what that was all about.</p></div>		</li>
