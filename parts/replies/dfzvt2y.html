			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I had a hard time figuring out where I stand on these sorts of things, since I consider myself pretty left-wing, but I also believe very strongly that censorship is a slippery slope, and that the standards, freedoms, and ideals I want my country to uphold should apply to everyone, not just people exactly like me. If I want the government to censor people I don't like, who's to say they won't get to thinking that I should be muzzled too? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, though I felt that it was important to focus specifically on the US end of things, since that has had a massive influence on how we deal with freedom of speech issues. </p>
<p>Prejudice is everywhere, and every country deals with it in their own way. Right now, I'm talking about how the US deals with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really appreciate your perspective on the matter. I am one of those who is thankful for free speech on the side of &quot;offense&quot;. Oftentimes, as I'm sure you would agree (even if just some of the time), the truth or the reality is difficult to stomach. </p>
<p>I believe on the other hand that there is another  (generational) pull that is at play: people are (<em>either</em>) more sensitive and more free now to express their sensitivities, and therefore it is made apparent that to that group of people (that many would rather be on the fringe) feelings/emotions weigh far greater than the facts/reason/logic/even the science (*OR they are correct that the right and libertarians are truly fascist, bigoted, islamaphobic c*****).</p>
<p>That is why people, particularly on the right or traditional liberals (like Dave Ruben), are just fed up with this new, observably &quot;left-wing&quot; sensitivity, and people are willing to raise up as their ideological banners individuals such as Gavin McInnes who say things like: <em>It really is fine to fight these pussy-hat-wearing, overly sensitive, non-establishment anti-Fa</em>.  Although a lot of his views are scoffed at for being radical, many don't see this side of his views as ridiculous (myself included).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also just easier to air your views these days. Back before the internet and social media, if you wanted people outside of your friends and family to hear the crazy shit (or not so crazy shit) you think about the state of the world, you had to write strongly worded letters to the paper, or go to the park and yell. You had to be really, really dedicated and passionate to make your voice heard. Now Aunt Mildred can tell everyone she knows what she thinks of the gays. Now Cousin Kaitlynn can tell 50,000 people on Twitter why Gavin McInnes is a misogynistic a-hole, and it takes zero effort or real dedication to do so. So it's like the free speech sandbox just suddenly expanded exponentially, and everyone has very strong feelings about it, since it's their views and mindsets and &quot;this is how things are/ought to be&quot; at stake. So now Cousin Kaitlynn is an over-sensitive feminazi instead of a college student who's learning to form opinions and becoming more confident about speaking her mind. Aunt Mildred is an irredeemable bigot instead of an elderly woman who's not sure how to deal with a society she no longer recognizes or feels she belongs to. </p>
<p>Also, I'm not much of a fan of Gavin McInnes, but yeah, he has the right to oppose liberal feminists and argue his beliefs. I disagree with him because I'm a liberal feminist, but he gets to disagree with me too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fair. Are these people real people for you? haha. Felt like a legit narrative.</p>
<p>I do like McInnes, but I know where he's abrasive to others and where I disagree with him. But you absolutely have the right to oppose him or whomever you wish, absolutely (purposefully redundant).</p>
<p>Just a reminder that many feminazis these days <em>are</em> in fact college students. Some might say it's a breeding ground for that (not saying I would know personally thoughâ€”we had a pretty fair balance of cultural and racial diversity at the state university I attended).</p></div>		</li>
