			<div class="markdown"><p>Great reply, thank you. Still, $20B in cash on hand even from short term investment vehicles is pretty wild. </p>
<p>I am fortunate enough later in life to have dollars to invest and I am constantly on the lookout for anything that can provide a decent return. I guess if I had $20B people may be more inclined to offer me more than 1% on my money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The size of the overall financial market is staggering, so even $20B is just a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. The US bond market is just over $40 trillion and stock market about $30 trillion, so that's $70 trillion for the US alone. Many multinational companies have investments all over the world too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you are really investing if you are getting 1% return.  That sounds like a money market account, which is FDIC insured and as such doesn't really count as an investment.  Its really a way to soften the impact of inflation.  Investing in a low fee index fund (i.e. vangaurd) is the most accessible way to invest smartly.  Look up warren buffet's Index vs hedge fund bet.  You should be able to get average 7% returns with a long enough time horizon (5-10+ years)</p></div>		</li>
