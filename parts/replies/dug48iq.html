			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to frequent a little shop run by a nice Korean couple, and the guy would always wear a face mask when he was sick out of politeness to his customers. (I live in southern California).</p>
<p>I also encountered it in customer service a handful of times, and if the subject came up it was almost always &quot;I don't want to get other people sick&quot; type of thing, but I've certainly run into a couple people that admitted to doing it out of fear of getting sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a person who touches my face a lot I would also imagine it’s a great way to prevent yourself from catching anything. You can’t just mindlessly wipe your nose or touch your mouth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a thread not too long ago -- I think in r/askscience -- that stated they were likely not very effective.  IIRC the arguments were:</p>
<ul>
<li>most viruses and bacteria don't tend to spread through the air.  Most of the time infections come from rubbing your eyes, mouth, or nose or from eating after getting the pathogens on your hands.</li>
<li>face masks are better at blocking incoming particles than outgoing, but the trend is to wear them while sick rather than trying to prevent illness.</li>
<li>the ability to block incoming particles by a meaningful amount depends on a certain specification of the mask, which most masks won't meet.</li>
<li>even if the mask is of the right type, if it's not the right fit or not worn correctly then it's unlikely to be effective.</li>
</ul>
<p>The recommendation was to adopt better hand washing habits as it would be much more effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the masks I see them wearing are the type I use when cutting wood, etc. (dust masks) to keep from breathing in those fine particles. You still breathe in some from the perimeter of the mask, but it's minimal.</p>
<p>The only way they'd help sickness from spreading is if you sneezed or something. Sneezing into your elbow does basically the same thing.</p>
<p>You'd actually need to wear a <strong>respirator</strong> that could filter out the tiny particulates you can't see. They have different levels of filtration, so you'd have to do your research.</p>
<p>Get your damn flu shots and stuff though, people!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely pollution is a part of it. I bought masks off Amazon for woodworking, and for years after I would get someone asking once a month or so if they we'd good for filtering out pollution.</p>
<p>Honestly they were cheap and sucked at filtering sawdust. I cant imagine smog wouldn't get in easily. </p></div>		</li>
