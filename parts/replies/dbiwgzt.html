			<div class="markdown"><p>cAMP is cyclic adenosine monophosphate. It's made from ATP, adenosine triphosphate, by the enzyme called adenylyl cyclase. ATP is the universal energy currency within cells, so there's lots of it around to use. Adenylyl cyclase is activated by what's known as a G protein-coupled receptor, or GPCR. This is found spanning the cell membrane, so can bind to messenger molecules such as hormones (including adrenaline) if they come into contact. Binding of a molecule outside triggers the trimeric (3 part) G protein subunits found coupled to the GPCR inside the cell to become dissociated so they can go off and do different things.</p>
<p>In the situation we're talking about, the GPCR's Gs subunit activates adenylyl cyclase. cAMP acts as a second messenger (with the extracellular signal being the first messenger), and an increased concentration of it means that it will bind to more proteins. These cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). The &quot;kinase&quot; means that it can phosphorylate other proteins (including ones to convert glycogen, an energy storage molecule that's basically lots of glucose strung together, back into something more glucose-y that can be used to provide energy), and this modifies their action. </p></div>		</li>
