<p>Isn't necessarily true? It isn't true at all. The gap between planets we can see/detect/hear/spectrally analyze and planets we can reasonably travel to is <strong>huge</strong>. If moving off Earth were our only goal, we'd need to look no further than Mars right now. We haven't even gotten a human there, yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many science futurists think if we hollowed out an asteroid kilometers long, create an environment that can sustain life, and develop a fusion based propulsion system that collects hydrogen from space to slowly accelerate to relativistic velocities, it's theoretically possible to send a colony of humans where generations would live and die in transit to another world. Obviously there are many challenges to overcome, but it's not impossible.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Both an interstellar seed and carrier warship, Sidonia is one of the many seed carrier ships that houses the surviving remains of humanity after the destruction of Earth by the Gauna. In a elongated octagonal shape, seemingly built right out of an asteroid, it has two massive boosters on the rear as its propulsion. However, since there's minimal spacial resistance for movement, the ship mostly relies on inertial drift for travel. Suggestively, Sidonia doesn't have any advanced FTL (Faster Than Light) capabilities. </p>
<p>Within the ship, Sidonia is a limited self-sustainable colony. Even though the colony is self-sustainable at extended periods, they are not unlimited in resources in food and materials. To remedy human food consumption, scientists modified every citizen capable of photosynthesis to limit their need for food.</p>

Sending autonomous craft to a planet, with the basic building blocks to assemble and grow a being in an artificial system which has been customized to be suitable for the environment found, rather than sending generations of living people, animals, and all other systems required.</p>
<p>Ikea has the right idea: flatpack the human race for shipping. Have something assemble it on the other side and hope none of the pieces go missing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very na√Øve to imagine that the &quot;current level of global technology&quot; is the actual level of technology. </p>
<p>The F-14 tomcat is an aircraft that entered service in 1970. That means it was built and designed 7 to 10 years before that.
It had the world's first microprocessor integrated into it. </p>
<p>This is the same microprocessor that Intel &quot;invented&quot; circa 1974. </p>
<p>I'm just saying, the actual level of technology in the classified &quot;black projects world&quot; is at least 10 or 15 years ahead of what we commonly think of as advanced modern technology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even looking further into the future the distances are absolutely huge, and potentially insurmountable. As an example, Kepler 186f - a nearby planet with an earthlike radius in the habitable zone of a star - orbits a star that is 490 lightyears away.</p>
<p>That journey is 490 years away if we travel the speed limit the whole way. So far the fastest we have ever travelled is just under 25,000 mph on the Apollo 10 return flight. At that speed, the journey to Kepler 186f would take more than 13 million years. </p>
<p>This is not to say we will never travel those distances - we will discover things nearer to home, our technology will improve, and perhaps we will even discover some form of FTL travel using wormholes or such. But we have a long way to go.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, this part isn't necessarily true. The search isn't primarily focused on finding another planet for humanity to move to. Simply finding another planet that supports life, even if we could never get there, would be one of the biggest scientific discoveries ever made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't forget, even if we managed to make it to a planet that we could possibly inhabit, there are still risks. For instance, the possibility of this planet containing bacteria and virus' that our bodies haven't had an opportunity to acclimate to over generations of exposure could potentially wipe out any attempted colonists rather quickly. So even by our metrics for what we consider life, it may be the things we <em>can't see</em> right away that could do the most harm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. Viruses rarely cross over on Earth. Rabies and Influenza being notable exceptions. HIV crossed over what appears to be a few times in human history. Influenza often swaps over between birds and pigs, but remember that humans, birds, and pigs all have a common ancestor if you go back far enough. We aren't that different, biologically speaking. Hell, we take pieces of pig hearts and sew them onto human hearts every single day in this country. But when was the last time we heard of the Portabella strain of Influenza? A virus that nearly wiped out a mushroom population, and now is infecting humans. Never happened, because our biology is so different.</p>
<p>Bacteria, on the other hand, COULD potentially infect us. I mean, bacteria don't necessarily need a host, like virii, just a food source. And if they are carbon based, there is a decent chance that they will be able to work with the same carbon based molecules we use for energy. And there is also a decent chance that the chemicals they release could very well be toxic to us. This is actually generally how bacterial infections kill us here on Earth. It's not the bacteria directly, it's their waste products or the chemicals inside them that get released when they rupture (endotoxins). These are what cause cavities and septic shock. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not saying it wouldn't be beneficial to us in some practical way, but usefulness (especially immediate usefulness) is not a required factor (though it may be a <em>contributing</em> factor) in what makes a discovery profound, interesting, or important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it useful to know a moldy sandwich you threw in the trash killed the stuff on the petri dishes you had in there? </p>
<p>Penicillin. </p>
<p>The usefulness of stuff isn't always immediately apparent, and that goes double for stuff that seems really obscure. Knowing you can make small electrical currents from magnets was pretty useless in the 1800's, but now it's the basis for our communications and information storage. </p>
<p>Similarly, knowledge of an entirely separate evolutionary timeline may seem pretty useless, but there's a lot of stuff we'd be able to tell if we were able to detect life <em>at all</em> somewhere else. Like, 'life can exist under conditions XYZ'. Or 'we should aim to land on <em>that</em> planet, because there's stuff there'. Or when we arrive 'okay cool, so there's actually a whole different way cells can work, such that we can maybe make unicellular organisms that move energy in a different method, sustaining much greater masses'. </p>
<p>Also, what /u/gliph said, but if you want a 'what could this mean' answer - there you go.</p></div>		</li>
