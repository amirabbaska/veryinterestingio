			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, yes, that's possible.  There is a <em>lot</em> of space outside of the Kuiper belt but still within the gravitational influence of the sun.  There could be several small planets out there.  The wide field infrared survey has ruled out anything as large as Saturn or bigger, though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uranus and Neptune both have surfaces, too. They are giant balls of ice with thick atmospheres, and far beneath all that ice is a rocky core about the same mass as Earth.</p>
<p>They are not gas giants, and they are not rocky planets. They are somewhere in between, and frozen over. They are frequently classified as &quot;ice giants&quot; for this reason.</p>
<p>Edit: a few people have pointed out that I've taken the word &quot;ice&quot; too literally in my readings on this subject. The &quot;ice&quot; on Neptune and Uranus is probably high pressure liquid that just sort of sloshes around with no real distinction between it and the atmosphere. Really, I blame the astronomers. They probably decided to call these liquids &quot;ices&quot; on purpose so that they could have fun correcting people on reddit, haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To find this planet they're going to have to take a lot of long exposure images of a good chunk of the sky.  They will likely find quite a few other objects in that region while they look for it.  Some will possibly be in the Kuiper belt, and others could be like Sedna and Eris, and be in the space past the Kuiper belt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's the other way around: Planet IX's existence is currently being inferred from the movements of other Kuiper belt objects. So to find additional planets this way, we'd need more Kuiper belt objects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Just because it's far from the sun doesn't mean it can't be hot itself. We know it isn't, but for its mass it would need to be a gas giant about Neptune's size, which means it has enough mass to pressurize the lower levels and its core to keep it hot. Along with that, it's fluctuation of gravity as it approaches and retreats from Sol are enough to give it some internal movement like our own core because of tidal pulls from the Luna. We've ruled out anything of Saturn's size or larger because it's heat signature would be measurable without really looking for it, but the mass it would require for the calculations to work would place it somewhere between Neptune and Uranus in size, and therefore gaseous and about 20% cooler than we've been searching for.</p>
<p>On top of which, space isn't cold. Cold isn't a thing, its a lack of heat, which means the energy must transfer somewhere. There is no medium for it to transfer, so an object in space loses heat by losing its own mass. Space stations have to worry about cooling from all the instruments and body heat, not staying warm like you see in movies. Now eventually, after several billion years between galaxies a planet earth's size could lose all its heat energy, but not one still circling a star, and nothing will reach absolute zero on its own until the heat death of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand recent reports that I've read correctly, the biggest reason we haven't found more planets beyond Pluto is simply because there isn't enough light to see that anything at that distance by current means.  So, yes, I'd say it's very possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of this size, no. The likelihood of this happening once and just figuring it out is very small, but there could be several dozen earth sized or smaller ones without effecting the numbers in any significant way.</p></div>		</li>
