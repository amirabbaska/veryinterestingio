<p>One technical point: I'm not sure that &quot;some nuclei that should not be able to fission will suddenly fission without any apparent cause&quot; is quite accurate. As you've said, the way spontaneous fission works is not really a mystery: a neutron tunnels out of one nucleus and if there are a lot of fissionable nuclei around, then some of those other guys fission. </p>
<p>The spontaneous nature of the fission has to do with the source of the neutrons. 252Cf will fission just as well whether you shoot a lot of neutrons at it or wait for neutrons to tunnel out.</p>
<p>But, as you say, this is a pretty sticky concept to explain :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer thank you. I was wondering since so little of it is made annually, how much is used per application? For instance, how much californium  would I need to start a nuclear reactor, or is used to find oil deposits? </p></div>		</li>
