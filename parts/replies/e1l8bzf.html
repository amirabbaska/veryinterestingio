			<div class="markdown"><p>Is what the same?  Changing the volume in the analog path is better regardless of the device or what quality DAC it has.  So if you're asking about headphones/earbuds plugged into a smartphone the same concept applies in that you'd want to use the volume adjust on the headphones as that is an analog signal.<br />
As for the built-in speakers it would depend on if the software adjusts the volume digitally as it leaves the DAC or if it can control the gain on the amplifier, the latter being preffered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep yep, asking about headphone plugged into smartphones, or in my case, I use a small portable analog headphone amp, usually I keep 70-80 on the phone and use the amp to attenuate, but maybe now I'll turn the phone's line out further up. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>
