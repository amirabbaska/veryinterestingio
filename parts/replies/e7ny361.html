			<div class="markdown"><p>Our capabilities are already quite absurd. The term that's used most regularly to determine an aircrafts ability to hide its self is its radar cross-section and the smaller the cross section, the better it is at avoiding detection.</p>
<p>An F-18 has a cross-section of about 1m^2, while an F-35 has a cross-section of about 0.005m^2 (about the size of a golf ball) and a B-2 stealth bomber has a cross-section of about 0.0001m^2 (about the size of a bumble bee).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stealth is both radar absorbent material and shaping the airframe to ensure less radio energy.   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In atmo, it's much easier to &quot;cloak&quot; an airframe because even IR is dampened by the air.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Designers are not finished, they reduced the radar cross sections of airplanes and ships by orders of magnitude (that's a power of ten for each order of magnitude) - and that was with 1970's tech and flat faceted shapes.</p>
<p>With supercomputers and newer materials there is still ways to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but its <em>very</em> unlikely that they'll ever make something that works against all possible radar wavelengths.</p>
<p>Most stealth coatings are aimed at modern high frequency radars, against which they can work fairly well under ideal circumstances ie no rain or snow, plane not using data links, radios, radar transmitters etc.</p>
<p>But much older radars with lower frequency emmisions can still detect them quite well. Thats how that F-117 was shot down; stealthy to modern stuff but <em>not</em> to older Soviet sets.</p>
<p>The Serbs were very clever, they also used microwave ovens with their safety switches jigged so they'd operate with the door open to bait US anti-radar missiles. Worked quite well apparently and a very good trade - swapping a £20 microwave for a £500k missile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the stealth works on the basis of deflection, wouldnt the plane be visible to radar from particular angles? The f117, e.g. is noticeably flat on the bottom. So if it made a hard bank to one side, thereby exposing its underbelly, wouldnt it show up on an operators screen?</p></div>		</li>
