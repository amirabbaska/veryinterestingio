<p>There are two space ships leaving Jupiter at the same time, heading towards earth. Assume Jupiter is 600,000,000 km from Earth. </p>
<p>Ship A is going 290,000 km/s</p>
<p>Ship B is going 280,000 km/s</p>
<p>It should take Ship A 2068 sec to travel 600 mil km (elapsed time at body T0)</p>
<p>It should take Ship B 2142 sec to travel 600 mil km (elapsed time at body T0)</p>
<p>According to this time dilation calculator:</p>
<p><a href="http://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1224059993" target="_blank">http://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1224059993</a></p>
<p>The elapsed time of earth observer T would be...</p>
<p>T = 8157 s for Ship A</p>
<p>T = 5994 s for Ship B</p>
<p>Paradoxically it looks like the slower ship would arrive first. What am I missing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you used the formula the wrong way round.</p>
<p>The 2068/2142 sec are actually what earth/jupiter/outsider measure. So ship A arrives first.</p>
<p>Now you solve for the other T (multiply by gamma instead of dividing), and you get the times measured on the ship. In words: &quot;The passengers will experience the flight as much shorter than it actually was&quot;. Because ship A is faster, the effect is stronger, making the flight even 'more shorter' than before.</p>
<p>A: 524 s</p>
<p>B: 766 s</p>
<p>note: this calculator is meant to be used for the following scenario: on earth we play a game of soccer (takes 90 minutes). jebediah watches the game from his spaceship and on his clock it took 200 minutes as his clock is ticking faster.</p></div>		</li>
