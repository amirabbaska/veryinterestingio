<p>Here's a cool graph showing the effect of density on gravity:

<p>No, that's not true. If you are at some point inside a sphere of constant density, adding more matter to the sphere at a greater distance from the center than your current location will have <em>exactly zero</em> effect on the gravitational field where you currently are (assuming the addition of mass keeps the whole thing spherical and doesn't change the density anywhere). This was proven by Gauss for electrical fields and is taught in every university-level electricity and magnetism physics class, and the result can be generalized to gravitational fields.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to disagree. Since we're talking about water on the surface of a earth we know that it's going to approximately conform to the spherical shape of the earth, which will give the effect of a shell of mass around the object. And an object doesn't feel any force from within a spherical shell shell. This also applies to electric fields. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it would decrease the pressure somewhat, as the gravitational field from the mass above would cancel some of the gravitational field from the mass below. </p>
<p>So the ocean would need to be deeper than the first approximation suggests, but would probably still fall within the range I posted.</p></div>		</li>
