			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot to mention how hydrazine is insanely toxic and carginogenic. &quot;Devils propellant&quot; is what the Russians called it. And then proceeded to build a rocket (Proton K-M) that burns hundreds of tons of the stuff in atmosphere. Except no rocket burn is perfectly balanced so every launch releases large quantities of hydrazine in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>NASA and the ESA are more environmentally and safety conscious and never used hydrazine in atmosphere while trying to limit its use as much as possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know why but I immediately thought of the CDC in the walking dead.  It's kind of a sad thought :/</p></div>		</li>
