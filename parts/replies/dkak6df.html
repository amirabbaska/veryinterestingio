			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is people have different sensitivity of the certain (D2) dopamine receptor. People with certain mutation of the gene (DRD2) coding that thing are more prone to become alcoholics. I supposed the behaviour you describe is (at least partly) defined by that gene. Or similar gene and similar neurochemical thins.
