			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! It blows my mind how much we don't know about the human body, nutrition, and the like. I was amazed to learn that we don't really know what muscle knots are, or what causes them. I can feel if there's a knot in your muscle, and I may be able to make it go away, but all the doctors in the world can't explain what's actually happening in the body.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd put my money on a knot simply being a bundle of muscle fibers that's contracted more than the surrounding tissue. That's what I assume in my answer, but I'm not sure even that's actually known for certain. And the question of *why* it's contracted is still a mystery. Trigger point theory predicts that metabolic byproducts build up where the motor nerve meets the muscle, screwing up the signal, but research has thrown this into doubt.</p>
<p>Note that this isn't one of those &quot;it's weird, we don't know how it could happen&quot; mysteries, but rather &quot;it's a complex system with lots of parts, and there are so many reasons a 'knot' might form that we don't know which one it is!&quot; sort of mystery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we even know there is such a thing as a &quot;knot&quot;? In my experience, massage therapists will jab at a nerve running over a bone and call it a &quot;knot.&quot; Is there any kind of attempt to objectively identify a &quot;knot&quot; in muscle tissue?</p></div>		</li>
