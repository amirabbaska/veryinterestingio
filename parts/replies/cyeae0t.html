<p>We are making headway on the problems in 3D bioprinting, but I would give it 10 years to prototype, and 18-20 years to therapy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anything medical, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed" target="_blank">NBCI's PubMed</a> is probably the first place to look. It's a search engine of published abstracts and aside from a slight weakness in the early computational work is pretty good. Usually helps if you know the medical name for what you're looking for too. Bear in mind a lot of very early work is also indexed there so even if a result is there, unless it's a late stage trial, don't expect it to be available. It also may not work as described, or not deliver the results advertised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rejection isn't the issue, the issue is that just chucking in a piece of hylaine cartilage into a space where it's not naturally built into the lattice work of already present cartilage.</p>
<p>Plugging a gap will never be as strong as naturally grown cartilage and the risk Is that the weaker form of cartilage, fibrocartilage, will form along the fault lines between the original and transplanted cartilage. This weak spot can shear under everyday stress and is not a viable cartilage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about stem cells? If you inject them into the cartilaginous matrix shouldn't they then become part and parcel of it, and secrete their own matrix components, thus creating new structure that's completely integrated with the old structure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was oversimplifying things by saying it was just glue and fibers! Cartilage really is an incredible material that can withstand high load, compressive force, is strong, is wear resistant &amp; is flexible. Imagine a sponge that could withstand being compressed, lasted for decades and was incredibly tough and strong while still being flexible. The knee for example may be called on to carry five times or more your body weight and flex thousands of times a day. The miracle material that makes that knee work day after day acting as a kind of universal shock absorber and lubricant is cartilage. There are different classes of fibers, proteins and they all add strength, flexibility etc. They're all available in different concentrations and arrangements throughout cartilage. So theres one layer of coton thread in lines glued with Elmer's glue, another layer of steel cable with superglue arranged in a weave, a cotton layer in a different pattern glued with Elmer's Glue and Duck tape. All these different materials and arrangements conspire to make a wear resistant shock absorber that is difficult to copy exactly. Furthermore it is also difficult to find a material that can replicate its functionality.  3D printing lets you make almost any shape, this does not mean that these shapes are functional and if these shapes would have to be made up of many different materials then new 3D printing technologies will have to be developed to do this. There are also more issues apart from rejection. Current thinking points to the repaired cartilage to have to be 3D printed in place. This would require much faster 3D printers that can be used to print directly ontop of/in the patient. These will have to be developed and then certified. Certification and testing of these procedures would even if it were possible to demonstrably 3D print living cartilage without rejection issues in situ today take years if not decades.  Breakthroughs may happen. This is in my opinion one of the largest single business opportunities in 3D printing so much research is and will be conducted on commericializing this. Eventually a solution will be found if only because 70% or more of people over 70 in OECD countries could benefit from a reliable cartilage repair and replacement technology. Eventually this will be a solvable challenge but it may take many years because cartilage is such a complex material that copes with many challenges simultaneously. </p></div>		</li>
