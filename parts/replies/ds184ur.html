			<div class="markdown"><p>At night the relative humidity is usually higher because of the temperature drop, and you may also have some slight condensation on the insulators. The additional water in the air, and possible water on the insulators, reduces how good the insulators insulate so you get more leakage of electrical current making that sound. On a really foggy night I have even seen insulators periodically flash over, which probably clears them of their condensed water and they continue working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The humidity makes it easier for the electricity to get through the air, making the discharge worse. I personally haven't noticed cold temperatures to be that significant of a difference, but dew developing on the insulators may also increase the discharge (with a cold change). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, it's probably just the water in the air condensing when the temperature drops. I'll have to observe what happens next time it rains, but I usually only hear it when I have the windows down in the car, and that clearly doesn't happen when it rains. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some places are more likely to experience temperature inversion at night. In this condition ambient noise is concentrated at ground level. Add to that reduced nighttime noise from other sources and leafless trees in the winter (leaves dampen sound) and you have conditions that may allow you to hear very subtle noises at great distances. Not sure if this is what you are experiencing, but it's worth knowing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it's the sound of the shock wave due to the breakage of the dielectric strength of air. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that’s a good way to describe it, ‘baby lightning’ as there are small arcs forming where the air breaks down from voltage.  (3,000,000 V/m is the voltage required to arc through air)</p></div>		</li>
