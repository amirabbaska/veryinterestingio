			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I've come to understand. Passenger-experienced jerk is minimized in amusement park rides like roller coasters, etc.</p>
<p>EDIT: Maybe it's maximized? Or perhaps there is a target/optimal value for which the ride design engineers aim. Forgive me for my anecdotal involvement here...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps it helps if we think about acceleration as force because, after all, the force required to cause that acceleration is directly proportional. (F=ma)</p>
<p>In the simplest case of when the coaster is speeding up, a constant acceleration (or constant force) pins the occupants to their seats through an unchanging force.  If instead the force were to start low and steadily increase, then it may start off extremely weak (and boring) and/or become a bit uncomfortable when reaching higher and ever-increasing levels of force.  In short, there may be a very short window of having an increasing force that is both fun and safe for the occupants.  On the other hand, constant acceleration at a comfortable level would allow the ride to be designed with a constant force at a safe level.  In my vague recollection of those roller coasters that are known for their super fun take-offs, I would think the increasing force during at least initial acceleration is what creates a far bigger thrill than a constant one.  As /u/rmxz may have implied, that thrill would require a positive (non-zero) jerk.</p>
<p>Now what if that force starts off at a comfortable and fun level for a little bit as the ride speeds up and then decreases for a little while and then increases again?  During that decreased force, the ride would still be increasing in velocity; the occupants would still be pinned to their seats but with slightly less force.  It's like if somebody were pushing you from behind with a certain force, suddenly reduced that amount of force, and then suddenly increased it again.  That certainly would create a jerking motion and feeling -- and I imagine that would be neither thrilling or comfortable.  That scenario would require a jerk that fluctuates between positive and negative values.</p>
<p>I'll let others assess how this might apply to turns, which are also changes in velocity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>?</p>
<p>I'd have thought <del>maximized</del>, or at least carefully selected to some pretty high value.</p>
<p>Jerk is what provides the excitement of a sharp unexpected sudden turn. </p>
<p>Minimizing jerk would make every turn - even those with painfully large acceleration(== g-forces) - boring because they were anticipated.</p>
<p>But rapidly changing acceleration - like a sudden dropoff, or a sharp right following a gradual left turn - that's what makes roller coasters more interesting than driving to the amusement park.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jerk is super important in internal combustion engine design - not for the reason you think - cams open valves in four stroke motors, and springs close the valves. Cam profiles are designed to minimize jerk, and the amount of jerk in a cam profile directly affects the strength of the spring needed to keep the valve following the cam. Create a cam profile with too much jerk at redline, and you need a heavier spring which saps more power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically Jackson chapter 17 (2nd edition) stuff. </p>
<p>Accelerating charges emit radiation, which exerts a force back on the particle. When you write out the equations in the most straightforward way from the standpoint of classical electrodynamics (the Abraham-Lorentz equation of motion), then you end up with problems: either the existence of unphysical solutions to the equations of motion (if written in differential form) or &quot;pre-acceleration&quot; that violates causality (if written in integro-differential form).</p>
<p>This isn't a purely academic problem, incidentally. With facilities like those of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Light_Infrastructure" target="_blank">ELI-NP</a>, high power lasers will soon reach intensities where such back-reactive forces are no longer ignorable in the laser-plasma dynamics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The self energy of point particles and other weird phenomena involving accelerating point particles are not really well understood. As Griffiths said in one of his textbooks, perhaps it's a sign that point charges aren't very physical in classical EM. Analogous issues arise in QED, but afaik it's not as big of an issue when you're tasked to calculate things.</p>
<p>Also, Maxwellian or electrodynamic fluids (i.e. plasma) isn't what I would call &quot;solved&quot;, despite being entirely classical. Turbulence!</p></div>		</li>
