			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought baking soda is only good if you mix it with vinegar. A surfactant would work better than an abrasive and surfactants usually end up down most drains when we wash our hands. If you wanted something alkaline, bleach would probably work much better and be more cost effective.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little bit of vinegar or citric acid helps, but it's not really necessary - boiling water is enough. Baking soda decomposes starting with 50 Â°C. Besides, it's slightly acidic environment in kitchen drain anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do keep min in fridge &amp; then use it for other purposes (not baking) it still works. One of thing I do is put it down drains with some vinegar, I've unclogged drains that way. Vinegar &amp; baking soda work miracles together, I've cleaned toilet bowl stains, burnt pans, etc. I also use as a less toxic scrubbing medium to Comet/Ajax. I buy big boxes at $ Store.</p></div>		</li>
