			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, Sister Cities may often have something in common (a common industry, a common travel route, a common interest, etc). When they partner, they can use their relationship to pursue their mutual commonalities together. </p>
<p>An example: </p>
<p>Lexington, Kentucky, is the &quot;Horse Capital of the World&quot; for <a href="http://www.visitlex.com/about/horse-capital-of-the-world/" target="_blank">many reasons</a>. Horse racing is huge in Kentucky, with both Louisville and Lexington hosting world-famous races.
Lexington has <a href="https://www.lexingtonky.gov/about-sister-cities-commission" target="_blank">four sister cities</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deauville, France </li>
<li>County Kildare, Ireland</li>
<li>Shinhidaka, Japan</li>
<li>Newmarket, England</li>
</ol>
<p>These cities work together to expose one another to the unique cultures of their respective countries, with many educational and historical opportunities. </p>
<p>But wait, what's that?</p>
<ul>
<li>Deauville is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deauville#Horse_culture" target="_blank">horse capital of France</a>?</li>
<li>County Kildare is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kildare#Horse_racing" target="_blank">horse capital of Ireland</a>?</li>
<li>Shinhidaka is home to the Japanese Imperial family's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinhidaka,_Hokkaido#Arts_and_culture" target="_blank">Horses</a>?</li>
<li>The Jockey Club and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmarket,_Suffolk#Connections_to_horse_racing_and_training" target="_blank">English horseracing</a> originates in Newmarket, England? </li>
</ul>
<p>Here we see a very notable trend and reason for Lexington to consider them all sister cities. :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite connection is my hometown, El Paso TX, and Juarez, Mexico. One of the safest cities in the U.S., paired with possibly the most dangerous city in the world. As far as I remember, a lot of people passed from El Paso to Juarez for a few hours at a time to buy cheaper medication or food, which helped these industries in Juarez a lot. Obviously, having a good medical industry in the most dangerous city in the world is important. That was just the main thing I remember. Juarez also brought lots of labor for El Paso's mining and other labor heavy industries, copper mining being one of the main money makers for the city. Overall, the border is very easy to cross legally, and very difficult to cross illegally due to the increased security but nessecity for a speedy pass. I remember almost driving into Mexico one night, directly from downtown El Paso. I've never had a passport, so I had to make a U-Turn and explain to a border crossing official that I couldn't cross and didn't want to.</p>
<p>Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. I never studied city planning or anything similar, I only lived there.</p></div>		</li>
