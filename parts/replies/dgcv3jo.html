			<div class="markdown"><p>I was listening to this on the radio just last week. The natural gas was made radioactive. The designers thought that the closest rock would just melt and seal in the radioactive parts of the nuke, with all of it sinking to the bottom of the cavern. </p>
<p>From the NPR transcript which can be found here:
<a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/04/13/523717152/how-can-the-colorado-river-continue-to-support-36-million-people-in-7-states" target="_blank">http://www.npr.org/2017/04/13/523717152/how-can-the-colorado-river-continue-to-support-36-million-people-in-7-states</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the cavity cools, the vaporized and melted rock will collect in a puddle at the bottom, and most of the radioactivity will be entrapped here as it solidifies.</p>
