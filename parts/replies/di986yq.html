			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone interested, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OMhvOes.png" target="_blank">here</a>'s a diagram I just whipped up showing what physical theories &quot;contain&quot; which other physical theories. If box A contains a smaller box B, it means that theory B can be derived from theory A by taking a certain limit (low speed, small gravitational potential, or small Planck constant).</p>
<p>You could imagine that the outer violet box (=theory of everything) contains all physical phenomena, and each box represents the fraction of all phenomena that can be accurately described by that theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum mechanics contains quantum field theory as a subset.  QM also contains string theory, and all the current mainstream candidates for a theory of everything (LQG, etc) are also quantum mechanical theories.  </p>
<p>The box that says &quot;quantum mechanics&quot; is probably intended to say &quot;nonrelativistic quantum mechanics of spinless particles moving in space and interacting according to a potential, like we teach to undergraduates.&quot;  But these were just examples of the general framework that is called quantum mechanics: states in Hilbert space, observables correspond to linear operators, unitary time evolution generated by the Hamiltonian, etc are all general and apply to &quot;second quantized&quot; theories like QFT (which can be relativistic as in the standard model, or non-relativistic as in many-body physics / condensed matter), and to relativistic &quot;first quantized&quot; theories like string theory.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's said that the standard model is the best theory so far (excluding general relativity).  Where does that fit into the diagram?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are absolutely right, but &quot;nonrelativistic quantum mechanics of spinless particles moving in space and interacting according to a potential, like we teach to undergraduates&quot; was too long to fit in haha. Anyway, I think people are getting the intended meaning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Debatable or not, that's an extremely good visualization of how these things relate to one another!</p>
<p>I'd love to see someone put one together for all (or at least most) of the various higher maths!</p></div>		</li>
