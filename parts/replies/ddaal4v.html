<p>Like, I sell insurance.  We get paid the exact same commission no matter what company's insurance I sell.  I sell a BCBS plan or Aetna or Humana, I get paid the same no matter what.  That means, my only incentive is to sell what makes the customer happy and fits their needs.  I'm proud of my company for that reason.</p></div>		</li>
