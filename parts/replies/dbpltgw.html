<p>say, by already seeing some of the data, or by knowing what sort of data it is</p>

<p>So that would explain why some time data can be &quot;very compressed&quot; (?) and other times it doesn't? Because there's no recognizable pattern?</p>
<p>E: nvm kept reading and found the answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>For instance, HTML is pretty compressible. Every time you have a '&lt;' symbol, you are almost certain to have a '&gt;' symbol before the next '&lt;', and vice versa; also, every '&lt;' symbol is highly likely to be followed by a '/' symbol; and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, this depends on both the data <em>and</em> the algorithm. Sometimes you might have an extremely long string of data that <em>could</em> be generated by a very small algorithm, but actual real-world compression algorithms aren't 'smart' enough to realize this and so they use some inefficient method instead, creating a larger compressed file than is strictly necessary.</p>

<p>Or just no pattern that the compression algorithm is 'smart' enough to pick up on.</p>
<p>But yes, some files (in fact, the vast majority of all possible files) have <em>no</em> overall patterns whatsoever and cannot be generated by <em>any</em> algorithm significantly shorter than the file itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's an example: Imagine that you took a TXT file of one of Shakespeare's plays, analyzed it, and found that the letter 'z' appears 2000 times and the two-letter sequence 'th' appears 5000 times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In what world would Z be only slightly less than half as common as TH?</p></div>		</li>
