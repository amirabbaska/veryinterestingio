			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's also related to brain perception. Cold water down the throat is supposed to feel cold and nice, because it regulates hydration and the brain 'likes' it , whereas cold water on the face means 'damage'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. Nose and ears get cold quickly not because they are less sensitive to cold - one would just be able to feel it earlier if that was the case.
They are simply distal. That is also why hands and feet get cold quickly. When body is working, it heats the blood, which then circulates yo warm everything up. As more and more things get heated, blood has less and less warmth. When it gets to distal parts, it jusg doesn't have eniugh. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never said nose and ears are less sensitive to cold. Please read my comment again. I am not sure about your explanation though. Do you have any source? Anyway, there surely are lots of factors that contribute to the way we percieve temperature, and saying that smb's argument is invalid just because you may be aware of another factor is not ... helpful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am saying. Distal parts feel colder because they actually are colder. Not because it's felt more.
You said they feel colder because of receptor density. </p>
