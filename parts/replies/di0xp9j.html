			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this really interesting in relation to drinking from streams while hiking. When I was a kid, we had certain rules for drinking water from streams, but basically it was 'if it was moving and not below cattle'. Now, if you try to find out if you'll get anything by drinking from a stream, no agency will give you a straight answer because lawsuits.</p>
<p>I think at some point, giardia went through the area and everyone just stopped drinking from streams, not because they got sick, but because they got told they might get sick. :\</p>
<p>edit: i found this article. Looks like a meta-study of other articles, and not a direct study:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10737847" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10737847</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;CONCLUSIONS:
Published reports of confirmed giardiasis among outdoor recreationalists clearly demonstrate a high incidence among this population. However, the evidence for an association between drinking backcountry water and acquiring giardiasis is minimal. Education efforts aimed at outdoor recreationalists should place more emphasis on handwashing than on water purification. Further studies should attempt to separate the specific risk factor of drinking water from backcountry sources from other behaviors among this group that may contribute to the risk.&quot;</p>

<p>That's why it's safe to drink clouds.  They move and are above cattle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's what i grew up with. Walk a short way down the stream to make sure there are no dead animals in it, but other than that anything flowing was considered &quot;safe&quot;. Now i pump or uv sterilize everything I drink in the backcountry.</p>
<p>I don't recall ever actually getting sick during any of that time. </p>
<p>Logically i'm far more likely to ingest bacteria from the difficulty in properly washing my hands after taking a dump, or from sharing the shovel that i'd use to bury it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People have ridiculously exaggerated idea of contracting any illness, regardless of transmission. People think if you go outside and lick the road, you'll be dead before sundown if you don't immediately go to the doctor's and get pumped full of antibiotics.</p>
<p>The human body is surprisingly resistant to a lot of gross, shitty stuff that's constantly all around us. If you live in a developed country, you have a pretty good chance of not getting sick, or at least potentially deathly sick, ever. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Iâ€™d prefer to lick the road than the average public door handle. And yet people touch those with their hands and then scratch their eyes, mouth or nose.</p></div>		</li>

They come from extremely poor areas if Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala though.... Clean water isn't exactly a normality.
