			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's not necessarily that the facial features look all scrambled, it's just that it's difficult to pin those specific features into long-term, easily retrievable memory. I have mild issues with face blindness, so if a friend changes their hair, wears a hat, gets a new outfit, etc., it takes me a while to be super sure it's the right person. I pass by people all the time that I think I might recognize, but I just can't say for sure until they come up to me and ask why I didn't say hi lol. It's kinda like &quot;I think I know that face, buuuuut...I'm not totally sure.&quot; They still look like normal human faces, but the wiring from long term memory to working memory just isn't very good. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear what you're saying. I've had tinitus for years, no idea when it happened and always thought it was just a combination of natural and environmental phenomena. I learned about it recently and realised that the very presence of background noise can cause me to instantly forget parts of conversations that I know for a fact I clearly heard and listened to, but my brain just said &quot;hold on for a sec, there's noise that sounds like that other thing so I'm going to white-out and see if it goes away&quot;, then I sheepishly ask for a replay of the last few lines.</p>
<p>As far as prosopagnosia, I know that ours eyes only see a narrow field in focus, and have to scan constantly to get full picture while the brain consciously keeps the image in place at a relative constant. I know I'm not explaining this part best, but maybe it's a fault in that &quot;refresh&quot; that keeps fully defined faces from being relayed to and from memory, thus preventing that &quot;ah-ha&quot; moment of recognition from happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember this one time I went on a date with a guy I met online. I saw him sitting at a bar and I had my phone out and kept comparing the photo from his profile to the guy sitting at the bar, but I couldn't tell if it was him because his hair was different. So I kicked the barstool he was sitting on and then just looked at him, to see if he recognized me. He did. We're getting married in three weeks.   </p>
<p>I apparently get very different looking actors mixed up with each other on the regular, and he finds this hilarious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm mildly faceblind and I also have tinnitus, both since I was a child. I wonder if there's a correlation? I have more than a few ridiculous stories of having conversations with strangers whom I was *convinced* were my friends, only to find out later that not only was it not my friend, but that the stranger(s) were so polite, that I never caught on they probably thought i was nuts. Everyone jokes about the clark kent/superman thing, but like beards, man. If you put a side by side pic of a guy with and without a beard, I wouldn't even think they were related to each other. I mostly identify people by their gait, hair, and like overall face shape. The rest is a grey area.   </p>
<p>I love taking pictures so much, possibly because it helps me remember what my friends and family look like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg thank you! I was diagnosed tinitus last year after decades of not even realizing something was wrong. This puts so much into perspective for why I have trouble hearing things that seem like &quot;background&quot; or sometimes just can't process things like for instance a page that just went off in my store for me and people think I'm deaf! I tell them I hear just fine I just don't &quot;register&quot; some things that well. I didn't realize that may be a side effect of that the tinitus!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read this and had the thought &quot;Wouldn't it be funny if there was a face-blind detective.  He would really <em>suck</em> at his job.&quot;  But it occurs to me that someone who makes detective despite being face-blind might be really <em>good</em> at, well, detecting.  He'd have to become quite practiced at instantly noticing and remembering observable facts about people like handedness or what shoes they wear or a bunch of other minor details the observation of which would make someone a really good crime solver.</p>
<p>I'd read that story.  Maybe I should write it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a guy with Prosopagnosia who did an AMA, and he said something like &quot;you can look at a tree and say it's tall, pointy, round etc, you <em>see</em> the tree clearly, but if I showed you a photo of a particular tree, you wouldn't say 'oh that's the third tree from the left in the park across from the library'&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the inherited form of prosopagnosia. People do not actually look like a Picasso painting. Basically, I can recognize a face as definitely being a face, but I can’t recognize it as being different from a similar face. Instead... you know how in anime, cartoons, and video games a lot of times there’s sometimes only a few different face shapes due to the art style, and the characters sharing that face shape are able to be visually distinguished from each other due to different hair styles, clothing styles, or whatever? That’s pretty much my life. Except, people in real life switch up hair styles suddenly or show up in clothing styles they don’t normally wear, and then they look like an entirely different person.</p>
<p>I have TWICE not recognized my own brother just because he got a haircut. My mom, also with prosopagnosia, almost called the cops on him because she didn’t recognize her own son that she had last seen that same morning and thought he was a robber.</p>
<p>I would like to say that humans really have very little variation in face shape, and most of you just think that you do solely due to a tiny specialized part in your brain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same thing. I recognise people by hair colour, height, gait (how they walk), clothes (different people usually wear certain styles of clothes) lots of stuff like that just not really actual faces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voices are one of the things I use to recognize people. Other things are hair color, hair style, glasses, clothing style, if they wear glasses, their behavior, and the location that I normally find them in. From what I can tell, it’s still not nearly as easy as recognizing people just by face, and the accuracy of this method is significantly lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, not the best example now I see, just the simplest one I could think up and I have added an edit. Also yes, the &quot;normal&quot; brain already does plenty of trickery with faces, particularly symmetry.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot of times I don't think people who are considered attractive are all that great. I really love <a href="https://goo.gl/images/K4fx6Q" target="_blank">young Roger Moore</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/images/fxaMWW" target="_blank">Randolph Mantooth</a>.</p>
<p>Serious question: was Michael C. Hall supposed to be attractive on Dexter? Usually protagonists are attractive, and it always weirded me out that he wasn't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can usually tell what faces are more attractive, as i have a decent grasp on telling facial symmetry (strongly influences if we find a person attractive), and I’m not blind, so I can see if the person appears to be way too old for me or has really bad skin. </p>
<p>I don’t know if I place as much emphasis on facial attractiveness as most people, and I don’t seem to be that great at really telling who has the most attractive face. I mean, the face is definitely a factor in who I find attractive, but I suspect my brain isn’t as weighting that quite as strongly as most people’s brains do, as there were several awkward moments back in high school where my rating of What Guy is Hottest just didn’t seem to line up with the rating of the other girls.</p>
<p>I will also point out that whatever part of my brain tells me about how old people are is still definitely working, and Steve Buscemi gets a mental note of “he’s wrinkled and way too old for me, so definitely not.” Ryan Gosling, on the other hand, is in the right age range, and I consider his face to be reasonably attractive, though he also has nice hair, which strongly influences my feelings on if I find a man attractive.</p></div>		</li>
