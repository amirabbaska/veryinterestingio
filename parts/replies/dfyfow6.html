			<div class="markdown"><p>good answer, i would just like to add that the Fibonacci sequence is more than connected to the golden ratio, it <em>is</em> the golden ratio. As you count up in the Fibonacci sequence the numbers approximate the golden ratio, which is about 1.618, also called Phi. The sequence goes 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233.....etc. If you take any number and divide it by the number before it in the sequence, you will get closer and closer to the Phi ratio. for example 3/2=1.5, 5/3=1.667, 8/5=1.6, 89/55=1.61818, 233/144=1.61805 and so on. My personal understanding of this is that (prepare for speculation) nature needs very simple &quot;rules&quot; for things to be based on, and the fibonacci sequence is all about self-repetitive relationships, and this can give rise to immensely complex forms of all shapes and sizes. Just look into fractals, totally dependent on self-repetition and they are literally <em>everywhere</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would disagree with the first bit of your comment, I think the Fibonacci sequence IS just tied to the golden ratio. The golden ratio itself is a much more easily constructed number; it is the positive solution to x^2 = x+1, or x = (1+sqrt(5))/2. if you do some algebra that i've honestly forgotten how to do, it ends up that the ratio of the fibonacci numbers approaches this number. It's not like phi is only arrived at by using limits of the fibonacci sequence; it's a much simpler number than that. </p></div>		</li>
