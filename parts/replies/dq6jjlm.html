<p>Incidentally, if you put a marshmallow out the window of a fighter jet, would the air friction cook the mallow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you? I see water being necessary for the Maillard reaction in some cases, but not oxygen. You'll get partial reactions, but I imagine you would have one freezer burned marshmallow, due to all water being vapor in those conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, when comparing a normal atmosphere of pressure (air) with a vacuum environment, the melting point is relatively unchanged. The vaporization point, however, would be drastically reduced. Maybe the marshmallow would begin to sublimate (i.e. solid to gas) rather than vaporize (liquid to gas)?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... are you saying that the lower the pressure the lower the vaporization temperature (including sublimation i.e. going from water to gas or solid to gas) is?  Does that mean ice in space is more likely to sublimate than melt?  Or even that liquid water is unlikely or impossible in the vacuum of space?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For fun, assuming a stick 2.5 cm in diameter (we want it to have some strength, right?), at 63,370,834 km long, implies a volume of the stick of 31,107,031 cubic metres.  Assuming oak for strength, that would give a mass of about 2.333 million kg (at 0.75 kg/m^3).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to this, temperatures on the moon can reach 127C during they, certainly hot enough to melt a marshmallow. <del>Without an atmosphere to trap heat,</del> why does it get so hot compared to the above calculations? Is it the moon rock itself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In space all head exchange has to be done with radiation which is incredibly weak compare to heat exchange between touching surfaces or a surface and a gas.</p>
<p>Since the air temperature in summer can easily be 35-40 degrees Celsius depending on location and the marshmallow will try to reach a temperature  equilibrium with the air, the heat rays from the sun only need to heat it up another 10 degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, Maillard reactions (which we typically associate with browning) do not require oxygen... just amino acids and proteins.</p>
<p>I don't have my food chemistry references with me but Wikipedia claims marshmallow toasting is such a reaction.  Protein comes via gelatin/collagen and I guess there's enough amino acid present as well.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The browning is caused by combustion, which is oxydation, you are right, it won't burn without oxygen.</p>
<p>Maybe if you put the marshmallow in a spacesuit...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space is a vacuum. It would pull the air out around the outside instantly puff the air inside up (and most out) and then when it melted the remaining air would be pulled out too fast for their to be any crisp.</p>
<p>Need to put the Marshmallow in a nice glass cube to get the crisp.</p></div>		</li>
