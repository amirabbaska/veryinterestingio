<p>That video shows a dam going from a dribble to complete failure in 4 minutes. Damn*, that's impressive.</p>
<p>Those videos about piping and slumping are pretty informative. But basically, the lesson is that water is going to go somewhere. Better that the engineers decide where it goes instead of letting the water decide that. </p>

<p>For example; if you were driving a car on an icy road around a sharp corner and slid off the road  and hit a tree, a 'root cause' investigation would ask and answer the following questions; What was the damage? Car hit tree. How did car hit tree? Car drove off road. How did car drive off road? Sharp turn. Other preceding factors? Icy Road. Was he speeding? No.</p>

<p>Did you use &quot;5 Why's&quot; an accident? Nice. Good example.</p></div>		</li>
