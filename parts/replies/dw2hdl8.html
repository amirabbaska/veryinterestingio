			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the air resistance play a significant part in the feeling of &quot;softness&quot;? If anything, it would add a damping effect to the movement of hair. The inherent feel of soft results from: 1. material has smooth texture (low coefficient of friction) and 2. compressible. Air movement might not play part in either of the two conditions to define softness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It adds to the dampening effect like you say, so any object coming in with velocity will be slowed more gradually - adding to the softness according to your conditions. Hair with air in between them has to be further apart than hair with no air between them, and as a result is compressible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much the air resistance, but more of the surface roughness and how much the material itself gives when we press on it.  Without noticing it, we change the presure that we exert when feel things (either between our fingers or against a solid structure). This provides a lot of detail about the compressibility of the material and supplements our perception of texture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would moisture absorption capabilities in the material have an impact, too? I have mild eczema on my hands so I'm sensitive to things that dry my skin out, and materials that do this the worst are also soft. Dryer lint is the ultimate one--it's so soft but as soon as I toss it I have to moisturize or my hands will flare up. Folding clothes does this too. Or am I just reading causation into a correlation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might also be due to the detergents or softeners used on the fabric. It's hard to say since you've only noticed it on your hands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah sounds familiar. I don't actually know why it's happening but after enough life experience I've settled on absorption as the reason. I had a job in college in a hotel laundry room and it was a nightmare--that's what triggered the connection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely correct to say it depends on the micro-structure of those fibers, but the mapping from the structure of the surface or fiber to the actual friction values is very complex. It's not just a &quot;oh, this is rougher, so it buzzes more&quot;. Fingers and skin actually respond to changes in friction quite differently than one might expect, and a surface that produces <em>more</em> or <em>louder</em> vibrations on the finger is not necessarily rougher, or smoother. It all depends on how the friction (or vibrations it creates) is patterned or structured. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24523522/" target="_blank">source</a></p>
<p>Also note, the finger and finger print seems to play a large role in the story too, highlightly certain spatial features, and storing energy at particular tactile frequencies. To simply think of furryiness as a property of the material and geometry is incomplete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fingerprint findings of this article are interesting. I research with vibrations on skins surface (literally buzzing), and since the Pacinian corpuscle is located so deep within the skin, we considered differences in fingerprints to be negligible.  Even simulations including the skin consider the skin to be homogenous (which it definitely is not) or anisotropic (which it is, but is difficult to quantify). <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004370" target="_blank">example source</a></p>
<p>But I agree completly with your statement </p>

<p>It all depends on how ...vibrations...is patterened or structured.</p>
