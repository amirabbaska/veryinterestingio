			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the specific type of reaction, though.  Some of the fusion reactions being studied emit large amounts of energy in the form of heavier electrically-charged particles whose energy of motion can be directly captured by an electrical field.  Conversions of that type can be much higher efficiency, and without the need for steam turbines.  But the more conventional reactions do rely on heat transfer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. A lot of the current demo reactors use the Deuterium-Tritium process, which releases a significant portion of its energy in the form of fast neutrons. Neutrons have no charge and are difficult to capture, so extracting energy is pretty difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm kinda hoping that Proton-Boron will catch on, it's aneutronic and a lot of the energy can be direct-captured, plus Boron is fairly easy to come by in large quantities with existing mining operations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to remember reading there is currently still some testing going on with using different types of lithium blankets designs to extract the energy. </p>
<p>One approach involves some lithium mix which end result breeds tritium (allowing feeding back into the cycle) and interacting with all those fast neutrons heats up the blanket which has some sort of extraction property in place either solid state ceramic mix or liquid lead base which can then be used to generate some useful energy.</p>
<p>I seem to recall some work on some type of direct electron interaction blanket, but my memory may be playing tricks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern power cycles operate close to the Carnot efficiency <em>at their operating temperature</em>. But their operating temperature is limited by what can be handled by steam equipment, something like 600 K. The flame temperature in the furnace, meanwhile, might be 1400 K. So actually, the efficiency of a steam turbine power plant is well below the Carnot limit. If they could handle a working fluid at 1400 K, the Carnot limit would be around 80%. </p>
<p>To be clear, these power plants are the state of the art and they're not doing anything wrong. Alloys that would use a 1400 K working fluid safely and cheaply do not yet exist. But let's not pretend we're near the ideal already. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern power plants don't operate near the Carnot efficiency, and for good reason! The Carnot efficiency provides the maximum efficiency operating quasistatically aka no power; this is awful for a power plant, where you want  the maximum efficiency at maximum power output! This is given by the Curzon-Alhborn efficiency! Most modern power plants operate very near this point! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, and very interesting thermodynamics. However, it doesn't change the main issue, which is how T_h is set in a power plant: T_h is generally determined by the maximum operating temperature of the materials available, which is much lower than the actual maximum temperature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High temperature turbines are made out of nickel super alloys, which are designed to have good creep resistance and high fracture toughness at high temperatures. </p>
<p>They're designed with hollow tubes inside to allow a coolant fluid to flow within them to reduce the temperature. They are also coated with a temperature and wear resistant ceramic coating (such as silicon carbide) to improve resistance to the hostile environment and act as a thermal barrier. (Currently working on my doctorate in materials engineering) </p>
<p>Edit: Forgot to mention ceramic matrix composites and metal matrix composites, which improve the monolithic ceramic or metal used to make the turbine with fibres which improve the creep resistance and fracture toughness of the material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water electrolysis is a chemical reaction, whereas fusion is a nuclear reaction. Electrolysing water and combining THOSE to get the water back is net negative. Perhaps that's what you are thinking of?</p>
<p>Fusion (and any nuclear reaction) on the other hand releases orders of magnitude more energy than chemical reactions.</p>
<p>HOWEVER</p>
<p>Fusion doesn't use normal hydrogen that you'd find in water. It uses more exotic fuels such as deuterium (found naturally in water but low abundance), tritium (radioactive, produced in small amounts in fission reactors, can be bred), helium, the fabled &quot;Helium 3&quot; etc. These are far more difficult to obtain but eventually these will still provide enough energy to be worth it (partly because you get a ton of energy from small amounts of fuel).</p></div>		</li>
