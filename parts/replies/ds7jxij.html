<p>Another point where the linear relationship breaks down: in very low gravity environments, for example on a small asteroid, it is entirely possible you could achieve escape velocity by jumping.  More generally you could jump high enough that the assumption that gravity is constant is no longer valid, owing to the fact that the change in your distance from the center of the object is no longer negligible.  This would further add to the effect you are describing.</p>
<p>Yet another discrepancy: it's possible it would be harder to get &quot;purchase&quot; in certain low gravity environments.  When we jump on Earth we spend a good part of the jump still on the ground, adding to the force we are exerting with our legs.  In a low-g environment it may be harder to add as much force to our jumps, since very quickly after the start of the jump we are airborne.  This would counteract the other two phenomena, though I don't have data to say with certainty at which scales each phenomenon would dominate.</p>
<p>For situations where the gravity is reasonably close to Earth's gravity, jump height and gravity are roughly inversely proportional as others have suggested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got to this post too late, but this is absolutely correct. During liftoff, the vertical acceleration is much higher due to decreased effort to overcome gravity. </p>
