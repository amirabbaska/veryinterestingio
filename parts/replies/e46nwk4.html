			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a lot of fungi are <em>mycorrhizal</em> meaning they share symbiotic relationships with tree roots, and they get awful picky about which tree roots they live with. Like if a fungus like douglas fir, you won't find it hanging out with oak trees.</p>

<p>Many fungi (think truffles) are symbiotic organisms and are hard to cultivate because they need an entire ecosystem to support their growth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question and the fundamental reason is because the mushrooms that can be cultivated are ones that rely on using dead matter to grow, which is easy to obtain and provide, while boletes and other mushrooms like them form a symbiotic relationship with their host organism, which makes it much harder to provide them with the adequate environment. You can read a more detailed answer here:</p>

<p>A fun fact is that in Russia and other Slavic countries, this relationship was intuitively known and thus many boletes have names such as &quot;the one that grows under the birch tree&quot; or &quot;the one that grows under the oak tree&quot; (they sound better in Russian, I promise!). Foragers who had no idea about what the scientific names and classifications and reasons for growth of mushrooms were, noticed a collaboration and proximity between specific mushrooms and specific trees, thus giving them such names.</p>
<p>EDIT: I should point out that according to that site, bolete cultivation was successful in some experiments!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I post pics a ton on iNaturalist and sometimes when it's not obvious what the mushroom was likely growing under (the ones under pine trees always have needles all around them) you'll definitely get people asking what the tree species was that the mushroom was growing near!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! The naming is similar in German. We have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leccinum_scabrum" target="_blank">&quot;Birch Fungi&quot;</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus_pinophilus" target="_blank">&quot;Pine Fungi&quot;</a>. I gotta look up the next time I find one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom's grandparents all came from Poland. The kids would go mushroom hunting in the forests near Chicago. They brought back their harvest where their &quot;old people&quot; sorted the good from the bad. The good ones were cooked up and everyone feasted on delicious wild mushrooms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! This is how I learned and began to love this activity as well. It is such a treat. I hope you can still go mushroom picking with your mom and family someday :)</p></div>		</li>
