'We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services or any features or portions thereof, including the Company’s “Creator Program” and “Publisher Program” referenced below, without prior notice. You agree that we will not be liable for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services or any part thereof.'  </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>'However, by submitting User Content to the Services, you hereby grant Vidme a worldwide, non-exclusive, paid up and royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Content in connection with the Services and Vidme's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Services (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.'</p>

<p>So a news channel's content could be yanked for any reason and vid.me would get the use of the video for free.</p></div>		</li>

So NYT can use the player and not worry about this type of thing and Google makes a penny a view on however many bajillion views</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like a start up in the making. &quot;We handle your news videos for you&quot;. Generous payback to the sites, a report system that doesn't cripple these stations, a good video player... Or maybe instead of payback, 100% of ad revenue and such goes to the news sites, but they pay for a license?</p></div>		</li>
