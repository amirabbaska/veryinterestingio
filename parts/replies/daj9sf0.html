<p>Additionally, melting cheese tends to remove a lot of fat from the cheese. If you've ever sopped up a layer of grease from your slice of pizza you know what I mean.</p>
<p>So you've significantly altered the cheese in several ways - changed the shape of protein molecules, melted away fat, some of which may re-congeal on top of the cheese but is now separate from the cheese itself, and also you've removed moisture from the cheese that has evaporated off of it during the heating process.</p></div>		</li>
