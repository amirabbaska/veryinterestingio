<p>I aso used to get that green image thing, always like a photo from the early 1900's but black and green instead of black and white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Coming from a computer science background, I suspect the brain is probably responsible for creating most of the actual imagery and patterns like what you were seeing. When we work with neural networks - systems we designed off of biologist's descriptions of how the brain functions - we can see similar sorts of effects <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html" target="_blank">if we feed random noise into image recognition networks</a>. I suspect the pressure on those cells causes random signals, which the brain is then making patterns out of in an attempt to understand the signal, which the brain then &quot;sees&quot; but because it can't piece them into a &quot;real&quot; image it ends up confused and focused on the fragments of structure.</p>
<p>In depth: So while the pressure stimulates the nerves (not my area of expertise) it's probably in a mostly random way, at which point the brain's image processing wetware (e.g. the part that probably functions similarly to our computer based image recognizing neural networks) attempts to reinforce structure (<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4Uj3hPFupok/VYIT6s_c9OI/AAAAAAAAAlc/_yGdbbsmGiw/s1600/ibis.png" target="_blank">this image</a> shows how this would normally function in a computer; note that the structuring is similar to many of the anecdotally reported grids) it is receiving so our higher functions can more easily discern what we are seeing. But because it's random, our higher functions become confused and just see the hints and pieces of random shapes and patterns the image processing section was trying to reinforce. This is probably why the patterns are unique-but-similar (e.g. some people see buildings, but most people see faces or geometric shapes) to each person: each person's brain was wired slightly differently as we learned how to recognize images, but we generally learned the same basic structures (geometric shapes, faces). </p>
<p>Disclaimer: This is all speculation from a pure computer scientist, I have no clue how the brain or biology functions. I can only describe things from my understanding of the computer science systems that have been translated from biology by computational biologists. I am also assuming our discoveries on these subjects would hold true for the original biological systems we cribbed them from (probable, but not certain).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured the &quot;noise&quot; in the middle was just that: noise. But the geometric patterns in the peripheral were so well defined and complex that I couldn't help but wonder if a pattern within the eye was the cause. Perhaps the retina itself gathers visual information in a way that's different than a camera? It just seems that while a camera's light sensors are arranged in a linear grid, the retina may be built around a polar grid arrangement. Imagine an image with it's pixels arranged in such a way. Would the math involved in computing it be very much different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it, what I am describing is the way neural networks function fundamentally. At some point the data is quantized into individual neurons, and then fed through layers of neurons, that was the part I was basing this off of. We have less neurons on the periphery so it seems likely that a lot of what we see there is created by the brain to fill in the gaps. My hypothesis is that the noise causes the brain to build these structures in an attempt to make sense of the noise.</p></div>		</li>
