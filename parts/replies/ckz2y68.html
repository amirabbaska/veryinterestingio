			<p>Question here, in my nutrition class it was mentioned that Alpha-Tocopherol is really the only form of Vitamin E stored (in the liver). What are the different actions that the Tocotrienols and other Tocopherols can do for you besides Alpha-Tocopherol? I.e. why is that a bad thing to have less of the others?</p>		</li>
