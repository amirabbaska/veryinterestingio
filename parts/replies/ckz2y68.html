			<div class="markdown"><p>Question here, in my nutrition class it was mentioned that Alpha-Tocopherol is really the only form of Vitamin E stored (in the liver). What are the different actions that the Tocotrienols and other Tocopherols can do for you besides Alpha-Tocopherol? I.e. why is that a bad thing to have less of the others?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That should answer most of your questions, and you can read the primary literature if you'd like too =D</p>
<p>The wiki also isn't a bad place for some sourced info:</p>
