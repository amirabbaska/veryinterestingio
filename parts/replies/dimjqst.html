<p>You used to be able to buy little perspex necklace or keyring charms filled with Hydrogen-3 on the internet. The radioactive decay would make the gas glow in the dark.</p>

<p>You still can (and it's sometimes used in luminescent watch dials and other things too). It's not a radiation hazard - it's not the radiation that glows. Tritium emits beta particles, which we can't see, and apart from that they're so low energy that they only travel something like a centimeter in air. There's a phosphor on the vial that absorbs beta particles and emits light.</p>
<p>In the early 1900s the same things were made with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_dials" target="_blank">radium</a>, which was probably not that dangerous once it was <em>on</em> the dials, but gave factory workers radiation poisoning because they were told to point their paintbrushes in their mouths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight correction: the people employed to paint watch hands with radium paint work told to point their brushes with their mouth, that's just how many painters did it. That led to calcium depletion and <del>phossy</del>  radium jaw, but that's a whole other tangent.</p>
<p>Tritium-powered glowing displays are still around and pretty easy to come by, too. I have a bunch of emergency exit signs that have about 50 tritium-filled glass tubes in them. I use them for demonstrations at my kids' school.</p>
<p>Edit: Brainfart changed radium to phossy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additional slight correction: It was only <strong>one</strong> factory that had the painters use their mouths to shape their brushes. Virtually all other factories had shaping bowls that were used instead. It wasn't a case of ignorance, but of malicious negligence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What happens to them after they travel a centimeter in the air? Do they just kind of hang out there? Do they decay into something else?</p></div>		</li>

<p>They lose most of their energy through collisions with electrons orbiting atoms in the air. Once they lose most of their energy they fall into orbit around an atom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically you could fuse things into technetium.  But since it is well beyond the iron limit you would have to use a lot of energy.  Anything heavier than iron costs energy to fuse instead of releasing energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technetium is one of the common medical isotopes. Because of its short half life, it's not actually what's shipped to hospitals for use in nuclear medicine. Instead, the hospitals are shipped Molybdenum 99 &quot;cows&quot; which decay into Technetium. This is then extracted through chemical means, producing the needed isotope. </p>
<p>The Molybdenum was traditionally produced by irradiating highly enriched uranium in various research reactors around the world. However due to the concerns related to proliferation, the aging reactors and the lack of new ones, these sources are going away. Lately there has been a movement to start producing these isotopes on an industrial scale using cyclotrons. This has the possibility to produce the same quantities, while also producing significantly less radioactive waste, and is more politically acceptable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Most commercial Tc is extracted from spent nuclear fuel rods, but you can also bombard Molybdenum-98 with neutrons, get Mo-99, which quickly decays to Tc-99m. The 'm' there means 'meyastable', it's basically an excited state of the nucleus, and decays to Tc-99 emitting a gamma ray. This has medical applications.</p>
<p>Project have also observed Tc in some stars. Presumably these stars have some process which is generating isotopes of Tc via fusion, but they don't know exactly what it is.</p></div>		</li>
