			<div class="markdown"><p>There are quite a few practical applications for optical antennas. For example, one of the biggest benefits of an optical antenna is that it can significantly enhance the electric field around it. As a result, you can get much stronger light-matter interaction, which can be useful for imaging and spectroscopy. Two of the biggest benefits you get are 1) strongly increased signal and 2) higher resolution. For example <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6112/1317" target="_blank">these guys</a> used such an antenna to look at how the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SA32JT8.png" target="_blank">emission spectrum of a nanowire changes as you scan across its long axis.</a> This result is both interesting and hard to achieve without using an antenna.</p>
<p>Other applications include trying to increase the absorption in solar cells, increasing the efficiency of LED's, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One application of optical antennas is tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip-enhanced_Raman_spectroscopy" target="_blank">(TERS)</a>. Using a sharp metallic tip (typically gold or silver) you can obtain the chemical information that comes with Raman spectroscopy with nanometer scale spatial resolution. I don't know how &quot;practical&quot; this is for the everyday person but for many in  the biological, chemical, and material science fields this is quite practical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but an alternative to wi-fi is li-fi, which uses visible light for wireless communication. From what I have seen, they are currently using photodetectors, which are not the same as antennas; however, it seems likely that this could be an application where an optical antenna, rather than a photodetector, could be useful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An optical antenna would add many degrees of difficulty to the problem for the reasons that have already been listed.  Trying to directly rectify an optical frequency signal is a monumental task simply because the electronic physics breaks down.  If we could efficiently achieve such a task, it would actually revolutionize much more than just wireless communications.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, that's how LEDs work, for example. </p>
<p>&quot;A light-emitting diode (LED) is a two-lead <strong>semiconductor</strong> light source...  When a <strong>suitable voltage is applied</strong> to the leads, electrons are able to recombine with electron holes within the device, <strong>releasing</strong> energy in the form of <strong>photons</strong>. This effect is called electroluminescence&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode</a></p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, also, lasers. Did you know it's an acronym? It stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation. Lasers work by reflecting and concentrating the strength of light before emitting it, but without &quot;heating&quot; in the traditional, incandescent lightbulb sense. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While /u/EmperorArthur is right, a better way of putting it is that their operation mechanisms are fundamentally different.  Antennas detect incoming EM waves when the oscillating electric field (from the light rays) trigger an oscillatory response in the electrons in the metal rods, as depicted in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Dipole_receiving_antenna_animation_6_800x394x150ms.gif/330px-Dipole_receiving_antenna_animation_6_800x394x150ms.gif" target="_blank">this animation</a> . Electrons drift toward the direction of an electric field, and if you oscillate the electric field (which is what light fundamentally does), electrons tend to oscillate as well, thus creating an AC current. Antennas also do the exact opposite (creating EM waves by oscillating the electrons in the rods), this is the idea behind reception and transmission. In the context of antennas, it's more convenient to think of light as <em>waves</em> rather than <em>particles</em> (photons).</p>
<p>Photodiodes, on the other hand, are semiconductors whose electrons change energy states through light absorption. Essentially, think of the semiconductor material as having a constant electric field in its center. Under equilibrium, there is negligible current in the device. However, when an incoming photon (whose energy is above a certain value) penetrates the semiconductor material, a low energy electron (that is, in a sense, tightly bound to the atom's core) will be excited into a higher energy level. At this level, it is free to roam throughout the semiconductor (i.e. conduct). The built in electric field will drift this excited electron toward the end of the photodiode where it will be collected by one of the metal electrodes. In the context of photodiodes, it's more convenient to think of light as <em>particles</em> rather than <em>waves</em>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. I just got it.</p>
<p>When I read the OP question, my initial thoughts were:</p>
<p>'of course, a CCD in a digital camera is a visible light antenna' </p>
<p>-- but it's not the case is it, because a TV aerial operates on the wave property and a CCD pixel operates on the particle property. That never occurred to me. They're completely different.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Optical antenna's are all about guiding light, photodiodes are receivers.  The reason optical antennas are a big deal is when you get to the smaller sizes quantum mechanics steps in and good old lenses don't work the way you'd expect them to.</p></div>		</li>
