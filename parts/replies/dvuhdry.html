			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, any time you have a heat differential, you have a potential to harness that differential to do work.</p>
<p>In practice (due to the Carnot Efficiency Theory), efficiency goes up as that differential gets larger. If you heat an object to cherry red or white hot and then submerge it in water, the water will evaporate/boil and you can use that steam expansion to do meaningful work. </p>
<p>If you take something that's not as hot, like about as hot as a cup of coffee or tea, you can put a stirling engine on it and use that temperature differential to do a little bit of work. However, stirling engines were rarely used to do meaningful work because you could get a much more efficient engine by heating stuff well beyond tea temperature and using steam.</p>
<p>Big gradient - big efficiency. Small gradient - inefficient.</p>
<p>So, by the time the water/coolant hits the cooling towers, there isn't enough of a differential in it to get a meaningful amount of work out of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only extract work from heat as it travels down a temperature gradient. The heat sink holding down the temperature at the low end of the gradient is every bit as important as the source of heat propping up the temperature at the high end of the gradient. If your reclamation facility can't sink heat as effectively as a cooling tower, it will reduce the efficiency of the primary steam loop, competing with it for a fixed amount of thermal gradient.</p>
<p>It's pretty hard to come up with a reclamation generator more efficient than than the primary loop, otherwise you would just use the &quot;reclamation&quot; technique as the primary loop. Viable reclamation techniques would have special considerations that make this impossible -- e.g. using waste heat to heat houses is very efficient, but there's a small, variable demand that doesn't always match up with your electricity generation needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that not too many people understand it but haven't run into them arguing the byproduct part haha. </p>
<p>It's funny because in a coal plant you can see the separate exhaust stacks that are the end stage of air scrubbing, in addition to the cooling towers, and the exhaust stacks are probably going to be much taller. </p></div>		</li>
