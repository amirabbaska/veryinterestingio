			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh. I get severe vasovagal responses every time I get injured, even a little. All of my blood is just like “okay boys we’ll power the back part of the brain and the lungs and NOTHING FUCKING ELSE”. Like, thanks, it was just a belly button piercing but that’s cool, make me go deaf for 5 minutes and puke on the cute receptionist</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So interesting. I have chronic fatigue and am pale all the time. I do not have anemia. My doctor just did an ANSAR test and found that I am parasympathetic dominant, especially when standing. Now, not sure what to do about this but it checks out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in menopause at age 39, I had vagus-vagal reactions and passed out almost monthly. I was diagnosed as epileptic and given anti-seizure meds to melt my brain. My BFF, who is an MD, lived in another country and we saw each other rarely, but I had an &quot;episode&quot; in front of her and she said, &quot;What I just witnessed was a vagus-vagal reaction&quot;.  My first symptom was the blood draining from my face.  My second symptom was a feeling of utmost dread in the pit of my belly. Upon regaining consciousness, I always puked and/or had diarrhea. I explained this to three neurologists, I begged to have my FSA taken, etc., all in vain. When I finally had the FSA done, I was post-menopausal. </p>
<p>I don't know how common my reaction to menopause is, but I want to spread the word to the medical community.  </p></div>		</li>
