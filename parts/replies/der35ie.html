<p>D&amp;D has been streamlined pretty hard, so it's not a bad choice for a first-time group.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The really nice thing about 5th edition is that all you really need to play are the core books. After that there are a couple of books that expand things (a fancied up monster manual of sorts and a Forgotten Realms scenario source) and the Unearthed Arcana portion of Wizards of the Coast's website, but none of that provides huge overhauls or massive amounts of extra content. They've been growing the game much more slowly than other editions. Also, they publish some really solid campaigns for 5th if you want to play something more structured but your DM doesn't want to do the work of designing everything.</p></div>		</li>
