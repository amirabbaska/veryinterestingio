			<div class="markdown"><p>Azerbaijani, Georgians are Caucasian (as in from northern Caucasus). Turks are Turkic, yes.
But all of them are Russians. Not ethnically, but as citizens of Russia. The question of Russian ethnicity is a strange one. Many people even believe that there are no ethnical Russian left whatsoever due to Mongol invasion, interbreeding with locals from different colonised lands and resetting policies through years.</p></div>		</li>
