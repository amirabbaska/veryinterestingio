			<div class="markdown"><p>How so? Is it because a well insulated house won't lose as much heat therefore less snow to melt for icicles to form? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. &quot;Hot&quot; roof + roof snow = icicle-feeding water. The roof snow can get heat from sunlight, air, or from the heat escaping the house. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. A properly insulated and ventilated attic should be the same temperature as outside. </p>
<p>If insulation or ventilation is inadequate, the attic will heat up and melt snow on the roof. As the water travels down over the soffit, cold air comes from underneath and refreezes the water, forming icicles and more importantly, ice dams. </p>
<p>Ice dams are huge collections of ice that form in and over your eavestroughs and they can literally tear your eavestroughs off of your house. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Icicles form when you have liquid water flowing into an area that's cold enough to freeze it. If the source of the water is snow melting on a warm roof, that's heat that you're paying for that you don't get to benefit from inside the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This works in reverse at night where the lack of sunlight allows surfaces exposed to the open expanse (not roofed or surrounded by walls) to cool below air temp by radiation.</p>
<p>I also live in the upper Midwest and the highest temperature I have had frost on my car in is 39°F. That's according to my car thermometer, so it could be a little off, but it's not 6°F off.</p></div>		</li>
