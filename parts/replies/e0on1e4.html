			<div class="markdown"><p>It does, but it has to check billions of cells across multiple systems constantly.  Errors get made through sheer volume of corrections occurring.  Also, cancer cells look similar enough to the normal cells of whatever system they're in that the body doesn't recognize them as errors, which is why cancer is such a bad thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. If the DNA coding the repair enzymes gets damaged the cell is at an increased risk. It can replicate fine, but further radiation could start it on the path of cancer.</p></div>		</li>
