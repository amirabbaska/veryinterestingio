			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to get to almost 2000 Atmosphere's of pressure (29 thousand PSI) to get a different form of ice, or to be at less than -100ºC (-148ºF). So in most situations on Earth where you're making ice under lots of pressure, it will still form normal ice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that far from reality as you think it is. 2000 bars 29 thousand psi(?) Is not so easy achieved, but possible. A breggar already uses 600 bars of pressure for operation I might remember from thermodynamics that 1200 bars is common in many power plants.</p>
<p>-100°C is easily reachable with liquid nitrogen and it is purchasable online.</p>
<p>I admit no one would make different form of ice then for research.</p></div>		</li>
