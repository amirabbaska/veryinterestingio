			<div class="markdown"><p>I make a nice cup of coffee. Drink it all and then immediately close my eyes. I'll drift off into a mild nap for about 15-20 minutes, then the coffee will hit and wake me up. Then I'm awake and feel super refreshed! It works much better than just having a coffee on its own. Though I do recommend setting an alarm just incase! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I genuinely think I have mastered this. I don’t set alarms any more either but just wake up at the right time. I do think I’m pushing my luck and one day my body is going to make me sleep well into my work day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea the nap length must have something to do with it. I take a 10-15 minute nap almost every afternoon and have never had anything like what everyone here is talking about happen to me.</p></div>		</li>
