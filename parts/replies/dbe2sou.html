			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the bigger reason for the fruit fly research is that <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> (fruit flies) is a major model system for the biomedical sciences. It's not that we're <em>actually</em> interested in the flies themselves, it's that we're interested in what we can learn about biology from studying them. </p>
<p>There are tons of human genes that were originally discovered in fruit flies, many of which have clinical relevance to human diseases. One example is the Shh gene, which encodes the protein Sonic hedgehog. It's an incredibly important protein in human development: it's basically <em>THE</em> protein that controls development of the spinal cord, the head/face, and all the limbs, hands and feet. Why's it called &quot;Sonic hedgehog&quot;? Because when it was first discovered in flies, mutating it caused the embryos to have hair-like projections, making them look like little hedgehogs.</p>
<p>Flies are really invaluable tools to research: they grow super quickly, they're easy to breed and maintain, they're a complex multicellular organism (more so than say, yeast) that has different tissues and organ systems, and there are tons of powerful genetic manipulation tools that only work in flies. You can do large genetic screens on flies that would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming in mice. </p>
<p>SO much of what we know about medicine has come from studying the biology of fruit flies, nematodes, yeast, etc. But it's easy for someone who doesn't know that to think &quot;Why are we spending so much studying <em>fruit flies</em>?!?!? That's a waste of money!!&quot;, when the reality is that it's not, we're still interested in <em>human</em> biology, and the flies are just a tool we can use to study it by proxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your reply, this is one of the most well informed I've even received and is the reason I love Reddit. Also that Sonic Hedgehog thing is worthy of a TIL.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for the record, Congress has recently started recognizing the importance of this kind of research. Researchers who helped establish the effectiveness of the the sterile insect technique by eradicating the screwworm <a href="http://www.goldengooseaward.org/awardees/screwworms" target="_blank">won a Golden Goose Award this year</a>. The <a href="http://www.goldengooseaward.org/history/" target="_blank">Golden Goose Awards</a> were established in 2012 by Congress to reward &quot;researchers whose seemingly obscure, federally-funded research had led to major breakthroughs.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
