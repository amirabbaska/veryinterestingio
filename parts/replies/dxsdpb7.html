			<div class="markdown"><p>So is there a way for a lock maker to do this and ensure every lock he makes complies with this standard? I guess I'm asking what sort of thinking doesd a lock maker have to go through if he's making say thousands of locks for one master key? How does he ensure those combinations of pins are all unique enough that another non-master key cannot open it but also ensure that the master key can?</p>
<p>Seems the permutations can almost be infinite</p></div>		</li>
