			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish they would highlight victories like this more often.  Environmentalism usually feels like a bunch of looming catastrophes that never end up really being anything.  The fact that the reason they don't end up being catastrophes is that we take action to stop them is completely lost on the average person like myself, so that the original hype ends up looking like some chicken-little sky-is-falling shit, and we aren't even told that the sky WAS falling and we legislated against that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I teach envi sci to high schoolers and I make sure to highlight this and other successes such as the return of bald eagles, the ozone recovering, and the improvements in the Chesapeake bay.</p>
<p>I like to because it illustrates that the science was right and the mistakes were reversible.  We can band together and DO something, even when the problem seems huge.  Also, with stuff like Flint going on, the class can be pretty depressing.</p></div>		</li>

It makes it even worse when I learned that apparently with the cost of fixing the towns infrastructure itâ€™d almost be cheaper to build a whole new town from scratch.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Y2K.  &quot;But nothing happened!&quot; - yeah, because we all busted our asses for 2 years leading up to it just so that nothing would happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had heard that this was originally spearheaded by Bush Administration and Environmental Defense fund, described to me as strange bedfellows at the time.</p>
<p>Also heard, there was significant cost-benefit analysis done with regards to the coatings required for automobiles due to future acid rain damage.  I think the costs to society to reduce high sulfur emissions was far lower than the incremental automobile costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EDF has a reputation for being pretty pragmatic and open to market-oriented policies compared to other large environmental NGOs (e.g.; Sierra Club, NRDC, and definitely Greenpeace).</p>
<p>SO2 cap-and-trade was a major coup, cheaper and more effective than a specific mandate to use whatever filtering or fuel technology was available in the late 80's/early 90's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was so good, it worked to disincentivize continued production of high sulfur coal (except for export to China). When Carbon cap and trade was proposed to put the same logic on fossil fuels for global warming, the oil industry got into high gear to stop that shit. They'd seen the writing on the wall. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was because the mechanism was &quot;market based&quot;, aka a &quot;cap-n-trade&quot; program. Other environmental groups (and the Democrats) favored a tougher regulatory approach (basically mandating use of filters and hard restrictions on emissions). </p>
<p>Back then no one really argued over the science (Sulfur emissions cause acid rain) so the debate was just how to combat it, with Republicans favoring market mechanisms and Democrats favoring traditional regulation. Now of course that is changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is interesting. The Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act were signed by Nixon. The Clean Air Act was reauthorized by Bush Sr. which brought in the provisions for the response to SOX and NOX emissions.  The Republicans took a hard-right turn somewhere after that though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Clean Air Act hails from 1963 and was signed by LBJ. There was a major amendment in 1970 that Nixon signed.</p>
<p>Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act but it was then passed by a veto proof majority in Congress. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Bottom line: coal is somewhat cleaner than it used to be, and we're burning far less of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If &quot;we&quot; means the US, you're right. The US is burning around 30% less coal than it was in the 90s.</p>
<p>If &quot;we&quot; means the world, you're wrong. The world is burning nearly 50% more coal now than it did in the 90s, though usage peaked in 2016.</p>
<p>Thank China for the increase; China alone burns nearly as much coal annually as the whole world did 20 years ago, though they have also peaked.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but if I remember the very basic science about acid rain I leaned in school it is predominantly caused by &quot;local&quot; emissions. (Emissions in the midwest causing acid rain in the eastern states) So while coal plants I'm china would be a concern for global warming, it wouldn't be a cause of acid rain in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, I'm focusing on the US. China now has its own domestic acid rain problem, but that's not going to noticeably impact the United States.
The flow of emissions in the atmosphere is obviously pretty complex, but SO2 has a moderately localized impact (i.e.; it doesn't get dispersed globally like CO2 or CFCs, but has a larger range than mercury). Even within the US the EPA designated specified sub-regions within the trading system to prevent a concentration of emissions (e.g.; all the Texas and East Coast coal plants remediate and sell their allowances to Ohio and Western PA, leaving those communities with the brunt of the pollution).</p></div>		</li>
