			<div class="markdown"><p>True for a standard medical x-ray (I assume), but advanced x-ray imaging techniques used in research settings do make use of lenses to focus the beam to a tiny spot. As a result, the x-ray beam would have a finite depth of field. These techniques usually scan the beam around the object to be imaged to get 3D information about its structure, so the analogy with optical imaging isn't perfect. Still, if the beam weren't correctly focused, there would be a loss of resolution.</p>
<p>X-rays are electromagnetic radiation just like visible light, the depth of field depends on the x-ray optics and the specific wavelengths involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>X-ray lenses?  Do you mean mirrors?  I'm not familiar with any materials that act as xray lenses.</p>
<p>You can get xrays to reflect off some materials at shallow angles (grazing incidence).  You can use this effect to focus xrays, for instance on a telescope.  An xray telescope looks like this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolter_telescope" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolter_telescope</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are x-ray Fresnel lenses - it's typically called a &quot;zone plate&quot;.  There's a good simple explanation of the theory <a href="http://zoneplate.lbl.gov/theory" target="_blank">here</a>.  The depth of field is calculated the same as for any other lens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can 'lens' X-Rays in a crude way by using fibre optic bundles.</p>
<p>Since X-Rays generated from a characteristic lines of a metal target are divergent, there are a number of strategies to increase your beam intensity by collecting from as wide of an arc as possible without having a massive, diffuse beam. The 'traditional' way is a parabolic mirror, but an alternative is to use a 'parabolic' array of fibre optic cables, which are then collected and bundled up parallel, giving you a kinda collimated beam. The 'down sides' (this is the same for most collection methods tbh) are that you are using total external reflections which have a pretty narrow collection angle, and you still retain that angular distribution in the transmitted beam. This is normally mitigated somewhat by two pairs of layered grazing mirrors in perpendicular orientations to reduce the angular distribution.</p>
<p>The end result is a pretty significant increase in beam intensity. The bundles make your apparatus a bit long, but that's not a huge deal.</p>
<p>^(Plz don't ask hard questions, I'll have to open my thesis and I really don't want to do that, I keep finding mistakes whenever I open it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the &quot;focus&quot; of the x rays in medical imaging is actually a factor when you put the imaging plate in front or behind a person. The structures in the body are magnified when they are further away from the imaging plate. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't mind me asking, is there a manufacturer that makes a system that actually registers a parallax error as such, and warns the user? If so, how is the info used in QC? And does it ever register at say, 10cm when you're using the air-gap technique?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes</p>
<p>There are X-ray optics that can make the source into a parallel beam. These are commonly used in X-ray diffraction.</p>
<p>For collimation there are two fundamental kinds of collimation, one is 'spatially collimated' which is synonymous with 'parallel' in most cases. The other is temporally collimated which means the beam is monochromatic like a laser. If you have a high degree of both then you can do some fun stuff with Fourier Transforms like coherent diffraction imaging.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It not related to whether the imaging plate is in front or behind i.e. AP or PA. Its the size of the object image distance (OID), the greater the OID the greater the magnification,  &gt; the greater the amount of penumbra produced &gt; which blurs the image. I think you are talking about AP chest x rays causing more magnification of the heart than PA views.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes!</p>
<p>The &quot;precision&quot; (or radiographic detail) of an image is closely related to something called the Object to Film Distance, or OFD, and the Source (meaning source of x-rays) to Image Distance, or SID.</p>
<p>For an illustration in &quot;the real world&quot; look at the way you shoot a wrist series vs a chest x-ray:</p>
<p>The wrist we can just plunk down right on the film/image receptor.   Most folks' bones are within an inch of the film/IR, and show up accurately with the SID being 36-40 inches.</p>
<p>If you shoot a chest x-ray at 40 inches, the heart appears larger-than-life on the image, because of the ratio between the heart's distance to the film and the source's distance to the film.  This is why we shoot chest x-rays at 72 inches.  Additionally, we have the patient face the film (not the X-ray machine) because the heart is closer to the sternum than the spine.</p>
<p>To see this work in practice, grab a flashlight and sit at a table.  Hold your​ finger an inch over the table and the flashlight a couple feet over your finger.  Pretty distinct shadow, no?</p>
<p>Now, move your finger closer to the flashlight.  See how the shadow gets bigger, but less distinct?  Now keep your finger still, but move the flashlight​ away from your finger - the shadow shrinks and becomes more distinct, right?</p>
<p>Boom, you got it now!</p>
<p>You do my next few patients, okay?  I'm going for coffee.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That or a photogram (I prefer the analogy to a photogram because bones and most things X-rayed are typically a bit more 3 dimensional than a negative in a contact print).</p></div>		</li>
