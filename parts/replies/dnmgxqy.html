<p>That doesn't in any way imply the very specific behavior of 'tail wagging'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't cut it off upon birth do they? Or do they let them grow up with it? Wouldn't they want to let it grow and develop to see how it functions later on? To study it further? If the person can control it etc. Plus, the person with it might like it and think it's fun.
This may just be me thinking it'd be fun if humans had tails as I surely would want to keep one if born with it. But still, I truly think someone born with one should be allowed to grow up with it regardless if it's &quot;unnatural&quot; by modern anatomical standards.</p></div>		</li>
