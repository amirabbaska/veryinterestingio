			<div class="markdown"><p>They are probably using the definition of entropy from data science.  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory</a>) </p>
<p>But that applies to discrete mechanisms, not continuous analog ones like the Brain.  The algorithm takes as input the result of an ffmri machine and doing some kind of algorithm over that to produce a brain entropy number.  Looks like you can download the code that does the conversion here:  <a href="https://cfn.upenn.edu/~zewang/BENtbx.php" target="_blank">https://cfn.upenn.edu/~zewang/BENtbx.php</a>  Associated PDF has some explanations as to how it's calculated.  </p>
<p>Measuring the entropy of a brain is not possible since neurons are analog wave patterns, wave forms transmitted and received in tones, pulses, strobes and intensity, they're not discrete.  So whatever this thing is measuring, it's probably not entropy, but the amount of activity.  But that's what science is all about, the Brain Entropy metric doesn't seem to change over time, but Caffine makes it rise.  There's this metric, it measures the brain somehow, it correlates with intelligence and caffine makes it rise and fall.  Science is about doing analyses and saying: &quot;Eureka this is significantly correlated with overall intelligence&quot;, vs &quot;Erueka this is just measuring blood flow&quot;. </p>
<p>But assuming you could accurately measure what they claim to, it would be awesome.  Students wouldn't need a test at the end of the semester to prove they have the material.  Just measure your brain with the machine to see if the data is there.  So if Caffeine increases brain entropy, another experiment would be to see if narcotics like Cocaine make it rise more.  Is this a dead end or a breakthrough discovery?  Calling all Jan Michael Vincents to reproduce these data and see if it's flim flam for billable hours, or a breakthrough algorithm that can separate smart people from dumb people with better accuracy than any aptitude test.  </p>
<p>Daniel Amen said he could take brain scans and reliably separate out the normal productive citizens from career criminals (in and out of jail) given only the scan output itself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esPRsT-lmw8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esPRsT-lmw8</a> so maybe they've distilled this into algorithmic form?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>The brain of a tossed coin has 2 bits worth of entropy.</p>

<p>Should this be 1 bit for 2 states of heads/tails?</p></div>		</li>

<p>So if coffee increases brain entropy, so also does other narcotics like cocaine.</p>

<p>So cocaine is just as good as caffeine for this &quot;brain entropy&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a brief clarification.  Entropy is not just a measure of the total number of states accessible but rather how widely distributed those states are.  So for instance, knowing one hundred facts about dinosaurs gives a lower entropy state than knowing one fact about one hundred unrelated topics.  Entropy is therefore a measure of variability in your sample space, and indeed, for normal distributions the entropy measure is proportional to the variance.  In this study they use fMRI to study the variance in brain signals while a person meditates on various topics.  More intelligent people seem to have a higher entropy because their brain scans show wider ranging activity (as opposed to really intense focused activity), and likewise, drinking caffeine boosts the variance in your brain signalling, allowing you to cast a wider neural net, so to speak.  It's confusing because there are many different measures of entropy... Linguists, for example define high entropy as a large number of new ideas per sentence, while low entropy is redundancy.  Shannon famously proved that a computer requires low entropy (redundant) code in order to avoid errors.  These don't seem to be the definitions for entropy used here.  They are literally just looking at the variance in brain waves measured by functional magnetic resonance.  Still interesting, but harder to draw concrete conclusions from other than smart people/caffeinated people have over active brains signalling relative to control groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the first line of the link you'd provided pretty says it all.</p>
<p>&quot;Entropy is an important trait of brain function and high entropy indicates high information processing capacity.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm reading that as increased entropy when resting like when watching TV or sitting in a classroom.</p>
<p>And now I'm wondering why this would even be a study to begin with?</p>
<p>Isn't it obvious already?</p>
<p>Classroom without coffee = half asleep</p>
<p>Classroom with coffee = alert and wide awake</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's good to have studies prove what we think is true, even obviously true. It's proof that we're right, and proof that we're right <em>for the right reasons</em>, not a separate or underlying reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't this about RESTING brain entropy? So that would mean where your brain is without external stimulus...right? (I'd didn't read the article) Like resting heart rate - it's what your heart rate is when you're at rest. Cardio helps reduce your resting heart rate, caffeine helps increase your resting brain entropy. So I take that to mean, someone who uses caffeine will have higher cognition right when they wake up as opposed to someone who doesn't use caffeine.</p>
<p>What I mean to say, is I don't know that class on caffeine vs not on caffeine is the right example. We already knew caffeine was a stimulant and understand how it works. This is instead about the effects of caffeine outside of direct caffeine use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I see resting as just that, resting....not sleeping. </p>
<p>I could be wrong, but that's how I perceived it.</p></div>		</li>
