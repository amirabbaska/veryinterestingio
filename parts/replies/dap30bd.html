<ul>
<li>
<p>To be in the top 1%, in the US, by income, only requires around $300k/year salary. Which is <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/49807529" target="_blank">not that much</a>. (It really isn't that much. It is &quot;don't have to worry about student loans, assuming your parents have good financial sense/support you&quot;, but it is NOT &quot;have $1mil in trust funds at the age of 18&quot;). </p>
</li>
<li>To be in the top 1%, in the US, by net worth, is about $8.5 million (ish, couldn't find 2016 data). This is the group you are referring to. The lowest yearly income in this group is around $350k, but the average is about $900k, so it's pretty obvious this is what you mean when you're talking about annual incomes averaging one million. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your numbers are off on income, according to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/income-rank/" target="_blank">CNN</a>. Even that article you linked says $250,000 is only in the top 2.9%, and it ranks up very quickly after than. </p>
<p>I'm above that, but I still have massive debt because my parents weren't. I need to make up for a huge deficit that I started with. It's more about wealth than income.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spez: The CNN numbers are from 2013. I'm using the numbers quoted in the thread, which are from 2016, and fully admit I could neither find those numbers nor do I know for sure if they're accurate. The actual 1% might be more like 400k/year. </p>
<p>Most of the top-level comments in this thread are saying &quot;It's usually people who have the top 1% highest income&quot; and then saying things that imply extreme wealth, and those just aren't the same thing. Top 1% of wealth and top 1% by income are very, very different beasts! When most people say &quot;the 1%&quot; they mean &quot;extremely wealthy&quot; and that description usually only applies to the top 1% by net worth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that would be 300k/year <em>individually</em>.  A family with each high-level exec may make 600k/year +.  30+ y/o individuals making that much may also have savings or stock portfolios returning not-insignificant dividends. </p>
<p>A 600k/yer + family could very, very easily establish a trust for a newborn that would vest at ~1million by the time a child was 18.  Even middle class families making far less than 300k/individual or 600k/couple can manage to have a college tuition account that covers part of a good chunk of a child's tuition; at 300k/year with minimally sound investing, would have very little trouble getting a ~1m trust fund for an 18 or 21 year old.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure that statistic is household income (likely to contain lots of either one executive making the lion's share or two similarly paid professionals).  </p>
<p>A family with two $300,000/yr earners would have a household income of $600,000/yr.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>The 99% will have to either take out loans, or have their parents take out loans to go to school. That's 30k - 100k of debt. </p>

<p>I think this right here is one the largest disconnects between the wealthy and those who aren't.  It reminds me of the story about the boots where it ends up being more expensive to be poor.  Two men need to buy boots for the winter.  The first man is poor, so he spends $25 on boots.  The second man is rich, so he spends $75 on boots.  The $25 boots only last for a season.  The $75 boots, however, can last for years.  In fact, five years later, the boots are still going strong.  Our poor guy, however, has had to buy new boots every single winter.  So over the last five years, the poor man has spent $125 on boots, where the rich guy only spent $75.</p>
<p>I went to a public, in-state university.  The first three years of college I lived in my Aunt and Uncle's basement to save money.  I left school with a very small amount of dept compared to the average graduate: only ~$40,000 dollars.  For the next ten years, ~$5500 a year, or about 14% of my annual, pre-tax salary*, goes to paying off these loans.  Money that could go into retirement, into savings, into the down-payment on a house, a college fund for my future children.  </p>
<p>*I understand that my education was an investment, and I make more money now than I did then, so the payments at one point dropped to &quot;only&quot; 9% of my pre-tax salary, and I've now bumped them up to 10% to try to pay off early, but it was rough for quite a few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree.  People who managed to get through school without any loans sometimes cannot fathom the level of burden it is.  I'm a post-grad Ph.D. holder with only around $31k of debt left.  That's exceptionally modest compared to many post-masters and post-docs.  Even still I put down $600/mo to that and wont be done paying it for another 5 years.</p>
<p>Now, as you said in your edit, I know that this was a good investment and will in the long term make me far better off.  Even now I make more post-tax income than anyone in my direct family has ever made. But imagine that $600/mo going into an investment portfolio or into house equity or whatever...  And there are millions of people in far far greater straights than me.  The level of debt burden on those who will soon be (if not currently are) the drivers of our entire economy is insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also affects choices. I went to law school and amassed massive debt to do it. I couldn't afford to work an entry level attorney job, it didn't pay enough to cover living and nearly $1000 per month in student loan payments. So I'm not an attorney. 17 years later I'm still working in the real estate field that I worked in during law school. </p>
<p>No question that the education still helped and has helped my career (I'm in the upper levels of the career), but after 17 years at this point I would probably be making much more as an attorney. Even if I switched at this point I would be entry level again, and I can't afford it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>He can invest 200k in index funds in an IRA or other fund, and just let the market make him a millionaire by virtue of compound interest in 10 years.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to turn $200k into a million over 10 years you need to return nearly 18% annually.  I like your post but your numbers are way off.  </p>
<p>Compound interest is fun, but let's stay grounded in reality.  In today's economy someone would be ecstatic to double their investment in 10 years.</p></div>		</li>
