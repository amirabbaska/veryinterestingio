Yes, that was my main worry when I heard about this system (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01564" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01564</a>) The most distant planet (h) receives about 40x the sun's X-ray flux and 20x the sun's UV flux which could strip an Earth's ocean's worth of water in a billion years. BUT it now seems likely that the outer few planets have several times the water that Earth does! It still seems possible for some kind of life to survive on the night side of some of the planets or in deep oceans. There are ways to measure exo-magnetospheres but so far I believe this is limited to hot Jupiters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What u/mattrusso says feeds into the bigger question of the search for life in the galaxy. Most of this search so far has focused on finding life similar to our own (planets in the right range to have liquid water, low X-rays etc.). That's REALLY limiting the types of life we can find, but it makes sense, since we know how to look for Earth-like life, and don't know how to look for other types we've never seen.</p>
<p>But the search for life is not the only goal. By finding thousands of planets outside our solar system, we also get to learn what the diversity of planets looks like, whether different planets form in different ways--it allows us to put our own solar system (a sample size of 1!) into a wider context. </p>
<p>So I think part of why the TRAPPIST-1 system is so exciting is that we have a whole spectrum of planets in the same system, with a range of conditions. Maybe the innermost planet has a lot of melting and volcanism because of tides raised by the star (see answer to u/onetimeforacomment). That's amazing! We could potentially see evidence of that in its atmosphere with JWST. There might be too many X-rays, but like matt said, there could be subsurface life. It's an opportunity to see what's possible and learn things we would never have been creative enough to guess ahead of time!</p></div>		</li>
