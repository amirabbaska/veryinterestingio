			<div class="markdown"><p>Right... It wouldn't have any more mass or be affected by gravity any more than it already is, it just has a secondary force applied. </p>
<p>Such as if I put my foot on the scale as my sister checks her weight. She doesn't weigh any more than she would if my foot wasn't on the scale, but I have to slow down her consumption of my girl scout cookies somehow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the math can get pretty weird when you start looking at the angles. Basically if poth are perfectly level on the surface then the weight is still the addition of the 2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they weren't perfectly level you'd presumably have some horizontal component of the magnetic force which would presumably push the floating one away. </p>
<p>If it's still floating there and there are no other forces acting on it except the magnetic force and gravity, then its full weight does press down on the other magnet. </p></div>		</li>
