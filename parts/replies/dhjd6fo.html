			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Are the heads and tails actually dumped down the drain? Or is there a use?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heads and tails are combined with the product of the first distillation, the &quot;low wines&quot;, and these are fed into the second distillation to minimise waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone else already said, it just gets fed round and round and round. When the mash is totally spent it is usually drained out, the alcohol evaporates off, and what remains is used as fertiliser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would just like to point out that it's very unlikely for higher alcohols to turn into lower alcohols over time, just as ethanol doesn't magically turn into methanol if you leave it for long enough. Most alcohols are pretty stable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apologies yes that was a mistake on my part. As I understand what happens is higher alcohols are drawn into the wood itself through adsorption.</p>
<p>And you are of course right that methanol is a lower alcohol not a higher one. So you tend to get methanol in the heads and higher alcohols in the tails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no reason for the wood to adsorb higher alcohols more than lower alcohols, at least none that I can think of. Wood is a very polar matrix, this is why it tends to soak up water quite well. Higher alcohols turn proportionally more &quot;oily&quot; which seems to indicate the contrary. However, if the tails are properly discarded as you said the initial amount will already be low enough to give a better taste. Some of them can even be quite aromatic and pleasant btw, even &quot;fruit like&quot;. Now of course all these alcohols are further lost when aging, because their volatility, the &quot;angels' share &quot;.</p></div>		</li>
