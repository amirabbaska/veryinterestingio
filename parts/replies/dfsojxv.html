			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be closer to the top since it points out the false premise of the question. Every book I've read on the subject says that hunter gatherers have more variety in their diet than settled agricultural societies, who developed health problems that hunter gatherers didn't have. Of course middle and upper class people of the last few generations have been able to eat food from around the world at more and more times of the year, so we are probably getting more variety back into our diets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well-said. Most early agricultural societies focused primarily on one or a few crops. A diet that's 90% corn is going to give you fewer nutrients than a diet of fish, deer, rabbit, mushrooms, roots, berries, herbs, and other things obtained from the wild.</p></div>		</li>
