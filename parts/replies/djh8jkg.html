			<div class="markdown"><p>According to classical electrodynamics the momentum should diminish over time. That is the case because any accelerating charge will inevitably emit electromagnetic radiation which carries away energy, thus taking away from the kinetic energy of the charged particle.</p>
<p>According to QM (like the previous poster explained), only discrete (quantised) states exist; transitions between these quantised states do happen spontaneously and are accompanied by radiation <em>but they can only happen if a lower-energy state is accessible</em>. Thanks to this spontaneous process, however, most electrons are  in the lowest accessible energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the classical picture, electrons would have to give off electromagnetic radiation as they orbit the nucleus, reducing the elections' speed. That is why it was so confusing that electrons don't constantly emit this radiation. The discovery that electrons exist in discrete states could explain why they didn't emit radiation (they can only emit discrete amounts of radiation that exactly brings them to a lower level) but it was quantum mechanics that explained why these discrete states exist in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The momentum an electron can have is limited kind of like the vibrations on a guitar string. When you pluck the string, only certain vibrations are stable, so you'll only hear a note and its harmonics. The space around the nucleus is like the string, and the electron is like the &quot;pluck&quot;, it can only exist at certain resonances within that space which correspond to different levels of momentum.</p>
<p>Unlike the guitar string, the electron can ONLY have those resonances. So while a string will slowly lose energy back to the environment, the electron will keep resonating forever. It will only change momentum if it absorbs or emits a photon, and it has to go to exactly one of the other allowed levels.</p>
<p>The level where the electron is &quot;stuck&quot; in the middle, momentum=0, isn't one of the allowed levels. So it's actually impossible. That said, it is possible to FIND the electron inside the nucleus of an atom, in fact for a Hydrogen atom (one electron), the very center of the nucleus is the most likely single point to find it. But the nucleus is still very small compared to the volume of an atom, so it's still very unlikely. If you did find it there, it would never have zero momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Why&quot; questions aren't REALLY answerable but I'll give it a shot...</p>
<p>The discreteness of energy states in atomic systems is mostly caused by the inability (due to physics) to accurately know a particle's position and momentum at the same time. An electron, or any particle, behaves more like a lump that can be spread out when the position isn't narrowly constrained or bunched up when it is. Likewise, the momentum might be hazy (causing the position lump to spread out over time) or it might be narrowly constrained (causing the lump to stay more bunched up over time). But, it will never have a narrowly-constrained position AND a narrowly-constrained momentum, at least not beyond a particular limit.</p>
<p>When we talk about atomic systems we've limited the position of the particle to the vicinity of an atom, so the momentum must be hazier. It's this haziness that actually prevents the electron from reaching lower energy levels. Supposing it did &quot;stick&quot; to the nucleus by chance, this means you have a very bunched-up lump at the center of the atom. But if the position is very bunched-up then the momentum must be very hazy, and a moment later the lump will be spread out. The more bunched-up it was initially, the faster it will spread. And then your electron can be found somewhere else!</p>
<p>When it comes to orbitals (bad name due to no orbiting happening) there are other effects that come into play. As long as it's just a single electron things are pretty simple, but electrons interact with each other in weird ways that push out the extra electrons until they're most likely to be found in weird lobe-shaped areas around the atom. It might be helpful to think of them as probability densities, but that's just the math we use to understand it. The shapes of the lobes can change a lot when atoms form bonds, and they get even crazier in metals where the electrons can move freely among ALL the atoms! So I would say the shapes and densities of the orbitals aren't really the important part, it has to do more with the energy levels of the electrons and the structure of the container they're trapped in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is beyond the horizon of scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>Yes, there are, in general, multiple orbitals that correspond to each energy state. However in multi-electron atoms, interactions between the electrons shift the energy of each orbital.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if so, would that mean the states are defined more by probability densities that we choose to represent as discrete?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure if I understand your question. Are you asking whether we could make the discrete properties of quantum systems disappear if we chose a different mathematical formalism? The answer to that is yes, however that would conflict with experimental results. The reason that physicists inserted the assumption of discrete energy levels into quantum theory is because there was strong evidence that electrons can only exist at certain energy levels. When you heat up a sample of any pure element and look at the light it emits as it cools down, the frequency distribution is a Gaussian with a precise mean and a dispersion that is consistent with the uncertainty principle. The only reasonable interpretation of this is that the electrons are falling from one fixed energy level to another.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not totally. We know that quantum mechanics gives rise to discrete energy states in some cases and not in others. We can tell beforehand which systems are going to have discrete spectra. If the differential equations that govern the behaviour of the system have continuous eigenvalues, then the system will have continuous energy states.</p>
<p>Why there should be differential equations governing the behaviour of anything in the first place is beyond the realm of science.</p></div>		</li>
