			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say humans are outliers in how helpless our babies are. There are many altricial species out there where the young are as (if not more so) helpless as newborn babies. Plenty of animals give birth to deaf and blind young that cannot do anything. (comparatively, our young are born with all their senses present) </p>
<p>The length of time for which we are helpless is somewhat of an outlier, but also not strange considering how many more skills we have to develop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address</p>
<p>Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient</p>
<p>So somebody's got to go kill something while I look after the kids</p>
<p>&quot;I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this thing its milk?&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you heard the theory that babies born at home cry less often than babies born within the medical industry i.e. hospitals? I would like to see some studies for or against this idea before I form an opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal:  My son was born in a hospital and was not crying upon emerging from my body since he had a cord wrapped around his neck.  My OBGYN is a ninja and instantly unwrapped him and saved him, but we sure did not hear a peep from him the whole time.  His eyes were WIDE open and he just looked around at everything when he first got here.</p></div>		</li>
