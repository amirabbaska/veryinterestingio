			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow I now understand what that mission was about. Being a kid who didn't care about the history when I first played the story, it never occurred to me what was going on. Just that it was a bitch to constantly have to raid towns in order to be able to finally create units. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the Great Wall was breached centuries before the Mongols conquered China. The first emperor of Later Jin gave the Liao people the modern day Beijing area for their support for him overthrowing the Later Tang dynasty, and this proved to be a weak spot to the Song dynasty later, then the Jurchens conquered the Liao and Mongols conquered Jurchens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a sanders supporter, but I don't have any issue with building a wall.  It'd cut down on illegal immigration, which surely wouldn't have a negative impact on the country.  However, I'd expect for there to be a legal process for entering the country, but I think that already exists.  But we either have rules about illegal immigration, or we don't; it's silly to just be like &quot;oh don't worry, they can come if they want to!&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
