			<div class="markdown"><p>French <em>steak tartare</em>, Italian <em>carpaccio</em> are done with raw meat, Japanese <em>Sushi</em> are done with raw fish.  Human can perfectly eat raw meat/fish and even enjoy it. </p>
<p>That said cooked meat/fish will reduce the risk of parasite and might help (no idea in fact) with not fully fresh meat. And of course the taste which is different after cooking (and help you to forget that you're eating a piece of a dead animal) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that being old isn't the only way meat gets bad. Even living meat can be riddled with parasites or disease giving pathogens that can quite happily cause you problems when you hack it off and consume it. Of course, most meat raising techniques will attempt to minimize these.</p></div>		</li>
