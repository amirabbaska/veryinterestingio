			<div class="markdown"><p>This is 98% correct, but: if you cause any cellular damage or other tissue trauma on implantation you're going to get an inflammatory response. While this won't target your biocompatible chip directly, it can trigger nonspecific immune attacks in the area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm.. I believe you to be only about 99.73% correct. Cellular osmosis can only occur when the cell membrane is susceptible to cardinal lymphostasis. Even though your biocompatible chip may have a non specific immune response, it does not mean that the inflammatory nodules in your tissue will reject implantation. </p></div>		</li>
