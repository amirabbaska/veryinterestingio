			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah I've spent enough time in America, and I was/am political science major so ive taken a few classes about laws here, to know a bit about how the legal system works. </p>
<p>What skuchoochum said is true - technicalities and wording are really important  in laws here. I don't really agree with the loophole since I think normal Kinder eggs present the same hazard when they're either surrounded wholly or by two bits of chocolate. </p>
<p>What you also have to keep in mind is that there may be more to the ban than just, &quot;kids can choke and die&quot;. Corporations can lobby congress and that goes a long way; so it's not uncommon for them (read: they do it all the time) to lobby congress to pass laws to their advantage, and competitor's (is that apostrophe right?) disadvantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American sense. The one where technicalities matter more than the intention of a law. Quite the duality; I bet some people probably think the law is fine as it is and should exist in the first place, and at the same time consider the loop hole perfectly fine as well. That they do not experience painful cognitive dissonance is beyond me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never knew these were illegal. I always see the regular eggs in most Italian super markets around me and they sell without any issues. I believe they are imported from Italy. </p>
<p>And no, it's not the knockoffs. It's actually a hollow egg with a tiny capsule inside. You can shake it like a one seeded marraca. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhhhhhh.... who can fit a whole egg in their mouth and still chew them? I don't see why that's illegal. No one is going to swallow a kinder egg without chewing and realizing they're plastic. Wtf US? </p>
<p>(Working on the knowledge of being unable to see the top comments that explain anything specific about regulations)</p></div>		</li>
