			<div class="markdown"><p>Symmetry is a signifier of health and lack of parasites and disease.  If you see someone with a horribly unsymmetrical face (think disfigured) do you normally think they are just ugly or do you think there is something else probably wrong? Many illnesses cause facial disfigurement. </p>
<p>Also, blondes in our culture are seen as more desirable but that comes back to health as well. Doesn’t have to do with being unique like people tend to assume. Blondes have more difficultly hiding illness. They tend to have fairer skin that can’t hide exhaustion or sickness. So if a blonde looks healthy then she is most likely healthy. Brunettes with darker complexions can hide illness easier so it is more of a gamble. </p>
<p>Attractiveness always comes down to signifiers of health, fertility, and ability of provide.  Of course people have kinks, but that’s more of an exception than the rule. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming the blonde theory is yours? There are far more dark colored heads than light globally, this would indicate the opposite of what you're explaining as being more desirable.</p></div>		</li>

Thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The appeal of blondes and light skin is more likely cultural due to European colonisation, dessimation of white supremacist ideologies and racist/classist stereotypes of darker skintones. There is not much biological basis for pale skin being preferable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Populations generate genetic diversity very quickly, which is important for adaptability, but that genetic diversity in itself is not very useful for increasing reproductive success, except in very seldom cases where it does create an advantage over the mean. In most cases, however, that genetic variation actually produces the opposite effect. Even though having changes present in your population is good, most changes themselves are NOT good, they actually reduce the viability of an organism compared to the mean organism of a population, hence the evolved behavioral bias toward sexual preference for the genetic average of your population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TL, DR: Species benefit from having variation in their population, as it occasionally produces good changes that help the species adapt to their environment, but that comes at the expense of producing many more bad changes. Natural selection does not reward bad changes, so there's an adaptation within sexual selection to prefer the mean and stay away from changes in general.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How would this explain people attracted to those outside their population/heritage?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Average preference doesn't account for individual preference. The diversity of the population is expressed in sexual preference as well, as it assures good genetic mixing. </p>
</li>
<li>Gotto also remember that our population as a species is human first, with races being secondary characteristics. We're primarily attracted to the human average, underneath it all, which is largely shared among all races. </li>
