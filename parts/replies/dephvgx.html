<p>Edit:  Thanks u/Bobenstien for pointing out the app <a href="https://wipac.wisc.edu/deco/home" target="_blank">DECO</a> as well as documentation of events <a href="https://wipac.wisc.edu/deco/data" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I find this incredibly hard to visualize. In the video you posted, should we assume the ray did not pass through the lens but instead hit the sensor on it's own? (This is reasonable because if it went through the lens it would be a point?) This means that the ray is in fact much larger than it seems imposed on a background that has been magnified, yes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cosmic rays will pretty much pass through anything in their way, if they pass through the CCD or CMOS sensors then they excite electrons, many more than a single photon would in fact, which registers a signal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine taking a knife (the cosmic ray) and a piece of paper (your sensor). The ray isn't really affected by anything in terms of orientation, so when it hits the paper the resultant streak will really just depend on where the knife was coming from and what angle the knife was hitting the paper. For example, it could hit point on, which would look like a spot, or it could come roughly perpendicular, which would create a long cut as it passed through.</p></div>		</li>
