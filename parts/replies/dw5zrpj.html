<p>Is this energy loss converted to heat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The energy has to go somewhere and as a rule of thumb, it usually becomes heat.</p>
<p>Don't quote me on this but my understanding is the dielectric has polar molecules which align with the electric field. Thus, while a capacitor is electrostatic rather than &quot;chemical&quot; energy storage, the chemicals in it physically respond to the field and their positioning is responsible for its performance compared to empty space, for example.</p>
<p>This is true for inductors, and &quot;saturation&quot; is when all the dipoles are aligned and this effect cannot continue to improve performance (beyond that of empty space). Disclaimer: I may be mistakenly applying this concept to capacitors. </p>
<p>So the losses are essentially friction as the electric field is causing motion (alignment) of the molecules to the polarity of the field. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the thermal energy released due to the electrons hitting each other when current flows in addition to the resistivity of the wire. Meaning the greater the impedance the more the electrons hit each other thus releasing more heat? So the heat that dissipation is due to the electrons hitting each other and due to the physical resistivity of the medium? </p>
<p>Is this similar to the thermal voltage characteristics of a diode?</p>
<p>I'm currently studying EE and this stuff confuses me...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the energy loss is <em>realized</em> as heat dissipation.  Some of the useful energy in the electric field is converted to waste energy (heat) as the field changes direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you like it!  I tried to explain the entire phenomenon without getting into the complex number part and give a real-world example of how we use it.</p>
<p>Not to sling too much mud, but I'm sad to see that the high-karma answer is so far off-base.  Joule heating does not really apply to a properly functioning capacitor, though as I noted, we can approximate it as such via the ESR under the right circumstances.  The comments under mine provide a better picture of the mechanism of loss via dipole re-orientation under the influence of the electric field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for your explanation, as I am constantly disappointed with ELI5s that necessitate further analysis. I have a physics degree, so I look for answers that can teach me something. Yours did :)</p>
<p>Eh Reddit is becoming a marketing factory just like everything else. Maybe too cynical to say that but oh well. Keep answering questions!</p></div>		</li>
