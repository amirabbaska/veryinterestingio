			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a preeeetty sketchy source for answering a scientific question. And it really bugs me that you're upvoted so much by people who didn't check your source. From her &quot;about&quot; page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Claire Obeid is a Certified Holistic Health Coach and Yoga Teacher who inspires women to discover balance, true happiness and perfect health. </p>
<p>What am I about? Oh-so-much. A soul-centered and heart-driven life. Inside-out wellness. Shadow work (from the darkness comes the light!) Truth-seeking. Leaning into the joy of life.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.precisionnutrition.com/all-about-phytates-phytic-acid" target="_blank">Another source</a> concludes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To argue that some plant foods are “unhealthy” because of their phytic acid content seems mistaken, especially when phytic acid’s potential negative effects on mineral assimilation may be offset by its health benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it may not be as simple as that blogger states. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially when the blogger draws her source from a foundation that <a href="http://www.vegsource.com/articles2/fuhrman_dietary_myths.htm" target="_blank">advocates eating clay among having other issues</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blog is quackery. Another post is that you need to 'activate' nuts before you eat them in order to get the 'vitality' from them.</p>
<p>As for zero qualifications, she's a:</p>
<p>&quot;Certified Holistic Health Coach&quot;</p>
<p>Which sounds about as useful as a theoretical degree in Astrophysics </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, then there's the question of raw vs cooked vs the fermented / soaked then cooked.</p>
<p>Because if you actually eat raw, as the OP asked, you won't have as many nutrients biologically available, especially any proteins.</p>
<p>That's an issue with raw eggs, they have higher amount of nutrients than cooked, but you loose some bioavialabilty, thus the body doesn't actually absorb as many proteins. </p>
<p>In the case of eggs, it's fascinating how different cooking methods will loose different nutrients... Boiling will reduce water-soluble nutrients such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium for example... frying you loose more of the protein content, certain other vitamins too since they're amino-acids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a bit skeptical of phytic acid in raw oats being much of a problem. Claire Obeid is a little too new-agey self-helpy for my taste. Also went to a couple of websites with doctors giving opinions about oats, and no mention of problems with raw oats were there.</p></div>		</li>
