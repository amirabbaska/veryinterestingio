			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The whole process is secret. The only person who knows is the judge and the U.S. Attorneys working the case. They would be in big trouble if they leaked the names of the people on the Grand Jury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is going to become a very heated question. I don't see how they can pick a non-partisan jury at this point, plus given his abuse of power in the past, it's not out of the realm of possibility that he will have play in who is chosen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the process is so secretive, it is unlikely that Trump was even notified that a grand jury was being convened. If he was, then that would be a scandal itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are getting downvoted because you are confusing grand jury with the trial jury.  They are at two different ends of the process.  Grand jury at the very start to determine whether a case is legitimate.  Two separate sets of people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Against whom? I'm really lost. Are the subpoenas threatening to the Trump Administration, or to those investigating the Trump Administration? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All we know is that the people subpoenaed are connected to the Russian investigation. I find it unlikely that the grand jury is convened to consider charges against those investigating the Trump Administration. Most likely, the grand jury is considering charges against Flynn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>do you presume to know the intended purpose of the 5th amendment? It almost seems as if it's protection of the government from the law. I've seen cases where police officers avoided facing very serious charges due to the Grand Jury process, but citizens are not afforded this luxury. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without a grand jury, the prosecutor gets to use his or her own discretion about whether to pursue a case. A grand jury is composed of our peers. A grand jury gives you a chance to have your peers put a stop to things before you go to trial.</p>
<p>The protection of a Grand Jury is not significant though. The prosecutor has so much control over what the grand jury hears that it is considered very easy to get an indictment. When I see a case where the grand jury does not indict, I assume that the prosecutor was not serious about seeking charges, or that the evidence was truly pitiful.</p></div>		</li>
