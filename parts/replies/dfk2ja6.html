			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been a runner for about 3 years now, off and on. I usually run around 20-25mi per week, and my longest run ever was around 14mi. My resting HR is around 60-65. I find that to be an accomplishment given I spent age 15-25 doing nothing but drinking and smoking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that amazing! I'm glad you're doing something for the better of yourself. I myself cant run 20-25mi a week. I track I'm a sprinter so at most we're getting 6-10mi per week. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I do too much sprinting, my knees can have problems--mainly due to a lack of flexibility from all those years of inactivity. My hips are super inflexible, so my knees take up the slack. Slowly working on loosening things up with stretching and yoga.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as it's not irregular, you shouldn't worry too much. Some people have good genes with strong hearts and alveoli in their lungs, but it doesn't hurt to have it checked out anyways. Stress, substances (caffeine/nicotine/alcohol) and other factors plays a pretty big role in this as well.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! That's reassuring. It's been like this most of my life, but I never put a second thought into it. It just was brought to my attention when I would test my rhr and anytime I'd be working in the field (construction) my hands and nose would freeze quickly. Abnormally cold</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My resting heart rate is about 60, and I don't do any sports, consume lots of substances I shouldn't consume, and generally live a very unhealthy lifestyle. I'm not overweight and I don't smoke, so maybe that contributes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, right now I'm sitting at just under 60. Though it's often down to mid 40s. I spend most of my time in front of the computer and my only exercise is dance classes twice a week and walking ~30 min a day to/from uni.</p></div>		</li>
