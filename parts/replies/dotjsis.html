			<div class="markdown"><p>In classical mechanics, yes, but not in relativity. Einstein's famous equation is actually: E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2. Light has energy (E) but no mass (m), thus the equation simplifies to: E = pc. Rearrange and the momentum is p = E/c.</p>
<p>EDIT: It was bothering me that I used a lowercase e, so I changed it to E.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I guess that, for objects with mass at low (non-relativistic) speeds, p^(2)c^(2) is barely consequential compared to m^(2)c^(4), which is why it's usually shortened to E = mc^(2), correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you break down the difference to me between the mechanical formula vs the relative formula? Iâ€™m not understanding how those equations are the same but yet different. How does the original equation get broken down to the most famous equation ever?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had resigned myself to thinking &quot;people smarter than you understand it, but you don't need to worry about it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why is the EM Drive getting so much flak where the scientists are saying it violates the conservation of momentum? </p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation is being output from the drive and has momentum. Why doesn't this solve it? What am I missing?</p></div>		</li>
