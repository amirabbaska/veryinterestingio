			<div class="markdown"><p>After the 11-day experiment, it was stated Gardner slept first for 14 hours, then a normal 8 hours after that. Other than a period around the 7-day mark where he apparently had difficulty counting backward, he never showed any particular strong symptoms to the lack of sleep.</p>
<p>It was an interesting experiment, because it showed that sleep is something that isn't universal, different people can handle sleep deprivation better than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in my days of taking Adderall, I would stay up all night for days, sometimes sleep less than 12 hour for a week. I'd say up drinking, cleaning, and doing menial tasks. I'd shower and go to work or school the next day and would feel relatively fine because of Adderall, but after about 3-4 days, everything would start to seem wierd and fuzzy like I was in a dream of some kind. I'd start making very bad decisions and do stupid shit until I would finally be able to medicate myself to sleep... then usually I would crash for 16 hours, end up missing school and/or work.</p>
<p>Fuck not sleeping. I would always seem coherent, but the choices you .ale when sleep deprived are short sighted and not well thought out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sometimes I get this too. My friends and I call it &quot;sleep drunk&quot;, because it actually feels like being drunk but not as much fun. It's like being drunk because I get upset or emotional easily, and will throw small (but i'm told very adorable) tantrums over the dumbest shit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You were either taking too many, taking more than one without sleeping, or on a significantly higher dose than what's appropriate for you. </p>
<p>I take Adderall every day, work full time, and maintain a normal sleep schedule without any trouble. If you truly need Adderall to function normally, you should try a lower dose (and not abuse it, if you were before). </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You could also do yourself a favour by ignoring society’s views on sleep, he says. “There’s this social view that short sleeping is a good thing and should be encouraged – we’re always hauling out the example of Margaret Thatcher and top CEOs who don’t need much sleep. In fact, the amount of sleep you need is genetically determined as much as your height or shoe size. Some people need very little sleep, others need 11 or 12 hours to feel their best.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL that Thatcher was not disciplined, she was in fact a more evolved version of homo sapiens. Margo Sapiens. Genetically built to thrive on very little sleep, she gets twice as much done in a day as the poor saps doomed by their genes to laze in bed smoking pot. </p>
<p>All hail the first of our new overlords, we didn't realize it because we were sleeping.</p>
<p>But now we know! Especially good to know that sleep, like being fat and also lazy are genetically inherited so we can do nothing about it and star athleticism seems to be granted by some sky spirit they are all thanking all the time. </p>
<p>Me I sleep very little but I feel like shit all the time. </p>
<p>I am hyper productive. But I don't waste time on entropic things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wish this was more widely known. I average 5h of sleep a night and I feel great, but I have to defend myself against everyone trying to say I will kill myself from sleep deprivation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not even you &quot;handling sleep deprivation better,&quot; it's literally you <em>needing</em> less sleep. I doubt you're actually very deprived, if at all. Can you/have you even slept for 9+ hour stretches before?</p>
<p>As someone who requires 9 hours of sleep to not feel like a zombie, I'm jealous. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was working in Security at the Square D factory in Toronto in 1973.  I started on a Friday morning at 8am, agreed to OT that night, then it began..</p>
<p>No one was available to relieve me so I kept getting told I 'had to' stay on duty.   80 hours non stop work, plus 3 hours travel without sleep.  I was 18 years old.  That's only 4 days and I felt so beat up mentally that I thought I was going crazy.</p>
<p>Finished after my regular shift on Monday at 4:30.   As we had punch clocks, I was on my feet walking around most of the time during that 80 hours.   </p>
<p>Hit the bed when I got home, slept until 11 am Tuesday, went into the office and quit. </p>
<p>That is the longest I have stayed awake without stimulants other than coffee.   By Saturday night, even coffee didn't do much.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got paid but by the time the taxman finished with me it wasn't much.   I was heading back to university, so when tax refund time came, that is when I saw a nice payout..</p>
<p>But, base wage was only $3.50/hr then.  OT was all 1.5 (no DT).  In perspective, an entire semester, books, courses, meals and accommodation only cost me about $2k, so this entire 80 hours got me about $250 take home.  </p>
<p>If you compare that to $20k (not sure about that amount, just for comparison) for a semester now, it was like taking home about $2500, or just over 10% of the semester. </p></div>		</li>
