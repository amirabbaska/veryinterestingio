			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do some stuff without water:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breath through a straw/device while watching tv/reading.</li>
<li>Get used to holding your breath by timing it. </li>
</ul>
<p>But for depth training you need to be in that environment to really get your body to adapt to its stresses.
It can be painful/deadly if not done right.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are clam/oyster farmers that go down multiple times for ~4 min of depth over 20 meters.</p>
<p>Earth spawn are crazy mofos.</p></div>		</li>
