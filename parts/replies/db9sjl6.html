			<div class="markdown"><p>he is wrong though. as a tends towards infinity, e^ia just keeps spinning around the unit circle in the complex plane. there is no mathematical justification to say that integral is 0. in short, don't trust a physicist to do mathematics </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, e^-ix with x towards inf is undefined. But that can't be possible in physical circumstances, and actually it tends to 0 as the charge density gradually decreases</p></div>		</li>
