			<div class="markdown"><p>To a certain degree, yes.  More importantly is airflow though.</p>
<p>But hail requires a large temperature differential -- hot at the surface to create the quickly-rising hot air, and very cold up high where that air ends up.   The bigger the differential, the easier it is to get moisture up there and freeze faster.</p>
<p>Get too far into the summer with too many days of sustained heat, then the differential isn't there (and not usually the moisture you need either).</p>
<p>But those days in late-Spring where it spikes to 90-degrees while it's been 70 for weeks.   Throw a thunderstorm into the mix and you've got the recipe for hail.   </p>
<p>To get the really big hail you also need some colliding fronts.   You need a lot of airflow to hold the hail up for as long as it takes to build up all that ice.  Hail is bigger because it's been held up longer with more and more layers of water building up ice, and it'll stay up there until it moves into an area where there's not enough upward flow to hold it anymore.   This is why storms usually dump hail in a very localized area.  Once the upward flow stops, the hail falls suddenly like opening the gate on a big dump chute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you need the combination of high-humidity, high surface temperatures and massive, colder air masses moving over the top.</p>
<p>I live in North Texas where this happens every Spring/early Summer.  We have the hot, moist air coming up from the Gulf of Mexico that gets further heated by the Sun on its way North throughout the day.  It hits a colder, low-pressure system coming down from the North.</p>
<p>The hot, moist air wants to rise above the more dense cold air, and in doing so it cools off and can no longer contain the amount of moisture it once held.  This movement results in lateral swirling of large amounts of air which can sometimes support hailstones as large as softballs.  </p>
<p>Sometimes this lateral swirling turns sideways and the updraft of warm air from the surface becomes a direct transfer of heat/moisture in the form of a tornado.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, maximum hail size goes up rapidly with temperature.  The energy  doesn't come from the temperature, but from the water vapor, but this also increases rapidly with temperature.</p>
<p>If it were actually hot enough to generate high velocities just from the convection, the heat would dissipate rapidly everywhere.  What happens is that humidity releases energy only when the air is cooled by being lifted, so it can concentrate the released energy in one supercell thunderstorm, and generate high updraft speeds.</p></div>		</li>
