			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. It does, it makes sense to manage the PH in the reactor but I wasn't sure why it had to be lithium.  Since lithium is a small element I was thinking this was due it had the smallest cross section for a PH regulator so it wouldn't interact with nuclear material like lead would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it doesn't really have to be lithium it just depends on the chemistry you are trying to maintain throughout the plant. It's not so much for the reactor core and more for all of the valves and piping throughout the coolant loops. Minimizing corrosion is more to prevent fouling of heat transfer surfaces and degradation of components within the piping and coolant channels. By cross section were you referring to like target nucleus cross section? That is not so important because the effects the coolant has such a large effect on neutron moderation that the chemicals added have negligible difference based on cross section. Lemme know if that answered your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes thank you much that is exactly what was wondering about lithium within the coolant. The neutron moderation your talking about is that to prevent titrium from forming as neutrons bombard the coolant? </p></div>		</li>
