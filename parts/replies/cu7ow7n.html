			<p>Ray Kurzweil pretty much pioneered the field of Heirchical Hidden Markov Chains, which assisted to his development of Natural Language Processing.  He, along with others, created the &quot;Dragon: Naturally Speaking&quot; dictation softwar, this as well as support from Kurzweil Industries helped with the language processing of Siri and others.  <br><br>It was all in his book &quot;How to create a Mind&quot; which was a bit droll in some parts but mostly a good read. You can get it free on audible with the trial, great for listening to if your daily journey is longer than 30 minutes.  <br><br>This book was so mind expanding for me that I changed career paths and enrolled into Computer Science at University to study Artificial Intelligence. </p>		</li>

			<p>As someone who is soon to change career paths and enroll in Computer Science at University to study Artificial Intelligence (I'm finishing a Master's in Psychology in the upcoming year and intend to begin an undergrad in CS in 2016), may I ask what career path you switched from, what point you are at now, and how old you are? I'm very interested in how others who didn't start out with CS have found getting into the field.</p>		</li>

			<p>I have worked in the relatively esoteric field of Quarantine for the past 7 years. I got into it through luck and skill, came out with a lot of qualifications that aren't really relevant to many other fields but have given me a unique perspective and a lot of encouragement to do something more with my intellect from my peers.  <br><br>I have only just started Tertiary study for the first time in my life at the age of 28, and work full time and study part time.  <br><br>I feel that if I had gone to university  at a younger age, my mind would have wandered from major to major. However having had plenty of time in the professional worlds of both Government, high and low profile business and everywhere in between.  <br><br>I came to the somewhat first world realization that you have to pursue what you can, if it's in your reach then reach for it. I don't want to be an astronaut or the President, but I have always, always had a flair for two specific things; creativity and approaching solutions to problems creatively.  <br><br>I have read as much literature as I can get my hands on and continue to learn and amalgamate the information into a cohesive thesis of Intelligence-- I already have several ideas how to start work in the field. <br><br>I bought a raspberry Pi, started building my own laptop and writing my own code, learning python and LISP and strangely enough, ALGOL- a very old High Level language from the 60s. Which has some interesting properties in Recursion.  <br><br>If you are interested in getting motivated- <br><br>GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid- Douglas Hofstadter.  <br><br>How to Create a mind- Ray Kurzweil.  <br><br>Predictably Irrational- Dan Ariely.  <br><br>On Intelligence - Jim Hawkins<br><br><a href="http://www.intelligenceexplosion.com" target="_blank">http://www.intelligenceexplosion.com</a>  <br><br>Less Wrong wiki- specifically Eliezer Yudkowsky.  <br><br>The Machine Intelligence Research Institute.  <br><br>Principia Mathematica- Alfred North Whitehead.  <br><br>These are some very heavy texts. And they tackle some huge problems in AI, how does consciousness and self awareness occur? If at all?  <br><br>Perhaps the most distinct piece of motivation I had was the Neil Blomkamp film 'Chappie'. It changed my mind from the understanding of AI as a robotic entity to an epistemology of consciousness.  <br><br>Sorry for rant. I have alway been nerdy but this is the next paradigm shift- it will happen in our lifetimes. </p>		</li>

			<p>Thank you for a fascinating response! What a mix of very familiar and unfamiliar points!<br><br>I first came across the work of Eliezer Yudkowsky about 6 years ago (through HPMOR, what else?) in my final year of high school, and I would credit him with introducing me to modern ideas about AI, the singularity, existential threats, and much, much more. As a matter of fact, I was just referencing some of his thoughts on reductionism in my prospectus earlier today.<br><br>But one of the most important thoughts I picked up from EY early on was that if you have the ability to do so, you pretty much owe it to yourself to tackle problems that are interesting, and important, and worth your time. Six years ago this led me to interesting questions like How do we think? How can we learn or be made to think better? which in turn led me to cognitive psychology. Even that recently, &quot;researching AI&quot; looked about as viable a career option as &quot;astronaut&quot; to me. Only in the last 2 or 3 years have I really noticed the bubble AI is enjoying- and I want in. Suddenly, How can a computer think? has joined the ranks of questions that are worth my time as well as being interesting and important.<br><br>I'd say I have a fairly solid footing in 'outsider' topics that I'd be willing to bet will continue contributing to AGI- psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy (mostly logic, but some epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and phil of mind). And much like you, I've had a reputation for creative and resourceful problem solving for a while now. So as of now, the only thing holding me back is my utter lack of programming experience, and rudimentary knowledge of computer science! So, back to square one it is!<br><br>And by the way, I quite agree that paradigm-shifting (paradigm-obliterating) progress is likely to be made in our lifetimes. That's part of what makes it worth it! Good luck with your work and thank you for all the recommendations.</p>		</li>
