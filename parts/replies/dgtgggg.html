<p>Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) may also be the problem. This is a problem with some teens and young adults, but it can persist in later life. This makes it harder to fall asleep, and acutally pushes the time it takes to fall asleep back by 2 hours. This can be problematic as your brain can start to wander.</p>

<p>I found out I have this.  According to a couple papers I found, taking melatonin 4-5 hours before bed can help.  It's not a sure-fire fix, but it helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only found out about it recently too but Melatonin has been a gamechanger for me the last 6 months. I never used to be able to fall asleep before at least 2am and was unable to wake up without using multiple alarm clocks before 12pm. Now I'm falling asleep by around 11:30pm and waking up before my 8am alarm goes off and generally feeling a lot more alert throughout the day.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hope it wears off soon, I can't imagine what it would be like to struggle going to sleep. Happens to me once a month or so, but to have it on a daily basis would be horrible. </p>
<p>I really wish you all the best, and hope you find ways of coping with it because sleep deprivation can have devistating effects. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it isn't a struggle to sleep, it is just extremely hard to wake up before a certain time. If I sleep at 8pm, I still need an alarm clock to get up at 7am. However when I sleep later on the weekends, I usually don't sleep that long. But if I fall asleep earlier, I will sleep much longer. My natural wake up time seems to be around 10-11am.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm 32, it's not going to wear off.  </p>
<p>Sucks, and yes probably 50-75% of days I end up with less than 5 hours of sleep at night, but I can usually make up some of that with an hour nap.  Working at 5:30am doesn't help matters.</p></div>		</li>
