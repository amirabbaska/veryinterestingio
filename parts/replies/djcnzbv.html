<p>I've grown my hair out a lot in the past, and seen the colour change a lot differing by the season. 10 years ago, I had light brown hair that was poofy. Then, around 12-16 years old it got very dark brown, and super straight. Then it started getting reddish-brown and wavy right before I cut it all off (grew it out for 3 years) and now it's growing out again, coming out wavy again. My beard has a lot of red in it, but then at the edges of my moustache and soul patch it's blonde, and then filled in with brown other areas. My brother and all my cousins also have a ton of red in their facial hair, and my dad is super blonde, while my mom has black hair.</p></div>		</li>
