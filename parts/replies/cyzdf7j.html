<p>Which explains some of the how-we-got-there for oxygen levels. (And why there's iron-ore in northern Minnesota.) </p></div>		</li>

<p>The oxygen they produced would have quickly been removed from the atmosphere by the weathering of reduced minerals, most notably iron. </p>

<p>It surprises me that things rusting can have such a huge impact on earth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before plants were widespread or even existed at all there wouldn't have been soil covering the bedrock, so the amount of surface area with iron ore in would have been vastly higher than today, which would have had a much bigger impact on oxygen levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two major factors at play for why this happens:</p>
<p>First, oxygen is higher concentration. Oxygen is required for fire. Kinetics (loosely) says when a required component of a reaction is in greater concentration, the reaction goes faster.</p>
<p>Second, other things that don't burn, like nitrogen, comprise a smaller fraction of air. Thermodynamics tells us that when you use the same amount of heat to warm less material, the temperature change will be greater.</p>
<p>Fire is complicated and has a lot of feedback. The hotter it is, the faster reactions go, the hotter it gets. But these factors make it so that enriched oxygen makes a big difference.</p></div>		</li>
