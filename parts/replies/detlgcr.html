			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that you are doing anything wrong or am I in any way justifying what they are doing, but they are kind of right in that you are a threat to their economic livelihood. The reality of the matter is that people are racist, and this is how the cycle goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a few venturing white people move into the &quot;shitty&quot; neighborhood. usually poor and just like the locals, struggle to get by</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other people see the white people that are living there now, and eventually decide to also move there, as since there are white people there, it can't be as dangerous or as bad as it seems, right? also, it's way cheaper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more and more white people move there, housing prices and taxes go up, stores like starbucks and other generic chain stores open up and kick out local businesses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>housing prices rise to the point that all of the original hispanic locals can no longer afford to live there and are forced out, and even the first original white people who moved there are forced out as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>now since the damned locals are gone and the neighborhood is now &quot;safe&quot; again (and also trendy), rich white businessmen buy out the houses to tear them down and rebuild into vacation homes or shit like that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other rich white buy these vacation homes.</p>
</li>
<li>community is destroyed.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get it. We purchased in a place that's near to the city center, that's known for its density and brick bungalows, so it's only a matter of time. If this was inside Chicago city limits, it would be completely populated by Chicago firefighters and police officers.</p>
<p>The density is one thing keeping full-on gentrification from torching this village (it has a higher pop. density than Chicago proper), along with extremely strict code enforcement that doesn't allow additions to existing homes, so it's not particularly attractive to the upscale crowd, at least right now. </p>
<p>The reality for my village is, there are a ton of straight up abandoned properties that are bank-owned from the recession, probably a hundred or more right now. Ours was one of these, completely overhauled; it sat empty for 8 years. The village actually has billboards in Chicago advertising for people to move here. So as much as it may bother the families that have been here for a few generations that I showed up on their block, they're way better off having me around paying property taxes to fund their kids' schools, because they're not buying. I genuinely wish they were. </p>
<p>So here I am justifying being a gentrifier, I guess. But I didn't force anyone out, and I didn't pay a price for my house that will do anything to jack up property values to unattainable levels, either. If you picked my house up and plopped it down 2 miles north of here, it would have cost us double, plus about a 50% bump in taxes. We paid less than half of what this property sold for as recently as 2004, and those folks lost the house to foreclosure.</p>
<p>If you have people moving into an area on a long enough timeline, it lifts the community by providing a broader tax base. The problems start when 20-somethings with money and no kids show up and vote against mill levy increases for schools, etc, that things go south in a hurry. We're 40, no kids, so we're not exactly on the leading edge of some migration that will displace a ton of people. My village is begging people like us to move here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fwiw, paying 2x the price makes you part of the problem. </p>
<p>Not that I'm blaming you. I'm also part of the problem. We paid 2x for our house compared to what it was worth 10 years ago. Property values in this part of town are skyrocketing because people like me and you are willing to pay them. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, do you and I have a choice, given what rents are like? It's stupid not to buy if you can get a mortgage , even at today's prices.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bullshit the people who move into the area benefit. The people who open new shops benefit. The shops that do adapt benefit.High income people don't make it unfordable. Taxes do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have good points. I tend to focus on the neighborhoods being impacted and forget about the people outside of the neighborhoods. Thanks for the reminder.</p>
<p>What I meant was that considering the people that lived in the area prior to gentrification, only the people who owned their property benefited from seeing their neighborhood gentrify around them.</p>
<p>Though it isn't just taxes that make neighborhoods unaffordable. Assuming a person could pay the higher taxes for their property, the cost of living will also rise. Costs of transportation, food, entertainment, and utilities all go up. If they need services - babysitter, tutor, job training - those prices increase as well. Everything becomes more expensive.</p>
<p>If individuals in the neighborhood don't have skills that can transfer to the new businesses then staying becomes unaffordable, or they see a decrease in their disposable incomes. Taxes are a major unavoidable issue, but there are others. Local economies can be pretty dialectic. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Again do grocery stores go out of business through out the entire city?</p>
<p>Gentrification is a good thing. You have areas that becoming nicer overall. Bringing in more tax revenue, having more profitable business. The people who live there are in a good situation because property values skyrocket. Its happening here in buffalo you can sell your house for 4 times what you bought it for. That is great, not terrible. Do you want terrible areas to stay terrible for ever? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know why you're haphazardly labeling Asians like that. </p>
<p>A very large group of Asian Americans immigrated into these poor neighborhoods, and were already established prior to gentrification. In fact, many of these Asian immigrants came from impoverished countries living in conditions worse than American ghettos.</p>
<p>The Asians you talk about just happen to also be very industrious, and place a heavy emphasis on education. They are able to gain wealth and STAY in these communities post gentrification. Thats different than the whites that move into the communities.</p>
<p>So to just say Asian people are coming in and moving all the blacks and Hispanics is careless, ignorant, and plain wrong.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, the problem is really about wealth Inequality. To make it a race problem is a poor substitute, and the discussion of why certain races tend to be poorer should be discussed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Edit: Went from 10+ upvotes to zero. Shows how ignorant people are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure why you think I was labeling asians as anything. Can you clarify what sentence makes you think that? I might have phrased it poorly.</p>
<p>Whites and Asians are more likely to be in middle and upper class neighborhoods than Blacks or Hispanics. That is a statistical fact straight from the U.S. Census. It isn't a label, it is a measured pattern.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-median-income-in-the-us-by-race-2013-9" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-median-income-in-the-us-by-race-2013-9</a>
(this article has a US Census chart)</p>
<p>The OP asked 3 questions, one of which is why gentrification is bad. Most of my post was about the economic disparity, but part of the debate around gentrification is that it is a racially discriminating institution - and this is one of the major reasons it is seen as a bad thing.</p>
<p>Though any racial trend will have exceptions (such as those you mentioned), the fact that it is a trend means that it is more likely to be one way than another. According to statistics, Whites and Asians are more likely to move in and benefit during gentrification (because of their middle/upper class status), while Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to move out with no benefits (because of their lower class status).</p></div>		</li>

<p>white/asians forcing blacks/hispanics out of their houses.</p>
<p>a neighborhood typically goes from black/hispanic to asian/white.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The immigrant Asian community is as much part of these pre-gentrified landscapes as Latino and Black communities. The multiple Chinatowns, Japantowns, Koreatowns, Little Manilas, Little Saigons, etc are NOT part of gentrification. They were there from the start. They are, and always have been, part of the culture and diversity that people are afraid of losing due to gentrification.</p>
<p>The fact that Asians are now mostly middle or upper class does not take away from the fact that immigrant Asians were already established in these communities.</p>
<p>Also gentrification doesn't discriminate by race. It discriminates by income. Poor white people are just as much victims.</p></div>		</li>
