<p>A lethal dose of radiation deposits the same amount of energy into your body as drinking 3mL of coffee. So the stuff is still dangerous for anyone reading!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This feels like apples to oranges. I mean, don't eat plutonium, obviously, and certainly don't inhale aerosolized particles of it. But plutonium on the <em>outside</em> of your body is not very dangerous, as long as it stays out there, as I am sure you are aware. I don't know what coffee has to do with this, or how that clarifies anyone's understanding of radioactivity (I am wary of apples-to-oranges energy comparisons in general — the Sun deposits the equivalent of 7 million Hiroshima bomb detonations per minute on the surface of the Earth, but that doesn't tell you much). My point was just that plutonium doesn't have to be wildly radioactive for it to create issues over the long term with regards to weapons component functionality. This is different from the health effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Pu-239 is an alpha emitter so your skin protects you.</p>
<p>My point was, is that energy equivalent to the thermal energy deposited in your body equivalent to a sip of coffee from the right type of radiation can be lethal. So if a lump of radioactive material is warm to the touch, it certainly has the potential to be super-lethal depending on the isotope present!</p>
<p>5 Gray total body dose from betas is probably lethal. That's 5 joules per kg, or 350 joules for a 70kg person. That's just over 80 calories (or 0.08 nutritional calories), so not much at all!</p></div>		</li>
