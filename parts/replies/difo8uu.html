			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  The eating poppy seed muffin story doesn't work. Testing for opioids tests is for drugs. You would have to eat a hell of a lot of muffins to test positive.

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the TSA website:</p>
<p>TSA security officers do not search for marijuana or other drugs. In the event a substance that appears to be marijuana is observed during security screening, TSA will refer the matter to a law enforcement officer.</p>
<p>Whether or not marijuana is considered legal under local law is not relevant to TSA screening because TSA is governed by federal law. Federal law provides no basis to treat medical marijuana any differently than non-medical marijuana.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They probably don't bother testing for cannabis in legal states since there would be an enormous amount of resources required to check every single person that came up positive, especially since the majority wouldn't currently be carrying anything.</p></div>		</li>
