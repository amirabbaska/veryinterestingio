			<div class="markdown"><p>Much easier and logical would be to just number the days starting fom day 0, at the winter solstice. (And maybe write that down in base 7, if we're keeping weeks)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't it 365.24 days per year? There would be 1 day left behind every year.  </p>
<p>Also, in calendars, programming etc. how would you write the monthless day? 0/1/year? 0/0/Year? Wouldn't that technically still be a month with only 1 day? Why not just add it to another month then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Programmatically, time is already such a huge fucking cluster fuck that an extra monthless day wouldn't be any bigger an issue than we've already solved. Call it the 29th day of the 13th month if you want, it doesn't really matter, there's be some solution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright. Then another problem is the month-count. 12 months are evenly divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6, being easily divided over a year. 13 however, is a prime number, not divisible by anything. Which means if you wanna partition the year evenly (for workflow, seasons, etc.) you simply can't, and must use weeks or days instead (which doesn't even have a consistent amount anyways).  </p>
<p>Look, I'm not hating on the idea, I'm just questioning what actual pros it has over our current system. I can find plenty of problems and the only pro is having the same amount of days in a month (28), which isn't even the case if the extra day brings one month to 29, or even 30 every 4th year...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could. Either way its still better than the current month scheme that took my wife and i 10 Minutes to figure out which months have what. </p></div>		</li>
