			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it be quite difficult to find out where the money came from? I mean if you are at a grocery store and pay in cash (which many people still do), how will they know which person gave the counterfeit money? And whether the person even knew the money was counterfeited in the first place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the key is to be smart about it. If you slip in one or two fake bills somewhere, you can easily act surprised and sketched out if someone does catch you. I remember a bill my grandma had was supposedly fake and she didn't know it was. She just gave the cashier another one and kept the fake one, the store didn't even care. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am glad you replied to a comment so I wouldn't have to say this as a top comment and get deleted. The ONLY reason I am replying is because you are making several comments that lead one to believe this might not simply a hypothetical. (I am sure it is, but I am saying this anyway)</p>
<p>Stop this line of thinking right now. Everything you are thinking right now that would be a good idea or a safe bet... most certainly isn't.  There are tools, systems and people in place to catch you.</p>
<p>Do you really think you are the first person to think of this?  Aside from it not being unique or profitable and being incredibly risky (20 years in prison thank you) this is one of the most often cracked cases, small bill counterfeiting.  Why? Because the perp thinks he's smart, but he is really just a fool.</p>
<p>About 5 years ago a man was caught distributing 5.00 counterfeit bills in my town (which is why I know about it).  My neighbor is a cop and he relayed the story given to him.  Smart guy thinks low denomination bills will not get caught right.. so he thinks he's going to go to various gas stations and convenience stores and buy gum (sound familiar) ok, so any way, he gets away with it for a total of, wait for it, four days.  You see, what our smart bro did was go to 3 gas stations of the same parent company, and in two of those stations the person getting the money ready for the bank each night noticed the bill. (it's harder than you think to make a fake bill feel like a real bill) </p>
<p>Cops were called, SS was called and a notice went to all stations in the state and surrounding 5 states.  Sure enough everyone checked really carefully and a few stations found more.  It also just so happened that the parent company also owned several convenience stores and, again, you guessed it, the notices went out and they found a few.  Based upon the pattern and the video evidence at 4 of the 10 or so locations they figured out who was doing it, circulated the picture and he was caught on day 4 of his criminal masterpiece.</p>
<p>His total Haul... 187 dollars. </p>

<p>I work at a casino and there were some guys creating very good fake $1 chips. Since creating those chips are usually way more expensive than the chips denomination we would just register them and use them ourselves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the 20 is the most counterfeited bill.</p>

<p>Funny story...I went to the ATM the other day and took out $60 in cash.  I got two of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_$20_Series_2006_Obverse.jpg" target="_blank">current style $20 bills</a>, and one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US-Series-1995-$20-Obverse.jpg" target="_blank">previous style $20 bills</a>.  When I went to Tim Horton's for a coffee later that morning the kid behind the counter refused to accept the older bill, claiming it was &quot;obviously counterfeit&quot;.  Knowing that he was probably younger than the $20 bill in question, I asked him to get his manager, who also refused to accept the bill claiming it was counterfeit because it didn't have the security thread/strip in it (which didn't exist at the time these bills were printed).  I was flabbergasted.</p></div>		</li>

Lots of editing software and printers will actively prevent you manipulating or printing an image of a banknote at home. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EURion_constellation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EURion_constellation</a><br />
The organisations that print high quality bills don't take them to Walmart, they sell them at a bulk discount to smaller gangs, each gang puts a little markup on it to the point where some street level guy approaches you in a bar and offers you a bunch of 50's for 35 a piece. If you follow the money far enough you end up with rogue government operations and multinational organised gangs, there's just not enough margin in small bills for everyone to make a cut and manage the logistics of shipping massive containers of small bills around the world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdollar" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdollar</a><br />
Some of the best counterfeits now use half of a genuine note in each fake, thus increasing the cost of production even more.

<p>In my experience, the best looking counterfeits are easily caught by the simplest of authentication devices, and the notes that beat a machine usually look obviously fake to the human eye.</p></div>		</li>
