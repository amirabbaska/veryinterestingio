			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about when you hear something that seems totally foreign to everything you've listened to before but that instantly clicks with you? Or when you suddenly find yourself shifting to anew genre you had never been interested in before? Is it really that there are elements you are already familiar with but that you're just not recognizing them as such? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious about that as well. For many years (15+) I listened almost exclusively to industrial music. Before that, I'd listened to thrash metal (pre-'Black' album era Metallica). Then I heard Plague Bringer, and suddenly found myself drawn to death and black metal. It was a very sudden transition, occurring over just a few weeks. That was maybe three years ago,  and I've barely listened to anything considered industrial since then. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who doesn't listen to a lot of metal, what you've described is that you like lots of music a non metal head would likely consider pretty similar in the grand scheme of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but different genres in rock and pop is not really the same as listening to, say, jazz v classical v pop/rock.</p>
<p>Especially with something like metal which just has lots of silly, vague partitions &quot;Death metal, black metal, green ham metal, flange whipped rock, satanic double step heavy gauge sprung metal&quot; and so on. These are just designed for partisan reasons rather than because there's any real or significant differences to the music.</p>
<p>Rock and pop is pretty much all sharing the same underlying chord progressions and so on. So it's not that difficult to find something that clicks.</p>
<p>It's when you first listen to things like, e.g, Captain Beefheart's <em>Trout Mask Replica</em> or some of Zappa's stuff that it often sounds very dissonant, possibly many think it's just noise.</p>
<p>If you listen to it enough though you tend to find it becomes musical and sounds just as musical as anything else you enjoy - perhaps richer though because of the greater complexity in the compositions (as in classical music too)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. So if I continue to go to cosmic bowling I'll eventually enjoy shitty music?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, remember it is about getting used to the sounds and rhythms in the music, and not the music itself. Listening to the same bad song endlessly won't make you like the song. You just grow accustomed to the pitches, instruments, melodies, etc contained in the song. </p></div>		</li>
