			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with this answer is that sometimes people will shake even when not at max capacity.</p>
<p>It likely has to do with the ability of the 'wave' of muscle engagement. If the muscle is 'out of practice' in contracting (ie you never work your abs), then putting them in a loaded position (such as a plank) may cause shaking. You may still be able to hold the plank for awhile, but the neurological system isn't completely efficient at engaging the muscle. It's likely recruiting too many motor units based on the difficulty of the task, causing shaking.</p>
<p>Then as a muscle gets to its max capacity it happens as you say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actin filaments are typically 7nm long and contract using an ATP synthase mechanism, ATP is a high energy molecule crucial to organic life, this is important to know, typically tremblin occurs when fatigue starts, this is in part due to 2 reasons; when you flex a muscle not ever sarcomere unit will contract at the same time, if it did your movement would be very jerky and not to mention very inefficient also your body not being able to supply the sarcomere units that contain the myosin and actin with ATP needed for contraction
TLDR: fatigue did it...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's other causes for this.  Including ones not local to the legs (central nervous system).  E.g. essential/intention tremor, which are caused by minor disorders of the cerebellum.  Your mention of the &quot;aren't used to the motion&quot; makes me think of these.</p>
<p>edit to note: most sources discussing essential tremor will refer to arm tremor, but note that no one really tests for leg tremor because it's not likely to be disabling, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI man you might have an essential tremor but never had it formally diagnosed.  It's pretty common, there is no real treatment, and it's one of those things you can safely ignore until you can't (i.e. it becomes disabling; they usually slowly progress as you get older; going to doc will do absolute nothing for you until then) at which point the put on you medication which can be worse than the tremor itself.  I had a similar story to you but at some point in my 40's it hit the point of medication; will probably end up with electrodes in my brain by 60 lol.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OMG, thank you. This explains so much. I've recently started taking aerial silks classes and found myself shaking (can't remember where, legs I think) when I was attempting the first part of an inverted trick. My instructor noticed and I said, &quot;Yes because I'm <em>TRYING</em>.&quot; And I was. But it was absolutely a new thing I was trying to teach my body to do and so now I can say the trembling is my body learning how to engage those muscles in those ways. And it seems to have figured it out because I haven't experienced that same shaking in subsequent attempts. Also, that first attempt was at the end of a very rigorous hour, so I figured I was just out of gas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Max capacity of what your brain will allow.  Always remember that.</p>
<p>This is why you've heard of stories of people having surreal bouts of strength when saving someone or themselves.  Your mind switches into a 'screw the damage!  Release the limiters!'</p>
<p>If you want a neat example- try putting electro-stim pads on a bicep or forearm... the electric signal will override the one the brain is sending.  Muscles will bulge, and your hand will clench so tight you won't be able to open it.</p>
<p>This is also why a taser is so effective at stopping someone, but at the same time, EXTREMELY dangerous since all those delicate neural signals are being ignored and not even your reactory subconsciousness can protect you from a fall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, your golgi tendon organ is part of the muscle that will monitor force and reflexively 'shut down' the muscle before it overworks and damages. This is the point of fatigue we feel when lifting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was young and stupid when I decided to try and repair a stereo amplifier, I needed it to be turned on so I could determine what wasn't getting power, but I wasn't wearing any protection on my hands. I accidentally touched something that sent a lot of power through my forearm, causing it to clench my fist harder than I could do on my own. My forearm hurt for a full day after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they cannot. lengthy explanation begins now:
There are 4 structures within your sarcomeres</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Myosin (Binds to Actin causing the contraction)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actin (filament that is protected by tropomyosin)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tropomyosin (A filament that aligns itself along Actin to prevent Myosin from binding to it)</p>
</li>
<li>Troponin (The lock that keeps tropomyosin in place)</li>
</ol>
<p>In order for Myosin to bind to Actin to cause a contraction tropomyosin needs to be removed and they way that happens is through excitation contraction coupling and Cross bridge cycling
ECC:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An action potential is sent from the brain down to your muscles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the action potential is received Acetyl Choline (Ach) is released into the Sarcolemma triggering the release of Calcium from your Sarcoplasmic Reticulum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calcium floats down your T-tubules and attaches to Troponin which lifts Tropomyosin off of the actin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This allows for Myosin to bind to Actin to cause contraction</p>
</li>
<li>Leftover Calcium is reabsorbed into the SR</li>
</ol>
<p>Cross Bridge Cycling (More more in depth all of this is in the presence of calcium bound to Troponin lifting Tropomyosin off of Actin)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Binding: Myosin binds to Actin / ADP+Pi is attached to myosin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power stroke: Myosin pulls Actin causing contraction / ADP+Pi is  released from Myosin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dissociation: ATP comes and binds to Myosin which causes Myosin to pop off Actin</p>
</li>
<li>Activation: ATPase breaks down ATP into ADP+Pi and causes myosin to return back to its original position.</li>
</ol>
<p>The whole cycle will start again as long as Calcium is present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In other words, muscle relaxation is actually active, in the sense that its default state is to be contracted and it takes 'work' to take the muscle out of the contraction.</p>
<p>To answer to original question, the muscle 'cycles' through contraction in different parts of the muscle, that's correct. A suatained contraction would be inefficent and at some point damaging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a heads up you are partially incorrect.</p>
<p>Rigamortis is the perfect example of muscles being locked in a contracted state due to membrane potentials being locked.</p>
<p>This state can be seen in many muscular centric illnesses for short and long bouts of time.</p>
<p>See muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, and convulsions to name a few.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be wrong but i think in complete tetnis (max contraction) the signals fire to your fibers at such a high speed they dont have time to relax so they stay contracted. </p>
<p>So it's kind of possible for muscles to stay contracted but it's not ideal or practical. Sounds to me like a painful muscle spasm.</p></div>		</li>
