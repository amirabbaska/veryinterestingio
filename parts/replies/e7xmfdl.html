			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of time and effort. I work in TV/FM broadcast and while it's not GHz range stuff, things like 0.05&quot; height of a coupling structure can make a world of difference in terms of performance. Though even if something doesn't exactly match the design, there are different tuning tricks you can use to overcome the issue. Things like delay lines in manifolds and stuff are a bit trickier, there's less margin for error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easiest way for small circuits is to put a moveable shunt (called a delay line)
somewhere and then just dial the shunt back and forth until everything is in sync. Don't know if that's what's used for high power systems though.</p>
<p>Edit: also if you're trying to phase match two different generators you simply run one of them at a slightly lower frequency as the other until you're in phase, then speed it up again. Playing around with delay lines is only needed if you're combining two signals from the same source or from sources with a fixed frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if the problem is that the two signals are out of phase... then one of the leads is longer. You shorten it until your signals are in phase. They just need to arrive at the same time so they most likely will not actually end up physically same length but electronically. edit: shorten can be done with other means, like others have noted, it does not need to be physically same but afaik, it really, really helps if they are already close before employing other tactics....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, the rigid coax shown in the picture is not waveguide. The highest frequency used for TV broadcast in the US is around 700 MHz. Some station do use waveguide, but it is rectangular. </p>
<p>There are expansion joints so distance isn't quite as critical as 1/10 mm. The thermal expansion of copper is much greater than that. Phase is only an issue if you are combining two transmitters which are running in parallel, and there is a knob to adjust the phase. The biggest problems I've run into with the rigid coax are the insulators arcing over, the dehydrator breaking, the hangers breaking, couplers (called bullets) overheating and real bullets being fired at the tower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh, I used to work for a company that made solid state radio transmitters. I worked in the machine shop. A bunch of times I had to make up some of that copper coax stuff for sending extra power, from lightening strikes and such to dummy loads.</p>
<p>I grew up with a father who is a plumber, and now I'm a plumber too.. just never got a break from working with copper pipe.</p></div>		</li>
