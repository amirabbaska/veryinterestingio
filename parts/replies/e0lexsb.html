			<div class="markdown"><p>Your scenario intrigues me. Mind checking my analysis?</p>
<p>In that scenario, player 1 has a 10% chance to win.</p>
<p>Player 2 has a 90% chance of getting to play, and a 10% chance to win, so his probability of winning is 9%.</p>
<p>Player 3 has an 81% chance of getting to play ( 1 - 1/10 - 0.9/10), and a 10% chance to win, so his probability of winning is 8.1%.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: the finite chance being 0.9^10 (i.e. 3.48%)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For independent and identical trials with a probability p of success on a given trial (this is called a Bernoulli distribution), the probability of success on the nth trial is equal to the probability of n - 1 consecutive failures followed by one success.</p>
<p>We can write this as:</p>
<p><em>(1 - p)^(n-1) * p</em></p>
<p>So for p = 0.1, we have:</p>
<p><em>0.9^(n-1) * .1</em></p>
<p>And with n = 3:</p>
<p><em>0.9^(2) <em> .1 = .81 </em> .1 = .081 = 8.1%</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that work? I figure that they second person to go in Russian roulette would want to “reset” the game by rolling the chamber. In a six shooter, there are five empty chambers, and if the first person lives, then there are only four possible survivable chambers left for the second player, unless they roll the chamber. Then they would get 5 empty chambers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I understand.  The first pull of the trigger has a 1/6 chance of killing person 1. Without rolling the chamber, the second person has a 1/5 chance of dying if person 1 lives. The third person has a 1/4 chance, etc.  If it gets to person 6, they have a 100% chance of dying.</p>
<p>If the chamber is rolled between each pull, then every person has a 1/6 chance to die if the turn gets to them.</p>
<p><del>Clearly, it's best to go last whether you roll the chamber or not, but</del> if you do end up getting a turn, wouldn't you rather have a 1/6 chance of dying than 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, or 1/1?</p>
<p>Put in terms of the math above, if you do not roll the chamber (and have a 10-shot barrel):</p>
<p>Person 1 has a 10% chance to die.</p>
<p>Person 2 has a 90% chance to play and a 1/9 chance to die, so the overall odds of dying are 10%.</p>
<p>If you do roll the chamber:</p>
<p>Person 1 has a 10% chance to die</p>
<p>Person 2 has a 90% chance to play and a 1/10 chance to die, so the overall odds of dying are 9%. So it seems like rolling the chamber is better for everyone but player 1, for whom rolling does not matter.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To illustrate intuitively, consider a game of Russian Roullete in which the chamber of the revolver is spun every time. Each time, the player has a 1/6 chance of dying, but the closer you go to the beginning, the higher the chance is that you are the one that dies (and conversely, the longer you can go without playing, the higher chance that you survive).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way to envision this is to imagine instead of picking balls out of the bag one at a time, everyone picks a ball out of the bag but doesn't reveal it.  Your odds are the same no matter if you reveal your ball first or last, changing the order of the reveal doesn't impact the outcome.  </p></div>		</li>
