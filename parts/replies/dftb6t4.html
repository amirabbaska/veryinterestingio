			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was at the Louvre seeing it barely registered in my brain.  It's a painting we have all seen so many times that it didn't feel particularly &quot;magical&quot;, and it was packed with people and secured behind glass, which only added to the sense of numbness.</p>

<p>&quot;Artists, you have fifteen minutes left in this challenge!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck it I'll just throw these here and be done with it. I'm definitely going home tonight.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more you know! I saw it last summer and on the way out <a href="http://imgur.com/YoMS25F" target="_blank">took a photo of this</a> because I couldn't believe how big it was, which led to a conversation about how they even transported a lot of shit to the Louvre.</p>
<p>My partner's and my favorite thing we saw though was in <a href="http://imgur.com/L7Rf1Xc" target="_blank">Napoleon's apartment</a>. I've never seen chairs like these before and am curious why they aren't in some public places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way it's presented has an impact. Winged Victory has its own pedestal in an open stairwell area and can be seen at a variety of angles.  It makes all the difference.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Starting when I was about middle school age, I always thought Winged Victory was my favorite sculpture. Being from a small town in America with no exposure to real art, I just thought it was cool looking and I liked the mystery. A couple years back I got the opportunity to travel to Europe and visit the Louvre, and I spent the months leading up to the trip so excited that I would finally get to see my beloved sculpture. My wife and I scheduled Paris as the last stop on our two week trip, adding to the excitement. The only problem was, we stopped in Florence before Paris and stopped by La Accademia, home of Michelangelo's David, and it completely ruined every sculpture in the Louvre for me. With the <em>possible</em> exception of Starry Night, nothing has even come close to the David as far as I'm concerned, and I've seen a great deal of famous art at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a copy of an Aphrodite statue in the Pushkin museum, and when you look from the top (you can, since there's a balcony) it looks ridiculosly heavy-shouldered and masculine, awkward... But if you look at it from below, like it was supposed to be viewed, it's an image of power and grace! Perspective and all that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the English wikipedia page confirms that the painting &quot;spent a brief period in the bedroom of Napoleon in the Tuileries Palace.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the Dutch wikipedia page says it was &quot;in Jos√©phine's appartments, not Napoleon's bedroom as is often said.&quot; (my translation)</p>
<p>No sources given though; not on the English page, nor on the Dutch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminded me of when I went to the Louvre. Huge crowd gathering to see that tiny painting, so you could barely see it. The sad thing is, there is (or was) a huge painting on the opposite side of the room which was magnificent, but totally ignored, as were all the other paintings in the room.</p></div>		</li>
