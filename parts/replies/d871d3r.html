<p>But im sure a bus can be painful too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well a big part of that is because the bigger the venue (stage to audience ratio) you can't hear yourself for shit. By the time the sound bounces back and hits you, it's way too late to correct. You really only have ear buds when the acoustics are for shit on stage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I actually have an answer. I'm a singer and acapella I would sound absolutely lovely. But when I would sing to music it would sound sooo bad. I had no idea why all anyone was telling me was that I was pitchy. Then someone finally explained to me what causes pitchyness. It's you're listening to yourself instead of making your self stay in key with the music. You HAVE to listen to the music not your voice and stay in tune with the music. The problem with people when they sing is that they sing and listen to their own voices so they think they sound great, in their own right. But if you arent harmonizing with the music. You're going to sound awful cause you're fighting the music.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never thought about that, but it's absolutely true: I would always be terrified of singing in front of others as a child and teen because I was always listening intently to the music and knew that I wouldn't be able to stay in key with the song.</p>
<p>Years of singing in choirs and finally learning vocal technique has changed that, but I still feel very, very uncomfortable when I hear someone sing out of key, or if lose control of my voice and do it myself.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have experience with this. When I was a kid, my dad would say I was the only one who could carry a tune in our family. When I hit puberty and my voice dropped a couple octaves, I lost that sense completely.</p>
<p>After I joined a choir (almost on accident), I finally had a moment a few weeks (months?) in: I was singing along, not too loudly, not at all on pitch, when the director singled me out and had me go up in pitch until I was matching everyone else. That moment was amazing - I just completely never had a sense for what it was like hitting the same note after my voice dropped in pitch, so I couldn't really tell my voice was not at the right note.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the real answer but from what I've seen it's mostly from a lack of anyone telling them it's terrible or they equate volume to pitch, the louder they sing the higher the pitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many people who heat their voice in a different tone, mostly with males because males have Adams apples coupled with larger muscle groups in their neck distorting the voice and making it resonate lower than in the larynx.  What a person hears is able to resonate almost directly with their ears so think of a person hearing their own voice as pre processed sound,  making it normal for their voice to be an octave lower than what they hear.  That's why guys with deeper voices often cannot sing in the right pitch without training to hear their own voice (i.e. singing in a bucket or to a wall).  Basically singing well is something you need to learn,  or be born with it by being less manly.</p></div>		</li>
