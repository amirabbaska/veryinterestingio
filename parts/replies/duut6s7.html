<p>H. G. Wells was a fantastic writer, but he maybe wasn't so meticulous about doing his library research.</p>

<p>A minor point, but Jupiter isn't mentioned in the book. It's the narration in the 1953 movie which goes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their nearest world was Jupiter, with giant cliffs of lava and ice, with hydrogen flaming at the tops. The atmosphere is awful. Thousands of pounds to the square inch.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The book is actually quite scientifically accurate, for the most part. It talks about spectroscopy and newly-discovered elements such as Argon to name a couple of things. H.G. Wells seems to have had a good understanding of the scientific knowledge at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love that book so much. He thought of everything. Gravity on mars is lighter, so martians don't need stiff skeletons like we do, they're octopus-like. They're too floppy to walk in earth's gravity, so they blasted entire factories out of a giant gun pointed at earth, so within a few days of the factories crashing to the surface, they could build a small army of mechanical walkers to compensate for the gravity. H. G. Wells even invented the idea of the heat ray, and it doesn't make any fancy lights or sounds like Star Trek phasers, it just makes the air in its line of sight hot enough to combust whatever it's pointed at. And the accounts he gives of trying to fight off the aliens with 19th century weapons are awesome. War of the Worlds is some good-ass hard scifi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wells‘ Martians were actually unique at the time for being non-humanoid (which makes them a lot more plausible), but he was criticized a lot because back then most people assumed intelligent aliens had to look humanoid because they thought that‘s the only shape possible for an intelligent creature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole thing sounds like it was written about Venus, and then at the last minute they swapped the name for some reason. Except even then the closest planet bit doesn't make sense, unless maybe Mars is closer to Venus than Earth during certain orbital alignments?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole concept of closeness depends entirely on what metric you're using.</p>
<p>If you're using average separation, every planet is closest to Mercury. That may seem bit silly. Maybe it makes more sense to compare orbits rather than the physical distance between planets. One way to compare orbits (among many) is by orbital acceleration. By that measure, Jupiter is the closest planet to Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen starts to become a metallic liquid at around ~2 million atmospheres, or about 30% of the way down on a journey to Jupiter's core. Long before this it would act as a supercritical fluid and there would be a smooth transition along a continuum, rather than an abrupt change to a metallic liquid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As he stated it, Kepler's third is an empirical law about proportions: it will give you the <em>ratio</em> of the orbital distances of two bodies, but you need to know one numerical distance to find the other.  This is the &quot;baseline&quot; problem I mentioned.</p>
<p>Newton used his new physics to derive Kepler's third law: his version relates the orbital distance and period explicitly to the mass of the central object.  That's what I meant by</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mass of Jupiter can be calculated using Newtonian orbital mechanics, provided you know the orbital period and orbital diameter of its moons</p>
