			<div class="markdown"><p>And as a person who was stuck in a relationship like this, it is easy to fall into this situation, even if you are a strong person.  </p>
<p>It's like the old analogy that if you throw a frog into a pot of hot water, it'll jump right back out.  But if you put the frog in the water and slowly turn the heat up, you'll cook the frog.  </p>
<p>I fell victim to this as my ex would badger me with misinformation during fights.  It often led me to believe I was in the wrong and eventually led me to question if she was right and I was the one with mental problems.  I even looked into therapy.  Then I had a moment of clarity when a friend pointed some things out and raised concern with how she acted about things.  That friend saved my sanity.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, that analogy is not actually true; frogs try to get out of the pot if it gets too hot. </p>
<p>A scientists removed most of the brains from frogs in an experiment (but left the lower portion of the brain and spinal column responsible for involuntary action like breathing) and did the hot pot experiment. The lobotomized frogs did not jump, showing that the reaction was not a mere involuntary reflex. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can i trust that the scientist had not infact been gas lighting the frogs to believe they were over reacting to jumping out of water and convinced them boiling was the normal response?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, exactly.</p>
<p>I've experienced this as well-- well, to be fair, in at least one case I still wonder if the other person knew that they were being misleading, but I digress-- and that's why I always stress the importance of getting a second opinion from someone unrelated to the situation.</p>
<p>If you ever doubt yourself, stop and find someone to help you get your facts straight. Therapists are great. So are friends who don't pick sides. Get one or both; they can be your greatest asset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom has done exactly this. I gave another example up above but I'll give another one here.</p>
<p>One day, we were coming home from Walmart. She likes to road rage and drives erratically and I'm 15 and can't stand confrontations. We're behind a van and she's tailgating him for no reason, getting so close I instinctively put my hand out like we're going to crash. I ask her if she could please not tailgate the guy in front of us. I don't know why she acts like this but instead of saying ok, and back off like a normal person, she gets pissed off, starts yelling at me, says she can do whatever the fuck she wants, tailgates him harder, and then pulls over and asks me to get out. She wanted me to walk about 10 miles home. I refused.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years later. I bring all this up because she was claiming something about how she never treated me bad. After I bring it up she says it never happened. :/</p>
<p>I recently asked for another apology and she literally laughed and walked away. I really don't get it. She's always posted stuff on facebook about how she wonders when her sons will respect her. Sigh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, but I'd like to add something:</p>
<p>It is not possible to gaslight someone on accident. (Even if the person doing it doesn't know what &quot;gaslighting&quot; means. The manipulation <em>itself</em> must be intentional, in order for it to count as &quot;gaslighting&quot;.)</p>
<p>If you are causing someone to question their memories during an argument because you HONESTLY think they are wrong...that is NOT gaslighting. This happens even in non-abusive relationships, because human memory isn't perfect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to think it would still be gaslighting if a person simply didn't want to admit to something they know to be true. Not necessarily to mess up the other persons mind or intentionally cause pain, but simply because they are cowardly and don't want to admit fault, and simply don't think about or care about the ramifications it may have. But then again, I could be wrong. Wait a minute...am I gaslighting myself, here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you actually might be lol.</p>
<p>If someone is too cowardly to even <em>admit</em> fault, and they don't care or even <em>think</em> about the ramifications it may have on that other person? That's just them converting their fear into someone else's pain. </p>
<p>If they (a) didn't think, and (b) don't care afterwards, then you know that you're dealing with someone who has decided that they are okay with intentionally causing pain in exchange for personal comfort.</p>
<p>The fucked up thing about it is that an abuser could read my post, and <em>easily</em> think that it applies to them. They might even get a little high thinking that they've found a new technique to test out. </p>
<p>The truth is that abusers themselves like the term gaslighting. This is because it happens so naturally for them, that it's easy for them to project the label onto their target. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree it can be subconscious. Sometimes people just are trying anything desperate to escape an argument. Other times, they are legitimately lying to themselves. I've seen this with an alcoholic who was in incredible denial. They tried to perpetuate that denial on their significant other. You might think, well, that's just denial. But there was a manipulative quality to it as well, because ultimately the goal was to continue drinking and staying in the relationship by making the other person seem irrational or crazy. At the same time alcohol messes up the perception of time, and harm being done, so they could potentially not recognize they are incorrect.</p>
<p>Think about arguments like &quot;you drank five times this week&quot;, &quot;no I drank three times&quot;. The first person is counting the last seven days, the second (alcoholic) person is counting Mon-present (let's say Friday) since &quot;the week&quot; starts on a Monday, one or two drinks (they had 4-5) don't count, and wait a sec, there was a holiday and that shouldn't count, etc. etc etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experiences, it comes off as an aggressive and manipulative attempt for force a person to &quot;move on&quot; from previous abusive behavior without going through the usual apology (or at least acknowledgement) plus forgiveness process.  If you just pretend that it didn't happen, maybe they'll forget about it.  The problem comes from the denials when confronted with the truth and if you get away with it once then it may become a pattern.  </p>
<p>At least that's my take.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, right! Thank you; I had forgotten that part of it.</p>
<p>Of course, this does lead to a ton of gray area when it comes to identifying or proving that gaslighting has occurred. It's really hard to prove intent.</p></div>		</li>
