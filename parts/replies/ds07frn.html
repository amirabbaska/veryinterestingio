			<div class="markdown"><p>That would certainly undo a lot of problems, but a lot of people are hooked on non pharmaceuticals like heroin and meth. Meth is made here and in Mexico for the most part, but heroin has been imported from Asia and the Middle East for centuries now and it's being done by big wig politicians/businessmen and the intelligence agencies/military.  </p>
<p>Samuel Russell was the biggest foreign merchant in China in his day and also one of the worlds biggest heroin distributers. He went on to start the Skull and Bones club at Yale along with president Taft's father. Skull and bones have been integral to the drug trade in America ever since, with both George Bush Sr and Jr as members. They both brought war to the Middle East, and the heroin kept flowing. Coincidence?</p></div>		</li>
