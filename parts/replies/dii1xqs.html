			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it's the present day Italian suffix which hasn't changed since before the renaissance which, incidentally, happens to roughly coincide with the first recorded example of the English Chinese.  Canadian = canadese, English = inglese, French = francese, etc.</p>
<p>So while the English suffix in general might trace back to latin through French, /u/Concise_Pirate probably has a point that we say Chinese because the Italians call them cinese (the c in this case even has the ch sound), as opposed to us calling them Chinese via the Old French -eis, while the French suffix itself is -ois.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easier in Polish, sorta.</p>
<p>All nationalities end in -ski for male nouns, -ska for female:</p>
<p>Chińska/Chiński (Chinese)</p>
<p>Japońska/Japoński (Japanese)</p>
<p>Wietnamska/Wietnamski (Vietnamese)</p>
<p>Szkocka/Szkocki (Scottish)</p>
<p>Amerykańska/Amerykański (American)</p>
<p>Niemiecka/Niemiecki (German - funny thing, Niemiec kinda means mute in Polish), but we also have Germanska/Germanski, though it's not really used</p>
<p>Egipska / Egipski (Egyptian)</p>
<p>Włoska/Włoski (Italian - another funny thing, it basically means 'stranger' in old german which was then taken on by Poles) </p>
<p>EDIT.</p>
<p><del>Fuck me, I'm Polish and I derped.</del></p>
<p>It's not as simple as I presented it (country name in Polish in brackets) - this is for a given country nationals:</p>
<p>Chinese - Chinka / Chinczyk (Chiny)</p>
<p>Japanese - Japonka / Japonczyk (Japonia)</p>
<p>Vietnamese - Wietnamka / Wietnamczyk (Wietnam)</p>
<p>Scottish - Szkotka / Szkot (Szkocja)</p>
<p>American - Amerykanka / Amerykanin (Ameryka)</p>
<p>German - Niemka / Niemiec (Niemcy)</p>
<p>Egyptian - Egipcjanka / Egipcjanin (Egipt)</p>
<p>Italian - Wloszka / Wloch (Wlochy)</p>
<p>It's actually quite varied either. </p>
<p>EDIT2.</p>
<p>Nah, I derped again. It was 'country adjectives', so the original list stands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, niemiec <em>literally</em> means 'mute'. It's derived from an old Protoslavic word (němьcь*), which literally means &quot;unable to speak&quot;, because they could not understand each other. Most Slavic languages use a word derived from this for 'German', as does Hungarian (although that's probably a loan word from Russian).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those of you reading at home, the German word for Chinese is super fun to say.</p>
<p>the Ch- <del>diphthong</del> <del>phoneme</del> digraph is identical to the -ch in &quot;ich&quot; and other fun words. Depending on the regional accent, it pronounces anywhere from an 'sh' to a 'k' to a glottal hiss -- like if you were making a cat's hiss. That's the accent I learned in, so I'm sticking with that. I'll just write it as &quot;H&quot;, but be sure to get that hiss in there.</p>
<p>It's followed by 'in', which sounds just like in English. Moving on.</p>
<p>The next part, 'es' rhymes with &quot;pays&quot;, as in 'he pays good money for those German lessons'.</p>
<p>Next up is 'isch', which is just the German way of spelling &quot;ish&quot;. As in 'fish' (German: Fisch)</p>
<p>And then, if you want to make it a feminine adjectival form, you add an 'e' at the end, which sounds like the noise you make when someone is boring you with linguistics. &quot;Eh.&quot;</p>
<p>Coming together, the word &quot;Chinese&quot; is, roughly, &quot;Hin-ays-ish-eh&quot;</p>
<p>Which, for no particular reason, I've always thought was a really fun word to say!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hmm, does that have to do with the ancient Germanic <strong>Saxons</strong> and <strong>Sachenland (Saxony?)</strong></p>
<p>Also, it's a real pity we call them Finns, the Finnish and Finland.
Their proper demonym is sounds so much cooler!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, the &quot;ish&quot; suffix is very Germanic in origin.  In Old English it's rendered as &quot;isc,&quot; as seen in the original spelling of the language &quot;Ænglisc.&quot;  This, in turn, gives us &quot;Wælsc (literally 'the other people' in OE),&quot; &quot;Scotisc,&quot; and &quot;Francisc,&quot; with the latter morphing to a &quot;ch&quot; suffix with time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All modern descendants of PIE are equally old (though some may be more conservative than others) and Albanian and Germanic aren't particularly closely related. In fact, Albanian is one of the few extant IE languages which is an isolate (isn't in the same subfamily as any other extant language).</p>
<p>That said, it could well be the case that their <em>-isht</em> ending shares its origin with the English/German <em>-ish/-isch</em>, which originate from PIE *<em>-iskos</em>. The PIE root also became the (stereotypically) Slavic <em>-ski(j)</em> ending.</p></div>		</li>
