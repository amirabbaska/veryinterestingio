			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. My &quot;inner voice&quot; is my own voice. I wonder if it differs from person to person... man there's still so much we don't know about our brains. Maybe we all experience consciousness differently from each other. </p>
<p>I just remembered in another thread about what we &quot;see&quot; in our heads, a redditor said something like: <em>of course no one can actually imagine things in our heads like a movie</em>. To which I and many others disagreed; we can imagine entirely original things in detail, movie-like (like when you day-dream and can't even see what's in front of you whilst day-dreaming). Other people said their brains did not think like this, some said they even have issues imagining what's happening while reading. I really want to get to the bottom of this, super interesting...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have always wondered if every person perceives colors in the same way. While two people might both describe the sky as blue, what if blue for one of them was the other's red? Would we have any way of knowing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely a controversial idea that isn't proven either way. This is a surprisingly under-studied area given how much of a role it plays in our lives. </p>
<p>My questions about that though, are:
If you can't hear your inner monologue, how can you read silently?
How can you write without also speaking the words?
If given a moderately difficult math problem, do you require working it out on paper? What's the experience from seeing it to writing the answer out? (Are the processes involved entirely hidden from you in your subconscious, bc if you get the answer, those processes obviously exist still even if they are outside of conscious awareness)
How would you be able to do any planning?</p>
<p>It seems like aphantasia would be a very serious mental disability, yet so many people on Reddit claim to have it. My personal guess is that its like drawing, where everyone can do it, but that some don't develop it enough to really know they can, and thus they discount their own abilities. Because even if you can just draw a stick figure that's still an impressive ability that most animals don't have, but it seems like you &quot;can't&quot; because you have so many well practiced artists to compare yourself to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's funny, I was just thinking the same thing. After listening to Conor McGregor talking, I started to adopt that Irish accent in me head a bit. Sometimes when I see something that says <em>Italian</em> on it, I adopt this east coast Italian voice in my head for fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a story where a super villain has the power to project voices anywhere in space. The villain uses it to whisper into the protagonists ear with the protagonists voice. The result is that the protagonist has trouble distinguishing between their own thoughts and the villains suggestions.</p>
<p>The point is that at least the author thinks that his thoughts are in his own voice and expects his audience to have the same believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm that's an interesting concept. I don't know about you, but while I do have an internal voice that sounds like me, it feels completely distinct to actually hearing sound. I wonder how much of that is the author's own perception, vs just artistic license.</p></div>		</li>
