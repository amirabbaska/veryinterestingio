			<div class="markdown"><p>The author of the website appears to be particularly motivated, but deluded. He seems to think the sun has a solid calcium ferrite surface, and spends many paragraphs pointing out why NASA is &quot;wrong&quot; about their interpretation of satellite images of the sun and the like.</p>
<p>While I don't have time to go into it in detail, he has plenty of &quot;sources&quot; but they often don't actually support what he tries to use them to say. I'd trust NASA and the entire body of research on this topic over this one website.</p>
<p>Edit: As an example: Look at the <a href="http://www.thesurfaceofthesun.com/tsunami.htm" target="_blank">tsunami page</a>. The author says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>we observe highly rigid and angular structures which retain their three dimensional shape over the course of many hours </p>
</blockquote>
<p>with respect to a movie on the page. But he then posts the text of an email he got from a Stanford professor regarding the movie, which included the quote </p>
<blockquote>
<p>These images are Doppler shift of the spectral line Ni 6768A. The Doppler shift measures the velocity of mass motions along the line of sight. The darker areas show the motions towards us, and light areas show flows from us. These are not cliffs or anything like this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means, among other things, that the area he circles as retaining its shape is actually moving around throughout the entire video- if it were staying in the same shape it would have a uniform color. </p>
<p>That's just one example. More generally, consider that he's disputing research results from many prominent scientists. It's never impossible that a whole field misinterprets results for long periods of time, but it doesn't happen often. If you find a mistake such as this that you're correct about, however, you don't spend your time making a website about how everyone else is wrong.</p>
<p>You write a paper, get it peer reviewed, and get it published. This website's author has done none of these things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun is too small to fuse iron. IIRC, it's only able to fuse up to carbon.</p>
<p>Any iron that is there, if it is there in any non-trivial quantities, would have had to have been there from the beginning, from the gaseous disk that the sun formed from.</p>
<p>Note that I am making no proposition in either direction, but simply pointing out that even if that <em>were</em> true, it wouldn't be because the sun is fusing iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, iron isn't star poison. A TypeII supernova happens when the core of the star, made of iron, exceeds about 1.4 times the mass of our sun, the Chandrasekhar limit. The energy within is then enough for electrons to merge with protons to form neutrons, and you get a runaway reaction to produce a neutron star and supernova.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really fascinating to me. What is it about fusing iron that causes the collapse? Actually, that might be the wrong question. If I understand right, the star fusing iron is an indicator of imminent collapse, correct? It's not what <em>causes</em> the collapse. So, I suppose the question I really want to ask is what is going on with a star that begins fusing iron and why will that cause a collapse? </p></div>		</li>
