			<div class="markdown"><p>It also has to do with the resistance to ground and the bonding methods used to interconnect the electrical system to the other conductive parts of the home (ie water mains and gas lines).  If the house or houses are not wired to current NEC (National Electric Code) specifications, they will often not trip the OCPD (fuse or breaker) because there is no potential difference between points.  For instance, if I were to fill a plastic tub with water and throw a toaster into the tub there is now zero potential difference between 120v from the toaster and the water.  Using a meter, that voltage will now read 120v from the water itself to a ground source.  If I now enter the water, I have also had my potential raised to 120v.  However, I may feel tingling, bit until I come  into direct contact with a ground source, I'm not in danger of death.  Electricians install a bare ground wire to facilitate the OCPD tripping in instances like the homes in Texas.  Ideally, as soon as there was a path made from the ungrounded feed to the grounding or grounded conductors the Available Fault Current of the breaker would max and the circuit will short and open thereby killing the power.  However, this also depends on the load and other types of device protection used.  If there is no load on the circuit, it may stay closed and folks are swimming around in energized water.  Once they hit a waterline or bonded metal enclosure, well that's it, that's a death sentence.  The running AC is suspect though, I'm not sure I buy that and I won't shrug it off to water salinity.  Those are heavy/ continuous duty motor loads with high draws.  If the AC itself wasn't submerged, I'd buy it and guess the water hadn't penetrated the terminal points at it's disconnection means.  If however that AC was submerged, no way it's working and someone is getting hurt.  Unless there was a massive error that occurred during the wiring installation.</p>

<p>You can run a computer inside a case filled with mineral oil...</p>

<p>Or pure alcohol (iso propanol 99%+). The problem arises when the liquid dries, which can cause rust problems (leading to poor conductivity on the parts that should be conductive, or even a short if something like a nail or something shorts two parts of the system.</p>
<p>So, to recap: Pure H2O is not the problem, diluted ions are. If we could put a computer in a 100% pure de-ionized, organic free water and keep it submerged, you would probably have no problem. BUT if it's ever in contact with anything, even dust or air (forming carbonic acid which could lead to ionisation afterward) OR if it's allowed to dry, then you would have problems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol yea. Pure water itself have very low conductivity. It when you start adding minerals to the water like salt or chlorine or even soap that allows the electricity to travel threw and short everything out. That said, prolonged exposure to pure water will eventually cause malfunctions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The breaker panel might not be submerged, while uncontained electrical splices elsewhere may be, for example, providing hidden dangers.</p>
<p>If the water was on the low-conductivity end of the scale, it's even possible it wouldn't flow enough current to trip breakers even if it were submerged. Have you seen the cheap chinese immersion heaters? The kind you drop into a cup of water and plug the other end into the wall? They literally are nothing but two electrodes spaced about 1/4 inch apart and plugged directly into the main. 6 to 10 amps of current can flow through the water, boiling it and even hydrolyzing it, yet your breaker doesn't trip. Don't stick your finger into that water or stir it with a spoon, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But when your house is flooded aren't you usually in a situation when all of a sudden you  are standing in what is essentially the middle of a giant lake?</p>
<p>Like your house is flooded and that same mass of water is stretching for miles flooding other neighborhoods and stores and streets. Nobody in a city is just experiencing their own flooding that is sequestered from others.</p>
<p>Does this large amount of water make it even less likely for electricity to cause any problems in a flood? Like if a power line gets ripped out and drops into the flooded streets it's not like the tens of thousands of people in that flooded corner of Houston get electrocuted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electric current takes the path of least resistance. For a vaguely similar example, this is why we get narrow bolts of lightning during storms and not just everyone in town getting zapped. I assume a large body of water acts kind of the same way: if you're next to a downed power line or something in a lake, that might suck. If you're four miles away, that electricity has already found a much better way to go.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Electric current takes the path of least resistance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the biggest misunderstandings of electricity. Electric current takes <em>every</em> path. However, the amount that goes down each path is inversely proportional to the resistance. In many cases there's only one path that has several orders of magnitude less resistance so the other paths can practically be ignored. But in the case of water, there's an infinite number of paths all with only slightly varying amounts of resistance.</p>
<p>The reason lightning bolts are so narrow is because once they start travelling, they literally tear the air apart and produce a highly conductive plasma, which brings us back to the case of having only one path with orders of magnitude less resistance.</p>
<p>Assuming a uniform mixture of the water, then the resistance of any given path is going to be proportional to the length of that path. There will be a voltage gradient extending from the hot wire down to whichever submerged parts are grounded. The important part will be the voltage between any two points in the water: if your body is between two points at a voltage difference high enough to overcome your skin resistance (which is very low when it's submerged in water), then electricity will conduct through you.</p>
<p>In the case of one hot wire and one grounded point, then the voltage at any point will be a function of the distance from that point to both the hot wire and to the grounded point. (It gets a bit more complex for multiple large grounded regions which is more likely to be the case.) The voltage will change most drastically along a straight path from the hot wire to the grounded point, making that the most dangerous place to be.</p>
<p>If you move 4 miles away from the hot wire and grounded point which are a few feet apart from each other, then most of the points in that region will be equidistant from the wire and ground and there will be little to no voltage difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true. The floodwater is in fact highly grounded. The problem is that the water isn't conductive enough to hold everything at the ground state; the body of water is essentially a giant voltage divider network, and if you're in it, you are part of it. The danger you're in is relative to what part of this voltage divider you are. It's a minefield problem. You are OK in most cases, but you may not see or recognize if you are providing a path between areas of differing potential.</p>
<p>In your powerline scenario, most of the current will be flowing between ground in the immediate vicinity of the powerline. Hopefully enough to cause the voltage to sag significantly, but suppose it isn't. The wet human body is about 1000 ohms resistance. The voltage potential will drop off with distance from the line, but could still be high enough to flow a fatal amount of current through you at a distance you might think is safe.</p></div>		</li>
