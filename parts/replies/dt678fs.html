<p>First off, increasing the orbital radius decreses orbital velocity</p>

<p>This is true for circular orbits, but in the context of the OP, increasing orbital velocity does increase altitude. He said: </p>

<p>If I increase the speed (by burning prograde)</p>

<p>Assume you are in a circular orbit. Burning prograde will increase your current velocity, and make the orbit elliptic, with the old orbital radius as periapsis and a higher apoapsis. Near the apoapsis, the velocity will be smaller, as you said. But near the periapsis, we have a higher velocity than before making the orbit elliptical. Only after circularising the orbit by burning prograde at the apoapsis will the orbital velocity be smaller than before raising the orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for pointing my mistake (I've edited the post above), I mistyped it but I had it correctly in mind (stupid of me to make a mistake on <em>that</em> topic!).</p>
<p>So yes increase of altitude is <em>decrease</em> in speed. No problem for that :)</p>
<p>Also I know that one would seldom burn entirely radially. But I'm trying to understand the physics of it. What <em>would</em> happen if I burned radially only?
So you're saying that it would translate the orbit, right? But that's what I don't understand either: an orbit it never really circular. This is an ellipse, and the body that we are orbiting is sitting at one of the focal points.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to translate the ellipse if the focal point (the body that we orbit) does not move?</p>
<p>What I can see instead is that it &quot;stretches&quot; the ellipse by changing the eccentricity.</p>
<p>But... this is what burning prograde / retrograde already does. So.. what am I missing?</p>
<p>I just mentioned KSP to give some context and how I &quot;experiment&quot; things, but I'm more interested in the physics (orbital mechanics), not the game itself in this case. Unless maybe some simplifications are made so that they somehow &quot;break&quot; the physics, but it was my understanding that orbital mechanics was pretty well implemented in KSP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A purely radial small impulsive burn changes the eccentricity of the orbit, but does not change the semimajor axis. The new orbit will (as always) cross the old orbit at the point of the burn (and another point). If you started with a circular orbit, you'll end up with an elliptical orbit. (Large burns, however, will add to the total energy and therefor change the semimajor axis.)</p>
<p>The question is a little complicated for an elliptical orbit: note that normally, in an elliptical orbit, a &quot;radial&quot; burn has a pro- or retro-grade component to it except at periapsis or apoapsis. You'll also likely shift the argument of periapsis of the orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hum that's right. I had not considered than in a ellipse orbit, the radial burn had a prograde component, also.<br />
I guess I was imagining a circular orbit or burning at periapsis.</p>
<p>I can understand that burning radial at periapsis will &quot;rotate&quot; the ellipse as it was explained in earlier comments, but I don't understand why / how it would change the eccentricity? I thought the only way to change the eccentricity was to burn prograde / retrograde at apo / peri-apsis?</p></div>		</li>
