			<div class="markdown"><p>In Brazilian Portuguese the diminutive is used all the time and actually alters the meaning of words. Changing &quot;só&quot; to &quot;sozinho&quot; changes the meaning from &quot;alone&quot; to &quot;lonely&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, &quot;sozinho&quot; isn't a diminutive, even if it uses <em>-inho</em>. </p>
<p>Also, &quot;só&quot; and &quot;sozinho&quot; both translate to &quot;alone&quot;. &quot;Solitário&quot; is what translates to &quot;lonely&quot;.</p>
<p>But yes, diminutive changes the meaning of words too. It usually adds a negative meaning to the object. If I said &quot;Ele tem uma guitarrazinha&quot; (&quot;he has a little guitar&quot;), it would mean that his guitar isn't very good.</p>
<p>Thanks for reminding me of yet another use of diminutive in Portuguese ^^</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also works the other way around some times. Adding an augmentative, the opposite of a diminutive, makes some things seem better. If I say &quot;ele tem um carrinho&quot; (he has a little car) it would seem his car isn't very good, while if I say &quot;ele tem um carrão&quot; (he has a big car), you would already imagine a great, expensive car.</p>
<p>Language is cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that using the diminutive isn't a good thing when teaching kids how to talk. </p>
<p>Since Portuguese is formed mostly by Paroxytone words,  kids would take only the &quot;inha/inho&quot;  thing and don't learn the actual words. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but it's kinda hard not to speak like that when around children.</p></div>		</li>

<p>auau (sound of their barks in Portuguese, usually used because it's way easier to way than &quot;cachorrinho&quot;, for example</p>

<p>Similarly, my mom used to call dogs &quot;bark barks&quot; around me when I was a kid</p></div>		</li>
