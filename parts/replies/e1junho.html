			<div class="markdown"><p>GPS receivers have to take relativity into account, since GPS satellites are orbiting at almost 9,000mph. That’s fast enough for their onboard atomic clocks to show a noticeable time dilation (about 40 ms per day) that receivers have to “subtract” out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big real life application of relativity is GPS navigation. The satellites in space aren't moving at speed of light but they are fast enough that without the relativity equations, our GPS location tracker would be in a different location than we actually were or our destination is closer to us than it actually was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The GPS application is one example frequently mentioned that has the added attractiveness of demonstrating a technologically practical application.</p>
<p>My personal favorites involve measurements of particles called muons. For simplicity's sake, imagine it's in most ways like an electron, but much heavier. When cosmic rays from the sun -- or other sources -- pass into the atmosphere, the high energy interactions sometimes create muons, at a predictable rate. The half life of a muon is on the order of 1.5 μs.</p>
<p>Knowing at what rate they are created, how they behave, and how quickly they decay, you can estimate how many would reach the surface over a given time. As it turns out, far more are detected than are accounted for from that calculation.</p>
<p>The discrepancy is a result of time dilation. Faster bodies experience time more slowly. This has been verified under laboratory conditions where muon half life can be multiplied by accelerating them to near light speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you haven't read it, professor Hawkings &quot;A brief history of time&quot; is probably a good place to start. It doesn't focus on relativity, but it includes some of it, and does a good job of explaining the concepts without relying on the maths.</p>
<p>I don't know any other specific book, but I know they exist. My university in Stockholm offers courses to the public on stuff like relativity, given at a level approachable by non academics. You may have something similar in your city, if there's a university there.</p>
<p>You can always do what my younger colleagues ended up doing, and watch the Feynman lectures on youtube and similar offerings. You can basically put yourself through university level physics using only stuff like that and hard work, if one is of a mind to. There's plenty of great online stuff for physics, but it will take some effort to get through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply! I don't think such a thing exists in my city haha</p>
<p>I'll look up both the book and videos!</p></div>		</li>
