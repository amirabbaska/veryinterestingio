			<div class="markdown"><p>I sleep on my stomach and feel the urge to move to another position and it’s easier/faster to turn one way but for some odd reason my body wants to make a complete circle the other direction to get into the new position. I also notice that if I just go with the faster route, my body gets upset and won’t relax until I have done it “the right way”. </p></div>		</li>
