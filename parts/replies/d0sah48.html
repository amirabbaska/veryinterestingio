<p>Edit: Dude you keep editing; if you can't answer it like you're talking to a five year old you shouldn't answer. I appreciate your effort but this isn't AskScience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immediately you would study groups of cells in the spinal cord for unique hormone receptors and produce drugs that target those receptors. In this way you could systemically turn on (or off) a tiny portion of the spinal cord.</p>
<p>In the further future, things like modified viruses carrying edited (or even foreign) genes would be injected directly into the cord to genetically modify these circuits and in that way cause the circuits to change how they behave.</p>
<p>Viral injections of edited genes are often done in mice, but gene therapy is very restricted in humans at the moment.</p></div>		</li>
