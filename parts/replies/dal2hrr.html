<p>EDIT3: In This Very Short Animation the left arm is ramped (vertically faced) and is the power stroke, the right arm is blunt (horizontally faced) and is the non-powered catch half of the cycle. You can see that the left side can be &quot;pushed&quot; by the gear while the right side can not.</p>

<p>No, actually, both <em>pallets</em> (what you call &quot;arms&quot;) have a <em>locking face</em> and an <em>impulse face</em>.  The locking faces here are curved (ideally they should be shaped as an arc of a circle centered on the anchor arbor); the impulse faces are straight and carefully sloped to receive a push from the escape wheel teeth but with minimal friction.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I made a really snarky reply, but then I deleted it after single-frame stepping the animation.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the horizontal face on the right side is a drive surface or not. It's not sloped enough to be an equal time/power drive compared to the left one. But that could be an animator error.</p>
<p>Hrm...</p>
<p>The left arm locks and drives on the same face, which again, could be an animation error.</p>
<p>I could have sworn that the oldest clocks I examined back in the day and a lock arm and a drive arm separately. Maybe it was a particular thing to the particular clocks I had on hand.</p>
<p>Correction accepted for the time being.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're trying to infer how the escapement works from an unreliable animation.  The intent of the animation is to depict some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_escapement" target="_blank">deadbeat escapement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The deadbeat escapement has two faces to the pallets, a 'locking' or 'dead' face, with a curved surface concentric with the axis on which the anchor rotates, and a sloping 'impulse' face.[3] When an escape wheel tooth is resting against one of the dead faces, its force is directed through the anchor's pivot axis, so it gives no impulse to the pendulum, allowing it to swing freely. When the pallet on the other side releases the escape wheel, a tooth lands on this &quot;dead&quot; face first, and remains resting against it for most of the pendulum's outward swing and return. For this period the escape wheel is &quot;locked&quot; and unable to turn. Near the bottom of the pendulum's swing the tooth slides off the dead face onto the slanted 'impulse' face of the pallet, allowing the escape wheel to turn and give the pendulum a push, before dropping off the pallet.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So to the extent that the animation appears not to have two impulses per cycle, I'd call it a flaw in the animation.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It's possible.  Some escapements do give one impulse per cycle (e.g., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapement#Detent_escapement" target="_blank">detent escapement</a>).  But the most common ones give two impulses.</p>
