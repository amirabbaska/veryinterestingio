			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything around you emits blackbody radiation aswell. And heat goes from hotter to colder.</p>
<p>Assuming you are sitting in a normal room now, you are actually radiating temperature away, more than what you recieve, but your bodily functions keep warm. This results in a net energy loss for you, but thats why you eat food to get it back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who says it doesn't? You lose energy from blackbody radiation, and by mass-energy equivalence—our favorite equation e = mc^(2)—therefore you must lose mass as well (albeit a very tiny, probably unmeasurable amount).</p>
<p>A fun example is the sun. The sun radiates 3.86 <em> 10^26 Joules of energy every second, which, dividing by c^(2), means that the sun loses 4.3 </em>billion<em> kilograms of mass every second. [According to wolframalpha](<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.86" target="_blank">https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.86</a></em>10%5E26+Joules+%2F+c%5E2), this is about 3/4 of a Pyramid of Giza every second that the sun loses. Strewn out about the cosmos in the form of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I'm sure you're right about us not being able to measure this, we could calculate it. <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/bodrad.html" target="_blank">This calculator can help one determine roughly how many watts they emit.</a> It says the average human emits 133 watts at room temperature. This would be 1.48 picograms per second. In 80 years time you would lose 3.7 milligrams of weight from blackbody emissions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a bit confused. From my understanding, nothing is true blackbody. An blackbody must emit and absorb light equally. Everything that we have is just an approximation.</p></div>		</li>
