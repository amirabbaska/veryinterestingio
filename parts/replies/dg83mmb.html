			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add information to your fifth point because some people might be unfamiliar with the nuances of opioids prescribed for pain: studies show that only a marginal percentange of chronic pain patients misuse their medication. One of the studies was conducted by the National Institutes of Health and found that 5% of chronic pain patients misused their opioid prescription. Which is in contrast to people's idea that all patients - no matter the chronicity of their illness - abuse opioids. </p>
<p>Instead the huge factor that contributes to illicit use is diversion by patients with temporary pain (like surgery or some other one-time event) and illegally produced opioids. An example of diversion is when patients with acute pain get prescribed a 30 day supply but only use it for 5 days and sell the rest. </p>
<p>I bring this up because some people want to fix addiction by limiting opioid prescriptions. Those guidelines incidentally affects all pain related patients. This is causing unnecessary suffering by the hands of overly cautious doctors (they are afraid of losing their license. Unfortunately their license can be seized without a trial). Patients are being denied opioid pain relief despite their legitimate medical need. It affects patients with chronic ilnesses - illnesses that can't be cured and induce daily debilitating pain - and it even affects people with terminal illnesses like cancer (see the first link provided below).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you this is exactly my case. Broke my back 10 years ago. I've always taken my medication as directed, called my pain doc if I need to adjust. Over the last few years though I'm treated like an addict. Given countless &quot;anti depressants&quot; and &quot;nerve&quot; medications all with worse side affects then the Percocet I currently take. </p>
<p>I'd love to no longer need to take my medication to function day to day but the countless &quot;alternatives&quot; being given as a result are a hell of a lot worse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is what happened to my mom, too (she crushed a vertebrae in her spine). it's frankly disgusting how patients are treated like criminals, and there's really no alternative to dealing with it other than just suffering. </p>
<p>some doctors are so certain that people are drug-seeking that they'll even refuse to acknowledge that something is wrong at all. when my mom went to the ER after her accident she was told it was just a pulled muscle and to suck it up, that she should never have wasted anyone's time at the ER. when she went to a different doctor and they actually examined and x-rayed her, they discovered the damage. it was clearly visible on an x-ray, but that doctor was too busy humiliating my mother to actually treat her like a person. and that was just the shitty start to more shitty years of being treated like an addict for wanting to recover some aspect of her strength and independence.</p>
<p>it will never fail to infuriate and sicken me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you.  Chronic pain patient here.  I have taken every antidepressant, anticonvulsant, nerve killing, body numbing alternative to opioids and the side effects and withdrawals from these are hell on earth.  The only side effect I get from my Tylenol 4's are constipation.  I think because opiates are cheap, they are demonized.
Every try withdrawing from neurontin?  Talk about horrible.  Months worth of agonizing spells of depression, intense pain, stomach pain, insomnia and panic attacks.  Terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband is a chronic pain patient. (Diabetic neuropathy and degenerative disc disease.) For years, because he didn't have health insurance and we don't have a lot of money, all his doctor could do was prescribe pain pills. Unfortunately, he suffers from every side effect known to man, but we weren't able to get him into pain management. </p>
<p>Finally, he was approved for social security, which made him eligible for Medicaid. So the referral has been made, and he should have an appointment soon. </p>
<p>Hopefully he will be able to benefit from advances in pain management, and won't have to keep taking the pulls that make him sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One problem with chronic pain management is the widespread misconception that you can't get addicted from proper use, only from abuse. So people think if their pain is real it somehow protects them. Better education is desperately needed. </p>
<p>And of course the other problem is opioid induced hyperalgesia - the treatment can actually make the pain more severe, increasing dependence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean dependent instead of addicted? If you're taking the medication properly (as directed in order to manage pain vs whenever you want in order to abuse it) then chances are you're not addicted. </p>
<p>Hyperglasia isn't proven yet. I'm not suggesting it doesnt happen but people might think it happens more often than it does because people confuse other pain phenomena with hyperglasia.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25128284" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25128284</a></p>
<p>&quot;Although opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is mentioned as a potential cause of opioid dose escalation without adequate analgesia, true evidence in support of this notion is relatively limited. Most studies conducted in the context of acute and experimental pain, which seemingly demonstrated evidence for OIH, actually might have measured other phenomena such as acute opioid withdrawal or tolerance&quot; if you read further it includes chronic pain patients in the discussion. I didn't include it to reduce the size of the comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a 30 tab (3 day) script for T3 and was taking them as prescribed.  The first two doses (six hours apart, as prescribed) were so miraculous at fixing the pain they were prescribed for, I couldn't believe it.  Then I woke up with a terrible stabbing headache.  Took my next dose or three hoping for relief from the original pain <em>and</em> the headache.  Finally the original pain was subsided enough to be tolerable but the headache was absolutely intolerable and I looked forward to the T3 for a completely different pain than original.  </p>
<p>After only 8 or so &quot;every six hours&quot; doses <em>as prescribed</em> I already was somewhat &quot;misusing&quot; my pain medications, and wondering if the headache wasn't itself <em>caused by</em> the T3.  </p>
<p>Scary shit.  Glad not to be stuck taking it longer term.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was really excited, as an ICU nurse, when my hospital started offering a 'detox' program for alcohol and/or substance abuse/opiod addiction. I've had family and friends who have dealt with this issue, and was glad to see a program instituted that was meaningful: patients could simply walk in and request treatment, without a doctor admitting them.</p>
<p>They started out on a regular floor, and were constantly evaluated for withdrawal symptoms. We had an order set that allowed nurses to ramp up the treatment based on vital signs and DTs, and sometimes they needed to be moved to the ICU for closer observation, one on one patient/nurse ratio, and/or medications and drips to support them (like if blood pressure was tanking, or they were out of their minds and trying to jump out a window!). After getting them stable and through the worst of their withdrawal, to the point that they were conscious, stable, and making sense, we could transfer them to a rehab clinic. The clinics around here don't deal with DTs, the patients are sent to the hospital for that, so this program set them up to get through the awful withdrawal phase before hopefully going to rehab.  </p>
<p>It was and wasn't successful. Not many people checked themselves in, instead coming in only after being found passed out in the bathroom of a gas station with a needle still in their arm, or OD'd at home. Those folks typically don't want rehab. </p>
<p>But a lot of people with opioid addiction utilized the program. Most of them had similar histories of back injuries and other chronic pain, and their addiction and reliance on drugs had overtaken their lives, plus, they rarely experienced pain relief at that point. </p>
<p>It was grueling work, most of the nurses wanted to do typical ICU type jobs, but felt frustrated that they were &quot;babysitting addicts&quot;. However, overall, I think that my hospital had a great idea that was under-utilized by the population it was created for, and I really wish we, in the States, could see  this epidemic for what it really is, and provide more intensive recovery programs that support these folks who our healthcare system &quot;broke&quot; in the 1st place.    </p>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>They don't want their tax dollars/research dollars/healthcare dollars going to junkies on the street who choose that lifestyle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just wrote an article on naloxone usage in Canada a few months back (am journalist) and I was really surprised at some of the angry letters to the editor about naloxone that I read while doing research. Who could hate a lifesaving drug that costs $10 a dose and is incapable of hurting a non-addict? </p>
<p>I'm generally pretty left wing but when I was researching public opinion, I was <em>really</em> surprised how fair one argument in particular seemed. A mother wrote into the local paper in Winnipeg, saying how her daughter -- who worked full-time, minimum wage -- couldn't afford both her diabetes medicine and her rent. She got evicted and was made homeless because of her insulin costs and had to move back in with her mom -- thankfully she had a good mom to move back in with. The mom was asking why the provincial government was giving out naloxone kits and therapy drugs (suboxone, methadone et al) and so forth out to opiate addicts, but they wouldn't give her daughter medicine for her Type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>Basically, the mom was annoyed that one disease (addiction) got free pharmacare but the other (Type 1 diabetes) didn't. And I actually kind of get that. I have pretty severe OCD but I can't afford therapy. My mom has asthma but during my childhood couldn't afford inhalers. Why do opiate addicts often get their pharmacare treatment for free but people with chronic illnesses don't? Why will the government help them but not us? It's obviously an emotional argument, not a logical one, but when you or your kid is suffering I can really understand how it feels unfair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely because those people with asthma and diabetes aren't usually public health risks, engaging in behaviour that could potentially endanger them further. </p>
<p>An asthmatic isn't going to turn to illegal drugs to help their asthma, they're going to take antihistamines or go to the ER. Someone with OCD isn't likely  to criminal behavior to pay for their therapy. A diabetic isn't super likely to start sharing needles with people who might be infected with hepatitis or HIV when they can't afford insulin or syringes, and diabetics are less likely to be dropping those potentially infected syringes in public places.</p>
<p>Getting addicts away from behaviors that are risks to the public health at large benefits everyone overall more than helping out small populations of non-addicts. Again though, your &quot;why them but not me?&quot; argument goes back to whether or not you believe that addiction is a moral failing and should be treated differently from other illnesses.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I understand your main argument, in terms of public health risks, but I don't think that will make anybody who actually <em>has</em> a chronic illness feel any better about not being able to afford their prescriptions. Sure, my mom wasn't going to make anyone else sick or commit crimes because of her asthma, but she could have died. She almost did a few times. Someone with bad untreated depression could kill themselves or self-harm -- &quot;endangering themselves further&quot; -- but therapy/meds for depression isn't free. A parent with bad postpartum psychosis could hurt their baby, but treatment for that is also not free. Someone with MRSA could sicken and even kill people in their community, but antibiotics aren't free. Physical therapy is not free or affordable, which leads many chronic pain patients to street opiates and the associated criminal risks. I understand your argument and I think you're right, but so many illnesses have the potential to harm the person further or induce public illness... It must be hard to see your disease not given any help by the provincial government.</p>
<p>And to your last point -- I don't consider addiction a moral failing at all, I consider it a valid disease/illness. But like I said, I can imagine it hurts when it feels like one disease gets privileged access to affordable treatment over another -- I don't feel this way personally, but it would be easy for a parent of a sick kid to do so. If asthmatics got free inhalers but diabetics didn't get free insulin affected people would feel that was unfair, too. I don't think addiction should be treated differently or negatively. I think everyone should get free national pharmacare, no exceptions, and we're getting there. I also know an &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality is not helpful and that we should all be working together to achieve pharmacare rather than infighting. But I <em>also</em> feel for that mom, because it must suck to see your loved one be excluded from affordable prescriptions when other illness populations aren't.</p></div>		</li>
