			<div class="markdown"><p>I always think of a group of 5 as a 2 and a 3, so AbCde, but that's just a 'quintuplet', not 5/4 time. If we're truly talking 5/4 time, it feels good to place a 'backbeat' on the '3' and the &quot;&amp; of 4&quot;. I don't think there's really a 'natural' stress pattern for 5's or 7's or 11's. Great musicians just make it seem natural, for instance, the song '7 Days' by Sting. Vinnie Colaiuta makes it feel like it's not an 'odd' time signature at all.
