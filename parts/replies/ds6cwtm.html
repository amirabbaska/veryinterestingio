<p>Molecular nitrogen is an extremely stable molecule and you need to spend a considerable amount of energy to break it.</p>

<p>Often that is the <em>reason</em> so much energy is released from the decomposition of high energy nitrogen-containing compounds - they decompose to form molecular nitrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Generally speaking, not only the more stable a molecule is, the more energy you need to break it; but also the more energy is liberated when you form it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Molecular nitrogen has an enthalpy of formation of zero, so any heat generated by breaking the bonds of the reactants leaves as heat unless byproducts are produced as well. The problem is that many of the bonds in nitrogen containing compounds are fairly highly energy intensive to form in the first place so it liberates a lot of energy when they break</p></div>		</li>
