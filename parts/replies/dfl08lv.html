			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad people understand the actual definition. By job title, I'm a lobbyist. But I lobby on behalf of a non profit that represents a citizens group. </p>
<p>Not everyone can go to the Hill and speak directly with the legislator or that legislators issue specific aide. Corporations have the money to have someone there daily so it's beneficial to send lobbyists that represent the citizen interest too. </p>
<p>If I tell someone I'm a lobbyist, they automatically think corruption. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I just have these preconceived notion of folks taking meetings (or their aides doing so) and nothing actually coming of it.</p></div>		</li>

We've established a climate caucus in the house and state and city resolutions. We have a proposal we hope to get into a committee soon. </p>
<p>We actually have a list of accomplishments on our website </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am also a lobbyist, in a sense. I belong to a community advocacy group. As a board member, I meet with local politicians to voice our concerns and give our input into government projects. We do research for them and put them in touch with people. </p>
<p>We don't give government any money because we don't have any (we are all volunteers). There is an exchange though. We give them creedence. They must &quot;consult community groups.&quot; It turns out that government chooses which groups they will work with. We even provide them with photos of community involvement so that they can promote their agenda. </p>
<p>This is small town, local stuff, but it is an interesting lesson in politics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is still lobbying. If you went to DC, unaffiliated with any group, to speak with legislators about an interest, that's lobbying. If you call your state legislators, that's lobbying. Corporations just have more money to keep someone in the legislators face full time.
A lot of non profits reach out for donations so they can have someone there full time too.
If we didn't have lobbying, those corporations CEOs are still close with legislators and could influence in private. With how it is now, constituents still have more power.
Legislators care a lot about re-election. </p>
<p>Edit to say: I'm completely agreeing with this comment, just wanted to point out to others in the thread that this person, although a volunteer, is still a lobbyist </p></div>		</li>

<p>There's been plenty of times that I couldn't get a meeting that day so I wait outside the office and give the legislator my info when they come out. </p>
<p>You're allowed to walk into any office and if you're a constituent and the legislator isn't in another meeting or in session, you may get a face to face meeting.
They have issue specific staff that will ALWAYS meet with you, even if you didn't call ahead </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a liberal, but I do not march in lockstep with other liberals in opposing the Citizens United decision.  We may dislike it because we dislike corporate power and the abuses it brings, but the fact of the matter is, in our country, citizens have Freedom of Assembly, and there is a longstanding tradition of those Assemblies having the right to collectively petition the government for a redress of grievances. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the part that never gets past the soundbite.  All citizens united did was basically uphold that we do not lose our rights when we group together.  People don't seem to think through how important that is.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except when a corporation donates to a political campaign it is doing so with profits earned from the labor of its employees. It's reasonable to assume that large portions of those corporation's employees (and surely even majorities in some cases) don't necessarily agree with the company's political views,policy preferences or supported candidates. </p>
<p>This is an obvious infringement upon not just those employees' speech but also their freedom of assembly because they--and the capital their labor generates--are effectively co-opted, by virtue of the compulsory need for employment, into whatever political causes and candidates to which their corporate employer donates.</p>
<p>This is to say nothing of companies with CEOs and management teams that send out memos during election seasons all but demanding their employees vote for a particular candidate or ballot initiative. </p>
<p>The employees have no say in how the profits their labor produces are spent towards corporate political funding. Sure, they can (maybe, depending on their field and the market) get another job but they'll likely run into this conflict of interest no matter which corporation employees them. </p>
<p>It is the employees that produce the labor which produces the capital that funds the corporation's preferred political causes and candidates. This can be (and more often than not is) harmful to the individual for the simple reason that the interests of an individual and those of a corporation are typically divergent. </p>
<p>Declaring money equal to speech effectively establishes a permanent society and an economy where those with the most money are entitled to the most speech. </p>
<p>And since corporate entities (be they for-profit, non-profit, unions, whatever) will always generate more wealth than any individual person, they will always have access to greater speech and therefore greater influence on the politics and laws that effect everyone in our society in a manner with which no individual person can ever compete. </p>
<p>Couple the equating of money with speech to the entitling of corporations with the same legal rights of individual persons, and you've forever tipped the scales of politics, economics, and justice in favor of corporate, monied interests at the expense (if not the virtual elimination) of the individual's interest with no possible recourse for the individual to ever again establish even a meager semblance of balanced power within the society they live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After Buckley, they put a cap on things like campaign donations. It was pretty low - Something like $2000. So pretty much anyone with a few followers could raise that kind of money really easily, and have the same amount of talking power (at least theoretically) as the big rich corporations.</p>
<p>Citizens United removed that cap, and allowed richer people/corporations/groups/etc to basically donate as much as they wanted. So now whoever throws the most money at their politicians has the most votes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're so wrong it's not even funny. </p>
<p>Simply googling the [Buckley Supreme Court Case] ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo</a>) tells you that all it did was say that caps were unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Citizens United did not remove the cap, it said that corporations could spend money from their general treasuries during election periods on media related to an election.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with Citizens United isn't corruption (that's a separate problem).</p>
<p>It's that if you believe money=speech then you implicitly believe that it's OK for some people to have more speech than others.</p>
<p>In a country where we theoretically have one vote per person and where the founders explicitlly rejected a proposal that only landowners could vote that seems like the real problem to me.</p></div>		</li>
