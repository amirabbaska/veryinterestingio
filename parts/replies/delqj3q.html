			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation.
Sort of off topic but if the Higgs boson is what gives particles mass, then why are things like photons said to be massless ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because not all particles interact with the higgs field. the photon is one of those. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IF this Higgs Boson's 'child particles'   'come from' Higgs Boson's &quot;breaking apart into them&quot; .... are the 'common' particles we know about that are everywhere and constitute the 'matter' we interact with Is the 'result' of (child particles) the Higgs Bosons?</p>
<p>Are they The Initial Source of ALL particles, both those with mass (i.e. electrons/neutrons et al) and those without? (e.g. photons)</p>
<p>Then how/where do 'massve' particles like the Higg's Boson occur in the first place?</p>
<p>If these 'bosons' are the basis of all particles with mass, why then aren't they more ubiquitous?</p></div>		</li>
