<p>Scientists aren't priests, dispensing some divine truth given to them alone. Most scientists never portray themselves or their work in this way,  but the press does. </p>
<p>To paraphrase Richard Feynman:
You make a guess. Doesn't matter who you are, or what letters come after your name. You make a guess. Based on that guess, you predict some measurable outcome in the natural world. Then you test it with an experiment. If what you see isn't what you predicted then your guess was wrong. That's science. Anything else isn't.</p>
<p>There's no honest way to ever be 100% sure that any theory is the only way to explain an experimental result, only to test whether it's wrong. So good scientists are actually in the business of proving themselves and their colleagues wrong. </p>
<p>If you're looking for absolute truth that will never be disproven, go find a priest.</p></div>		</li>
