			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you're correct, but that's a result of our pressure sensitivity. The resistance of a liquid against your movement is more than air, and less than a solid (obviously), and the differences sensed by each part of your skin in contact with the liquid in contrast to each other (such as placing your hand in moving water) are what we learn to identify as a liquid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the question was about wet sensation. You’re asking about how we differentiate between solids and liquids, which is itself an interesting question. I guess it’s the same way we differentiate between wood vs sand, or plastic vs paper. In short, your skin has vibration sensors of different frequencies, deep pressure sensors, a pain sensor, 2 or 3 different temp sensors set at different temperatures ... and that’s it I think. Your brain combines the input from all of these to give you a perception of rough or smooth or hard or soft or liquid or solid etc etc. </p>
<p>Incidentally, all your eyes do is detect electromagnetic radiation of different frequencies coming from different directions. Your brain combines these to give colours, depth, images, objects, patterns, beauty etc</p>
<p>Basically it’s all in your head.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not really as a texture, but the difference in viscosity between water and air is very noticeable. Even if you can't &quot;feel&quot; the water itself, you can feel it resisting your movements in a way that air doesn't, which lets you conclude that there's a liquid even if you have no way of sensing it directly.</p></div>		</li>
