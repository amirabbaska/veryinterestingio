			<div class="markdown"><p>If you just take a second to visualize how big a fly's brain probably is and put it next to your own brain, it should be pretty obvious how absolutely stupid they are. It's like a crumb. A piece of your brain 10 times larger could die right now and you probably wouldn't ever notice. They basically just run on a script. &quot;FIND FOOD. LOCATED. LAND. DANGER DETECTED. FLY AWAY. FIND FOOD. LOCATED. LAND. DANGER DETECTED. (repeat until you kill the son of a bitch or he gets his fill)&quot;. Insects are basically machines. And most of that crumb brain is probably dedicated to aerial navigation and swatter avoiding, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some really smart birds out there with tiny brains. </p>
<p>Flies are not the smartest but they will even quit eating if they witness the death of a fly that was sharing captivity with them. </p>
<p>But since we’re on the topic of brain sizes, there are some very big animals with very big brains that aren’t the smartest. There’s a lot more to do with it than just the size of a brain </p></div>		</li>

<p>That takes a lot of cognitive ability and their brains are probably smaller than a fly's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more the brain to body mass ratio that matters. We havd quite a big brain in relation to our body weights. If it were for absolute sizes, blue whales and elephants would  be way ahead of us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you say that. Here in the UK if you swat a fly away then you never see it again. However i was recently in Australia and couldn’t believe it. You swatted a fly away and it would come back instantly, over and over ad infinitum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but cognitive ability is more about brain density than size. The gray matter of a brain is where all the thinking happens. If you look at the gray matter of a human brain, the structure is very rigid and defined because of how developed our brains are, whereas a majority of animals have very smooth gray matter. I mean, a humans brain is only 3lbs on average, and a sperm whales is a whopping 17lbs, but I don't see any sperm whales buildng skyscrapers and going to space.</p>
<p>But, I'm not a psychologist, I've just taken a couple of classes, so take all that with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>
