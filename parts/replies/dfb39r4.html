			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that are quite transmittable in QA format.  At best, I'd say, practice different techniques over time with the intention of expanding awareness.  Some techniques I practice are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Getting very interested in my reactions - whether good or bad, and trying to get to the source of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>desiring to understand myself objectively - trying to see what is so about what I did or said  without labeling it good or bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>practicing not making myself wrong - nothing makes me stupider than judging myself negatively </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>noticing when I'm not listening to people and noticing what conversation I am having my head about what they're saying rather than what they are actually  saying</p>
</li>
<li>just a note:  I'm not sure there are &quot;true&quot; reasons why we do things or feel a certain way, but I think there are authentic and inauthentic reasons - </li>
</ul>
<p>For example:  I'm feeling very angry after hanging out with my mother.</p>
<p><em>Inauthentic explanation</em>:  &quot;I guess me and my mom just don't get along.  If only she didn't judge me so much.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Authentic explanation</em>:  &quot;When she said that thing about my schoolwork, I made it mean she didn't love me and I got upset.&quot;</p>
<p>Life never happens in vague generalities; there are always specific instances or events that give rise to things.   Also in the above example, I locate myself at the source of my emotion - <em>I had a thought.  I believed it.  I had an emotional reaction to that thought.</em> - this gives me power to let go of the negative emotion because my interpretation caused it - nothing else <em>did it to me</em>.</p>
<p>Notice it's not quite the 'TRUTH', but it's close enough to get me back in the drivers seat, rather than being at the effect of the circumstances or something outside of me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is some really good advice right here. Although I do remember that i used to do some of the things you said but sadly I would get trapped in the pattern of overthinking everything and as a result reach no conclusion whatsoever. Any tips on how to deal with that ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I must work with a lot of people who take your advice. They are constantly justifying how their decisions and reactions aren't wrong. Thinking we are right all of the time is the key to acknowledging we are perfect just the way we are. I wish I understood why this frustrates me so much...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be wary of any neuroscientific &quot;explanation&quot; that relies on hemisphere specialization (which is simply out-dated). Also, it's an impossible leap to generalize findings in split-brain studies to average people with a connected, parallel-processing brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure what you say is valid, but I don't think it matters.  I don't think OP is looking for a scientific <strong>TRUTH</strong> (what I wrote is surely not rigorously written enough to reach that standard anyway), but rather something that would empower him.  </p>
<p>Whether philosophical; psychological; neurological; historical; etc., any explanation involving our emotions and thinking is necessarily incomplete.  However, that doesn't need to stop us from working with what we got.  On the court of the game of life, the explanation I provided offers a sufficient place to stand and provides something anyone can work with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is never a &quot;true&quot; explanation in the strict sense of the word.</p>
<p>Workable/adaptive explanations for your private events (thoughts/emotions/memories) are nice to strive for though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That can also occur as a way to stop seizures. The corpus callosum, or connection between the hemispheres, gets cut by surgeons so that the electrical storm won't get to the other side of the brain, and what you were talking about occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people could see things on the side that the other half of their brain couldn't so you could present a written instruction on the right periphery and the left brain would remain unaware of it for example. Definitely double check that though. </p></div>		</li>
