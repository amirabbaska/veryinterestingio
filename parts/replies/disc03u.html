			<div class="markdown"><p>Question, is this a theory, or is this a proven fact?</p>
<p>Because I can very easily recall all type of scents and tastes, and they're very nuanced in my head. But ask me about the specifics of a certain sound, and it's way more difficult for me.</p>
<p>So I'm inclined to want some sources on this before I accept it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flavor chemist here, I would say mostly theory and poor at that.  There are certainly characterizing compounds that tell you what things are.  Coffee is Mercaptan, cherry is Benzaldehyde.  Yes there are other compounds but those tell you freshness or rot.  The reason you KNOW someone is baking cookies and that makes you feel good is because you have eaten cookies and the smell is unquestionable.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it is true that olfaction does not lend itself to the type of analysis into primitive sensations that other senses do.
For example, visual experience can be reduced down to primary visual sensations of brightness and color.<br />
Auditory experience can be reduced to primary auditory sensations of loudness and pitch.<br />
Taste experience can be reduced down to primary tastes of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami.<br />
Touch experience can be reduced to primary touch sensations of pressure and movement.<br />
Olfaction just doesn't lend itself to identifying some finite list of primary smell sensations.<br />
Now, whether or not this is important to answering OPs question, or whether even the ideas of primary sensations is even relevant to understanding how perception occurs is entirely different issue, and thus is still very theoretical. Keep in mind, your question about &quot;theory or proven fact&quot; is ill-formed for science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't the question become the dimensionality of the senses? Color receptors sense wavelength and intensity. Auditory receptors also sense wavelength and intensity.</p>
<p>I'd cough a little at saying taste can be reduced to 5 primary tastes - they're artificial categories. If olfaction got the same attention that taste did then I'm sure somebody could come up with whatever arbitrary categories to split them up, too (just as Myers-Briggs did for personality types). You could come up with ways to map color and auditory perceptions onto some kind of Cartesian coordinate system but olfaction and taste don't have clear dimensionality to map the experience onto, so people have to make up artificial classes to group them into.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How about the question, your &quot;theory&quot; (opinion) or theory with actual sources? They weren't provided originally; now that a very weak source was provided (very limited summary of Linda Buck and Richard Axel), they superficially seem to contradict this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Olfaction just doesn't lend itself to identifying some finite list of primary smell sensations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2004/illpres/6_codes.html" target="_blank">This page</a> seems to imply olfactory receptions are, to a degree, synthesized into categories of smells by the mind that can be recombined in a way that can be used to describe other smells. </p>
<p>Now not having access to their original work or other papers, I don't know for sure what the assertions being made are, but I'll rephrase &quot;is that your theory or a fact?&quot; to &quot;is that your opinion or an actual theory with empirical evidence?&quot; until it's sourced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be fair to say that language probably plays a big role in this? Like, the sensory inputs you mentioned that are easy to remember (colors) have words that correspond relatively specifically to a physical property, whereas we don't have such specific descriptors for complex bouquets of smell or taste. Like, to use OP's example, I can pretty easily  describe Ramen as &quot;a bowl of noodles and broth and other ingredients&quot; but I can't be nearly so precise with the smell or taste... it's savory? Or salty and rich? I don't know. Maybe this is also why sommeliers have such a reputation. In summary do you think language might actually play a role here?</p></div>		</li>
