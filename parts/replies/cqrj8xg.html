			<div class="markdown"><p>One other point about the flags on the moon is that by now they're most likely completely white. Any cloth will fade with exposure to sunlight, and since there's no atmosphere to protect them from the UV rays, all the colour in the flags would have faded by now. If you attached a banner to a spacecraft it would suffer the same effect. Someone smarter than me could probably figure out how fast it would fade, but in any case it'd need to be replaced after a while.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I suppose the better question is, &quot;is there any material that doesn't bleach in space?&quot; Even if they painted a flag on metal it would still be the paint that bleaches. What kind of material could be used to color a flag that wouldn't suffer the same bleach fate? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;bleaching&quot; is just the molecule decomposing. There is no &quot;rule&quot; requiring it to decompose to something white, except that colored molecules are more rare than no-color.</p>
<p>Just find a molecule that is stable enough that UV doesn't have the energy to decompose it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those minerals are generally what paints are colored with. Sun eventually oxidizes them so they turn white. This brings up an interesting point though: the funny thing about oxidizing, is it requires oxygen, so maybe it wouldn't happen in space? </p>
<p>edit: just learned that sun bleaching is different from regular bleaching. durrr.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>serious question: is the lunar landing site visible from earth using commercially available telescopes? If so, why isn't this commonly used as evidence that the landing occurred? If not, why? Is there some feature of geography that obscures it from earth?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it isn't visible.  However there are several pieces of absolutely definitive evidence.  The first is the hundreds of kilograms of material brought back from the moon.  The second is that the astronauts set up retroreflectors on the moon that anyone with the right equipment can bounce lasers off of.  These are used to accurately measure the distance to the moon and show that it is slowly receeding from the Earth by a few centimeters a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the lunar vehicles are not visible from the Earth's surface using current telescopes.  The problem is not geography; all of the landing sites are on the lunar near side, and none are close to the limb as seen from Earth.  The problem instead is the physics of light.  Light diffracts around any obstacle, including the aperture of a telescope, and this limits the achievable resolution.  The largest optical telescopes have apertures of about 10 m.  Using 500 nm blue-green light, the best achievable angular resolution by a 10 m telescope is about 0.01&quot;, from the Rayleigh criterion.  At the distance of the Moon, this corresponds to an object size of over 20 m; the lunar landers and such are more like 2 m in diameter.  Smaller objects than this can be seen, but only if they are significantly brighter than the background, and then only as points of light.  </p>
<p>Short answer is that we'd need telescopes more than ten times larger than any currently built in order to have a chance at seeing the lunar landers from Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>great answer, thanks. Its hard to imagine that we can see the beautiful details of distant stars and nebula, but we can't see a lander on the Moon  even when we know right where it is - but it just goes to show how massive and bright those objects must be in relation to our normal frame of reference</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, absolutely not. It's way too small to be visible through telescopes, even the Hubble. The only thing that can kinda sorta see them is the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter going around the Moon.</p>
<p>However, one of the things they placed on the Moon are <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/ALSEP_AS14-67-9386.jpg/768px-ALSEP_AS14-67-9386.jpg" target="_blank">laser reflector plates</a>. If you aim a laser precisely at one of those plates, you can get the reflection back and time the speed of light. This is out of reach for the private citizen, but universities around the world can do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it out of reach? </p>
<p>Strength of laser required or the quality/expense of the equipment needed to collect/measure the results? The trajectory/coordinates (?proper term?) you'd need to hit the plate should be publicly available information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Apollo &quot;hoax&quot; is one of the dumbest conspiracies out there.  If America had faked the landing and made such a public display of it, the Soviets would have called BS the very next day.  And later the reds would have sent a probe to the moon to disprove it directly.  They had the technology and the motive; there's no way they would have kept silent.</p></div>		</li>
