			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a suggestion from a dental professional, don’t use charcoal toothpaste or any CHARCOAL paste on your teeth. It’s like scrubbing your teeth leaving them microscopically jagged by basically exfoliating your enamel away. Yes, in the short run it will whiten, but with continuous use I give it two years and your teeth will look yellow from scraping all that enamel away up to the dentin, your second layer of your teeth which is naturally a bit yellow. Your enamel also doesn’t grown back like your skin does.</p>
<p>Edit: meant any charcoal paste, regular paste should be coarse like charcoal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The natural color of your teeth isn't white so don't feel insecure. White teeth is a marketing product like makeup, red santa and so many things. If your teeth are just a bit light brown this is perfectly normal. </p>
<p>If they start going for a darker color go to your dentist so he can clean them. Avoid soda or drinking too much tea/coffee as this stain your teeth and you'll be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your best bet would be to pay more for whitening from the dentist. you should get the proper methods along with a check up if it's even ok for your particular mouth.</p>
<p>In order to whiten your teeth you need certain chemicals. Whitening toothpaste is usually more of a polish that get's rid of surface level stains. Talk with a dentist or hygienist for your individual options.</p>
<p>Don't smoke. Drink water often with staining foods and beverages. and brush and floss at least once a day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>...or <em>any</em> paste? Then why do some dentists seem to advocate using toothpaste?</p>
<p>And if not toothpaste, then what? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard from my dentist and a few other people that using the charcoal to clean teeth is really bad. It scraps away enamel and leaves teeth pours and more susceptible to infection. But I️’m not a density, so dunno. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what my dentist told me about regular whitening toothpaste as well. It's just an abrasive that scrapes your enamel away. They'll be whiter in the short term but you're doing long term damage to your teeth if you use it all the time. It's actually super hard to find toothpaste these days WITHOUT whitening in it annoyingly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sells better cause people want whiter teeth. Same thing with toothbrushes. You should always be using a soft brush but the average person will think &quot;harder brush = cleaner teeth!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
