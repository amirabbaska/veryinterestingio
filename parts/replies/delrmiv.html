			<div class="markdown"><p>So, imagine a beacon, pulsing with light.</p>
<p>There is a point in time at which, the light pulse (and every subsequent one) emitted from that beacon will never reach us.</p>
<p>However, the light pulse just before that one, will reach us over a very very long time. This happens since the light will be red-shifted.</p>
<p>But this time is finite, isn't it?</p>
<p>I mean, the pulse of light which will be arbitrarily <em>but finitely</em> red-shifted.</p>
<p>Now if we go to a continues look, a wave front of light emitted from the object slightly closer and closer to the cutoff point will arrive after larger and larger time intervals.</p>
<p>There is a wave front which will be emitted that will always stay the same distance to us as when it was emitted.</p>
<p>However, since light is quantized, I feel it will eventually, in a finite time, run out and the object will completely disappear...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that because the wave has a wavelength and that wave expands with space forever, the wave will be infinitely red shifted. I get where you are going with light being quantized as some photons will be closer to us than the universe is expanding at the speed of light and thus reach us within some finite time, some will be at the exact distance that space is expading at the speed of light and thus it will have a fixed relative distance and some will be further away and thus will be moving away from us.<br />
If you want it to make sense that it doesn't run out, think of the quantized light as a steady stream of particles. As the distance between them is stretched the time between each one hitting us goes towards infinity and each one will be ever more redshifted. Then at some point the time between each photon being observed at our location is greater than the lifetime of the universe (however it dies) but there is always one on the way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think that time is finite. Since the red-shift goes towards infinity, the length of the pulse as seen by us also goes towards infinity.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Tell me more :)</p>
<p>In a truly continuous look, you can keep reducing the time window and still have non-zero total photons emitted during that window.</p>
<p>But if you were talking about a discrete look then you can't have photons be emitted arbitrarily close to the cut off time/distance.</p>
<p>At least, that's how I see things.</p>
<p>So the question then is, is the situation continuous or discrete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 1 every 5 years. Estimate: use the Hubble radius (4.1 Gpc) to find the surface area of the Hubble horizon, multiply by the speed of light, divide by the galaxy density (about 0.01/cubic Mpc).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 / (((4.1 gigaParsec)^2) <em> 4 </em> c * (0.01 / (cubic megaParsec))) =
4.85 years</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the 0.01 / Mpc^3 number is for decent sized galaxies; it might be more if you include dwarf galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a much lower number that I would have guessed.  We get told all the time about the enormous size of the observable universe, and suddenly here we get a figure that we could count out in slow human time.</p>
<p>If anything, the five-year figure is even more amazing because of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>0.01 is a number for large galaxies. I would use a number closer to 1/mpc. Also galaxies were denser earlier and have been spreading out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to be careful when you start talking about things on this scale. Your question seems to be presupposing there is a universal &quot;now&quot;. But there isn't. I kind of get with the questions asking. But I'd have to carefully constructed the question first to know if the question even makes sense. </p>
<p>For example: The popular notion that light reaching us now from distant stars could be coming from stars that died long ago, simply isn't true. When the light reaches you that is the &quot;now&quot; of the star. Its &quot;present state&quot; is EXACTLY what you see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get it but nah. I don't remember the term for this, but when people say &quot;now&quot;, they generally mean the instant of our proper time, i.e. a horizontal line on the time-space coordinate grid. Your &quot;now&quot; is on our light cone.</p></div>		</li>
