			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard in my highschool psych that one of the main theories is that it helped or ancestors learn what was and wasn't dangerous.  If a group of people all want to do something because it would make life easier, but there is a high price for failure, a small subset of them will have less impulse control and will heed the call. They are the guinea pigs that let us know if it is a risk worth considering or not.</p></div>		</li>
