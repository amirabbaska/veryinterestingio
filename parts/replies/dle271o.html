My wife and I will be travelling from Lawrence to St. Joe that day to see it. Best of luck convincing your wife.</p>
<p>EDIT: 64501 is a zipcode for St. Joe that you can plug in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man. I love Vox. I didn’t even know this article / interactive was available but I remember watching their video on it. They have the best YouTube videos. I learn a ton of things about it, things I didn’t even realize I cared about! Thanks for the share. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the Nasa guys in the IamA thread, the difference between 99% and 100% is the difference between night and day. The brightness change if not in totality is like the difference between a noonday sun and the afternoon sun, and you won't notice the change because it's fast enough that your eyes will adjust at the same speed the light dims.</p>
<p>However, you can still have fun with the eclipse. Get a piece of paper and poke a hole in it, hold it above clear ground so you can see the shadow of the sun through the hole, and you'll see the shape of the eclipse at that moment, although mirrored (mirrored for the same reason a camera takes an upside down picture: the small shutter hole).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an awesome idea! I'll be around 90% and was bummed I couldn't make a day trip to the 100 zone, but I'll definitely be doing the paper trick- thanks for the tip :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why so many people have no idea how awesome totality is. They have all seen partial eclipses this way before - tiny black disc moving over tiny white disc, big freaking deal. They think that totality will be the same. And that is exactly what they will see of totality on TV - telescopic view of big black disc moving over big white disc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out here they're predicting gridlock traffic for 3 days prior and 3 days after. I don't have a week of vacation to use for a 3 minute event, as cool as it would be. 98% in my area though. Not good enough, but ohwell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>98% coverage might as well be totality. You'd still see a corona effect at that percentage, I would think.  </p>
<p>I'll only get 84% where I live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Almost got convinced to go to Carbondale (Illinois college town close to greatest duration spot), but refused because of expected traffic. Then I learned that Ozzy Ozbourne will be playing during the eclipse in Carbondale. Now I'm really not going anywhere near that place. Their regular population is under 30k, they're going to get swamped twice over.</p>
<p><em>edit: accidently PSA, I guess. If you plan to go to Carbondale, I read that the authorities are preparing for a disaster level event due to the expected traffic and population.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the warning. We (the tour group) have reserved a semi-private space with the astronomy department at the university.<br />
I doubt Ozzy will be that close by. Although, I could go for some <em>War Pigs</em> during totality. </p></div>		</li>
