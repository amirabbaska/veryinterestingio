			<div class="markdown"><p>From a physics stand point I believe the idea here is that if semen were to travel in a stream the first would have the greatest acceleration and velocity, maintaining that rate for short period, with a resultant downward curve in terms of acceleration and resultant velocity/distance traveled. The spurts are an evolutionary advantage in that each group (spurt) of sperm are released with a similar chance to fertilize an egg.This is advantageous because, as noted, sperm in different spurts have been found to have varying pH and levels of viability:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll add that it's been found that each of the spurts of semen has a slightly different chemical makeup. The earlier ones are more acidic, the later ones more alkaline, and the middle ones closer to PH neutral.
It's been hypothesized that this pattern helps the earlier semen to kill any semen left over in the vagina from a previous sexual partner, whereas the later ones serve as protection from a potential later partner's acidic sperm. The middle ones are the most viable.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect the efficacy of a given ejaculate is partially influenced by the peak force with which it is propelled towards the cervix. It is energetically demanding and probably provides no benefit for the entire volume of semen to be expelled at the 'peak force'. Therefore a system has evolved which ejaculates in spurts rather than streams.</p>
<p>By comparison organisms are selected to expel urine more quickly as well as energy efficiently. Thus there is pressure to select for a stable rate of micturition rather than wasting energy on peak flow rate.</p></div>		</li>
