			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, the vein that goes through the belly button carries oxygenated blood directly to the liver, some of it is split off and heads towards the heart. Usually arteries carry oxygenated blood and veins carry deoxygenated blood. But really it's veins go towards the heart and arteries away, so it's the opposite in this case(the other exception are the pulmonary arteries which carry the deoxygenated blood out of the heart directly to the lungs to get oxygen). Have you ever seen a diagram of the liver with those ligaments splitting it up? Some of that is what's left over from that vein. </p></div>		</li>
