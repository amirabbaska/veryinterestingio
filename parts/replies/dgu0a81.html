<p>This is obviously handy for medicine and engineering, but not very useful for taking photographs with them.</p>

<p>My late grandfather was a radiologist and he used the equipment for his &quot;art&quot; as well. Of course the medium places certain restrictions for the subject matter; he mostly shot flowers, if I recall correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a quick <a href="http://imgur.com/a/z6iFn" target="_blank">photo</a> of one I have on the wall. I wanted to make a post with proper scans, but I couldn't find the box where I keep the rest of the pictures. Gotta save that for another day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: the way most medical x-rays are used is essentially like shining a flashlight onto a large piece of film (or, a large digital sensor these days.) If something is between the flashlight and the film/sensor, it will casts a shadow which is then be recorded. </p>
<p>X-rays easily penetrate most flesh, but are better blocked by denser materials like bones and teeth. The x-ray images you see are the shadows of those bones. </p>
<p>If you were making a shadow puppet show with the visible light from a regular flashlight, the closer your hand was to the flashlight, the larger it's shadow would appear on the wall, but you may also end up with fuzzier edges to the shadow you make. </p>
<p>For this reason, in medical x-rays, it is best for you to have your hand as close to the film/sensor as possible, making for the sharpest images. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When using a radioactive source, we use a tungsten block with a barrel to essentially &quot;aim&quot; the radiation at whatever it is. But it's more of a way of keeping the radiation from going every where else but the thing we are X-raying.   </p>
