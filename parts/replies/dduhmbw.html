			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a scene in Sucker Punch in which a 20 year old woman consents to having sex with a man after some discussion of it. No nudity (just a reasonably revealing outfit), consensual, and the scene doesn't go further than kissing. Her consent is important in the context of the plot and her character arc.</p>
<p>MPAA threatened to stamp the movie with R unless it's re-edited into a... <em>non</em>-consensual scene of this man forcing himself on this woman. That's right - the original consensual scene would be R, the rape would be PG-13.</p>
<p>Zack Snyder ended up removing the scene altogether instead of butchering it like that. Unfortunately, it's also a very important scene, plot-wise. It resolves a major part of the plot and additionally subverts certain expectations that were built up throughout the movie.</p>
<p>It's available in the director's cut, for anyone interested. Director's cut is significantly better, overall.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://youtu.be/TBYNOxLVj5Y?t=1m34s" target="_blank"><strong>here is the scene</strong></a>, starting from 1:33. Obviously, MAJOR spoilers. Judge for yourself how horrible and R-deserving it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the time of the release, the biggest talk point was whether the movie is feminist, because it's pretty much a &quot;girl power&quot; story, even if it never explicitly shows so &quot;in your face&quot;; or misogynist, because the heroines look <a href="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Sucker_Punch_image-36.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a> (context: most of the movie takes place in a burlesque club slash brothel)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  clicked on this to see if this movie was mentioned.  This answers a lot of questions about the MPAA as well as raises a lot of others.  </p>
<p>Another point of interest that the movie mentioned was that you could not bring up another movie as an example of something that was acceptable for a rating when their movie was not.  Just a lot of double standards and arbitrary rules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is essentially their problem. They implicitly have criteria via their decisions or have secret criteria, e.g. the sexual use of &quot;fuck&quot; leading to an &quot;R&quot;, but don't want to publish their criteria, I suspect because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it would be possible for sick fuck filmmakers to evade their intent and release a child-damaging PG movie by coming up with something the criteria didn't anticipate but is clearly disturbing</li>
<li>they will be inconsistent inadvertently and embarrass themselves or get sued</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the better way is to publish principles rather than rules with an allowance to break those rules for each rating. That would let parents and filmmakers know what they care about. Also publish a paragraph on their thinking each time. Then take that leeway to allow movies with artistic merit to get lower ratings and fucked up movies that are hard to pin down why get higher ratings. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's is why there are judges in the first place and not a bunch of clerks. They can both publish the criteria and still stop filmmakers to evade their intents. Just like how the laws in published. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs more attention, and is the correct answer. Watch the documentary, it's very eye opening in terms of how non-transparent the MPAA operates, and how they &quot;shape&quot; society.
I also believe it also calls out how much the Academy Award's choice for picture of the year is nonsense. I stopped watching the Oscar's when I saw this. It's all BS.</p></div>		</li>
