<p>While that's not easy, it's theoretically doable and doesn't require changing the definition of Avogadro's Number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually HAVE changed the definition, in the 70s. It's now &quot;Avogadro's Constant&quot; not &quot;Number,&quot; and has been abstracted from the measurement. It was just too pointless to keep refining the value of the number when it was more important for calculations to be consistent.</p></div>		</li>
