			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I tried to write about this in detail in our New York Times oped, but basically the factors that affected the clock movement were:  new and disturbing language and proposals by incoming President Trump related to nuclear weapons and their possible use, enlarging the US arsenal etc, Sabre rattling from the President of Russia, North Korea efforts to launch ICBMs, and consistently ignoring of science data related to climate change by the incoming administration and republicans in Congress.  Moving by 30 seconds was done because it is too early in the administration to see how many words will be translated into actions.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would I be accurate in stating that the process is essentially a vote-esque system by the board(s) of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists ? Does anyone have the authority to call the vote ? </p>
<p>*I apologise for imposing additional questions if an article on this matter is to be published soon/has been published.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed one: the firing of Thomas Countryman, a nonpartisan career diplomat who has served under Presidents of both parties, from his post as the Assistant Secretary of State for <strong>International Security and Nonproliferation.</strong></p>
<p>Like his crazy tweets, it's just a signal and not a clear policy direction, but it's one of many that suggest the Trump administration is serious about the inevitability of World War III.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am curious about this but more so, if we are constantly destroying earth with pollution and global climate change don't we need another kind of &quot;clock&quot; to estimate how long earth will remain inhabitable at the current rate of destruction?</p>
<p>A clock that we would change according to how many years we have left of the necessary resources to support the human species and the state of our environment might help deter such earth threatening pollution in the same way the doomsday clock helps people put into perspective how close we are to a nuclear apocalyptic event, would it not? One that isn't hypothetical but inevitable?</p>
<p>I personally think there is no true way to gauge how close we are to that inevitable day a nuclear barrage of weapons destroys us all, but as irrational and compulsive humans are I don't see a scenario where anyone would be aware of it before it happened. It would just happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The clock has always been an icon to try to alert the world to possible existential threats, and to encourage the public to exert pressure on their leaders to address these.  There have been many proposals for several clocks etc, but in the end The Bulletin has decided to maintain its iconic clock, that has been used for 70 years now, as a beacon, allowing us to then issue statements about the various important issues that need to be addressed.  As new technologies come online, we take these into account as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>We just put an ugly collection of personality disorders stitched together into a person in charge of a military larger than the next ten combined and enough nukes to easily destroy civilization many times over. The idea that this isn't a good reason to suspect we all might die soon as result is myopic nonsense. If there is another 9/11 the middle east will be turned into glass as the start of the end. This is not a joke or game. Realistically it seems the most likely end to this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh good sir, I in no way meant to sound like I didn't think we were close to &quot;doomsday&quot; so to speak. Especially because of the reason you mention. I meant to say that despite how close or far we are at any point we're at 24 hours to midnight as well as 2 minutes because people are so impulsive, even if we had someone who was the opposite of Trump in the office it'd be the same. Truly unpredictable but almost inevitable.
.
But in all honesty... I have the feeling that we're all going to be really fked really soon... So just accept it and surrender because there's nothing we can do anymore. It's already too late... Always has been .. always will be.. too late...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading about the doomsday clock. I am a bit curious about that myself. Is it now just a doomsday clock instead of noting how close we are in Nuclear Annihilation? What brought that change?</p></div>		</li>
