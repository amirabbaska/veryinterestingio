			<div class="markdown"><p>When I had heat exhaustion once, I collapsed in the field (farming). I'd stopped sweating and I could hardly get to my feet. My dad was with me and brought me home.  I ate a teaspoon of salt, drank a big glass of water, and ate 3 peanut butter and banana sandwiches.  I went from almost paralyzed to able to get back in the field in 30 minutes.  It's all about the sodium and potassium.</p>
<p>My grandmother had an uncle that died while farming because he drank too much after getting heat exhaustion.  She always said it was because the water was cold and you have to drink slow.  I learned later that it was water intoxication but, either way, it was drilled into me that you don't drink too much plain water if you've stopped sweating.</p></div>		</li>
