<p>Yeah, same here. I'm pretty confident that I have Delayed sleep phase disorder (some times called offset circadian rhythm) and I have no idea what to do, or what a real sleep study would reveal. Ambien is a real motherfucker so I don't want to get dependent on it.</p>
<p>My solution was get a job where I can work at 11 AM... Nothing else has ever worked for me. I could go to bed at 10PM with absolutely no distractions in a black room, and just lay there awake till 2:30AM before naturally falling asleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about changing your routine by waking up earlier? Usually that’s how I’ve adjusted my schedule. It’s not foolproof but it has helped.</p>
<p>And yes Ambien is indeed a real motherfucker.</p></div>		</li>
