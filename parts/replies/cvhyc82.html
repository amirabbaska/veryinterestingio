			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, a simple answer that you may be looking for is this, pre humans australopithecines type humanoids developed the ability to create fire. That ancestor started to use fire to cook meat. Cooked meat is prossseced in our body easier than raw meat. Less energy is spent digesting foods. Our brain uses a lot of energy. Therefore, the energy used to process food is reduced and it allowed our brains to grow bigger. This caused issues with birth which lead to walking up right, big heads can't pop out of something on all fours as easy. Essentially, processing food better gave our brains more energy. I'm sorry, day drinking, but there are docs on this somewhere on the webs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>At what point do they stop being animals and become people? I feel like our ancestors, when challenged with this, must have somehow known that it wouldn't work and either bred with or killed all substantially similar creatures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, we just out-competed them for food and a few human women may or may not have been raped by Neanderthals. Humans and other Homo sapiens filled the same biological niche, so as we filled it up there wasn't space for any other species. It's why there aren't like, 60 different kinds of lion in Africa. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also scary to consider that we are unique in our sense of destruction. It means that were far more unstable than we might hope but it also brings hope in that hopefully other beings in the universe aren't as hostile as us so they haven't wipes themselves out. </p>
<p>Now that I think about it, the universe can also be a huge ecosystem where the aggressive ones wiped out all the rest. </p>

We're probably the only species capable of killing off other species to extinction as long as it happens in a place where the species naturally evolved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A neat thing about Cat's Cradle is the hidden meanings behind a lot of different things. I've started my thesis on that book about the inclusion secret or double meanings. Take for example Mona Aamons Monzano, if you take the name Mona out of all three of her names you're left with an anagram for Azons. Which happen to be remotely controlled aerial bombs, which is a massive subplot in the book. Lots of cool things going on in Vonnegut's literature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually think dolphins might be capable of asking why but also incapable of doing much about it. No ability to manipulate object and sounds to express themselves. </p>
<p>We know that dolphins are one of the very few creatures that have names for each other. That shows a huge amount of intelligence. Enough that they may have asked several why questions. The issue is finding a common language it seems.</p>
<p>But if this is true it means that dolphins that help humans out are doing so on purpose. And that if you're drowning near a group of dolphins you've met a group of racist dolphins lol. I'm not trying to start a race war, my dad is human and my best friends are humans as well, but I think dolphins don't always like us.</p></div>		</li>
