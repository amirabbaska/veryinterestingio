			<div class="markdown"><p>And to anyone to whom this sounds like conspiracy, you really should read the book mentioned above, Manufacturing Consent. </p>
<p>It details, with extensive (and i do mean extensive) examples and proofs, why mass media as it exists today <em>necessarily</em> must reinforce the status quo, just because of the way the system is set up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That still raises the question of why other countries aren't also doing the same thing. You can say that billionaires and boards of directors don't want certain things being asked, but how do the BBC get away with it then when they're asking tough questions to the UK's prime minister who is in charge of their funding? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/azfNPez_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=high" target="_blank">Ironic</a> that a founding principle of a free press gets suppressed by the money making machine of 24/7 cable news channels. </p>
<p>One day's worth of news can't exceed a few hours or so, but we just <em>have</em> to have talking heads think for us, specifically the stupidity of CNN and the cavemen fear mongering of Fox. Idk if they're the cause to spineless reporting, but they still sensationalize current events, and hurt us, the people, the ones meant to benefit from freedom of the press, lol Murica. Love this place, but the BBC is where I get my news. Also check out Democracy Now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The USA has free speech enshrined in the constitution, but there's a consistent pattern of behaviour which has the net effect of censoring the truth from the people. Crazy! If the USA cared anywhere as much about the freedom of the press as it did about the right to bear arms, it would have a well informed electorate. </p>
<p>You can't have a true democracy unless the general public have some idea of the truth. Otherwise you have elections but no democracy. Plenty of countries do that, but I don't think the USA should be one of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a delicate balance during the interview between the reporter and the politician. The reporter wants to get paid for doing the interview, and also get the recognition of working with famous politicians. The politician wants a story that makes them look good in order to help their causes and agenda.</p>
<p>The politician has more power than the reporter, though. If a reporter stops playing nice then that reporter will get 1 story before being replaced by a different reporter who is more likely to play nice. Unless that story is big enough to bring down the politician or about a major public issue it really isn't worth the hassle.</p>
<p>Also, with <em>most</em> politicians the 'false statement' is often just a mistake or a bit of poor writing by who-ever prepared the speech. Reporters know this and will forgive/forget to some degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how do we tell and reward media outlets that do this?  Surely Detroit's Leduff (sp) is popular for hard hitting reporting.  How do we get him interviewing the prez?   </p>
<p>Honestly the recent guy to call the prez the source of 'fake news' needs his own show by now.</p></div>		</li>
