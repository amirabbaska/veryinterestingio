			<div class="markdown"><p>The <em>simple</em> answer is <strong>no</strong>. </p>
<p>Taking our Moon as an example, there is simply no stable orbit that a tiny moon ^(like Deimos or something) could have around the Moon. It either breaks up because of tidal forces, gets dominated by Earth's gravity, or it's quickly ejected because of n-body physics doing funky stuff. ^(this is why we don't have any old satellites in a Moon orbit, they require frequent active orbit keeping)</p>
<p>On other Moon examples this gets worse, because the mass-ratio of planet-moon tends to be way higher. The Moon is fairly large compared to Earths mass, and most moons are much smaller relatively. Examples are the relatively tiny moons around Mars and Jupiter. <del>For Jupiter, the SOI could conceivably lie within a moons surface, but I'd have to do the math to be sure.</del>^1</p>
<p>However:</p>
<p>The slightly harder answer is <strong>&quot;no, but yes&quot;</strong>. If you use an increasingly large moon and/or in an increasingly high orbit around its planet, you'll eventually get into a range where you could put something in a stable orbit around that moon, without having it break up, be in the planets SoI, or get ejected. No such configuration exists in our Solar System as far as I'm aware (could be wrong), but it's certainly possible.</p>
<p>Edit ^1. ^(Should've done the math first. This is never the case, because it would break up the moon)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is the system of the moon orbiting Earth orbiting the sun (which does exist and is stable) different from a mini-moon orbiting a moon orbiting a planet?</p>
<p>I understand that the ratios of distances and masses between the planets and Sun are different from those of planets and their moons.  Is this the difference - stars are just much bigger than planets?</p>
<p>Or is it that it'sâ€‹ the three-level system, with Sun-planet-moon which is stable, and a 4-level system is not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the so-called &quot;frozen orbits&quot;? An object in low lunar orbit at 27, 50, 76, or 86 degrees can stay in orbit indefinitely. </p>
<p>Now, getting a natural object into one of those orbits is incredibly unlikely, but it's theoretically possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm genuinely unsure also.  Also, the examples show the earth and moon, and I understand the basic formula would stay the same, but would it possible for a different planet?  Say a super Jupiter?  Interesting topic!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this assume that the orbit of the sun moon passes between Earth and the Moon?
Is it possible for the submoon to orbit the Moon---frig what's the right way to say describe the relationship?---so that the plane of the orbit is tangential? to the Moon's orbit? I.e. So that from our perspective, we'd look up and see the submoon circling around the Moon like it was all 2D. Could that orbit be stable in that the Earth's gravity would be, if not equal, at least balanced?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what you're asking is, could submoon have an orbit perpendicular to the orbit of the moon around its host planet? </p>
<p>My incomplete knowledge says that.. Yes, it could happen. It would be very unlikely since orbits tend to be on the same plane. It would be just as unstable as any other orbit in that zone due to wobbling gravity from the host planet. It would eventually shift into a different orbit around the planet, crash into the planet, crash into the moon or drift into space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you're describing a polar orbit around the Moon - so named because the submoon's orbit would take it above both of the lunar poles. The thing is, submoon would still pass between Earth and the Moon sometimes.</p>
<p>If you can imagine submoon's whole orbit being visible, there may be a point when you could look up and see it looking like a halo around the Moon (thus, the plane of submoon's orbit is tangential to the Moon's orbit). However, a week later, the Moon will have revolved a quarter of the way around the Earth, while submoon's orbit stays in the same plane. That means that submoon's orbit now looks like a vertical line cutting across the front of the Moon, rather than a halo around it. This relative rotation of submoon's orbital plane (from the perspective of an Earthbound observer) would be very similar to the workings of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum" target="_blank">Foucault Pendulum</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That wouldn't work because, as the moon orbited, the sub-moon's orbit would not stay that way. The sub-moon's orbit will maintain it's plane of motion as it travels around the earth. Let's say that you start off with the sub-moon in a polar orbit, appearing to orbit vertically around the moon (like looking at a top-down picture of the solar system). One week later, when the moon is a quarter of the way through its orbit, we would see the sub-moon orbiting edge-on. One week later it would look like it started and a week later it would be edge-on again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok thanks! That's kind of what I was wondering... whether it would be possible for the sub-moon's orbit to be &quot;tidally locked&quot; as it were so that it stayed facing the Earth the way the Moon does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand your math but thinking earth-moon-moon, is the difference between this and sun-earth-moon the density and or size of the objects? If so, does that make Jupiter a better candidate for moon moons? Like an object orbiting an object that is orbiting something else is something that happens all the time. </p></div>		</li>
