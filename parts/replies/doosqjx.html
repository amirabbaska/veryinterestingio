			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect example of this is my home setup - likely a pretty common one, at that. Basically, I'm forced to use the ISP's modem/router to convert from the coaxial coming in from the fiber box into Ethernet, but while the Ethernet on it is good, the Wi-Fi sucks, and I need good Wi-Fi. Hence, I set the ISP's modem to bridge mode, connect my own, better router, and connect everything else to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even better - buy your own $40 modem (if your network supports it) and do away with the $5.95/month modem rental fees.  You don't have to worry about sending it back when you move which is also handy.  And of course argue about any $50 or $100 &quot;installation&quot; charges - you can do that yourself in 5 minutes on the phone with their tech support, assuming the building/room you're installing to has a recent cable pull.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably may know but make sure the modem you received is capable of handling the speed you receive and can properly relay it. It's been ages ago when I worked at a call center. If you had a dumbfuck on the other side of the line he would send you a modem, though an old version since they were modem-only, which weren't able to deal with the internet speeds we deliver.</p>
<p>Always fun when the client would call in later asking why his internet is slow like fuck. If you were really lucky you had a second dumbfuck who would tell you that the ISP doesn't support home routers and that it's the router problem. Someone with a bit of brains could tell by the firmware being pushed what type of modem was hooked on the line but unfortunately brains wasn't mandatory to work there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually, many ISPs do force you to use their router. </p>
<p>My ISP won't give me the PPPoE password and their router doesn't come with a bridge mode. So what I ended up doing was putting my router in the DMZ of their router and everything works just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have FiOS (well, Frontier), and I have Unifi’s in my home because I had their router plus their hardline network extended, and they still had no range. I believe you still need their modem or else you can’t get the guide+DVR on the tv or something like that, but I could be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to nitpick, but the Wi-Fi bridge does the same. It connects two different interfaces. Like.. Modem to router.. Or Wi-Fi access point to wired network.</p>
<p>A bridge just... Bridges those two different networks. While a ROUTER routes things from one network to another. Similar, in a way, but not exactly. Routers are used when different networks need to talk to each other, while bridges are used when diffefent networks need to appear as one network.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd want the &quot;router&quot; that isn't directly connected to your modem/ISP to be set to &quot;access-point&quot; mode if it has one.  That mode should just allow wireless access without performing any routing functions.</p>
<p>If you put both of them into &quot;wireless bridge&quot; mode (or one in &quot;wireless client&quot; mode), then they would connect to each other via the wireless radios to form a bridge between the two wired networks.</p>
<p>When dealing with home networking devices though, it is really hard to make generalizations because the manufacturers often use terms loosely, or completely make up their own terms/definitions.  It isn't as clear-cut as it is with enterprise networking gear.  I find it ironic because they do that in an effort to &quot;simplify&quot; things, when it really just makes it more confusing since there is no consistency across different makes/models.</p></div>		</li>
