<p>There's a kind of parasitic slave making ant where the slaves sometimes revolt against the leaders and eat their young. Interestingly, in harsh environments the more docile subjugated ant <del>actually benefit</del> <em>take such little negative effects</em> that they don't end up revolting because they'd <del>be without protection</del> <em>too costly to fight back</em> so it works more like a one sided symbiosis leading to something called &quot;inquilinism&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a &quot;symbiosis&quot; cannot evolve - there is absolutely zero advantage to the slave ant in having &quot;protection&quot; if it never reproduces. Slave ants do everything they do because the slaver has the upperhand, and revolt when that subjugation fails. The only evolutionary reason to not revolt is to allow a better revolt later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a small research project on social parasitism so I can try to explain some of your questions. Social parasites absolutely apply pheromone based trickery, the actual process though depends on the type of social parasite we are talking about(which there are a few). In ants though most if not all social parasites follow &quot;Emery's Rule&quot;  which basically says the parasites are genetically closely related to there hosts. Begin closely related allows the parasites to have a similar pheromone make up, with obvious pressure to be as close as possible, they also can share dietary needs. As mentioned below social parasites will acquire the nest scent of there host colony to blend in though passive means or by killing a worker host ant and using its scent. Some are actually able to re-synthesize their original scent to match that of the host nest! </p>
<p>I can add a little more detail if your curious, but people who know more about the subject feel free to correct or add things.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! (To not just you, but all who responded to my follow-up question with info). These little buggers really are fascinating. They have a sort of alien way of processing the world that we have trouble relating to sometimes, yet maybe that's why it keeps us wanting to know more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Queens are not, however, very good flyers. So, as with most things, it's partially random and partially genetic instincts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you happen to know if they are making decisions during this process? For example, if the queen has a maximum flying range of x, and finds a somewhat suitable location at x/2, does she keep looking for something better further up the road only to return to the first identified spot if she doesn't find anything better? Or, would she land at the first identified suitable location?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ants that are placed in queenless ant farms will typically only last 30-40 days until the ants are all dead, especially with gel farms.  Soil farms with proper nutrition (both sugar and a protein source) last a bit longer.  Also, the ant behavior you see in them isn't really typical ant behavior.  You'll see them trying to climb the glass walls at the top, and after a few days they dig a bunch of vertical, then horizontal tunnels until they hit glass.  They don't usually make chambers.  This is likely because they're digging to try to find the queen and the rest of the hive.  They do eventually set up a bathroom area and a graveyard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would happen if you had a &quot;proper&quot; ant farm with a queen? </p>
<p>I'm thinking like how a bee exhibit at our local Ren Faire has a full hive, exits and all, but it is only a single layer thick. It's interesting to watch the workers attend to the queen, and they come and go as they please - towards the end of the year, they have two jars of supplemental honey for them to use as the number of available flowers for foraging is reduced.</p></div>		</li>
