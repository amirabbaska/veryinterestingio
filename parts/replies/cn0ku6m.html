			<p>that is my point. You make it a point to say you got no financial help and then say &quot;except $10,000 freaking dollars&quot;<br><br>you imply you did not have much help but to MOST wage earners $10,000 is not a &quot;little help&quot; it is a life altering massive help if spent carefully.</p>		</li>
