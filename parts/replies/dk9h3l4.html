			<div class="markdown"><p>However, even the axolotl's regeneration isn't perfect. A friend had a large tank with a half dozen adults, and they would repeatedly bite each other's hands and feet, sometimes biting them of. They would always grow back, but over time they grew back more ragged and misshapen. The oldest ones eventually ended up with squashed mittens instead of hands and feet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i agree, but also, dividing walls? in an already small aquarium? as well as even if they are salamanders, i assume theyd still need interaction with others of their kind, like mice</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually true for most larval salamanders. Axolotls are paedomorphic, so they evolved in such a way that they lost the ability to transform (metamorphose) out of their larval morphology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, you can force them into metamorphosis using thyroid hormone. (Don't do that though cause it's extremely bad for them.) Rarely, an axolotl will metamorphose all by itself, which might be a response to stress or simply a mutation. Some of them can live for awhile as terrestrial salamanders. If your young axolotl metamorphoses and gains black and yellow markings, congrats! It was actually a tiger salamander and you probably got conned.</p></div>		</li>
