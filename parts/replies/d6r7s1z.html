			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, we are born before we've reached further development because otherwise our skulls wouldn't pass through the mother's pelvis. This early birth requires extra development time after the baby has been born.</p>
<p>If you didn't provide any social learning other than providing food until the child could collect food on their own, they would likely survive but lack a lot of skills. Would be an interesting experiment if it was ethical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great read.  As a former pregnant person, I would say it is two additional things.  I buy the metabolic idea...but only to a point.  Babies breastfeed up to 30oz/day, which is 750kcal expended for mom and 600kcal consumed for baby.  So more than pregnancy.  I have no problem metabolizing that.  </p>
<p>I would add that your cardiovascular system is the real problem.  I thought I would get stronger, i.e. become someone who could carry 185lbs but no, I was a 135lb woman awkwardly, breathlessly, painfully hauling 50lbs, mostly fluid.   Until you experience it, it is hard to describe, but those last few weeks are misery.  I went 2 weeks overdue and my body was at the end of what it could do.  Heavy breathing constantly.  </p>
<p>Then the other minor issue is, your placenta just turns to junk.  It is a temporary organ.  It craps out.  In my case, gestational diabetes and then a c section because it became clear my placenta had no reserves for helping baby survive labor.   </p>
<p>Babies are extremely biologically intense.  That's why there are plenty of early miscarriages (25+%) with a risk that drops steeply after the first trimester.  Your body goes all in.  </p>
<p>So imho from an evolutionary perspective, you have to balance mom's survival (can survive independently and have more babies) with baby's survival (extremely expensive to make, continues species).   10 months (40-42 weeks is not 9 months) is a sweet spot between mother still functioning at the end and surviving childbirth, and the little being strong enough to survive outside the womb, and the placenta being not shitty enough to still help baby survive birth. </p>
<p>Side note, babies surviving birth prior to 38 weeks is a very new thing.  8 weeks before JFK was assassinated, Jackie lost a baby boy who was born at 36 weeks.  Survival rate for that birth these days would be very close to 100%.  That loss kicked off a lot of research into premature birth survival.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did the researchers forget about lactation? Or just ignore it? The ideas in this study are semi-compelling, but they leave out the fact that, even after birth, 100% of a baby's energy needs are still generated by the mother. I am not an anthropologist (IANAA, I want credit for that), but I suspect that, when humans were doing the majority of their evolving, mothers probably nursed for up to two years, as the ready availability of infant and toddler friendly food sources was limited. This means that the metabolism argument doesn't really hold up - the mother's body still has to metabolize all that energy and synthesize an energy source for the baby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, the mothers pelvis thing is false (as someone earlier pointed out)</p>
<p>(This might've been mentioned) but human advanced brains/intelligence is due to our long development phase. Basically our brains don't fully develop til well after puberty, while chimp brains are pretty much done by puberty. Because of this, our brains are constantly learning and developing. It's not necessarily a social thing- it is more a brain development thing. Our advanced intelligence wants us to be able to learn a vast quantities of things, and because of this we sacrifice that quantity for development time: we have super long brain development maturation. An ant knows everything it ever needs to know by day two of existence; a human is constantly learning throughout its life so the development of the brain needs to take longer</p>
<p>So to answer the question, why do others know how to animal earlier, it's basically because less is expected of them. Being an ant is way simpler than being a human. In our evolution, because we are known to live on every continent, a lot of learning is required. The basics are still there (reproduction, eating, etc) but hunting is vastly different in Asia than in South America, so our brains adapted for that by extending a development period. (I.e. Easier to learn how to take down a mammoth from social groups then having a brain hard wired for mammoth hunting in South America where there were none and being screwed)</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another aside- </p>
<p>Animals that have fewer offspring tend to put more time into them. We can be underdeveloped because all of mom and dad's energy is going into us alone (for the most part) as infants. Other animals that don't do this typically have large litters so that a few of the many will survive </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Social learning applies to other animals as well, I puppy raised with adult cats will act differently from a wild dog.
A kitten taken away before it is weaned and hand raised by humans without ever meeting another cat will be very different from say a farm cat who is raised and taught by their mothers and nest in a communal den.
We are just the most extreme social animals. Extreme in so many ways but still we exist on a continuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: Humans have one of the weakest bonds between mother and child among any of the primates. An orangutan mother will maintain physical contact with her child for quite some time, not breaking for a moment if she can avoid it and voraciously defending the child, whereas a human mother can give up their child the instant it's born to others. It's likely a social development, allowing the child the opportunity to experience and learn from numerous different other humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems awfully anecdotal since the young of feral primates are subject to predation. If you would expect your child to be in danger by predators all the time, of course your relationship would include more physical contact. Which just goes to show how incredibly safe the lives for a lot of us have become</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's considered a long time? Days? Weeks? More? I read a blog post from a midwife once about how she thinks babies should have near-constant physical contact for the first two months or so with her baby for proper bonding. It seemed really extreme to me but if orangutans regularly do it, maybe there is some truth behind it (despite the impracticality for humans)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because other primates do this doesn't mean it's necessary or beneficial for humans though. Take a baby orangutan away from its mom and she will physically attack you. That's probably not a feature we'd like to see in human mothers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brain is remembering somewhere between 6 months to like...2 years? And I'm certain one of those is close to wrong.</p>
<p>I wouldn't compare orangutan practices to human ones, to be honest. Physical contact is good for social bonding for sure, but I don't think there's any benefit in that contact being exclusively with the mother.</p></div>		</li>
