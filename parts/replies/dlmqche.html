			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question(totally ignorant on the subject). We typically have like 5L of blood in an adult. if you lose a limb(and survive obviously) do you produce less total blood? Makes sense that we would but nice to <em>know</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up on this - if we do indeed produce less blood after losing a limb, what is the mechanism for that? Does that same mechanism apply when we lose significant amounts of weight? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mechanism simplified is all about meeting aerobic metabolic needs.  In other words, &quot;Is enough oxygen being delivered to the cells of your tissues to allow them to function appropriately?&quot;  If not enough oxygen is being delivered to the kidneys they release a hormone called Erythropoietin that starts the process of, you guessed it, erythropoiesis (AKA red blood cell production mostly within bone marrow).  If you lose large amounts weight (and I'm assuming you mean adipose tissue, or fat) your body will adjust the amount of circulating blood to meet minimum need. That being said different tissues in your body require vastly different amounts blood with fat requiring very little (as opposed to muscle requiring large amounts).  Therefore, your body would not need to adjust your total blood volume much if you lost 30 pounds of fat as opposed to if you lost a thirty pound limb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body has mechanisms in the heart and blood vessels that tell if it has the right amount of volume and pressure. If you lose a limb, your body would meed to have less blood in order to keep the balance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breaking it down to the basics the human body makes enough blood to meet metabolic demand for aerobic (with oxygen) metabolism.  If there is less body to supply there will be less blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You produce less blood in your body, because it will figure out that it doesn't need as much blood, but a good chunk of the lost production would be from the limb itself. If you lose an arm, suddenly you have that much less body to do the production with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscles are not the only parts of the body that need blood. The skin is the biggest organ of the body, therefore it also needs blood supply. Veins run everywhere in the body, but they become more apparent in the hands and feet because they get 'pushed' to the surface by the boney structure of the hands. Plus, there's not much body fat which makes it easier to see them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not nearly as much muscle or fat tissue in he hands so they're just more visible. You have more blood flow in the upper extremities, you just can't see any of it.. Watch wrestling sometime, or mma and you'll notice those guys show a lot more in the arms or lower legs because of low fat %.</p></div>		</li>
