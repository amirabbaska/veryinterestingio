			<div class="markdown"><p>So, my son attended a charter school that ran the International Baccalaureate program for grades k-8. The school was publicly funded but really ran by the PTA. The parents that started the school made all the rules and the committees that followed were chaired by the parents who put in the most volunteer time. It really was a quality school, but the staff who are from the local public system really don't have as much leeway as the other public schools. The wait list to get your kid into one of these is usually a few years long, and there's a mandatory volunteer commitment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds great. But let's be clear... That was a good school because you had... </p>
<p>1) parents who had to actively decide to send their kids there</p>
<p>2) a school where the parents of those kids volunteer an obscene amount of time (just being on a PTA board takes a lot of volunteer time, now we're talking about committees and curriculum... That's an insane amount of parent time) </p>
<p>What this basically means is that you have a school full of kids whose parents want them to do so well that they are personally spending their time working for the school.  Basically, these are kids who come from families that really value education and put time and effort into making sure their kids do well. Those kids are probably going to do well anywhere. </p>
<p>That's great. That's wonderful. And it's exactly why so many charter schools do well... Because the populations of those schools self-select great students. </p>
<p>There's a big argument here (usa) that charter <em>schools are inherently better</em> than standard public schools.  The thing is, in the few cases where they have shifted and entire school from standard to charter, they don't see improvement.</p>
<p>Take the students from the best and worst schools in a city/area and swap the students, and you'll find that the teachers and facilities and curriculum has little to do with how well the school performs.</p>
<p>Both Bush and Obama instituted federal programs that placed the onus on the teachers. That's a bunch of shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely agree. That was a great school for the first 7 years or so, but as the founding(most involved) parents moved on, the school floundered. It is closed now.  I worked at a local elementary school here for 15 years and I can tell you honestly that demographics are everything. A school is as successful as the parents help it to be. And the kids that learn best are the kids that are encouraged to at home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. Parents have a far larger impact on their children's education than teachers do. Unfortunately politicians are afraid to run with this idea because it essentially means if you're kid sucks at school the parent sucks, not the teacher, and nobody wants to be told that something is their fault. Much easier to blame teachers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rules vary state by state, but in Arizona, charter schools get the same per pupil funding as public schools, but charter schools can turn away expensive or &quot;undesirable&quot; students. Charter schools and private schools do not have to take special ed students, disabled students and so on.</p>
<p>It creates an incredibly unfair distribution of funds, and an innacurate perception that charter schools are more efficient.</p>
<p>Public schools educate all the children of the local community. Charter schools and private schools pick and choose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason they are controversial is because there are many instances of charter schools abusing the rules and little state oversight, John Oliver did a piece on them.</p>
<p>And vouchers are probably needed in areas where there is a strong tradition of private schools like St. Louis where the majority actually attend a private school. Or where public schools are viewed very poorly</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, there is really a chasm in quality between various charters.  </p>
<p>There are two prominent &quot;Independent Study&quot; charter high schools in a nearby city.  One is run very well, has good success rates, and graduates students.  We call the other one &quot;The fake school&quot; because in my experience they take anybody, not one student who has transferred to it from our comprehensive high school has had <em>any</em> success, and their public records show that this isn't just anecdotal.  They are basically siphoning money from the state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with vouchers is that it just exacerbates the problem, as it effectively defunds public school and redirects that money to private sector. It makes public schools less desirable and attractive to middle income parents who would have put their kids there, but instead choose to make additional financial sacrifices and send their kids to a private school. </p>
<p>Chile implemented something like this in the 80s and now the public ed system is basically completely broken.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Which isn't necessarily a bad thing on its own. The real problem as I see it stems from the difficulty in objectively assessing the quality of an educational institution. The typical metric is student success rate, but unlike other business models, that depends greatly on the students (consumers) themselves, thereby incentivizing the schools to admit only those most likely to succeed while rejecting others. That's an issue in and of itself, but obviously public schools don't have the luxury to game their reputation like this, so you're left with this quasi free market Frankenstein.</p>
<p>Competition is great, but clearly fails when success is measured by the &quot;quality&quot; of the consumer, and I think it's only until we can figure out some way around that, that it can be effectively applied in this context.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's also why vouchers are seen as bad. Resources devoted to public education is taken away, and private schools tend to be much more expensive and inaccessible to those in poverty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't checked the numbers on this in over a decade (since my wife and I decided not to have children), but in the mid 2000s, at least, this was not true.  Generally, public schools cost the tax-payers more per student per year than tuition at a private school in the same area, if only marginally.  That still made non-voucher private education out of reach for most middle-income families because unlike public school the cost was not defrayed by indirect participants (singles without children, married without children, the elderly, etc.) who pay taxes to fund public schools but aren't direct recipients of the benefits.  However, the voucher system fixes this.</p>
<p>That's not to say that there aren't other potential pitfalls to a voucher system, but cost has rarely been one, and would tend to be self-correcting over time.  Private school is costly now in part due to a market force.  Private enterprise can rarely compete with the government on a cost basis, so they have to compete on a quality basis.  If vouchers caught on in an area, I suspect over time that you would see new entrants into the private school marketplace and the competition would further drive down prices as well as create a broader and more diversified menu of education options.</p></div>		</li>
