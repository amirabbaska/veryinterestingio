			<div class="markdown"><p>What would happen if you place the imaginary disks in a bigger amount of goo? </p>
<p>Does it need the pupa as a structure to orientated itself and organize where which imaginary disk should go? </p>
<p>What would happen if you add an imaginary disk for an additional leg/wing/reproductive organs/...?</p></div>		</li>
