			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not. The whiskers disappear rather quickly, so quickly in fact that if you still have them you're also likely to have remains of the release agent which actually lowers the grip of the tyre. They're also called chicken strips because you can often find them on the edge of the tyre, and since they disappear so quickly it's a good indication that the rider hasn't ridden the tyre to the edge, and is therefore a &quot;chicken&quot; because they're afraid of leaning their bike to the limit. </p></div>		</li>
