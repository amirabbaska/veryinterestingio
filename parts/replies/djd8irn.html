<p>In terms of corpses and dead animals disappearing, there is a specific type of beetle in the United States called the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Nicrophorus_vespilloides5.jpg" target="_blank">Burrowing Beetle</a> whose lifestyle specifically resolves around scavenging. They find a corpse of a small mammal, bird, amphibian, or pretty much anything and then excavate the ground underneath the body, allowing it to fall through before then burying it beneath the soil. It can actually disappear something the size of a bird or rat within a day of finding it. Then, depending on the size of the corpse and how much food is still available on it, they'll lay an appropriate clutch of eggs inside the corpse, such that they have a food source as larvae. They're one of the few beetle species that actively care for their young as well, staying in and around their clutches until they move along and even feeding the larvae themselves. </p>
<p>Anyway, they're apparently critically endangered in the US and I managed to find one inside my house a few weeks ago! Incredibly beautiful bug. I got the chance to spend a few minutes examining him/her, IDing it and learning all about them, before relocating him/her to my back-yard. It was really exciting.</p>
<p>Hopefully my cats hunted something for it to lay some eggs in. </p>
<p>Here's a super interesting and quick read on them: <a href="http://spot.colorado.edu/~mitton/webarticles/Burying%20Beetles.htm" target="_blank">http://spot.colorado.edu/~mitton/webarticles/Burying%20Beetles.htm</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome, thank you for sharing!! It must have been incredible to find something so rare and then observe it in real life! I know it's mostly just anthropomorphizing, but I like to think that lil' bugs like that Burrowing Beetle you met appreciate not getting squished--you basically saved it from a nasty run in with a shoe or your cat! :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is purely anecdotal, but once I was waiting for the tram after work late at night, and I saw lots of fluffy white stuff floating in the air around me. Curious, I grabbed some handfuls of the stuff. It was so soft, I exclaimed to my boyfriend over the phone. Suddenly and to my horror, a police car stopped about 20 feet away and started shoveling a very large and very dead bunny off the road and into a garbage bag. It was dead bunny floof kicked up from getting hit by a car :(</p>
<p>So yes, I suppose the authorities do remove a certain number of these. I'm in Germany and there aren't that many predators that would be big enough to run off with such a large corpse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm  a gas meter reader, going house to house in suburbia. I've seen quite a few dead birds (10+) over the last couple of weeks, more than usual. Probably a lot more swept into bushes that I don't see as well. It's  my anecdotal evidence though.   </p>
<p>Most people aren't walking in between houses everyday let alone walking about 15km a day doing so. </p></div>		</li>
