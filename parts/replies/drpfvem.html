			<div class="markdown"><p>So the way that the liquid crystal displays work is that they rotate the actual liquid crystal molecules in response to an electric field. When light passes through these molecules, the light polarization will also rotate along with the molecule. The specifics depend on the type of LCD, but if the rotation of the molecules isn't perfect 90 degrees, then the second polarizer won't block 100% light. Obviously, it's impossible to have it perfect, which is why you don't get pure black. </p></div>		</li>
