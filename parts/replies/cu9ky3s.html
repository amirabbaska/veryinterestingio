			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the opposite.  Gas station owners have to buy the fuel themselves, they aren't allotted any from BP or Sunoco or whatever company is on the logo on their sign.  So they have to think not about the fuel they have stored in their tanks, but the owners best guess of what the next delivery will cost.  They don't make much money on fuel, literally a few pennies a gallon, so they have to run on the margin that will keep them afloat on the next shipment.  Say they buy 5000 gallons, at $2.00 a gallon for a total of $10,000 they are into this.  Let's assume taxes and fees don't exist for simplicities sake (but in reality we know they do and they complicate things on local, state, and federal levels).  Tack on your profit of $.10 (again, for simplicities sake) and you can sell your gas at $2.10 and pay back your investment of $10 grand and make $500 for your week of gas sales.  Something happens, price to you jumps to $3.00 a gallon.  So now you have some choices: do you sell at $2.10 and make your $500 profit like you intended?  Do you sell at $3.10, like everyone else will, and pocket the difference?  Something in between? Most people would be tempted to sell at market price and make a windfall, but that isn't what is happening in reality.  See, assume Mr. goodGuy Gasman sells his gas he got at $2.00 at $2.10, making his $500 profit cause he's not greedy.  Hooray that guy, we all love him.  But Mr. Gasman just made $500 bucks this week, hardly anything to retire on.  So, he sold his 5000 gallons he got at $2.00 for $2.10, and ends up with $10,500.  But it's a new week, and Mr. Gasman needs to keep selling so he needs a new shipment.  He has $10,500 dollars...but fuel is now $3.00, and his minimum shipment of 5000 gallons costs $15000.  Now Mr. GoodGuy is $4,500 in the red if he wants to keep selling gas (assuming he takes nothing, and folds his profit back into the business).  Mr. Gasman is, as we say in the industry, fucked.  He now has to take out a loan from the oil company (they live doing that to gas station owners) just to stay in business and he has to pay interest on a loan just so people will not think he is greedy.</p>
<p>Instead, what he should have and what fuel stations owners do do is make your best guess at where the market will be next week. And price his fuel to suit that, always trying to stay ahead of the curve.  It has to also be priced at such a level that his competition won't undercut him, so profits are kept thin, and in a world based on possible future costs, thin profit margins means that when you do the math at the end of the month, if you didn't guess well, you may have been selling your gas at a loss at times.  They system continues, the gas station owner trying to guess what his always uncertain costs will be, dancing the razors edge of profit and loss, and getting blamed cause he is selling you something at $3.10 that he got at $2.00.  But you don't pay based on what he has, but in what (he thinks) he will need.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: everyone in the fuel transaction at your corner station is getting screwed, except the parent company whose name is on the sign. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a complete fantasy.  Almost no gas station owners set their own prices.  They are uniformly controlled by the franchiser.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To the best of my knowledge, /u/TrainsareFascinating is correct, but assuming you are for a minute, can you relate this to the factory shutdown in Indiana? Even moreso than that, everytime there is a &quot;tragedy&quot;, the supply doesn't go down (if it did, gas stations would be running out of gas) and the demand doesn't go up, but only the prices seem to change, it's not costs of the crude oil anymore. </p>
<p>Even more on top of that, why do prices go up so fast when there is a &quot;tragedy&quot; and go down so slowly when it's fixed? Assume the same cost for crude, producing the gas would cost x amount when things are proper and y amount when things are in emergency mode like they are now. When the cost goes from x to y, we see the change immediately, but when it goes back from y to x, we don't see it for months. The difference between the tragedy premium we keep paying and the lower cost of production must then be pure profit, otherwise it wouldn't raise as fast as it does. How is this justified?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great explanation of how the gas station business works. But oil at $40/barrel historically meant gas prices <em>nationwide</em> were a lot lower. Particularly on the west coast, oil prices seem to have next to no effect on gas prices at the pump. Any explanation for that? </p></div>		</li>

<p>ETA: by the way, don't think that living within 20 miles of the refinery means cheaper gas.  No sir, it's somehow more expensive here than in most of the state and region.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You seem to be hinting that a company would shut down a refinery to raise the price of gasoline. </p>
<p>Since gasoline is primarily supplied locally, that would enrich that company's competitors at its own expense. I assure you, refining companies want to refine gasoline. They don't want to not refine gasoline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is interesting is, There is always some refinery issues every time gas goes down. I would guess mostly due to age of these places, and no new refineries are being built. So I can see how someone can say how convenient. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the share of the market that company has, shutting down production, in the short term will lower their market share, however it will also spike the retail prices.  When the refinery comes back on line, it generally takes quite a while for prices to fall to previous levels.  It's not &quot;really&quot; an impposible senario due to the small numbers of refineries around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They had a severe leak on the overhead of their crude unit vacuum tower causing air to be sucked in and them to lose vacuum. They were forced to shut down to prevent O2 levels from reaching the UEL and potentially causing an explosion. They could potentially start-up this week and you should immediately see prices drop if successful.</p>
<p>Trust me, this isn't a conspiracy as BP is losing a tremendous amount of money during this incident while other local Midwest refineries are making bank on the fuels supply/demand curve.</p>
<p>You should've also noticed prices drop in the past week due to the Explorer pipeline routing fuels from the gulf (which, under normal conditions, is not profitable).</p></div>		</li>
