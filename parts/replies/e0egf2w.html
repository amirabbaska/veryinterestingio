			<div class="markdown"><p>So maybe a bit off topic but I probably wont find any other Hawaiian residents anytime soon but just how bad is the vog on the kona side? I'm looking at planning a trip there many months down the road when it most likely will have subsided and want to take advantage of the much cheaper airfare right now. What's the worst case scenario if it continues as is? I'm considering bringing along someone who has asthma and we would plan on spending a lot of time on the beach and outside (kona area, a family member has had a condo reserved since before the eruption). I've been there several times before so I know how big the island is and which areas are affected by flows, I won't plan on going to the hot springs or national park. I'm expecting it would still be a massive improvement over Salt Lake City's notoriously bad winter air quality (daily health advisory for pm2.5 pollution). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kilauea has been erupting continuously since 1983, so thinking it will likely have subsided within a few months is a guess at best. This flurry of activity may be just about over, or it could just be clearing its throat for the Main Event yet to come.  Hopefully Mauna Loa stays quiet</p></div>		</li>
