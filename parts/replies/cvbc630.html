<p>Say you were standing right next to the sun when it disappeared. You know Earth won't see/feel any changes for 8 minutes. Does that mean you also won't see Earth's orbit change for 8 minutes <em>after</em> the initial 8 minutes?</p>
<p>So you would be standing there for a total of about 16 minutes before you <em>saw</em> Earth affected by the disappearing sun? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, just like the fact that the Earth will still give off light. After 16 minutes it would finally turn dark for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's go deeper. Say a giant mirror with no mass and pointed directly at earth replaces the sun instantly. I am on the earth with a telescope trained only on the mirror to observe earth's movement. It would then take 24 minutes for me to observe a change in the earth's trajectory?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well yes because you are seeing the earth 8 minutes before the sun disappears. So then the sun disappears and you watch the earth continue in its previous path until 16 minutes pass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We believe that it travels at the speed of light, but since the full theory of gravity is not worked out it is possible it travels a little bit slower. Experiments have showing that gravitational changes propagate at least 99.999% of the speed of light. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That was actually going to be my question. So, apparently this has been experimentally verified. How did they do the experiment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have the experiments actually proven that it's not instantaneous? I know that theory <em>predicts</em> the delay, but I'm not sure if it has actually been measured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is the difference between a propagating gravitational change and the gravitational wave so much money is being spent trying to detect to show that such a thing exists?</p>
<p>If there is a propagation rate there is a rate of change of the field in both time and space and that is pretty much the definition of a field wave.  What are they looking for that isn't an obvious consequence of a propagation rate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't there a gravity &quot;messenger&quot; like a particle (using that word very loosely) or something that gets emitted that causes the attraction? (Is that a graviton? Or did I just make that up?)</p>
<p>If anything like that exists then one would assume these &quot;particles&quot; get emitted with some form of a frequency. I may be punching above my weight here...</p></div>		</li>
