The project had to buy GSFC two  new shaker tables that could impart enough force. That alone was several million dollars.</p>
<p>The test sequence took several weeks to execute, but was many months in the planning. I am proud to say that the contractors who did most of that planning work in my group at SGT Inc. </p>
<p>This summer they conducted a test to prove they can form the 18 segments into a single reflective surface while operating at 40 Kelvins. This was done at Johnson Space Center. This will it is flying to Long Beach CA for the final phase of testing.</p>
<p>Think year they will prove the spacecraft part can survive its loads, then bring the telescope and spacecraft together for one final vibration test. They will be careful not to test the telescope as severely this time. Launch is very hard on the structure but you can't afford to build a super strong structure, it would weigh too much.</p>
<p>This only hints at all the steps involved in structural testing. I started working in the field while still in college and I never want to do anything else. </p>
<p>BTW, you can thank the space business for cars that are designed to leave a survivable core in heavy crashes while weighing far less than older cars. This is possible due to NASTRAN, a software that NASA funded in the early 70s. It is how we plan these tests.</p></div>		</li>
