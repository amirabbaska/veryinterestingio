			<div class="markdown"><p>All the reasons tinnitus can develop are interesting as well. I never did anything growing up that would have been linked to my early development on 24-7 tinnitus in my left ear. My hearing in that ear is impaired somewhat too. It's only been recently when I was undergoing tests to diagnose my Vestibular Migraines we also discovered I also have semicircular canal dehiscence which is the most likely cause of said hearing loss and tinnitus. I can also hear and feel the blood in the veins in my ears as it moves and is changed by movement and pressure. </p>
<p>That said I'm not exactly sure as to why a thin bone would cause tinnitus. A question to ask my ENT another time. I'm new to my recent diagnosis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right - best to ask your ENT.  Usually tinnitus caused by semicircular canal dehiscence is pulsatile and can have some associated conductive hearing loss from &quot;third window&quot; phenomenon.  Basically, easy transmission through the bone and easy transmission out of the bone covering the hearing organ.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Med student here. Is ENT still 5 years or is it 6 now? Just curious. I want to be a surgical specialist and I like 3 different fields including ENT, 1 of which I know is 5 years and another is 6 to 7. I know very little though about ENT residency structure though. </p>
<p>Also, in your experience, what is the most common path for trainee physicians to take to being dual board certification in reconstructive plastics and ENT? </p>
<p>Also I have 2 middle-author orthopedic sports medicine pubs in good Ortho journals and am wondering if someone applying ENT, aside from stellar board scores, would also need ENT-specific research to be considered by PDs. Would the Ortho pubs work against me for ENT, esp. If they were my only listed pubs? </p>
<p>Lastly, what are your favorite parts of being an ENT doc and least favorite parts? </p>
<p>If you're too far removed from residency to answer these, I completely understand and thank you for your time anyway. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>edit: thanks for the PM!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not quite sure if this is off-topic for r/askscience, so sent a PM too in case this gets deleted.  Most residencies are 5 years, but some 7 year tracks exist for those who want a prolonged research experience.  The only way to practice both ENT and Facial Plastics would be to train in ENT and then do a fellowship in Facial Plastic Surgery.  Plastic Surgeons cannot do fellowship training in ENT, because the scope is just too different from the rest of their training.. I suppose you could return for a second residency, but I can't imagine why anyone would want to do that.  If you're interested in Plastic Surgery, I suppose the question would be whether you also want to learn about wound care, other types of cosmetic surgery, and general surgery principles or if you would rather learn about ENT disorders and focus on facial plastics later on.</p>
<p>As for publications- generally speaking the ENT publications will carry much heavier weight than non-ENT.  I can't say that non-ENT publications count for nothing, but I have certainly heard that sentiment passed around before.  It really depends on who you ask. Basically, something MAY be better than nothing, but not my much.  ENT-related something is vastly better than non ENT-related.  As for favorite parts of ENT - it's a very diverse specialty with both medical and surgical components that range from tubes and tonsils to massive airway and head/neck cancer reconstructions, depending on what you fancy.  It is challenging and also affords the opportunity for a good lifestyle with not too many emergencies if you don't feel the need to do airway or cancer surgery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have tinnitus and reading this thread has amplified it so much. To the point it got quite uncomfortable and I had to put on some music.</p>
<p>It's quite a mental thing for sure.</p></div>		</li>
