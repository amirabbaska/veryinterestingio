			<div class="markdown"><p>OP didn't indicate that he or she realised that water would be able to deform a steel container. The amount of pressure freezing ice can create is probably surprising to most people who haven't seen its effects - I remember being surprised the first time I saw a milk bottle which had broken due to the milk freezing inside (and I already knew about ice, and milk, expanding when frozen)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we're talking about an infinitely strong container with no temperature expansion/contraction, starting at liquid water and then lowering the temperature?</p>
<p>Presumably, we'd just need to get above 1g/cm^3 density, not infinite pressure.  Since all of the 2-X Ice types have &gt;1 g/cm^3, I'd guess you end up with a complicated temperature dependent mix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda. Ice IX exists in the real world and is formed by freezing water at certain pressures/temperatures, but it has no relation to the fictional Ice 9, including any of the properties of it converting regular water to more Ice 9. </p>
<p>But yes, the idea of a different structure of water is based in reality.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The new phase is sufficiently different from ice III to warrant a new name, and the designation &quot;ice IX&quot; is proposed. This designation has already been used by Vonnegut^15 for a  phase of ice, but since it was a  fictional phase, the name is not pre-empted. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Entirely unrelated, I'm afraid.  That diagram shows the way water behaves at dramatically different temperatures and pressures.  The concept of Ice 9 is water behaving in a different way at a normal temperature and pressure.  In fact, there is an Ice IX on that diagram, but it's just the kind of ice you get when you combine very high pressure and very low temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is absolutely possible that increasing the pressure of the system would cause the water to change phase. It's a little more complicated than that, take another look at the phase diagram for water: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/700px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/700px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png</a></p>
<p>This diagram illustrates the structure of water corresponding to any temperature and pressure. If, for instance, you started with water vapor at 100C inside the piston and started pressurizing it (traveling up on the graph), you would quickly form liquid water. Assuming the system is isothermal (ie, you let the piston conduct away the excess heat from the water, leaving it at exactly 100C) it will become ice VII at around 2.1GPa, or 2.1 billion newtons per meter squared. If the system is not isothermal, the temperature will rise (for complicated reasons), and it will take a much higher pressure to form solid ice. Regardless, you can see that, within the range of the graph, you will <em>always</em> form solid ice by pressurizing water that's below ~375C. I'm not sure what the diagram looks like for higher pressures or temperatures, but you can interpolate the solidus line (line between solid and liquid denoting full solidification) quite far off to the right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10 kbar is the pressure to go from liquid to solid at room temperature, which is 140,000 psi. If you tried using a piston and a hole, you would break the piston, and the hole. If you use diamond for the your piston/hole setup, you probably don't have enough force to compress the water. If you get past all that, then yes, you could freeze the water by compressing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You would need an incredibly sturdy piston to freeze water at room temperature by increasing pressure, but theoretically it could be done. If you examine a pressure-temperature phase diagram for water, you will see that for certain temperatures, it is possible to freeze water by increasing pressure.</p></div>		</li>
