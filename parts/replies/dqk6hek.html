			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCbyByY-A6w" target="_blank">Cattle and Cane</a>, famously written in a time signature of Go Fuck Yourself/4.</p>
<p>(Technically the verses' time signature rotates from 5/4 to 2/4 to 4/4, changing every bar.  It's usually easier for the rhythm section to just let the guitar and the vocals take the lead and hang on for grim death once you lose count.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a member of the cult of written score, we are not all jerks! However, this is correct, the meter conveys additional information that seem intuitive after some listens but make the piece easier for a sight-reader. </p></div>		</li>
