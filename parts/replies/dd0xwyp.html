			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the trick of all government: Ultimately, it's just about people and what they decide to do. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpL6Fwu0wkw" target="_blank">An appropriate time to recall the riddle of the sellsword</a>]</p>
<p>This is why people who design governments (and intend them to be non-tyrannical) tend to have lots of fail-safes and competing interests and checks and balances: the idea is to make it as hard as possible to get to that critical mass, and to make sure that the steps that they would need to take even if they existed would be as hard as possible. </p>
<p>Of course, the trade off for those steps is that it's harder to make &quot;good&quot; policy.  But governing people isn't easy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Governing people is so much harder than running a business. Successful business executives are not necessarily fit to run for public office. Corporations are judged solely by their profit margin. I mean, that's the entirety of what they're supposed to do --produce profit for their shareholders.</p>
<p>Government success is judged on so many different factors that mean different things to every group. Much of what a government sure will have longer consequences and can't even be judged fairly until significantly later.</p>
<p>Of course, the same thing plagues many top corporate executives. Turn a profit on the short term, use that to advance to the next position. Lose money, blame the short sighted work of your predecessor, or worst case collect your severance and stock options and try again somewhere else. I'm getting off topic though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You understand correctly. </p>
<p>This is why some people really freak out when they see any minority being mistreated (or set up for future mistreatment) by those in power. It's a slippery slope that can lead to disaster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. That's why the U.S. Federal government was designed to move so slowly. And over the last century, we chipped away at a lot of those checks and balances. It was done in the name of progress, for the sake of minorities, we felt we had to drag some of the slower to adapt areas of the country through struggles with racism, sexism, and homophobia. At the time, it seemed like, and probably was, the right thing to do. But it's created a government with so much power concentrated in the hands of the executive branch, that a single demagogue can be swept into power with a minority of the popular vote and begin to issue decrees via executive order. And there's not much we can do about it. This is the price we're paying for changing the system to chase short term gains. </p>
<p>Not all state's rights advocates are secret racists or homophobes or otherwise backwards in some way. Many of us just want a return to a more balanced system of government. It's funny now to see so many on the left, who just a few years ago were proponents of an activist Supreme Court and a powerful executive branch suddenly rediscovering the constitution and the Bill of rights.</p>
<p>I'm not saying expanding the power of the federal government in order to improve the lives of fellow Americans struggling in backwards regions was a bad thing. I'm saying all actions have consequences. We built a powerful weapon for (relatively) rapid and unilateral change, we shouldn't be surprised that it's being used against us.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, a lot of the expanded powers of the executive branch emerged from the cold war and the peculiar nature of threats at the time. The president needed the ability to drop the bomb, effectively giving him the ability to annihilate millions without congressional approval for war. Then responding to communist crises in the 60s-80s, followed by issues in the Gulf lead to the executive branch being able to take over war powers from the legislature. I'd argue that this has done more to erode the separation of powers than the civil rights act did. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't just designed to move slowly. It was designed to make it difficult to do <em>anything.</em> The Federal government was also designed to be <em>very weak.</em> Yet states have given up power to the Fed gov and Congress has abdicated it's authority to the Executive. Now we have a government with very little accountability and even Congress can't perform oversight on the executive agencies it delegated power to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A few years ago the executive powers were being used to enact healthcare for the poor, environmental protections and goodness knows what else.  In his first week Trump has used those powers to alienate half the planet, lay down the ground work for mass deportation of brown people who worship a slightly different god, and enact legislation that will begin the destruction of your environment.  Bravo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It wasn't quite that wealthy at the time when the Nazi's came in power though, which was partially why they came into power in the first place, IIRC my history.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is ultimately human decency though. As OP says, the majority has the power to change just about anything. Fortunately a sufficient enough people are decent, at least more or less, over a broad enough scope. And I still believe that to be true. Ultimately the majority of people want to be decent, even if they don't always vote that way. There are certainly many other factors that into determining who one votes for.</p>
<p>People demand justice. Sometimes twists and turns, but the history of mankind, when looked at from enough distance, the amount of justice in the world trends upward. Helps that it keeps being redefined to extend further.</p></div>		</li>
