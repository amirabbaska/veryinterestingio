			<div class="markdown"><p>After working in the flavor industry, I learned it has a lot to do with how willing a culture is to accept new things.  In America people don’t tend to be adventurous with their food, so they have to pair something new with something familiar.  Popular Examples of this include strawberry kiwi, peach mango, and blueberry açaí, among many others.  If these flavors become popular enough then people might try the new flavors by themselves, but most times it is always paired with something.  In some other cultures, people are more willing to try new things, so more wild flavors are used.  </p>
<p>At the end of the day for most companies, it comes down to profitability.  If a flavor isn’t going to make a bunch of money, why are they going to release it?  So to find truly unique flavors, look for smaller brands who don’t stand to make/lose a bunch of money by putting out a crazy flavor.</p>
<p>TL;DR. Some cultures are more willing to try new things and food companies don’t want to take large risks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>wow, that makes so much sense. I never understood why they did that, always thought it was odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The importance of the &quot;seasonal&quot; part of this explanation can't be overstated.  In Japan there's something called &quot;季節感&quot; <em>kisetsukan</em>, which means sort of &quot;seasonal awareness.&quot;  It's really important to people.</p>
<p>People go out with their families to observe the fall leaves changing color, or to see the cherry blossoms flowering.  In summer, there are fireworks.  And all the flavors of things change along with what's in season.  People decorate their houses according to the seasons.</p>
<p>It took me awhile to get used to, because I grew up in a place without a real definition of the seasons as far as weather's concerned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just add that while most Japanese people don't consider themselves religious, this observing of the changing of seasons in the culture ties in a lot with the Buddhist concept of impermanence.  It's a deeply embedded cultural value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I quite understand...people in the US will drive across state lines to do fall foliage tours, we have fireworks holidays in different seasons, it's pretty well known that decorations change with the seasons (Christmas lights, new plantings growing in spring in gardens, Christmas decorations in windows and lawns, thanksgiving, halloween, 4th of july, most houses I have ever frequented change interior stuff like pillows and will put out tchotchkies for each season etc). We get more cinnamon and peppermint and others for winter, lavender, berries for spring, fruits and refreshing for summer etc.</p>
<p>And that was when I was in Alaska, Seattle, and Alabama. </p>
<p>Which basically are...winter....rain...and hot as fuck...respectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about the seasons for America, it's about the holidays. </p>
<p>Christmas, easter, fourth of july, thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The snacks would have to be themed around those holidays to be relevant (and that's definitely a thing), but in Japan it sounds like the whole idea is the passage of time itself, not an event or date. The seasonal snacks would help people recognize how fast time is passing, so the theme isn't important.</p></div>		</li>
