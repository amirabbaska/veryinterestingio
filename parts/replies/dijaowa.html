			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure GM has magnitude of assets over Tesla and craps out like 65 times more cars annually and yet somehow Tesla is worth more than GM. As far as intellectual batteries, I think they're worth something....but that's astronomical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the growth component. You have hit on a very good example and asked a very good question. </p>
<p>Which company has more potential for growth, Tesla or GM? GM is an older more established company that is currently paying out dividends, therefore it is viewed as being a safer investment. In these cases the valuation is a little easier to piece together. I would expect GM to have the same level of business this year as it had last year. I would be shocked if GM increases sales by 10%. However Tesla? They better increase sales by at least 10%. </p>
<p>Another way to look at this. What will the price of Tesla be, if it can achieve the same level of success as GM? How much are you willing to bet on that price, and how long do you think it will take to get there? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So assuming Tesla does nail every projection in its growth for the next 10 years and gets its deserved valuation of 60 billion. Does that mean stocks will be stagnant for 10 years just waiting on quarterly reports? Doesn't sound like a good investment to have all the risk of losing growth projection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GM has a Pension cost probably 1,000 times the size of Tesla's, and a huge levels of wasted money in human assets. If you wanted to ask why Tesla is worth more than GM, you should have asked that, because their business models aren't remotely comparable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But GM is a mature company, and is never going to dramatically grow their business 100x. Tesla's Model 3 has the potential to propel the company into one of the top automakers. Also you have to look at structural costs... pensions, legacy factories, bloated corporate structure, resources to develop 100+ models, etc. Tesla is much leaner so when they begin selling at larger scale they will be able to book much more in profits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think Über is massively overvalued, especially when they have little protection over their business model, and are actively contributing to the obsolescence of the industry with self driving vehicles.</p>
<p>But, in the end, the value of something is what you can convince someone to pay for it, so if people are investing at that valuation, then I guess that is what they are worth.</p></div>		</li>
