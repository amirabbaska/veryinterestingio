<p>The real issue, and the easiest one to resolve, is to have workers get involved in creating jobs again and not merely relying on the rich to create jobs. Because the rich like to fuck people for the most gain when it comes to employing people. </p>

<p>I agree with that and see, I and many others might would do that...<em>if</em> we didn't spend our entire lives working.  If I worked 20 hrs a week and my SO as well each of us would have time for another hobby which could turn into a business idea.  And then I could either have a business and a regular job and be rich, or do away with one and have more time.</p>
<p>I guess though we would need something to keep the majority of the population from working two 20 hr jobs...otherwise that justifiably raise prices...and I don't know how we could do that...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, who is going to pay you a 'living wage' for working twenty hours a week? What will you produce in that twenty hours that will double the company's investment in you? As you bide your and the wife's time planning an alternative career how are you proving to the corporation paying you that you guys are producing the bare modicum of productivity? Whether you care for it or not: regardless of how you conceive a controlling giant cradle to grave government, you will work for most of your life. If you work smart and plan wisely you can retire early; if you are looking to the government to plan your future you are going to be so disappointed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who said anything about cradle to grave government?  You think I want welfare?  Assistance?  Free money?  The dole like the banks are getting? No, thank you.</p>
<p>Which part of the post did we lose you at?</p>
<p>I'm asking what's happening to the extra 40 hrs that half the working population is putting in (on top of huge improvements in production)?  All things seem about equal (except for housing, cars, going out and tuition loan expenses) yet before 1980 40 hrs of work per housed per week sufficed to maintain that lifestyle and now it takes 80 hrs (two ppl working full time) and we're still going into debt....so it's like the profit from 40 hrs of work per household is disappearing...and I was wondering where to?  And people have been brainstorming answers.  I'm still mauling it all over (all the answers I've gotten).  Now that we're hopefully on the same page (remember, Im not talking about government help, you're the first to mention it) can you help us answer this?</p></div>		</li>
