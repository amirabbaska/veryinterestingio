<p>Thank you for the kind words. Scientists have been aware of the similarities between placenta and cancer for some time now and have been actively looking for similarities between the two. </p>
<p>VAR2CSA functions as a delivery system for drugs to cancer cells. It binds to specific modifications on the cells then the cells themselves will take the protein in. Once inside the cell, the drugs will be released and kill the cell.</p>
<p>We are currently working on the immunogenicity of VAR2CSA. (see edit)</p>

<p>Edit: VAR2CSA in malaria is a evolutionary protein that does not induce an immune response in the host. We are working on the immunegenicity of recombinant VAR2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there - since VAR2CSA is just a delivery mechanism for existing therapies, I'm curious about its applicability in cancers that have already become resistant to those therapies. Does VAR2CSA provide a breakthrough for metastatic cancers that have progressed on multiple prior therapies? Has it been shown to restore sensitivity to those therapies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the mechanism of resistance. For example if breast cancer became resistant to a certain drug because the target has mutated then having VAR2 deliver the same drug is useless. But if the resistance is due to the changes in the environment surrounding the tumor, then theoretically VAR2 can still deliver the same drug to the tumor as long as it has the placental chondroitin sulfate chain.</p>
