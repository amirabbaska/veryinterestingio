			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the biggest change is that <a href="http://joannenova.com.au/globalwarming/graphs/vostok-ice-core-50000.jpg" target="_blank">about 10,000 years ago the climate got a lot nicer</a>.  We've been in a nice, stable, warm climate system for about 10k years now, which is probably pretty much the ideal climate for doing agriculture in.  Predictable seasons, no ice everwhere, pretty good for plants in general.</p>
<p>Given that agriculture appears to have been invented in several different places independently around the same sort of time frame, I don't think it's unreasonable to speculate that people were smart enough to figure out how to do it for a good long time, just that the climate wasn't quite right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think, though someone can correct me if I'm wrong, that the dominant forcing regarding what causes ice ages is changes in the characteristics of earths orbit, know as Milankovitch cycles.  There are changes in oribital eccentricity, obliquity and precession, which alter how the Sun's rays hit the earth.  If you do a spectral decomposition on a sufficiently long temperature time series then you get <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v399/n6735/images/399429ad.eps.2.gif" target="_blank">spectral peaks</a> at around 100k, 40k and 20k years, which I think correspond to the various periods that these cycles act on.  Of course there a lot more complexity going on under the hood that isn't well understood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not clear that anatomically modern humans had language. Estimates of when language emerged generally say 50-70,000 years ago, right around the same time as the population bottleneck and leaving Africa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetic evidence is one. Without the FOXP2 gene none of us would be talking like we are now. So when it first appeared, it is a good indicator that there was heavy selection/need for it to become the norm and people most likely began naturally communicating in a very complex manner.  </p>
<p>Basically going from: &quot;<em>Ugh, fruit, tree, me, eat, give!</em>&quot;...to &quot;<em>hey Adam, can you give me that fruit up from that three right there I might need that later on....k thanks I'll pay you back later...don't step on that snake...how's Mary doing by the way?</em>&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can look at the nasal passages in skulls to figure out if they could speak. Humans had this for at least 100,000 years, neanderthals, for instance, didn't, but could have made nasally noises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The emergence of behavioral modernity is dated to be complete around 50-70,000 years ago but that is by no means the same as the date for the emergence of language. Language diversification/proliferation  and phoneme diversification studies typicall place the origin of human type languages at least before 100,000 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Methods are highly disputed.</p>
<p>Richard Klein for example places language 50,000 years ago and he's not alone.</p>
