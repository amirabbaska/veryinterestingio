Once they start, the process finishes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm understanding you correctly, there's another party trick you can do with a beer bottle that uses this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Fill an empty beer bottle up with water* to the point where the straight sides of the bottle meet the shoulders, then slam your hand down on the open top. This pushes the bottom of the bottle away from the bottom of the water, creating a bubble, or cavitation. The bubble is vacuum, however, so when it collapses, it breaks the bottom of the bottle clean off.</p>
<p>*Edit: forgot to mention that you fill it up with water.</p>
<p>**Edit 2: Also forgot to mention that you should be holding the bottle by the neck in your other hand when you hit it. Don't, like, leave it on a table or something and try to hit it. </p></div>		</li>
