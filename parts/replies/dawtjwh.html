<p>I think it's really important to point out that these things take more work because they are NOT the default functioning of your brain.  The grey matter in your head does not WANT to contradict itself, and it requires not just time but emotional fortitude to critique your news.  This isn't just true about things you care about - once you've had a thought, that is the preferred thought.  It's your &quot;frame.&quot;</p>
<p>If you're new to the &quot;holy shit, I could be wrong about ANYTHING&quot; phase of learning (this phase is recurring - you'll get it when you're 70 if you care to), pay attention when you start to fact-check your news.  You will <em>literally feel uncomfortable</em> when reading contradictory facts, and will feel a sense of relief when you corroborate something that seemed like it may have been untrue.  </p>
<p>Bias isn't something that happens because we watch shit news, we watch shit news because we're biased - and bias is built into the fundamental mechanics of the human brain.</p>
<p>EDIT: Hell, you could argue bias <strong>IS</strong> the fundamental mechanism of the human brain.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How they acquire the information and what is the desired goal of publican is also helpful.  The OP's example of Washington Post is interesting.  They've been riding on the success of the Watergate reporting for decades.  This is the premier example of good journalism, strong editorial decision making, and brave publishing.  </p>
<p>However... it does change your understanding of the events a bit when you know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ben Bradlee, executive editor: office of naval intelligence.</li>
<li>Bob Woodward, journalist: office of naval intelligence.</li>
<li>Mark Felt, &quot;deep throat&quot; leaker:  Deputy director of the FBI, head of COINTELPRO.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird" target="_blank">Operation Mockingbird</a>: a campaign by the United States Central Intelligence Agency to influence media during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.</li>
