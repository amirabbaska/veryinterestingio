			<div class="markdown"><p>I have one of the worst cases of the flu I’ve ever had. I’m pretty sure walking is saving my life right now. I walk to work and I’m a server so I walk at work (I’m sick but I can’t afford to take off more than one day a week). The first fifteen minutes of my walk to work is pretty difficult but it gets easier. By the time I’m at work I’m pretty good and the walk home is ok. I don’t start to feel really bad again until I stop moving. </p></div>		</li>
