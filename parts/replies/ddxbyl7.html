			<div class="markdown"><p>The human body is not designed by &quot;what works best&quot;, that is not evolution's way. it is guided, as all evolution is, by &quot;What managed to spew out kids before dying that also had kids before dying&quot;, no more and no less.</p>
<p>We don't have it like that everywhere in the body because no one ever wound up with it that way and spread the genes to their kids. Evolution is quite blind, it cannot see an improvement - or anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But... we do.</p>
<p>If you cut yourself and bleed, the blood will flush out most of the nasty stuff that can give you infections. It's not foolproof (because reality isn't a Quentin Tarantino movie) but it really works quite well. </p>
<p>Bleeding, combined with your immune system, is why you don't infections every week.</p></div>		</li>
