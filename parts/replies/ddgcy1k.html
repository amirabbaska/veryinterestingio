			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is, at least to some extent, an objective shared reality on many things. </p>
<p>Just because someone claims to doubt something doesn't automatically make the suspicion legitimate or worthy of consideration in the overall true-ness of something. When there is a unanimous consensus of a &quot;learned class&quot; -- scientists, to use your example, about something we simply can't prove ourselves, we take them at their word and have for centuries.</p>
<p>Plus, you can see all 8 planets (and Pluto) yourself with a powerful enough telescope. We universally agree that those bodies are called what they're called and if you can find and see them yourself that's irrefutable proof they exist as far as I'm concerned.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens then when there isn't a unanimous consensus (there rarely is) then?</p>
<p>When there are opposing views, we will tend to go with the one we support personally, regardless of whatever facts or data you show. The human mind is very good at rejecting things that don't fit in with expected patterns. If someone believes that climate change is not occurring, then no amount of facts will ever satisfy them. They will find ways to force them to fit their pattern (climate change isn't happening) even if they are meant to prove the contrary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Climate change is an outlier as far as scientific consensus goes. Better than 95% of climate scientists say climate change is real and caused by humans, yet many people doubt it. Can you name one other thing 95% of scientists say is true that people have a shred of doubt about? I can't. Again, just because someone doubts something, it doesn't automatically give the doubt any actual heft.</p></div>		</li>

<p>People have learned not to trust those establishments though. Lately, discoveries are flying in the face of beliefs that have been held since childhood, or beliefs that someone builds their whole life upon. </p>
<p>More realistically, the way the news reports on scientific breakthrough has been doing a lot to weaken the trust in science overall. When a hack journalist puts out a headline that says &quot;BREAKTHROUGH SUBSTANCE WILL REPLACE PLASTIC IN 4 YEARS!&quot; but the actual science is that someone found Graphene and nobody knows how to anything with it yet, you and I know that the journalist is looking for clicks, and isn't representing the facts correctly, but someone else who doesn't know anything about the topic might just think that scientists were lying to the media to get attention and funding. </p>
<p>The establishment has worn away a lot of its own credibility over the years, while at the same time, people are losing their ability to understand what's going on in science, and how the scientific method works. More and more of the world is made up by things that you can't see with your own eyes. When you lead a simple &quot;touch based&quot; lifestyle, you naturally distrust all of those other things, and feel like everyone is trying to pull one over on you.</p></div>		</li>

Things are not as absolute as you wish they were, shades of grey will naturally exist in any discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two colleagues and I were driving home after work and the one asked if the light above behind the cloud is from the sun or the moon. I said the sun, they both insisted it's the moon. </p>
<p>I explained to them that the moon hasn't risen yet and it wouldn't emit so much light. Her response: &quot;The moon doesn't rise.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day I showed her a website which shows the sun and moon rise/set times. She replied that she still doesn't believe it <em>because she wasn't taught that in school.</em> </p></div>		</li>
