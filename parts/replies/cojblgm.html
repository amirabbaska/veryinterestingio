			<p>&gt; I find it hard to believe that I would be able to ride a boat around the world, look at some birds (I'm paraphrasing), and come up with, well, natural selection, without already knowing what I know.<br><br>But Darwin knew a lot about competition and struggle from Malthus' political theory, 'transmutation' from Lamarck, the age of the earth from Lyell, and the application of natural law to man from Chambers (the Vestiges published anonymously). Historians of science have gone so far as to say you can trace the history of evolutionary thought almost without Darwin, and thus not to take anything away from his originality in presenting an original interpretation of an age-old problem with experimental support, it is telling that Alfred Russel Wallace was able to publish almost the same theory independently several years before Darwin (though the latter had been working on it in his personal notebooks ever since the Beagle voyage). </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not implying that Darwin (or Wallace) was working in intellectual isolation, I'm just trying to compare the body of knowledge even a layperson has today, one that seems to make the very concept of evolution seem straightforward, to what existed in the early-to-mid-19th century. </p>		</li>

			<p>And I agree with the sentiment of it appearing so clear now that it makes historical empathy difficult, I just didn't want someone reading to get the wrong impression that Darwin simply came up with natural selection in a context where nobody was considering it, where in fact many were (or at least providing material conducive to the development of such a theory) :)</p>		</li>

			<p>Please correct me if I am in error but I dont believe Wallace published &quot;years&quot; before CD. In fact wasn't Darwin compelled to publish when he was made aware of Wallaces work, but Origin was basically finished, he was being cautious, compiling mountain of evidence to support his theory? Wallace defered to Darwin, as they were both gentleman scientists and Darwin was clearly first.<br><br>And also, for those of you who think CD was stating the nearly obvious, how do you account for his influence on great men, like t.h huxley, who famously challenged a theist:<br><br> I would rather be the son of apes than a man afraid to face the truth (paraphrase).</p>		</li>

			<p>You are essentially right; Wallace published works addressing evolution such as the 'Sarawak Law' paper in 1855 a number of years before Darwin, but only in private correspondence did he explicitly put the idea of 'natural selection' to him very soon before Darwin was prompted to publish by Lyell and Hooker. The 'Origin' actually represents an introduction of sorts to Darwin's work on evolution; he was intending to publish a far more substantial volume, however was stimulated by Wallace to release a far shorter, more accessible work in 1859. </p>		</li>

			<p>It's almost always forgotten, but Darwin and Wallace announced natural selection to the world together in a joint publication.<br><br>Wallace published a paper in 1855 that laid out his Sarawak law (&quot;Every species has come into existence coincident both in time and space with a pre-existing closely allied species&quot;), and discusses evolution, descent with modification due to environmental pressures etc. Essentially everything but explicitly describing natural selection. At this point Darwin had been at it for years but hadn't published.<br><br>Wallace subsequently wrote another paper describing natural selection (though not by that name) that he sent to Darwin. Darwin read it and thought it was so similar to his own work that he wrote to Charles Lyell saying that Wallace's ideas were essentially his own chapter headings. They jointly published their work together in 1858, though Wallace was off chasing beetles in a jungle at the time and it was actually published without his consent. Being a chronically humble man and an outsider to the scientific establishment he didn't complain. Darwin then published Origin the next year.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes but those theories of 'evolution' described transmutation from simple to complex organisms in a progressive fashion, offering teleological explanations to the problem of speciation.

			<p>Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time. This is the seminal concept that you must understand first, and if you don't, go look up those words and figure it out.<br><br>This can happen in several ways. There can be a mutation. There can be incoming genetic variation. There can be random changes or genetic &quot;drift,&quot; especially in small populations. Or there can be natural selection. So natural selection is one mechanism (some say the primary mechanism, although I actually disagree) of evolution.<br><br>I hope this helps.</p>		</li>

			<p>This isn't quite scanning for me.<br><br>Genetic variation, mutation, etc. describe means by which the alleles change, right? And, then natural selection really nothing more than the observation that individuals that are lucky enough to get genetic changes which are advantageous are more likely to survive (and pass on the changes). Conversely, individuals that are unlucky enough to get changes which are disadvantageous don't survive (and don't pass on those changes).<br><br>The way you are writing it makes it sound like natural selection <em>causes</em> changes, and I feel fairly certain it's not proper to describe it that way.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Genetic drift and natural selection operate above the individual, at the population scale. In essence, they explain probabilistic patterns in which mutations arising in a single individual are spread throughout an entire population.<br><br>I think you understand this, because what you are saying is correct. I would just say that natural selection and genetic drift aren't usually approached by biologists as an outcome after the fact, but instead as a 'force' acting presently or previously on populations. I'm not sure if this is a bit of a longshot comparison, but I could argue the 'forces' of natural selection and drift are somewhat analogous to our concept of entropy.<br><br>Mutations produce genetic variation in an individual, but natural selection/genetic drift are crucial mechanisms in spreading that variation throughout a population.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah I totally see what you're saying. It's funny - in the evolutionary bio course I took, mutation, natural selection, genetic drift and gene flow were lumped together under the &quot;four mechanisms of evolution&quot;.

			<p>I'd be interested in /u/ktool's answer, but if he doesn't come back, I'll share my thoughts.<br><br>Mutation could be considered by some to be the primary mechanism of evolution, due to the fact that it is the only thing that actually introduces new alleles into a population. If organisms reproduced flawlessly all the time, there would be no new sources of genetic variation, so we wouldn't see any new developments in any species. The overwhelming majority of mutations are harmful to individuals, but the select few that aren't have the potential to spread quickly through a population.<br><br>Genetic drift could be also be argued to be more of a primary mechanism, since I believe the majority of alleles in an organism aren't under natural selection. It depends on how you define &quot;primary&quot;. Evolution isn't goal-oriented, so genetic drift may be a stronger force acting on alleles overall.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm interested in how we differentiate between harmful and beneficial mutations.

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cardboard_dinosaur" target="_blank">cardboard_dinosaur</a>
			<p>If a mutation causes individuals to have a higher genetic representation in the next generation then it is beneficial - if they leave more/better offspring than someone without it. This is all relative and it isn't binary i.e. not 'can reproduce vs unable to reproduce'.<br><br>Measuring fitness is actually pretty complicated and people still argue about what exactly fitness is and how we should measure it. The most holistic way to do it is, as /u/waterflock says, measure an allele's frequency over time and see whether it goes up or down. In practice, though, we don't always have the time or logistical capability for that, and so measure fitness proxies (also because we're more often than not looking at the fitness contribution of a trait rather than a mutation). So in Drosophila, say, that might be put two males and a female in an arena and the male to mate first wins. For females it might be mating them once to a standard male and counting offspring production (their fecundity). Doing that kind of stuff with a single mutation means standardising two strains - one with the mutation and one without, but otherwise identical genetically (or at least containing the same genetic variation) - and comparing their fitness measures. If individuals with it have higher fitness than those without then it's beneficial, if it's the other way around, harmful.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;  In practice, though, we don't always have the time or logistical capability for that, and so measure fitness proxies<br><br>Yes, it really is a shame we know so little. There is also the possibility that a mutation continues to be preserved and distributed in the gene pool even though it doesn't exactly contribute to fitness (or anything else for that matter) because the processes of mutation/selection make errors, too. Although it might be premature to draw that kind of conclusion this early since we're only meant to do that when that mutation has run its course, so to speak- which again brings us to our limited capabilities.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cardboard_dinosaur" target="_blank">cardboard_dinosaur</a>
			<p>Well you can account for genetic drift by design. Rather than setting up one population and counting the frequency of an allele at each generation, you set up several replicate populations and track it in all of them. Afterwards you can then perform statistical tests try and see whether it looks like any change in allele frequencies is due to chance. If something has no effect on fitness then there should be no consistent pattern of change across all the populations you set up.<br><br>Also, there are many valid reasons why you might want to measure fitness proxies rather than track allele frequency changes - it's not always just because of a limitation. An allele might have different effects in males and females, you might care about measuring a trait rather than a mutation, you might want to know <em>how</em> something is contributing to fitness rather than just whether or not it does etc.</p>		</li>

			<p>You can only tell it by the power of hindsight. If, after many generations, this mutation is present in a lot of descendants then you can say it was &quot;beneficial&quot;.

			<p>Evolution is the simple part -- things descend from each other and change over time. Natural selection is a theory to explain why these changes appear to make animals that are designed specially to fit into separate niches.

			<p>Natural selection is one of the main forces that drives evolution. The others being mutation and genetic drift, some consider gene flow one of the main forces as well. Natural selection acts on individuals whereas the unit of evolution is the population. An example of natural selection would be the beak of a finch being long enough to reach seeds underground and another finch who's beak isn't quite long enough, the finch with the shorter beak dies. This means the finch with a longer beak was selected for. Over time, granted the environment doesn't change greatly, you will see very few short beaked finches and numerous longer beaked finches, now evolution has taken place. Over simplified but I hope it helped. </p>		</li>

			<p>I think this reinforces a fallacy that evolution needs something that &quot;drives&quot; it. Some kind of Cosmic Evaluator, or Evolution Fairy that overlooks the individuals, determines some well-defined fitness and decides which ones get to reproduce. Yes you probably don't mean it that way but laypeople often have this misconception.<br><br>But there is no mediator involved in the process. If this is not cleared up, people often think that evolutionary logic is circular or a tautology because we say that evolution is survival/reproduction of the fittest, while fitness is defined as a higher chance of survival/reproduction; so we didn't explain anything. Of course it's not that way, but that's an easy confusion to fall into.<br><br>There is no separate &quot;evolution&quot; process going on. It's not something extra that goes on in the background, it's just a large-scale pattern of all at the individual organisms reproducing, over long times. Again, maybe you've never encountered this kind of thinking so you may think I'm crazy, but I know a lot of people are baffled by this little twist in thought, and once it's cleared out of the way, it just all makes sense for the first time for many people.<br><br>Also, what part of the process you describe as natural selection or genetic drift is not a clear cut thing. You may say that NS is something that's useful for the individual, but that's anthropomorphizing evolution. Survival and reproduction are not 'success', there is no game being played. It's simply that certain alleles in a certain environment have more copies in the next generation than another allele. Not by some outside force, but it just simply happens. The organisms go about their business, meet up, reproduce, then you have a new organism. All of the process eventually comes down to actual individual organisms doing their stuff, swimmin/walking around, without asking for guidance from some Evolutionary Process. Each and every death has an actual story to it and there is no separate Elimination from the Gene Pool action performed by some benevolent gardener weeding them out.<br><br>This fallacy can lead to thinking that &quot;organisms are supposed to be reproducing&quot; as it it were some Rule Of Evolution to be followed. Or asking what the purpose of a certain organ or appendage is; even leading to the fallacy of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; that for example the eye is too complex and it wouldn't work unless all parts are there. The key thing is that nothing is &quot;supposed to be performing&quot; any particular function. A nose can evolve into a trunk, colonies of cells can evolve into multicellular organisms etc.<br><br>Maybe this helps someone.</p>		</li>

I feel that standard evolutionary biology textbooks also give this false idea to new people. That there is some extra force, some extra purpose to evolution. Not in a Spaghetti Monster or God kind of way of course. Just that there would be a &quot;biological law&quot; that overrules physical laws, some extra process running in the background. There's nothing &quot;extra&quot; above what is just actually going on with the individual animals, just scaled up and seen from a statistical point of view.<br><br>I don't really know how to explain. The same way that the hand is nothing more than the palm and the fingers. There is no extra hand object there. Similarly there is no extra evolutionary process.

			<p>First and foremost: I'm not proposing any change to the modern mainstream theory of evolution. I'm just discussing a mental barrier to the uninitiated person that results from poor early explanations. Not necessarily this particular thread, but it seemed fitting for me to write it here.<br><br>As a child/teenager I already &quot;believed in evolution&quot; but I didn't even really understand the main idea. It was very confusing but I just basically believed it because it was all over biology class in school, TV documentaries like Discovery and National Geographic and books. And I've met many others who got into the same fallacy. It's not even a complicated scientific thing, just a twisted and wrong way of looking at the whole process.<br><br>Let's not focus on humans because it introduces some baggage and it hinders our intuition. Let's say animals in general. Of course the ones that survive and evolve will have reproduced sexually. But they aren't playing some game where they are supposed to be doing this. Many of them don't do it and they just die and that's it. You may say that they failed it and didn't manage to do their evolutionary task, but there is no game being played that could be failed. It's just that the next generation will be the offspring of those that did reproduce. It's a &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;indifferent&quot; universe.<br><br>How can I find an analogy... It's similar to the Just world fallacy or the Gambler's fallacy with coin tosses: The individual coin tosses aren't &quot;trying to&quot; make the results balanced in the long run. Coin tosses don't have access to some global scheme of things. But nevertheless, even such independent events can lead to a global pattern that the head-tails ratio gets closer and closer to 0.5 with time.<br><br>Similarly, &quot;evolution&quot; isn't telling anything to the organisms. They simply do their stuff, look for food and mates because that's what their brain causes them to do. They aren't considering any evolutionary Rules of Life. Species that go extinct aren't &quot;punished&quot;, they just simply don't reproduce and that's it. There is no additional loss.<br><br>Such people may believe evolution has foresight; that there are actual transitional forms in a strong sense; that there is (irreducible) group selection; that animals care for the &quot;survival of the species&quot;; that there is a Great Chain of Being and an active force drives species to &quot;level up&quot; and we can contemplate what the next level is for us. Sometimes some of these things are explicitly ruled out as misconceptions even in school books, but the main underlying idea can <em>still</em> stay there: that there <em>is</em> an evolutionary game.<br><br>Now most of these thoughts <em>can</em> be repaired and you <em>can</em> sensibly discuss something similar to each of these topics but the fundamental basis of them, posed as such, is just a misconception. Maybe you never had this misconception and therefore don't &quot;get&quot; what I'm saying. It's hard to look at things with a fresh eye once you have sorted it out for yourself.<br><br>Of course, once someone understands this, there is no problem in using &quot;naive&quot; language; just as you can say &quot;sunrise&quot; and &quot;sunset&quot; even if you know that the sun isn't really moving around.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fair enough and I agree with your stance; however, I was curious about your view on that asexual reproduction scenario because I got the sense you were more open-minded (for lack of a better word) about the process of evolution.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ah okay, I misunderstood your question.<br><br>It isn't unthinkable, in the sense that there are some animal species where the female occasionally gives birth to its own clone, it's called parthenogenesis.<br><br>But the key thing is that asexual reproduction simply creates clones (with a few mutations), while sexual reproduction 'combines' two genomes and that results in faster adaptation to the environment, so I guess the sexually reproducing animals would leave more descendants in the long run compared to the ones that just clone themselves generation after generation.<br><br>If somehow there would be a huge shortage in men, perhaps such an asexual, self-cloning reproduction method could also evolve in humans over a long time. By that I mean that maybe some women would have a random mutation that makes them able to spontaneously give birth to their clones, then they may have more offsprings than those who cannot do this because there are no men around or only very few (although extinction is more probable in such extreme cases I guess).<br><br>So, it's certainly not impossible but I don't see any indication that this would happen so I don't find it &quot;reasonable&quot; it in this sense at all.<br><br>I'm not sure if this answers your question.</p>		</li>

			<p>`&gt; Maybe you never had this misconception and therefore don't &quot;get&quot; what I'm saying. It's hard to look at things with a fresh eye once you have sorted it out for yourself.<br><br>So true. Understanding evolution requires both a textbook understanding of the underlying processes, but more importantly I believe, a considerable amount of critical thinking about the probable &quot;what if&quot; scenarios that a species would encounter over time due to changing environments, periods of abundance or lack thereof, competition for resources, competition for reproduction, group behavior and individual behavior and many more that do not come to mind at the moment.<br><br>I have seen too many commenters in layman discussions (I am admittedly a layman btw) who apply a direct linear logic to evolution and hence do not grasp the more disorganized, haphazard, sloppy way that evolution does its thing in a variety of diverse circumstances.  <br><br>Further, as you allude to with respect to human evolution, it is clear to me that the science is distortive in an effort to prove similarities when in fact the evolutionary history has been one that has resulted in a vast degree of diversity, coupled with rapid changes due to the various conversions from hunter/gatherer to farmer to city states to ancient civilizations to dark ages to modern day - a process that is continuing to rapidly occur as we speak.  Perhaps as socially advanced animals this is a necessity.  But it nevertheless is distortive to the efforts of scientific advancement.<br><br>Further, a topic that does not get addressed but one that is eminently reasonable given an understanding of evolution and thinking through of its consequences in various environmental conditions is the trend towards entropy during favorable times for reproductive survival.  Roman civilization collapsed when society long long was able to maintain itself, let alone build the great monuments of the past.  Could entropy have played a contributing, perhaps even the primary role in this event and conversely, could the plagues of the Middle Ages have contributed to the reinvigoration of the species and its renaissance (to play on words)?  Third rail stuff, but evolution is not altruistic in the sense that it has a higher social purpose, rather it is a cold, objective, on-going and messy process of the tautological survival of those and their offspring who are most fit to survive in the particular environments and changes in environmental over time that they find themselves in.</p>		</li>

			<p>I seriously cannot figure out what you're saying.<br><br>Are you trying to make some connection between biological evolution (patterns of change in allele frequencies in the population) and historical events like the collapse of the Roman Empire? Do you mean that the change from hunter/gatherer to ... to modern day was a genetic change? AFAIK genetic evicence shows that humans haven't substantially changed genetically in the last few hundred thousand years.<br><br>But then you go over to entropy which is at best metaphorically connected to decline... And then you skip some centuries in the same sentence and talk about the plagues? Do you mean that the Enlightenment and the scientific revolution happened because the plague survivors tended to be more intelligent? I'd need a lot of evidence for that, it's a very shaky speculation in itself.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;AFAIK genetic evicence shows that humans haven't substantially changed genetically in the last few hundred thousand years.&quot;<br><br>How do you then explain the significant physiological differences between the far more robust and powerful Cro Magnon Man and present day humans or man's hybridization with Neanderthals , or the fact that the modern human's brain size is significantly smaller than either of these predecessors?<br><br>Perhaps the dissonance lies with what is the meaning of substantial.  If it represents the percentage change in total genetic composition, then certainly there is not much change since we are discussing a process that has been in place for a billion or so years.  But percentage change and attribute change are on vastly different scales. <br><br>Of course it is speculation that the plague changed the composition of attributes within various civilizations, but it is reasoned speculation.  <br><br>There are about 60 genetic mutations with every birth.  Most are benign, some on occasion are bad, and on very rare occasions one comes along that enhances some attribute that offers a competitive advantage.  There would be roughly 5,000 or more generations during the past 100,000 years.  There were literally tens of thousands of clans/tribes through out the planet hunting, gathering and reproducing. Over time these genetic mutations drift into the general population of the clan/tribe/civilization, whatever its parameters at the time were.  Interactions with outside clans/tribes/populations create hybridizations, further widening the diversity of attributes. <br><br>When the environment is favorable, far more alleles will survive in the gene pool, including mutations that weaken but do not impede reproduction.  When the environment is harsh (famine/disease/climate change), those attributes that are best able to survive this harsh environment do so leaving a remaining population with a different proportionate mix of stronger (more survivable) attributes than before.  </p>		</li>
