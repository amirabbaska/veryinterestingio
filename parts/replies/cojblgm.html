<p>I find it hard to believe that I would be able to ride a boat around the world, look at some birds (I'm paraphrasing), and come up with, well, natural selection, without already knowing what I know.</p>

<p>But Darwin knew a lot about competition and struggle from Malthus' political theory, 'transmutation' from Lamarck, the age of the earth from Lyell, and the application of natural law to man from Chambers (the Vestiges published anonymously). Historians of science have gone so far as to say you can trace the history of evolutionary thought almost without Darwin, and thus not to take anything away from his originality in presenting an original interpretation of an age-old problem with experimental support, it is telling that Alfred Russel Wallace was able to publish almost the same theory independently several years before Darwin (though the latter had been working on it in his personal notebooks ever since the Beagle voyage). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not implying that Darwin (or Wallace) was working in intellectual isolation, I'm just trying to compare the body of knowledge even a layperson has today, one that seems to make the very concept of evolution seem straightforward, to what existed in the early-to-mid-19th century. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I agree with the sentiment of it appearing so clear now that it makes historical empathy difficult, I just didn't want someone reading to get the wrong impression that Darwin simply came up with natural selection in a context where nobody was considering it, where in fact many were (or at least providing material conducive to the development of such a theory) :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please correct me if I am in error but I dont believe Wallace published &quot;years&quot; before CD. In fact wasn't Darwin compelled to publish when he was made aware of Wallaces work, but Origin was basically finished, he was being cautious, compiling mountain of evidence to support his theory? Wallace defered to Darwin, as they were both gentleman scientists and Darwin was clearly first.</p>
<p>And also, for those of you who think CD was stating the nearly obvious, how do you account for his influence on great men, like t.h huxley, who famously challenged a theist:</p>
<p>I would rather be the son of apes than a man afraid to face the truth (paraphrase).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are essentially right; Wallace published works addressing evolution such as the 'Sarawak Law' paper in 1855 a number of years before Darwin, but only in private correspondence did he explicitly put the idea of 'natural selection' to him very soon before Darwin was prompted to publish by Lyell and Hooker. The 'Origin' actually represents an introduction of sorts to Darwin's work on evolution; he was intending to publish a far more substantial volume, however was stimulated by Wallace to release a far shorter, more accessible work in 1859. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's almost always forgotten, but Darwin and Wallace announced natural selection to the world together in a joint publication.</p>
<p>Wallace published a paper in 1855 that laid out his Sarawak law (&quot;Every species has come into existence coincident both in time and space with a pre-existing closely allied species&quot;), and discusses evolution, descent with modification due to environmental pressures etc. Essentially everything but explicitly describing natural selection. At this point Darwin had been at it for years but hadn't published.</p>
<p>Wallace subsequently wrote another paper describing natural selection (though not by that name) that he sent to Darwin. Darwin read it and thought it was so similar to his own work that he wrote to Charles Lyell saying that Wallace's ideas were essentially his own chapter headings. They jointly published their work together in 1858, though Wallace was off chasing beetles in a jungle at the time and it was actually published without his consent. Being a chronically humble man and an outsider to the scientific establishment he didn't complain. Darwin then published Origin the next year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but those theories of 'evolution' described transmutation from simple to complex organisms in a progressive fashion, offering teleological explanations to the problem of speciation. 'Natural selection' was the crucial part, and indeed as you suggest and my reference to A.R.W alludes to, the period was ripe for such a theory to emerge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I have a small question, I think. When people talk about evolution and natural selection, are they the same idea or concept? I'd like to be able to use these terms when discussing the concept with someone else but I'd like to first make sure I'm using them correctly. If you can shed any light on how to differentiate the two that would be extremely helpful. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time. This is the seminal concept that you must understand first, and if you don't, go look up those words and figure it out.</p>
<p>This can happen in several ways. There can be a mutation. There can be incoming genetic variation. There can be random changes or genetic &quot;drift,&quot; especially in small populations. Or there can be natural selection. So natural selection is one mechanism (some say the primary mechanism, although I actually disagree) of evolution.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution is the simple part -- things descend from each other and change over time. Natural selection is a theory to explain why these changes appear to make animals that are designed specially to fit into separate niches. Try these <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5cXKQUh6bVQC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=pinker+%22brown+and+beige+ones%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4QqlAacY6R&amp;sig=Ns5zE_3IRdyTd2SuM0Rwf1dKzrk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-1wPVOj3L4b_yQT8vYGoAg&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pinker%20%22brown%20and%20beige%20ones%22&amp;f=false" target="_blank">three pages by Steven Pinker</a> to understand natural selection (includes diagrams, start with the paragraph under my highlight).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural selection is one of the main forces that drives evolution. The others being mutation and genetic drift, some consider gene flow one of the main forces as well. Natural selection acts on individuals whereas the unit of evolution is the population. An example of natural selection would be the beak of a finch being long enough to reach seeds underground and another finch who's beak isn't quite long enough, the finch with the shorter beak dies. This means the finch with a longer beak was selected for. Over time, granted the environment doesn't change greatly, you will see very few short beaked finches and numerous longer beaked finches, now evolution has taken place. Over simplified but I hope it helped. </p></div>		</li>
