			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yeah, but the thing is that you maby listen to 20 songs at a time.
Each time you start the playlist once more the shuffle/repeat can still play previously played songs again. </p>
<p>As a heavy spotify listener and early user I fully agree that the shuffle setting is biased. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah I don't get what everyone's saying here; when I hit shuffle it plays the same playlist in a different order.</p>
<p>maybe they mean they played the playlist again and got the same songs, which makes sense because every time you hit play you get a different shuffle.</p>
<p>I don't know how they could claim they got the same 20 songs (more than once) unless they had it on non-stop for several hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think its about playing through one continuous shuffle, but trying to reshuffle the same group of songs multiple times. </p>
<p>Example: I turn on my phone and ask it to shuffle all 2000 songs to listen to at work on Monday. I only listen to about 100 of them, and then listen to something else so the shuffled queue is now gone.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning, I get to work and ask my phone to shuffle all 2000 songs. I only listen to 100 songs, and notice that 50 of them are songs I heard yesterday. Then I hear those same 50 on Wednesday, and Thursday, and Friday. By the end of a month, I've noticed that 1700 of my 2000 songs have never been played, and every time I try to shuffle &quot;all&quot; of my songs, I only seem to be shuffling the same top chunk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a playlist with about 800 songs (49 hours of music).</p>
<p>Every day on the subway, I open that playlist, and press shuffle. </p>
<p>Every day I hear almost the same songs during a 40 minute trip.</p>
<p>Why are the other 48 hours worth of songs so rarely playing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a really hard time believing this. I hear people saying this often, but I've never had the issue. </p>
<p>I've read posts from Spotify where they couldn't recreate the issue either. </p>
<p>Hook up your spotify to last.fm and track your songs when it's on shuffle. I'm pretty sure the shuffle is also reset anytime you skip a song. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you tried shuffling after playing a less well-played song? I've gotten better results from doing that. Even playing lesser known songs from the same artist will usually mix up my playlist a fair bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This worked for me. I turned shuffle off and played a song I hadn't heard recently. Then, when I turned shuffle back on it was like a completely different playlist. Had to do this every day in order to keep things random. Kind of a pain but it did work. </p></div>		</li>
