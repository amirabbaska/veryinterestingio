			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends on the context, too.</p>
<p>Maybe we like to feel that acts of niceness/kindness are needed from us on a random and limited basis. And if feels like a pattern, or a serial chore, we are less inclined to do it spontaneously.</p>
<p>It's one thing to be approached once by someone collecting money for charity on the streets while you are walking to or from work, but what if that happens every 50 meters? </p>
<p>It's not that, because you gave money to one of them, the others need it less. But you sure will feel different about donating after the first or second time, even if it's a small amount.</p>
<p>Or suppose that, instead of people collecting money, it's people dropping their bags in front of you every 50 meters, or old ladies needing help to cross every other street. The predictability, even the apparent deliberateness of it, might lessen your willingness to help, even if they are all just spontaneous, uncoordinated random events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this kind of like the same thing the threshold thread talks about? You can build threshold, but does this mean you have to keep practicing otherwise the &quot;muscle&quot; resorts back to normal? For example, if I'm a 6/10 in a muscle area, I train daily to make it 10/10. Overtime I don't train it, so do I go back to the 6/10 rate?</p>
<p>And also, since genetics is probably involved, does this mean some people will have more willpower (or any attributes in relation to what we are discussing) than others? Let's say my background are Taiwanese WWII survivors, we developed some sort of will power, and it carries on to me. I have the capacity to work harder, and have will power to stay on the shop making iphones longer. Is this something true?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? The few things I've read on this topic seem to imply it's an inbuilt thing and you just have to learn to deal with your own level of willpower (like how to trick yourself, or ways to minimize decision making) Do you happen to have a link or book suggestion? I'd <strong>really</strong> love to increase my willpower in 2017!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>purple--other</del>  The Star Sapphires.  Their power comes from love, but it's not...good.  It's a jealous, zealous, controlling love, that seeks to <em>own</em> the object of affection.  They're sometimes helpful to the Green Lanterns, but just as often against them.</p>
<p>There's also the Indigo Tribe.  They're powered by compassion and they're...weird.  For instance, the lantern rings can translate any language...except it can't translate the language used by the Indigo Tribe, because they're weird.</p>

<p>I think red is the weakest. They have like 30 members and their best guy isnt stupid powerful like the other corps that only have a few members.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion#Criticism" target="_blank">There is yet much evidence that ego depletion is not real</a>.  I'm not offering that like I'm trying to say you're wrong, just pointing out the criticism.  Recent studies have not been able to reproduce any evidence that ego depletion exists, and suggests that it may be a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo" target="_blank">nocebo effect</a>: because people believe ego depletion exists, they are more likely to behave as if it does.</p>
<p>If memory serves, that was part of a big controversy in psychology surrounding a number of experiments that could not be reproduced, casting a lot of doubt on some of the foundations of psychology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct. A large scale effort by many labs to replicate ego depletion effects has failed.</p>

<p>A frustrating aspect of science is that ruling out one explanation rarely yields an alternative explanation. So after a lot of time, effort, and money, you end up with less certainty than you started with.</p></div>		</li>
