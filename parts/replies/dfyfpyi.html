			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, doctors and consultants tend not to be, but nursing staff in particular, very much so. A lot of talk about horoscopes, mediums, the whole thing.  I'm not sure whether nursing attracts people more susceptible to those beliefs, or if the job tends to push people in that direction, or even if that's just observation bias. Certainly almost all the people I work with are that way, but  I don't know if that's the case elsewhere in the hospital.</p>
<p>I will say that most of them don't believe in alternative medicine, thankfully. One does, however. She thinks she can do reiki (spelling?), and that's basically the one exception to my approach of just letting people have their beliefs. It's fine, but I see it as kinda unethical to bring into a medical environment, especially around terminally ill patients. To my knowledge she's never brought it up around patients, because I'd be inclined to bring that up with management if she did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a nurse, I find that a lot of my colleagues have spiritual beliefs. However, usually they belong to an organized religion or they have very vague &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot; beliefs that give them comfort but don't effect their behavior. As for why this is, my personal opinion is that spiritual beliefs are more common than reddit would have you believe in general and that health care has historically found a lot of support in churches (in America a good portion of hospitals were founded by churches). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, MDs are as prone to 'magical thinking' as any profession.  Not sure about nurses although I've known plenty who espouse plenty of odd beliefs, again roughly in proportion to the population at large.  I mean both are good at what they do but outside of this, no bet.  I've had this conversation many times now since Ben Carson popped up on the political radar, as in 'how can a brain surgeon be bizarre in other areas?'  My answer: I'm not surprised in the least.</p></div>		</li>
