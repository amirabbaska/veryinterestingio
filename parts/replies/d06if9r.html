			<div class="markdown"><p>Other trippy, sperm-preserving facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>During the fertile period of a woman's cycle, her cervix secretes a special, egg-white-like mucus that provides a hospitable medium for the sperm (and also balances the hostile, acidic vaginal pH). The os of the cervix also softens and opens a bit to make it easier for the sperm to enter and get to safe haven...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That safe haven is &quot;crypts&quot; in the cervix that store sperm and allow them to &quot;capacitate,&quot; i.e. mature into their next phase. These crypts release the sperm in batches over the next day or so to increase their chance of meeting a ready egg.</p>
</li>
<li>White blood cells are present in the uterus and do eventually consume the sperm that are unsuccessful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, yes, various biological factors are present to kill the invading sperm, but the body makes it a little easier on them sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the inside of the uterus is a vascular kind of tissue called the endometrium. This is what is shed during a woman's period. It involves a lot of different bodily fluids including blood and mucus, so I would think that there are white blood cells in there.</p>
<p>As soon as you are inside the cervix, you are inside the body, much like after you swallow something, it is then &quot;inside&quot; the body.
Things in your mouth or vagina could be said to be outside the body still...</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body.&quot;

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, much like a blood-brain barrier, there is a blood-testes barrier. Certain conditions and illnesses can weaken it, which allows the immune system to enter, and destroy everything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) acidity/chemical composition. They have a kind of &quot;chemical map&quot; of which direction to move basing on environment composition.
2) sheer numbers. The above mechanism isn't very reliable. But if you inject 280 million of the little buggers at a time... yeah, some of them will wind up where they need to be, and the immunity system, despite doing its best simply can't deal with all of them in time.</p>
<p>Of course some will completely lose the way and end up quite elsewhere than they should, that's how you end up with non-zero sperm count in female urine for days after sex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really dislike this about many videos about how fertilization works; in the ones I've seen, it's always millions of sperm cells that don't just go around in generally random (brownian motion? not sure on that one) directions with a bias where eventually one of them gets lucky, but rather millions of sperm cells that all point in the same direction 'in a race', carefully navigating a course.</p></div>		</li>
