			<div class="markdown"><p>That TL;DR though. </p>
<p>With the cultural perception being different, isn't it that they have different meanings behind the words, not that the tactile sense (?) of identical soft sample is physically perceived differently? Or  do different cultures rate an identical sample differently? (for instance an average of 6/10 instead of a 4/10)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some put more emphasis on low friction and low density in their personal understanding of softness, while others would put more focus on tactility and how much feedback the material gives. Particularly for pillows and duvets; how much weight they can carry is a measurement of softness used in the industry, where a higher weight is normally better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this answer a lot. I think its really focused on the feeling of something like fur itself. I also agree completely that it depends of a huge number of factors, and a lot of our preconceived notions we bring to perception before we even touch something.</p>
<p>When it comes to more surface like structures (not hair, fur, etc) I think we are starting to get more objective answers on what sensations people can pickup and percieve on their fingers. The problem is, however, that we don't have a great shared language to talk about it so, as you say, &quot;cottony&quot; has no shared meaning. We need something that is objective &quot;softness&quot; in the same way &quot;blue&quot; is a (somewhat) objective description of a visual color!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a big problem. There was a <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6671586/?reload=true" target="_blank">paper</a> a few years ago that looked at vibrotactile sensation (they used exact frequencies and chords instead of texture, but it's the same process of sensation).  They used conconant and dissonant stimuli and allowed subjects to describe the sensation with any adjective.  While &quot;pleasant&quot; and &quot;unpleasant&quot; were on the list of common responses, my favorite are &quot;divine&quot; and &quot;blasphemous&quot; and &quot;muddy&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you elaborate on the cultural bit?</p>
<p>Are you saying that what we learn to call soft growing up affects what we actually feel in softness? What are the differences?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Commented above a bit on this but I'll expand a bit further because it fascinates me. Within the fabric industry, there is a device which characterizes the overall mechanical performance of a fabric or structure called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawabata_evaluation_system" target="_blank">Kawabata</a> Evaluation System. You output a set of mechanical constants for each material which tells you... something. That material is more plyable to others, etc. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/004051750007000510?journalCode=trjc" target="_blank">Work</a> been done to connect the KES values into a multi-variate equation for softness. So great, each material deforms and behaves differently. In that sense, its possible to create materials or fur with the best bending, compression and strength properties ever. </p>
<p>A human will respond to each of those properties and measure them, themselves. The issue is, how you prompt the consumer differently or they inherently weight the importance of those measures differently from region to region. So no one has yet to truly, objectively validate the mechanical measurements to the human response, and repeat that data over and over again. We (the royal we), just say &quot;o thats soft&quot;. Add in the effects of layers, and the equation gets more complex, or the fact that the device measures a limited amount of variables (heat transfer, sound, light scattering not included)</p>
<p>So is it something you grow up with? I'm not the person to answer that but I have seen the same materials with the same mechanical description get rated differently. I'd guess that our biomechanical responses across cultures to stimuli vary based on upbringing, and previous experiences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting, there is a lot of research on how culture affects how we experience pain. There's the common parenting trick of not acting worried when a child falls, I imagine that affects what threshold of pain they can take over time. Or your culture's view on healthcare, again, I would think that having to tough out certain sicknesses also leads to a higher pain tolerance. An accumulation of these behaviors can have significant differences between cultures on how they experience the same action. I wouldn't have thought it affected perception of softness, but it makes sense.</p>
<p>Thank you for your explanations, very interesting.</p></div>		</li>
