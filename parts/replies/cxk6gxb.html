			<div class="markdown"><p>The worst one I saw was a guy who got a lift with a couple of guys in their 20s.  They take him down a dirt road and say they just have to meet someone.  Before stopping they make a dodgy phone call which strongly implies they are mafia.</p>
<p>They come to a car on the side of the road and one person gets out to pick up a package.  Suddenly a shootout starts (drug deal gone bad) and the driver is now fake dead, with an angry stranger staring into the car ready to kill the others.</p>
<p>After the prank was over the prankee was asked to sign a release.  But his hand was shaking so much and he wasn't really laughing.  I could tell he was still very scared and not sure if it truly was a prank.  He did end up signing it but it showed me there is a real limit to how far pranks should go, and whether post-signing should be allowed in some cases.</p>
<p>I don't have a link to the prank sorry but it is on youtube.</p></div>		</li>
