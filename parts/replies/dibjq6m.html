			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what u/ajiggag said, some processors can have a lot of extra fees they can add on, which can be upwards of $.25 per swipe that they use to make it look like the overall rate is lower than it is, which is why a lot of smaller businesses have a minimum amount you have to spend before they'll accept your card. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I have just negotiated a new deal with our payment provider -  0.5% for credit cards (1.9% for Amex) and 0.3% for debit cards (European only - international cards are charged at around 1.2%) all with no transaction fee.</p>
<p>This is based on processing Â£8.5m annually.. you can pay far less with higher amounts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want an ELI25 we can get into the details but I alluded to the fact that interchange is dependent on fraud, platform (which is a proxy for risk profile and spending behavior), and negotiated merchant rates.  Debit cards are totally different from credit cards as far as interchange because they don't incentivize spending as much as credit cards and the fraud rates are lower (not to mention there is virtually no charge off rate).  Thus, the interchange is going to be a lot lower. </p></div>		</li>

<p>All of the interchange rates can be negotiated by the merchant. So for example, Walmart has a lot lower fee that your local mom and pop's store since they have a lot of leverage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interchange fees are not negotiable. Even companies like Walmart have set interchange fees, it's tiered.</p>
<p>The markup that the processor charges on top of interchange is what's negotiable. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amex tends to be the most expensive. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't accurate since 2015 when Amex rolled out OptBlue. However some processors are still being sneaky with Amex fees because businesses don't know better.</p></div>		</li>
