			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh... Most building codes around the world require egress doors to open in the direction of egress. So if there are a lot of people trying to get out quick, the door can't be pinned shut by the press of people. So more or less the opposite of what you're saying...</p>
<p><a href="https://codes.iccsafe.org/public/document/IBC2015/chapter-10-means-of-egress" target="_blank">ICC international building code 1010.1.2.1</a></p>
<p>Doors for rooms with smaller occupancy that aren't considered egress doors usually open in so they don't swing out into high traffic corridors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that’s his point, the door is indeed designed to swing in to the toilet for safety, but for a different reason (not a blocked door but the higher traffic corridor)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most buildings are big enough to have an occupancy of at least 2 in each restroom. Those that are single restrooms still have to meet the same code but only if it’s a commercial building. Building codes (especially commercial) have everything to do with lawyers and a little bit to do with safety. Also, not every municipality uses the international building code. Florida and I think California does, but a lot of the interior states don’t. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also remember reading that there doens't even have to be obstruction to make it dangerous , if there's smoke due to a fire on one side of the door and air in the bathroom/room it creates a vacuum-like scenario that would make the door difficult to push open and that alone could trap people.</p></div>		</li>
