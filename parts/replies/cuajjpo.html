<p>5 secs to 2 days after: The bank/credit card company is holding onto the money while they check all the info, make sure its all legit, go through federally mandated safety measures, etc.</p>
<p>2 to 3 days after: The merchant actually receives the money.</p>
<p>Now, just apply that in reverse for refunds. 5 seconds after the transaction, the money has left the merchant's account, then the bank does a day or two of processing, and then, 3 days later, you finally get the money.</p>
<p>It only LOOKS like its done in 5 seconds for payments, and takes 3 days for refunds, because you're only seeing your end of things. Youre not seeing the middle part of the merchant's part.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It might be more accurate to say that 5 seconds after you complete your transaction, an authorization hold is placed for the value the merchant submitted. Your ledger balance isn't updated until the completed transaction posts, but the &quot;available balance&quot; your bank gives you includes the value of that hold.</p>
<p>Note that the hold may not be for the actual amount spent, too. If you present your card at a steakhouse, they run your card for the cost of the meal, but tip isn't usually included because they don't know how much you're going to tip. If you check your balance after that but before it posts, your balance is probably off by that much. Similar circumstances apply when prepaying at the pump, when getting hotel reservations, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand how people don't know how debit and credit cards work. I've been in the hospitality industry for around a decade and it astounds me the number of people that don't know their card will be authorized when they check in and posted when they check out. Why would you hand over a credit card and expect nothing to happen to your account? It boggles the mind, especially since this is an industry standard across all major hotels. I love when guests say, &quot;Well, this has never happened before!&quot; What I'd love to say is, &quot;Yes, it has. You're just broke right now and are noticing it for the first time.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, typically gas stations will place a $1 hold until the transaction posts, in which it will post for the actual transaction amount; however, you can usually avoid this by entering a PIN instead of running the card as credit (and these transactions usually post faster than non-PIN-based transactions).</p>
<p>More importantly, the way these transactions work is based on the way you use the card and the network that the card falls under. So if you're using a Visa Debit card without the PIN, then your card usage falls under Visa guidelines in which it is required to place a 3-5 day hold based on the authorization submitted by the merchant. The merchant then has to collect on the authorization, which then causes the transaction to post.</p>
<p>Here's the kicker though (still in the context of Visa): the merchant does not have to collect on the funds from the authorization within 3-5 days; in fact, it's simply that the hold can not remain beyond that period of time, in which the financial institution is required to release the hold. If the hold is released and the funds have not been collected upon, then the available balance reflected by your financial institution is not correct and they have no control over that.</p>
<p>I feel like the true question that's being asked is &quot;Why do financial institutions place holds based on non-PIN credit/debit transactions?&quot; The answer is that the financial institution has to follow the guidelines based on the facilitator of the card being used. It would be important to review the guidelines set forth from your financial institution which should be listed in some sort of BSA (if you have a bank account, then you should have a Service Agreement), as well as the guidelines of the card facilitator (usually Visa/Discover/MC).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus it's actually convenient to have the hold post to your account. I know some people hate &quot;seeing&quot; that the bank &quot;takes&quot; your money or credit 5 seconds after the transaction, but I'd rather have that and the ability to track transactions/holds than no record of the transaction for days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The timeline is also wildly incorrect if you have a reasonably competent processor and merchant account. Overnight settlement is increasingly common, and you probably won't wait more than a full business day if you don't get that.</p>
<p>The money does <strong>not</strong> leave your (or their) account immediately; it happens overnight in a batch job. This is why an authorization affects your available line of credit, but not your statement balance. It's merely a hold, not money moving. If the merchant doesn't issue a capture, they will <em>never</em> see that money.</p>
<p>It's during this real-time authorization process where most of the fraud checks occur; a successful auth response is basically a guarantee that you <em>can</em> get those funds if you issue the capture. Other fun stuff (AML policies, underwriting, and whatnot) generally happen when you first get the account, not in real-time on every transaction. It may be refreshed occasionally, but isn't typically performed synchronously.</p>
<p>The money, if the merchant sends a capture request for the auth they got, is sent to the acquiring bank, who forwards the money on to the merchant (depending on your agreement, you may effectively be fronted this money to receive it next-day; otherwise, it'll probably be the day following).</p>
<p>Refunds <em>can</em> happen just as quickly, but some merchant accounts will hold on to the funds a little bit longer to ensure the ACH debit doesn't bounce (this is more common in a gross/gross settlement, rather than a single net; i.e. +$10000,-$300 instead of +$9700). There's no concept of a refund authorization, so you won't see a &quot;pending credit&quot; on your statement like you will with the charges. The money just shows up.</p>
<p>So the summary is mostly correct in terms of the flow of money, but the delays stated are really drawn-out unless the merchant has a <em>really</em> shitty agreement.</p>
<p>(As you might imagine, I've been in the industry for a while)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reply is only half true. For MOST systems this is how it works; However i can promise it does NOT work for every system. </p>
<p>I work for a retail company (think gas/grocery) and typically purchase something daily and always ALWAYS on Credit with my bank card (hate using my pin).</p>
<p>Now as an Assistant Manager for said store, i know when we run batch close, ect. (Hint.. it's Daily)... However my bank doesn't post (authorizes but does not post) the total's from my purchase for nearly 3 days. </p>
<p>So although in theory the answer above is correct, it's only half there. It really all depends on the bank, as well as the store's systems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Banks also have a batch process, which could delay showing transactions on your banks side. Thats why there are cut off times for certain transactions. Banks also don't batch on non banking days, such as weekends and holidays.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now why do they take so long to do batch closes? Probably because each close costs money (+ transaction fees and percentages). So they do them every few days to save money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most places do nightly, if not multiple, captures in a day. It's a huge risk if something goes wrong and they lose all their CC records. Smaller places (basically anything smaller than a mid-size grocery store) don't have the systems in place to keep all that stuff 100% backed up, and they don't want to risk losing all of a days or weeks profits to save a $10 processing fee.</p></div>		</li>
