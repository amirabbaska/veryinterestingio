			<div class="markdown"><p>You see, unlike a wife, the body will eventually give up nagging you for something that it feels should be obvious or can wait. In hunger's case it can generally wait a pretty long time. </p>
<p>After a day or 2 of fasting you dont feel hungry much at all. If you do it seems to be in passing. Its a mental toughness thing. Most folks can do a few days of no food pretty easy, if you take the mental desire to eat out of the equation.  </p>
<p>You can train yourself to feel less thirsty, less pain, less need to use the restroom... (this does not change your body's needs, just feelings)</p>
<p>Ever feel hungry when you know your lunch hour is coming? Trained yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't your body naturally want to fast during the night anyway? I remember when I first started working third shift, and even though I would sleep 8 hours during the day, eat breakfast after waking up, and then go to work, I wouldn't feel hungry at all during my lunchbreak, even though normally I would be ravenous after not eating since breakfast. Then I realized &quot;duh, it's because it's the middle of the night.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's okay , my husband is a diabetic so I get defensive because I see what he goes through. Just last night he went low and it was hard for us to get it back up because he also had an upset stomach so getting juice or dex tabs or any kind of sugar in him to bring him back up was more challenging than regular so I was already crabby :/ </p></div>		</li>
