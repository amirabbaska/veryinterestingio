			<div class="markdown"><p>So apart from Positive curvature scenario all theories knowns to us so far leads us to having universe of infitite size. However if one was to believe in Big Bang theory than we sort of expect the eventual Big Crunch and the whole cycle keeps repeating.</p>
<p>For the scenario with Dark energy, what I don't understand is the source, was it there when Big Bang happened? Or it is product of Big Bang just like regular energy?</p>
<p>I must say Astrophysics is amazing field. So many unknowns and so many possibilities, I wonder whether there would be any major discoveries in our lifetime...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Great question - we just don't really know. It seems that it has always been around, it just took a while before it became the dominant force to start the Universal acceleration. Where it came from, or even what it really is, is still a mystery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could the acceleration of the expansion of the universe be the collapse of the universe? </p>
<p>By that, I mean if we use the thrown ball analogy but the ball is attracted to our own mass. We throw it outwards, and it comes back. If we were in a curved universe, wouldn't the ball eventually cross the threshold where it would stop coming back to us along the path we threw it and instead be attracted to us from our opposite side? Up becomes down again? </p>
<p>Could the dark matter be the &quot;underside&quot; of the existing matter in the universe? Sorry, I can visualize it better than I can express it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there some sort of theory that the big bang was surrounded by dark matter, and as the universe expanded, the gaps filled in with dark matter.  The slow down happens at the point where the universe, without dark matter, would slowly start collapsing back into itself, but since those voids are filled with dark matter everything is now being propelled apart.     ...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, from how I understand Dark energy, it's something that has been around since the Big Bang, as it is the &quot;vacuum energy&quot; - basically, a true vacuum has a non-zero energy level, which creates positive pressure. Positive pressure is like gas in a canister - it pushes outward and wants to expand and lower in density. When the universe expands, however, it simply ends up with more vacuum, and therefore the same energy density: we made the can bigger, but the gas inside is at the same pressure! </p>
<p>Matter in this analogy would be little floating pieces in the can that are always in the same <em>relative</em> position. So if one piece is always at the top of the tank, and another is always halfway down, as our can grows the distance between these pieces grows. But what's special about the growth of the universe is that it is expanding equally in all directions; it's not quite a regular &quot;explosion&quot; with a center and trajectories. It's more like a 3D grid of cubes, where the distance between each &quot;corner&quot; to adjacent points was 0 at the Big Bang, became non-zero and therefore yielded HUGE expansion right after, only to be slowed by gravity/matter until recently when vacuum energy &quot;overcame&quot; gravity. This means that the expansion of the universe will accelerate indefinitely, ultimately leading to the &quot;Big Rip&quot; - eventually space will be expanding so quickly (the spaces in between adjacent points in the grid) that galaxies, solar systems, planets and even atoms will be ripped apart as the space within <em>them</em> expands. Basically, the scale of our can has gotten so big the relative positions of the floating pieces of matter are bigger than those pieces themselves, ripping them apart. And what happens then is anyone's guess at this point!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting response. The part that I just can't seem to understand is why the expansion doesn't need to conform to the speed of light limit. How are two galaxies growing in distance relative to each other any different than two terrestrial objects growing in distance relative to each other?</p></div>		</li>

<p>dark energy has negative pressure.  not positive. </p>

<p>it will accelerate indefinitely but that doesn't mean it will rip.  that's speculation on your side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested, part of (Physicist) Brian Greene's book <em>The Hidden Reality</em> (2011) describes, in as close to layman's terms as you can get, many of the most likely causes for the accellerating expansion of the universe.  If I recall correctly he even provides some conditions under which we might be able to prove the expansion is caused by one thing rather than another.</p>
<p>It's important to note (and he explicitly mentions this) that these are all hypotheses, and it may be that the expansion is caused by something we can't yet fathom.</p>
<p>I'd explain them myself, but it's been so long since I've read it that I'm sure I'd get quite a lot wrong.  I would recommend reading the book yourself, though, as I do think you'd find it quite interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP, you might like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKGWT--c0A" target="_blank">Universe vs Multiverse documentary</a>. It goes through some of these ideas at a really understandable level and parallels how string theory, dark energy, and internal inflation (which is like the expansion aspect) all kind of lead into this Multiverse theory that essentially consists of an insane amount of universes essentially &quot;big banging&quot; into existence with different shaped particles that make up the fundamental laws of nature for that universe. In fact, there are so many possible universes in this theory that every possible variation could have been done so that there are exact replica's of you in different universes.</p>
<p>Really takes your imagination on a rational rollercoaster.  </p></div>		</li>
