<ul>
<li>
<p>The placebo effect, especially when we're thinking, &quot;Wow, they've been saying chicken soup works for colds for centuries, so how can this not work?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>The kindness effect, assuming that someone made the soup and brought it to us. Same reason that O.J. has more of an effect when someone brings it to you than if you had to drag your ass out of bed and get it yourself.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, fats and collagen and other things released from boiling the chicken is what usually helps. I made chicken broth that turned into jello at room temperature, I'd have some before bed and it'd kick start your morning for sure. </p></div>		</li>
