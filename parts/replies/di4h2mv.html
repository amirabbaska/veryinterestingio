			<div class="markdown"><p>WTF?! The same thing happens to me. Just last week I was on my way to LA.. My job is to deliver and install appliances. But I'm not the driver. I always seem to get extremely tired and for the life of me can't stop myself from falling asleep. </p>
<p>I was eating seeds and I was staying awake the whole time. I stopped eating them and immediately fell asleep. Couldn't stop it. </p></div>		</li>
