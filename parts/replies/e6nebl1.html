			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.</p>
<p>For target tracking older aircraft (such as the F-4) would use a technique called lobing where the center collector of the parabolic dish would spin when the radar locked on.  It was mounted slightly asymmetrically, so when the target moved, the antenna could sense which way to point.</p>
<p>The problem is this resulted in a very obvious signature in the target's RWR system.  &quot;Hey, someone's locked on to you.&quot;</p>
<p>This was mitigated somewhat by the advent of planar array antennae (F-16, for example) that used LORO (Lobe on receive only.)</p>
<p>The antenna was divided into four quadrants, and each quadrant would send out a targeting pulse, but when &quot;listening,&quot; three of the four quadrants attenuated reception.  After it cycled through each quadrant, the FCR Computer would compare signal strength, and move the antenna accordingly.  This gave more modern aircraft a somewhat less obvious indication to target RWR that they were in fact locked on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lobe switching / conical scanning is a super old technique that's not used anymore. If you have a 4-quadrant antenna you can just use phase-comparison monopulse (or a variety of other techniques) instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There are essentially 4 types of missiles. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Heat seeking missiles </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passive radar seeking missiles that actually look for the radar an enemy aircraft is emitting. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semi active radar missiles which relies on the radar from the aircraft that launched them to guide it all the way to the target </p>
</li>
<li>Active radar missiles which are cued on where to look before launch and then fired and use their own radar to guide them. The radar on them is decteable. </li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat seeking missiles would use infrared. A sensor or lens would just detect incoming Infrared radiation, which means no need for any output signal like radar.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Infrared is emitted from everything and everyone. The hotter an object is, the more infrared radiation. Fighter jets are very hot, so they're probably somewhat easy to detect in  a cool sky</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is firing flares to &quot;blind&quot; the heat-seeking missiles an absolute defense against the missiles? Can the missile do anything then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A radar guided missile like a Sparrow is targeted in the general direction of a target while still on board by the pilot. You are probably familiar with the term &quot;got tone&quot;.... Once the missile has a lock it can be fired and uses it's own radar to continue closing in on the target. A lot of these weapons are called &quot;fire-and-forget&quot;.
The F-15 can fire several missiles at targets up to a couple hundred miles away and once he's loosed them, he can turn around and go home while they continue autonomously to the target.
This is a gross oversimplification.....but you get the idea.
The countermeasure to a radar guided missile is something called &quot;chaff&quot;. It's like little streamers or confetti made of an aluminum foil type of material that's meant to create a small cloud of radar REFLECTIVE material to try and trick the weapon into thinking it's a bigger better target....
They use flares to confuse or misdirect a heat seaking missile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this additional info, it answers a follow-up question I had about why they don’t just design the lock-in system so that it isn’t obviously slipping into a hostile / non-standard scanning mode. But having hundreds of modules doing all sort of stuff solves that I suppose..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hundreds of modules also allows you to track multiple targets at once, scan for any new targets, direct a very strong EW source and a few other tricks.</p>
<p>If you've ever heard of the US Aegis system, it uses very large array antennae to scan and track everything at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it as looking at something through a tube. Old fighters used one big tube like a sewer pipe so you knew when it was looking at you, newer fighters used 4 toilet paper tubes so you had a good idea of where it was looking and now modern fighters use hundreds of drinking straws so maybe only a few are looking at you but the rest can be searching for other things. </p></div>		</li>
