			<div class="markdown"><p>I explain it like this. Say there is a little man who controls traffic inside your brain, and the traffic is different stimuli, such as sounds, smells, thoughts, feelings etc. </p>
<p>In someone with ADHD, that little man has fallen asleep. The Ritalin wakes him up so he can do his job properly.</p>
<p>If that man is already awake and functioning ie. in someone without ADHD, he becomes hyperactive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty accurate. It also explains why some people with ADHD get so easily exhausted. I become easily exhausted because without that little man I'm being flooded with thoughts and stimuli which just completely overwhelms my brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's a lot better explanation than my &quot;the voice in your head that tells you things to do and how to do it. Like, if you gotta take shower, it tells you that you start by grabbing the clothes, for which you gotta get to your closest and open the door... and so on&quot;. It's effortless for people without ADHD but for us, it's what's missing so we just sorta drift away. </p></div>		</li>

<p>People don’t seem to understand that these drugs CALM people down who actually have ADHD.</p>

<p>We know when I've forgotten my morning dose. A bump in the road doesn't lead to a proportionate response, it leads to a full-on panic attack breakdown. I can't breathe. I can't see any path forward because I'm seeing all paths at once. Jesus. I can't take my dose yet (other meds) and just typing this out is making me feel anxious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This was happening before treatment started. Oh, and you are not my doctor. Good day.</p></div>		</li>
