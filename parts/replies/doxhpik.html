			<div class="markdown"><p>Bench press will definitely make you better at push-ups, but as with most exercises, the best way to get better at it is to just do more of it. Bench press works slightly different muscles than push ups do, so you'd probably be better off just doing push up variations if your goal is to simply improve push up stamina. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't doubt this, but I find a discrepancy here with my own experience.</p>
<p>I'm 178 lbs, and as it happens I've been benching with 125 lbs on the bar (about 72%).  I can bang out 17 reps on the bench, but I can also do 67 pushups.  So almost four times as many pushups.</p>
<p>I would think I would be able to do more reps on the bench if I'm only using &quot;slightly&quot; different muscles between the two.  I dunno.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to consider that your hands are in a fixed position when doing the pushups, as opposed to benchpressing where you will have to stabilize the weight (of the bar) in a different way. Compare to doing pushups with your hands in gymnastic rings for example, rather than on the floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really not trying to be rude so really trying to say this nicely - but double check your form.  Many people have terrible form on their pushups.  Their core doesn't stay straight and/or they don't fully extend their arms on the up.  This leads to half reps and much higher numbers.  I know many people aren't aware of this and truly feel like they are doing them correctly.  67 is a solid number of legit pushups, I'd expect your bench to be higher.  Easy to film at home and check.  Sorry - I'm a nitpicker at pushups having been through a school where were tested on pushups and they had to be right on test day or they didn't count. Not saying yours are wrong - just something to look at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are distributing the load among more muscles when doing a pushup. Think about curling, when you are standing up you can usually lift more than doing curls on an isolation board. This is because more muscles (though many of the same primary movers) are sharing the load, when you bench, it's like doing pushups in isolation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>not necessarily, there are diminishing returns and once you get used to a stimuli, a different one might be more effective. Also at a point increasing the intensity (weight) would be more productive than increasing the volume (reps).</p>
<p>E.g. at westside, they don't really train the exact specific big 3 lifts per se, but almost always modified version of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I'm not advocating strictly doing nothing put perfect push ups ad infinitum, that's why I said push up variations. I've had to do a lot of push ups in the past three years and what I've found to be true for myself and most other people I've spoken to is that the best results come not from lifting, which primarily trains muscular strength, but simply doing more push ups, strict or otherwise, which trains more muscular endurance. Lifting is a good supplement to that, but only if you already have a good base.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you are right I wouldn't use Westside as an example of typical programming. You could just as easily use Abadjiev as evidence of the exact opposite. WSBB are an extreme case of over-variation that just happens to work, because Louie and his five hundred years of experience are here to tell you what specific variation you should be doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes of course. But the load on your chest and triceps is different than in a push up. It's easy to find people who can do 20 push ups but can't do a single 70% body weight bench press, and many many more who can't do 20 of them. If someone starting out spends some time (3 months) trying to increase his 1 rep max then 2 weeks stamina training he will most likely manage to do more push ups than a guy that just did stamina training with a weight he managed to press as often as many push ups he could do or alternatively the 70% bw. Interestingly enough there are non responders to cardio training and non responders to HIIT (in most cases if you are one the other works fine, and for most people one is better than the other, in most cases HIIT) but I have never found a study that found non responders to weight training (1-15 rep range) with the exception of people with real conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are leaving a huge element out of all of this, the skill involved in doing a specific exercise. Strength doesn't just directly translate in to another athletic movement in the way people are trying to describe it here. This is why people who switch between bodyweight/weight training and then go back, find they lost in whichever they were doing first despite making gains with the other system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Health and exercise science student here. You can work on the stamina of different muscles by doing different push-ups. As the angle between you and the ground increases more of your body weight is held over the fulcrum (your hands on the floor) and the effort force (your chest/shoulders/-forearms) which increases the weight of the push-up.<br />
It's a cyclical system; as you get heavier, you get stronger and as you get stronger, you get heavier. </p></div>		</li>
