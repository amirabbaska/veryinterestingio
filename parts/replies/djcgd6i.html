			<div class="markdown"><p>basically if you think of the immune system as something that its goal is to remove something foreign and shouldn't be there from the body, like a viruses or bacteria, our goal is to convince the immune system that even those cancer cells are made of their own body, they too shouldn't be there. with the hope the immune system with remove and attack the cancer.</p>
<p>short answer: tricky</p>
<p>longer answer: in some patients in some cancers it works really well and is giving us new tools to attack cancers we didn't previously have arsenals of treatment options for. I do believe its a new hope for cancer therapy.</p>
