			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Coiled hair does exactly grow slower, but appears that way because it's so delicate and breaks off easily, and shrinks a lot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rock comment is super valid - as long as humans have been able to spear/cut through animal hide/chop down foliage, we've had tools sharp enough to cut our hair. I wonder if people who live in hotter climates find their hair grows slower? This can happen in other animals, and obviously I'm talking about ancient humans, who didn't just hop on horses or boats and romp around continents. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always assumed humans just bit the nails off like we do now without realizing it. We've never been taught to bite our nails yet we feel the innate need to, almost like scratching an itch. Just like reading this now you can feel your nails vividly in your head and consider biting them. When my dogs nails get to long she goes straight to biting at them because they're uncomfortable. So I don't see why humans wouldn't feel the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this. Even hair we could do this to if we really wanted to. If hair got to the point it was so long it was a hazard, we could easily put it in our mouth and cut individual strands with our teeth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easier than one might think to chew of nibble your nails until they're just the right length, and not sharp. If you do it regularly, it never gets long enough to be difficult. Gives relatively smooth shaped nail curve too.</p>
