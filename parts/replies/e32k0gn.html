<p>I have a wireless baby-monitor. A cheap, extremly basic thing I bought at IKEA. I've always wondered what would happen if my neighbor bought the exact same model. Would we both hear eachother or are the two pieces keyed to eachother so they don't interfere with another unit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends.  Baby monitors tend to run on the 5.8ghz band.   It’s high bandwidth but low range and penetration for signal.   There are quite a few different channels (frequencies) available to them in that range.  The units will typically find a clean channel automatically and tune themselves to it.  </p>
<p>If it uses analog video/audio, the way the tuners work, the strongest signal wins.   Like how if 2 FM radio stations are on the same frequency, as you get nearer to the stronger signal, it will lock in over the weaker signal, they won’t bleed together unless both signals are incredibly weak.  It’s how radar jammers work, be the loudest signal around and everything else is ignored.</p>
<p>If they use digital transmission, then it would be able to pick out the right packets based on the hardware ID and encryption, similar to how Wi-Fi would do it, even if both monitors were on the same channel.   It’s harder to jam a digital signal because it’s more fault tolerant and doesn’t need as much frequency separation to work.  HD Radio for example can have 2 or 3 digital channels on top of the analog channel and be more clear and solid.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the monitor. There are a few different technologies that they use. If yours is one of the better ones it's very hard to eavesdrop, by accident or otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
