			<div class="markdown"><p>I would edit this and say that the superior tarsal muscle is also used to keep the eye open. It has sympathetic innervation so in Horner's syndrome it can cause ptosis (eyelid drooping), so it is involved in more than just a &quot;surprised&quot; reaction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add further detail, Horner's syndrome causes a mild ptosis, affecting the superior tarsal muscle.  On the other hand, severe ptosis is caused by damage to cranial nerve III, which affects the levator palpebrae superioris.  The LPS is a stronger &quot;opener&quot; of the eyelid than the superior tarsal muscle.  So clinically, when you see ptosis, you first determine whether it looks like it is mild or severe, which will help you find the cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s called a myokymia. As everyone else has said it is due to stress, caffeine, lack of sleep, or all of the above &amp; only involves the orbicularis oculi muscle. This differs from what’s called a blepharospasm, which consists of an involuntary forceful closure of the eyelid, and involves 3 muscles - the orbicularus oculi, procerus, and corrogator. This is more severe in nature and often requires Botox to treat.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is it called when my eyebrow, the muscle on my temple and next to my eye and the muscle on my cheekbone contract to close my eye? It's sort of gradual and I get it if I have a fever. It's accompanied by a pleasant noisy warmth around my eyelids and often it'll make me cry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I’m wrong, /u/Nightowl3090 explains what a twitch is understood to be much better. </p>
<p>If I remember correctly a twitch is when your muscles nearly reach their action potential but not fully and release their stored energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless in regards to graded potentials, action potentials leading to muscle fibers are all or none responses. A &quot;nearly&quot; depolarized cell will not fire. While the exact mechanisms of twitches are not completely known, the major consensus is distal spontaneous firing of a partially demyelinated nerve which can cascade and reverberate to nearby nerves. This is why individuals who have chronic atypical twitches should be worked up for possible demylenating diseases like Multiple Sclerosis. </p>
<p>Edit: MS or peripheral demylenating disease is rarely a leading differential. Environmental (stress) and dietary factors (caffeine) are almost always addressed first.</p></div>		</li>
