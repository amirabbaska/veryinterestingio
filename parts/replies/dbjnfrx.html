			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, capsaicin is a chemical in jalapenos that binds to TRPV1 channels on your tongue and causes them to open. These channels also open when exposed to high temperature.</p>
<p>So the effect is analogous, but the proteins involved are different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually that was a pretty interesting Fun fact. I have a question. If you have ate Jalapeno and are burning like a fool, would eating some menthol (say in a chewing gum) make the burning sensation subside?</p></div>		</li>
