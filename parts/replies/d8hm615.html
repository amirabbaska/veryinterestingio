			<div class="markdown"><p>I was curious what you meant by &quot;It's easier and more commercially viable to raise and farm silkworms than it is spiders who produce enough silk. It has been done, most famously in recent memory with over a million female Golden Orb Spiders. The fabric produced is naturally golden in color, and is breathtakingly lovely.&quot;</p>
<p>So, I did a google.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/09/spider-silk/" target="_blank">And I found this</a></p>

<p>That's amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really neat. I wanna see it in person, you can tell the camera's are missing a lot, like when you take a photo of the moon with a mobile. I especially like when she says the military have been trying to make a synthetic strand and have been unsuccesful. I imagine their research facilities look just like Oscorp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question then - why is silk so &quot;slippery&quot;? Is it because there's no rough edges/areas for other stuff to catch, and so is low friction?</p>
<p>Cause I've heard stories... silk PJ's on a silk bed with silk sheets means you ain't getting out of bed in a hurry</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Protein fiber fabrics like silk are usually a single strand, plied many times over to make the yarn that goes into the weave. Apart from the cuts to make the clothing piece, it's all just one long strand from top to bottom on each little woven part. Fibers that are spun have &quot;teeth;&quot; they have a rougher surface area, which gives them the ability to grip more. It's also why silk feels dry compared to other fabrics. Less moisture in the protein, and less moisture held in the yarns and weaves. Linen feels cold because it's so loosely woven and thick yarned compared to cotton (which is super tightly woven since it's the most popular fabric outside of polyester). Polyesters are a class all their own, but much like silk, they're usually a monofilament that gets extruded into a strand of uniform thickness. From there it's either spun with other strands and then machine knitted for jerseys, woven for innumerable types of fabric, or simply woven as single strands (like windbreaker or super slick sportsball fabrics).</p>
<p>Silk PJs on any kind of tightly woven sheet is hard enough. Silk on silk is A, overkill, and B not always graceful. </p>
<p>However! Silk is used commonly in a healthcare setting. It can be made into bedsheets and patient gowns or coverings that are ubiquitous to burn wards. The smoothness of the unbroken fibers doesn't irritate (or is incredibly minimal), and t doesn't abrade the wounds the way a &quot;toothy&quot; spun fiber might. We had to take our daughter in for a small burn on her hand, and even the outpatient section of the burn unit at our local hospital had silk sheets on the beds. It was awesome. </p>
<p>Wool is a funny one because it's keratin. Which is technically a protein fiber, but it grows out in laminated flaps much like our own hair does. Take a look on the back of a shampoo bottle and it'll usually have a cutaway view of a hair. It's lots of little plates of keratin around a core. That's the way wool looks under a microscope. Because of this it has a property unique to all hair called felting. You rub the fabric together enough, and heat it up, and this little keratin plates start interlocking with each other. It's the same reason hair is capable of matting into dreadlocks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>nod</em> If I recall right, the whole point of silk sheets is they are less damaging to the skin - they don't pull moisture from it, and the smooth threads don't micro-abrade the skin, is that right?</p></div>		</li>
