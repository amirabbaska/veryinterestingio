			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any potential danger from long term paresthesia? For example, I'm a big man (around 230lbs), and I regularly sleep in the fetal position with my arms tucked between my knees or under my head. I often wake up with one or the other arm &quot;asleep&quot;, and recently, I've been noticing a weakness in one or both arms. Just wondering if it's possible that the decades-long habit of sleeping like this can cause extended symptoms of the paresthesia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There usually isn't any damage from transient paresthesia that happens when you stay in one position for too long. But transient paresthesia does not really explain prolonged weakness, the weakness should go away after the transient paresthesia is resolved. Many things could account for the weakness and it's impossible to say anything without a medical history evaluation and a neurological exam. It technically could be a peripheral neuropathy caused by prolonged pressure on a nerve or something altogether different. Since you mentioned that you were a big man, brachial plexus or radial nerve  compression could definitely be a possibility. Radial nerve neuropathy (Also called honeymoon palsy and saturday night palsy) is a possibility since you mentioned you often slept with your head on your arm or your arm between your legs. The compression is often not caused simply by postural changes but also by anatomical structures next to the nerves compressing the nerves. I don't know if you have diabetes, but if you do and it's not controlled, it could be associated with that as well. It could potentially be associated with a cervical hernia or a bulging disc. But once again, it could also be something completely different. If there really is noticeable weakness in your arms I would very highly recommend a neurological exam ASAP because it's an important sign. Especially if the weakness is progressing don't ignore it. If it really is due to prolonged compression it's not a serious or permanent condition but the treatment could take a fairly long time and might be frustrating, so an early diagnosis may save you a lot of frustration. See your GP, list your complaints and ask for a referral to a neurologist or your GP could also probably help you. If you have further questions feel free to PM me and I can refer you to some sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have diabetes, but I do have early-stage hepatic steatosis (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), which has many similar symptoms. I used to be much heavier (270lbs) and I'm in much better shape than I've ever been in, exercising regularly and eating much better. I also sometimes sleep with my arms crossed, on my side, because it keeps my body from rolling over. I wonder if the axillary position of my hands (in fist position) might be compressing my radial nerve. Thank you for the feedback - I'll check in with my PCP and get a referral. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have symptoms like this, went to see a doctor and he dismissed it as &quot;Just exercise more&quot; and I got to leave a blood sample for cholesterol, natrium and something else which I can't remember.</p>
<p>Not sure what else to do if the problem just gets dismissed entirely because my weight and since I live a very passive life. No doubt that doesn't help but since it's been accelerating in severity (going from a bit of numbness to getting close to losing most feeling entirely in 3 months)</p></div>		</li>

<li>Honeymoon palsy from another individual sleeping on and compressing one's arm overnight.</li>
<li>Saturday night palsy from falling asleep with one's arm hanging over the arm rest of a chair, compressing the radial nerve.</li>
<li>Squash palsy, from traction forces associated with the sport squash, happens to squash players during periods between matches.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It matters.</p>
<p>Suggestions follow: first right now you can find and use pillows to change the pressure.</p>
<p>I found one rectangular-block pillow for upper leg in side-lying position and it was transformative. I don't know what would help you, not from here certainly.</p>
<p>Read this book, by Pete Egoscue, &quot;Pain Free, a revolutionary method&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
