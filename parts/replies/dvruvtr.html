			<div class="markdown"><p>I just set it for 90 minutes right as my head is hitting the pillow. The sleep cycle is different for everyone, but I don't think a few minutes in either direction is going to majorly affect anything. That being said, I'm one of the people who can almost instantly fall asleep, so if you roll around in bed for 20 minutes before sleeping then you should adjust the alarm accordingly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 90 minute nap is more rejuvenating than a shorter nap. What people are generally getting at with their short-nap advice, is that you might feel groggy for a few minutes after 90 minutes out. But worth it when you really need it! I generally do the 20-30 minute nap thing if I am at work and it does boost productivity for sure. </p>
<p>I especially like to down two shots of espresso and then take a brief nap. Best feeling ever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read, REM sleep is the sleep that actually makes you feel rested. And REM sleep comes at the end of the 90 minute sleep cycle. In laboratory tests focused on studying the sleep pattern, people who are consistently woken up before reaching REM sleep are just as tired as the people who got no sleep at all. As such, I've never really put much stock in the 20 minute power naps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read before that the best length of time for a nap is around 30 minutes, so I set my alarm for 45~ to give me time to fall asleep before those 30 minutes kick in. </p>
<p>Now you say it's 20 minutes instead. I really wish there was a unanimous decision on the best length of time for a power nap...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s honestly different for everyone. Science works off of averages and does great when it comes to generalizing for large populations. Application of results to individuals though? It still largely requires trial, error, and luck. </p>
<p>If 30 min works for you, great. If it isn’t, try experimenting with 20 and see how you feel. </p></div>		</li>
