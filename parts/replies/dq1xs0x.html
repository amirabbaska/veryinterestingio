			<div class="markdown"><p>“Miss Kelly, how can water be a solid, liquid, and gas?”</p>
<p>“Well little Timmy, water is made up of these little fuckers called molecules. When these little fuckers have a lot of energy (when heated) they go batshit crazy and start running around like a bunch of trailer trash on meth and turn into gas. But when they loose enough energy (when the temperature gets cold enough to freeze your buys off) they get really lazy and clump together  like junkies in a flop house all crammed onto one mattes. When the little fuckers have a normal amount of energy they just kind of sit around like you little non substance abusing mongrels are doing now. That’s when it’s a liquid”</p>
<p>“Oh, thanks Miss Kelly. That shit made a lot f sense”</p></div>		</li>
