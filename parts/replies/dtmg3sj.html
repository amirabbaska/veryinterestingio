			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the reboot of Battelstar Galactica had pretty good space physics (no sound, no banking of spacecraft).  Also Firefly did this too.  Both were great.</p>
<p>However, I still like spacecraft that fly like they are in the air - example, the space battle at the end of Rogue One was super awesome.</p>
