			<div class="markdown"><p>If we were closer to the sun than that, would it be possible to use the extremities of our body to shade our vital organs? Like could I get closer and juts sacrifice my forearms and shins to get super hot while using them to shade my chest and head, or would my circulation (which we're assuming is fully functional) move the heat to my organs anyway? </p>
<p>I think you get my (space)drift but if I worded this poorly then sorry in advance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The circulatory system is pretty efficient at moving heat around the body. My suspicion is that this wouldn't work because the heat would just get moved to your core too quickly. Kind of like trying to keep yourself cool by shading yourself with your limbs on a blazing hot day in the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is actually a yes. I don’t know by how much, or the exact math involved, but, it should be a simple proof. If all the heat you gather from the sun is via radiation, and the heat you gather from that radiation is proportional to your surface area that that radiation hits, then consider the following opposing situations: 1) You face the sun with your arms spread out, revealing the most surface area possible, and 2) You move your arms over your body, covering your chest. In situation 2, while your arms receive roughly the same amount of radiation as in 1, your chest receives less radiation due to the shadow. Because less surface area is exposed to radiation in 2, less radiation produces less heat, and you don’t get as hot.</p>
<p>Your circulatory system would be a moot point here, since, as a whole, with or without it, your body would still heat up as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your body was oriented with your feet facing the sun, and you adopted a pose like a soldier standing to attention, you would present a much smaller cross section to the sun, and as a result absorb much less heat from it. Not quite what you were asking, but the idea of orienting feet first would work, albeit in a different way to you expected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not going to be able to give you mathematic equations like the top comment. However, the short answer is yes you could move closer to the sun by shading your vital organs. You could also just turn sideways since a side angle would present less surface area and therefore would absorb less energy.</p>
<p>So let’s start with covering your face with your hands. The way to get maximum surface area is face the sun with arms and legs slightly externally rotated. If you cover your face you’ve reduced the surface area of your body and could move closer in. As for your blood vessels transferring the heat to your core. The answer is they would do so but there would be heat lost in the transfer. </p>
<p>For instance you are very cold and put your hands under a warm faucet. The water heats up your hands and that heat will move towards your body but you will loose a significant portion as it travels from hands to heart and back out.</p>
<p>The way to get the closest to the sun in this scenario is to tuck yourself into a chin to chest ball thereby presenting the smallest profile possible. However, the minute you stretched out you’d fry in a short period of time as your surface area expanded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BTU is a measurement of energy. Watts are power (energy/time).
So, over what span of time does the body output those 25,000 BTU?</p>
<p>120 V is electric potential. No energy is being used unless this voltage is driving a current. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some math: 1 BTU is 0.293 Watt Hours, so our 100 Watt human takes 25,000 BTU * 0.293 Watt Hours/BTU / 100 Watts = 73.3 Hours to output 25,000 BTU.</p>
<p>And Watts = Amps * Volts so our 100 Watt human can output 120 Volts at 100 Volt Amp / 120 Volt = 0.83 Amp (if it could be converted perfectly to electricity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 120 volts is nonsense, but technically a human does output 25,000 btu, it's just over 3-4 days on average.</p>
<p>To put out 25,000 BTU an hour, you would need to be eating 6,000 calories an hour, which incidentally is two large dominoes pepperoni pizzas an hour.</p></div>		</li>
