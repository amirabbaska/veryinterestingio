			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying it sucks is kinda misleading. Yeah it can be tough because in single fluid MHD (combine electrons and ions to one fluid) there are essentially 10 equations, but there are many equilibrium solutions that have been found to accurately model a wide range of phenomena. These equilibrium serve as starting points and complexity can be added to more precisely model non equilibrium effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally single fluid MHD is described by 8 equations. if want to model electron flow specifically you really want to use an extended MHD or two fluid model. In extended MHD we use a generalized Ohm's law to more accurately model the electron dynamics. You can still model extended MHD with 8 equations. </p>
<p>There are many equilibrium solutions for single fluid MHD. However there are few known, if any, nontrivial extended MHD equilibrium solutions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a crucial difference between electrons in a metal and plasma in free space though. In the former, the electron momentum is not conserved due to the scattering between electrons and phonons / defects, which implies that the momentum relaxes rather than diffuses. Of course, in an ultra-clean system at extremely low temperature (e.g. graphene), where one may neglect the electron-phonon or electron-defect scattering, electrons do behave like a fluid, which gives rise to striking phenomena such as negative resistance. </p></div>		</li>
