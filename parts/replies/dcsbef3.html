<p>Aquafina make their water bottles with the same plastic and bottle style as regular soda bottles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, because it's probably cheaper on the whole to use the same type of bottles for every drink, meaning it costs much less to produce, but slightly more in materials, because they have all the stuff to make the bottles they need, molds and all the infrastructure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The cans are pressurized to the exact level the manufacturer desires. They compensate for the plastic by adding additional pressure which they anticipate will seep through the bottle until the consumer drinks the product. At that time, if they're right, the plastic soda would have depressurized to the same level as a can straight from the factory.</p></div>		</li>
