<p>Basically our brains seem to be chemical computers, not quantum computers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're pointing to the most obvious criticism of &quot;quantum consciousness&quot;. But anyone actually trying to make a serious claim or hypothesis would need to model their theory on already existing coherent quantum systems. Penrose's Orch-OR mathematical theory predicts this may be occurring on organized aromatized microtubules. This is all fringe speculation though, fascinating nonetheless. But it's important to know the basic arguments for and against a hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are pretty notable people who suggest that the &quot;mind&quot; exists also between individuals and not just intraindividual. Dan Siegel, UCLA interpersonal neurobiologist being the biggest proponent of such a postulation. It also depends on how you define &quot;mind&quot; and he is pretty deliberate about that but it does raise interesting questions about information flow between brains vs just within a brain. Cool stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mind does exist between individuals. A lot of what we think of as &quot;mind&quot; is external - but in a purely social sense. Humans en masse act as a rather confused and not very sentient herd organism. Uniquely, the organism has a patchy persistent memory which means that learning doesn't die out with individuals and can even be stored in physical objects outside of the brain.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with quantum theory, but it highlights that it's hard to say anything useful about &quot;mind&quot; when we have no clear definition of &quot;mind&quot; is or what its properties are.</p>
<p>We have a <em>naive</em> idea that it means the consciousness we experience, which includes an apparent ability to understand and model situations, make decisions about future goals, work towards those goals, and change the understanding and the goals by responding live to events around us. At the same time we're aware of emotional responses and memories of past events/emotions.</p>
<p>But we don't really understand this works. We don't know in detail what memories are, we don't know how you get from a giant blob of neurons to something with self-awareness, we don't know how we make mental models or how we choose goals and motivations, we don't understand how genetic differences and experience define personalities - and so on. </p>
<p>There may be quantum effects happening at some level, but trying to find out if quantum effects shape personality or memory is like wondering if the computers that run the Internet are made of quarks - it may be true in a distant sense, but there's so much else going on that it's probably not a helpful question until there's much better insight into the higher levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually some people in my group and my professor specifically, has repeatedly looked into vibrationally enhanced energy transfer processes - specifically with recourse to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenna-Matthews-Olson_complex" target="_blank">FMO complex</a> which is to my knowledge a key protein responsible for energy transfer from antenna complexes to the reaction center <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_antenna_complex" target="_blank">within the Light Harvesting Complex II</a> (which, for instance, occurs in green bacteria). </p>
<p>Apparently, people thought that an enhancement of energy transfer through long-lived coherent oscillations on the picosecond scale was possible - thus enhancing the actual conversion from sunlight into usable chemical energy - prompted by an experiment in Berkley <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7137/abs/nature05678.html" target="_blank">in 2007 from what I understand</a>. However, recent measurements in Lund (<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00534" target="_blank">likely this paper</a>) at lower temperature and <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b05592" target="_blank">in Hamburg at room temperature</a> cast doubt on that (EDIT: I was thinking of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08425" target="_blank">this paper from Hamburg</a> actually). There is also long-lived theoretical disagreement with the results from Berkley, although I don't know the details.</p>
<p>Also note that I'm not aware of the investigated Dimer in the bacterial photosystem which is apparently being used for the calculations in the article you cite.</p>
<p>I'll also add two more biological quantum effects which were investigated to my knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/apr/07/birds-measure-magnetic-fields-using-long-lived-quantum-coherence" target="_blank">Magnetic sensing in birds as method of orientation</a> via the earth's magnetic field. Apparently ivestigated by Hore et al. from Oxford.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration_theory_of_olfaction" target="_blank">The Vibrational Theory of Olfaction</a> going back to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/chemse/21.6.773" target="_blank">an idea by Turin</a>, where vibrational energy transfer (which can be seen as a quantum effect I guess) is responsible for the sense of smell. This idea has recently come under <a href="http://m.pnas.org/content/112/21/6525" target="_blank">strong suspicion due to contrasting experimental results</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I cannot comment in detail on anything else and I may be wrong in some details as I'm not actively working on any of those topics.</p>
<p>Oh I also stumbled upon this informative review <a href="http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v9/n1/full/nphys2474.html" target="_blank">in nature about quantum biology.</a>   </p>
<hr />
<p>More edit: You know what? As a means to procrastinate I have decided to go into a little bit more detail as to what I think underlines the quantum nature in these effects and give a short introduction of how an environment interacts with a quantum system. Mistakes may still be present, if so, call me out on that.</p>
<p>First off, quantum systems can exist in a superposition state. A superposition state is, mathematically speaking, essentially an expansion of your state into some basis spanned by the eigenvectors of the observable you are looking at. Much in the same way that you can describe a vector in a three dimensional space by a sum of three weighted basis vectors corresponding to the x, y and z direction. </p>
<p>Same in quantum mechanics: you essentially have a sum of terms where the basis states correspond to states standing in for specific results of a measured quantity - for instance a position state corresponding to position 1 and another to position 2. A measurement of the position, however, destroys this superposition and the quantum system is left in exactly the state corresponding to the position you measured. In other words, you essentially throw away all the other terms in the sum and are only left with one of the basis vectors. This is the fabled collapse of the wave function.*</p>
<p>If you couple a sufficiently large** environment (for instance vibrational, rotational or electronic excitations in molecules, spin excitations in magnetic substances, phonons (= vibrations of the crystal lattice in solids), the electromagnetic field in general and anything else really which can somehow couple to what you look at) to a small system you will see two effects: relaxation and decoherence. </p>
<p>Relaxation is essentially the same process you see everyday when you step away from your gas pedal in your car or let a pendulum swing. Both will decelerate with time as kinetic energy is funneled into the environment and effectively disappears into the vast number of degrees of freedom provided by all the air molecules and appears as heat. Same for a quantum system where excited states deexcite with time until the system is in equilibrium with the environment again.</p>
<p>Decoherence is the more relevant effect for this question here: it means that superposition states collapse by themselves to a certain degree - or rather that the environment effectively measures the system and destroys superposition states over time, leading the system to constrain itself to a few possible states. That's also the answer to Schrödinger's Cat - the cat can only be alive or dead and not a zombie, because the large environment all around constantly measures the cat.</p>
<p>If your system couples to the environment in the right way*** you'll also have a coupling in the dynamics between the actual states you investigate and the superposition state. These appear as oscillations over time if you look at the occupation probability of the states you are interested in. This means your system can be reexcited through interaction with the environment because small decoherence effects keep superposition states (&quot;coherences&quot; as they are called and represent off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of your system) alive long enough such that they can reexcite the system. In turn, this allows for more energy transfer out of the system into whatever channel we look at.</p>
<p>This is what I assume is meant with &quot;long lived vibrational coherence&quot; and why this effect is important to look for energy transfer purposes. Assume being the keyword here.</p>
<p>[*] You still need to normalize the state you are now in. Because the actual norm of your state defines the probability of your particle being in that state, and given you measured it in that state the probability of it being in that state has to be one.</p>
<p>[**] An interesting counterpoint to the sufficiently large environment can be found for instance in the Jaynes-Cummings model which can for instance be used to model a highly excited atom inside an optical cavity. There, a simple quantum system with  two states couples to only a single mode of a bosonic (e.g. the EM) field, meaning your environment is restricted to only one degree of freedom. You'll see first a collapse but after a time a revival of superposition states - the &quot;environment&quot; is simply too small to lead to decoherence.</p>
<p>[***] A simple (well not quite, given it cannot be analytically solved) model system is the spin-boson model where you effecively couple a two state system to a large collection of harmonic oscillators. There, the way of coupling your system (off-diagonal, diagonal or both) determines if you have only decoherence or decoherence and relaxation. Moreover, you'll only get long-lived fluctuations if your decoherence is small which is (if I recall correctly) associated with weak coupling to the environment. For strong coupling, one should only see overdamped dynamics (read: only algebraic or exponential decay).</p>
