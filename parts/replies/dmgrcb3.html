			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your response is the only reason what keeps me here. I tend to stick to unhealthy relations with people whom are albeit extremely bright, tend to be suicidal. Personally I have close to <em>zero</em> drive to stay. Mind you I live a life which most people would consider &quot;you've made it&quot;. I was born as a 1%, I got various companies to my name, I recently got a healthy happy little daughter and yet ... there is not a day I wake up wondering is this it. My moment of happiness is when I sit in the back of the car going home with nothing. Not for the fact that I go home, simply sit and that's it.</p>
<p>I've had several of my family members decide in their life that it was enough, some for health reasons, some I tend to think simply wondering the same. I hated them for doing so and yet I understand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you considered either traveling or trying to help people less fortunate than yourself, in some way?  It sounds like your lacking meaning and fulfilment in your life.  I'm not rich but if I had a lot of money the first thing I would do is travel and hike, see national parks, travel in foreign countries.  And when I mean travel, I mean booking an economy ticket, staying in hostels and cheaper hotels (as long as its safe, obviously)  and trying to try the cheap local food, do some local hikes, or investigate the area and walk around site seeing, maybe try to connect with some locals at a bar, etc.</p>
<p>After traveling for a bit, I would try to do something that gives me direct interactions with people I could help.  Writing a check for a million dollars and giving it to a charity has a much different emotional response than feeding someone at a shelter, or directly interacting with someone that could really use your help.  Definitely more fulfilling, and definitely more of a human connection, rather than: &quot;I have money, someone needs money, so I gave them money.&quot;  Seems a little disconnected right?  No one wants to feel like a living bank.</p>
<p>Anyway, hope you find some meaning and direction, and stay strong!  You have a beautiful new daughter to think about now!   </p></div>		</li>

<p>Simply sitting and being happy there, don't you think that's as simple as it all needs to be? </p>
<p>You have been given most everything already. Are you craving a sense of accomplishment or something? I think the quest for happiness is a long winding one, for everyone. You, the top 1% and me, working/middle class. It's part of what makes us human. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the only things keeping me from ending it are like the fact that it would be an extreme waste of my parents love, time, effort, and resources just for me to be gone. I just don't want to do that to them, no matter how little I want to be here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've come to think that the point of life is learning how to be happy despite everything that makes you sad. </p>
<p>I always think helping others is a great way to feel good about yourself, that you matter because you made a difference, no matter how small. </p>
<p>Like take this post. I feel good because someone asked about suicide, and I thought I had a pretty clear answer that can help others have a better understanding of suicide, and through it the meaning of life. It makes me feel good even though I feel down a lot of the time. Ultimately, I want my happiness to come from within. I've started getting that more and more. </p>
<p>You deserve happiness, Bacon_Bitsx. Real happiness where you feel good about yourself almost all the time, despite whatever factors. I wish you luck finding it. </p></div>		</li>
