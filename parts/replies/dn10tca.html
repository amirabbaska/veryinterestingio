			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that the alternative methods are strictly that: alternatives to be used in the event lethal injection is not an option, e.g. the drugs are unavailable or the method is ruled unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Edit: You might be able to choose your method of execution, but that's likely the exception and not the rule.</p>
<p>Edit 2: It looks like most states that offer a choice only allow lethal injection or the chair; some allow lethal gas or hanging. Some states allow a choice only for inmates sentenced prior to a certain date. Most states only authorize lethal injection, though. <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution" target="_blank">Source</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's worth noting that Utah only allows the firing squad for those sentenced before 2004, and he was sentenced in 1985.</p>
<p>That reminds me of this fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamida_Djandoubi" target="_blank">the last execution by guillotine</a> in France happened the same year Star Wars was released in theaters (1977).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this, why don't we use Nitrogen Gas suffocation as a means of the death sentence? With NO^2 your body doesn't realize it's suffocating and panic like it does with Carbon Monoxide, and instead you drift to sleep and die without a sense of impending doom.</p>
<p>Is there a reason Lethal Injection is used instead?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting snuffed out with a pillow and stoning are both higher up on my list of ways to go than lethal injection. I could probably come up with a few hundred more, but doing so seems <em>fairly morbid.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I'm aware, Washington is the only state where you can be hung these days. Prisoners to be executed are given the choice of lethal injection or hanging. The last hanging was 1994 (last official hanging in America IIRC), but we still have active gallows ready to go somewhere in the state.</p>
<p>EDIT: OK so according to the reddit grammar police it's &quot;hanged&quot; not &quot;hung.&quot; I'd like to apologize for not watching the relevant CCP Grey video or whatever where I would've learned this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember right, It's still on the books in those states but it's very unlikely to be carried out. Washington's the only one with an active gallows and a reasonable chance someone will get hung, at least until the penalty is completely repealed.</p></div>		</li>
