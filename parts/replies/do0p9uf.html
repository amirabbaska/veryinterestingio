			<div class="markdown"><p>So I am a physician also, and I have to step in here. This is incorrect. This post above is describing septic shock, which is when a bad infection causes all of your blood vessels to dilate (expand) and you then have a drop in blood pressure and die.  u/whocanhebe is right that the first thing we do to treat this is give lots of fluid... but the problem with that answer is this-  fluid does not fix the problem.  We use IV fluid as a very temporary solution to the big problem which is obviously fighting the infection.  Thats a life threatening issue, and no doctor in the world should ever be trying to treat or prevent septic shock by telling people to drink fluids at home.  Not even a chiropractor would do that. </p>
<p>We tell people to drink lots of fluids because most of the symptoms of benign viral infections (non life threatening) are caused by dehydration. Its also why Campbell's chicken noodle soup helps (lots of sodium, which makes you retain fluid).<br />
You drink fluid so that you dont get muscle cramps, fatigue, nausea etc. If you DO have those symptoms after we diagnosed you with a not-serious infection, and you have been drinking a lot of water, that means one of two things.  1) The infection is more serious than we initially thought, and you need different treatment or 2) We completely misdiagnosed you and you need to be re-worked up for some other illness. </p>
<p>TL;DR I am doc who works in an ER and an ICU. We see both deadly infections (septic shock, like what the post above describes) all the way to the common cold. We tell you to drink fluids because if you drink fluids and you dont get better, you might not have the common cold, and you need to be seen again by a doctor. Drinking fluids will absolutely not fix septic shock, and we absolutely do not tell you to drink fluids as a way of curing hypotension from an infection.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, who the heck is getting septic shock from a common cold? Why is the top response about septic shock when the question covers rhinorrhea and flu. Your answer is much better. It's not for septic shock, it's for dehydration. Oh, residents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While your content is true, your answer misses the mark as well given the initial question. Your answer assumed septic shock, end organ dysfunction, etc as best avoided by good hydration. This isn't really true though either, so I take back that what you say is true. No matter how well hydrated you are, septic shock requires pressors, aggressive IV fluids, broad spectrum antibiotics, yada yada yada. The fluid loss/shift in that pathological process is horrendous and totally unrelated. The initial question  asked about the colloquial general advice regarding run of the mill URIs, not the boogeyman of infectious disease.
How about a more holistic answer: increased fluids produces more lymph which facilitates antigen uptake, presentation and clearance. Increased fluid is also palliative and preventative, reducing myalgia and keeps other organs like your kidneys, which regulate lytes, running tip top.
Colds suck. </p>
<p>Edit for colloquial purposes: antigen = foreign invading protein your body greets with &quot;you're not one of us, GTFO&quot;
Myalgia = muscle pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh God that explains why they told my dad that I will die when I fainted after my blood pressure went down... After I went to the hospital after 4 days with diarrhea, my period and they tried to take out 4 essay tubes of blood from my arm. I fainted of course... Lost so much liquids and they put me in the  stretcher with so many tubes and oxygen and 2 bags of serum in each arm... I felt like it was like other times when I fainted, because I heard and everything but my pressure they said was almost non existing
I'm a low pressure person... Normally around 90-70 so imagine how low it was... For everybody in the hospital to freak out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the question may have been aimed more towards less serious infections like the common cold. Everything said above was spot on regarding septic shock. For less serious infections, the simple ELI5 answer: increasing fluids pushes more circulation towards the lymphatic system (which kills viruses/bacteria) which kills more germs and makes you better. </p>
