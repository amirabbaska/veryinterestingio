			<div class="markdown"><p>That's sort of an urban myth.  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229437155_The_Twentieth_Century_Reversal_of_Pink-Blue_Gender_Coding_A_Scientific_Urban_Legend" target="_blank">Here</a> is a research paper about the topic.  </p>
<p>There are four total references, including the two you listed, suggesting that pink should be for boys and blue for girls, and lots suggesting that pink should be for girls and blue for boys, dating back to 1890.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It says occurrences of certain phrases were searched for in a database of over 5 million books from 1800 to 2000, not that there are 5 million sources suggesting what you said. 5 million sources in a research paper would've been interesting, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Though he doesn't cite all the sources he saw, just Google books (and a few sources for other info, like the possibility that it's a biological preference).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries, it's a fairly recent paper (2012) - before he did the research, the best information we had was what you posted.  Most of the information that pops up on Google was published before that and got really popular because it's definitely interesting.</p></div>		</li>
