<p>This even includes &quot;aggressively retiring&quot; an old queen. When she becomes too old and infirm she is no longer capable of producing the correct pheromone to tell the hive that she is a queen. The hive will regard her as as foreign insect and kill her, thus freeing up a position for a new queen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I realise that, however that's not always true, especially for bees that are not in the hive 24/7. Scent gets weak and the guard bees are none the wiser and who are they to complain about a bee that's bringing back good. How do you think robbing happens in apiaries? Plus it's stupid easy to fool both parties of bees. </p>
<p>One of the ways to help a struggling hive is to take a frame of brood and nurse bees and put them into a failing hive. It gives them a bunch of young bees that will help revitalize the colony. All you need to do to prevent any fighting is to spray the frame with a little sugar water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds about right. I have an infestation of wasps at my house every fall (its cold and i have a black roof on my garage so they sleep there to keep from freezing, i think.) And can confirm, they are gigantic bitches. I could see why no colony/hive would accept those punks.</p></div>		</li>
