<p>The thing that truly worries me about this is that everyone seems to see it, but no one seems to be able or willing to do anything about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that people who are living comfortably are much more likely to be politically pacified. Right now I see a generation of young people who are literate enough to understand how corporate socialism (US economy is not truly capitalism) fucks them over. A decent number of them are actually pissed enough to start doing something about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a senior in high school now and so probably lack the necessary perspective to fully discuss student loan politics, but I'll go ahead and ask anyway:</p>
<p>Don't most in-state schools have pretty solid in-state discounts? I know at least that if I chose to go to UVA I'd be able to mostly avoid going into debt, especially with my parents helping to cover it.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to argue that everyone in debt just hasn't been going about it right or should have just been &quot;born richer&quot; or whatever, but I'm kind of struggling to understand why the problem is as large as it is and how so many people end up paying absurd amounts of money to go to university in the US rather than being able to get decent financial aid commensurate with their income level and a subsidy from going to school in-state and studying a subject that has good earning potential.</p>
<p>edit: double negatives are a slippery slope to bad english</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really a bunch of people who decided to take out loans to live out there college fantasy and now that they can't find jobs are crying about it instead of doing something about it. My brother hasn't accepted a penny from my Dad for college, he works and he went to community college and makes straight A's. He's just been accepted to his first choice school and he is going to take out some loans now just because he wants to be done in 2 years now that he has an awesome head start and the college he wants. He will walk away with maybe 30k in loans an EE degree from a top 10 in the world school and some work history to put on his resume when he starts looking for his career job. It's completely possible for a normal person to get a degree with out debt if they don't just quit working and go to school full-time. </p></div>		</li>
