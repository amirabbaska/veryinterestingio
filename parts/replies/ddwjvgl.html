<p>TL;DR - The lack of unskilled labor jobs has created a drastic devaluation of college degrees because everyone &quot;has to&quot; go to college. This leads to many people having tens of thousands of dollars of debt upon graduation. Since wages have increased a lot slower than tuition, this is creating an ROI black hole. Much of wealth people are earning is going to paying back tuition rather than to living.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also think there are whole classes of middle class jobs that have just evaporated.</p>
<p>In the past some manager at each fast food restaurant would produce sales reports, monitor inventory and place orders for whatever they'd need next week. Now that's almost certainly entirely computerized, nobody needs to do that kind of work any more. There are probably a few more people at corporate doing that kind of work for the whole country, but there's one less in every fast food restaurant in every town.</p>
<p>Shipping is another thing (where I have a lot more first hand experience). Every warehouse in the country would have had a shipping manager (or more than one) who'd track orders and inventory, figure out what was available to leave and allocate staff to go pick that order and get it out the door. Now that job is almost entirely done by computer. It creates a few more positions for software developers like me, but ultimately a few less middle income jobs in every warehouse in the country.</p>
<p>The particularly insidious thing about this is that it breaks the corporate ladder. It used to be at McDonalds* that you could start as a cashier and if the store manager thought you were competent then he might let you do the inventory one week and see how that turned out. Then maybe in a few months you'd get the start placing the replenishment orders, and over time you could transition into a store management role yourself. From there you might have a shot at transferring over to regional management and into the greater corporate structure. Someone without a formal education who worked hard could actually transition into a decent career. Obviously most people never made that leap, but was a leap that could be made. </p>
<p>Now nobody is going to say &quot;John does a good job of balancing his cash drawer, let's make him an Inventory Analyst&quot; and there are fewer and fewer jobs in between.</p>
<p>* I actually know almost nothing about McDonald's and it's possible this doesn't really apply, but i thought a concrete example would be easier to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do make a point</p>
<p>I worked at publix for two years. Guys who dropped out of highschool could work our ordering system with 2 weeks of training. The managers didn't need much technical knowhow, all of the hard stuff was preprogrammed off site and the management was more in charge of making sure everyone did everything</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny how ridiculous that sounds now. There's simply no way a large company that has high school dropouts ordering canned beans for individual grocery stores could ever compete with the likes of Walmart and Kroger. </p>
<p>Go back a little further in time and those orders for beans would have been phone or faxed in to suppliers and someone on the other end would have to handle taking that order and ensuring it filled and invoiced properly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fabulous point about the change to upward mobility potential.</p>
<p>I see this in healthcare. Most of our low level staff would make terrible doctors, but there are a few with real potential who I think would be fabulous. Their current job does nothing to provide that opportunity. Not that I want doctors trained without medical school, but it's interesting how there's such limited potential for growth at work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree, but to put it in another light: youth aren't being sold an education, they're being sold debt. Debt is hugely profitable. Government and universities want some of that too, hence the massive push for everyone to get at least some college. Not to devalue education, but when a system is fucked, just follow the money...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree. This seems to be so much common sense, yet it blows me away how few people recognize this. I could see that this was happening fifteen years ago, yet many people I have mentioned it to over the years were oblivious. To me, it's as simple as &quot;if everyone is special, then no one is special.&quot; Bachelors degrees are just glorified high school diplomas these days, but many people I know with Masters can't find work because they are considered overqualified and/or too expensive. Why pay someone with a MBA when you can underpay someone with a BS who will be grateful that they can even find a damned job?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>College is half technical skills and half everything else. People choose a simple undifferentiated major and perform at or below average and then expect above average pay. It's a viewpoint thing more than a lack of good jobs. And if an MBA can't find a job clearly they aren't a master of business in any sense lol. I know people don't want to feel like they could actually fail but sometimes it's the reality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PhDs are incredibly difficult to obtain, requiring intense <em>original research</em> that expands the domain of human knowledge in one area. There are other doctorates that are more like &quot;applied PhDs&quot; such as Ed.D. (education doctorates) and DBA (doctor of business administration) that focus on taking someone else's original research and applying it to some particular area, but even those are extremely difficult to get.</p>
<p>There's something like a 50% washout rate in most doctorate programs -- 50% of the tiny % that is actually allowed in -- and virtually all of them are nearly ground to dust in the process whether they make it or not. Some are driven to suicide. It can be crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ph.D. In chemistry from Princeton University here. A Ph.D. is hard to get but not that hard, it is more time consuming than anything else. I know a lot of people with advanced degrees and it doesn't make finding a job much easier. I think this is because there arent that many jobs for people who are so specialized. In industry, if a company can hire someone to do the same job who has a BS and pay them less they will. So there is a similar oversupply for demand thing going on at that level already. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The good thing about PhD's are that they are very difficult to obtain and may become the glass ceiling for many. You need a lot of research and dedicate a lot of time to obtain the PhD. However, I would not be surprised if they made some alternative to make people feel special.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I can only say for engineering Ph.D.s. It depends on who your advisor is. If your advisor is really nice, you can fool around for 3 or 4 years, get some experiment data, piece them together and publish a few trashy papers that nobody will read at some academic conferences that nobody attends, or even have no publication at all, and your advisor will award you a Ph.D.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your advisor is hard-working or eager to get his tenure, he will work you like a mule. You stay in the lab or stare at a computer monitor 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 6 or 7 years. You publish 5 or more papers, all on peer-reviewed journals with high impact factors. Only then you are qualified to graduate.</p>
<p>The truth is, the relationship between a Ph.D. student and an advisor is very like the traditional master-apprentice relationship in the handicraft industry. Your Ph.D. experience will be predominately determined by your advisor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't believe that you guys do not know about post doctoral fellowships. My dad did one. It is kind of a level above PhDs. You do original research but usually the duration is smaller than PhD. You could be guided by a Professor or you can pursue it self-guided.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PhDs aren't likely to become common. You have to do original research in order to be awarded one. They require both skill, and a fairly high amount of luck.</p>
<p>A master's only requires you to take classes, and as such is much much easier to obtain. This isn't to say that a master's is easy to obtain. It's still quite hard, but a PhD is far more difficult to get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While your latter point is certainly the case in some masters programs, others require far more than just class attendance before the degree can be obtained. My masters degree was for a physical science and required not just course attendance, but a three hour oral comprehensive exam with my committee in my third semester, completion of a thesis showing original research in my field, a public and private defense of that research, and acceptance of that thesis by the graduate school before the degree was officially conferred. It wasn't as hard as a PhD, but the only real differences between a masters degree in my program and a PhD was the structure of the comprehensive exams (which for the doctors required essay responses as well as the oral part), the number of credits required, and the publishing of an article showcasing your research in a peer-reviewed journal (which many masters students in that program strive to do anyway). </p></div>		</li>
