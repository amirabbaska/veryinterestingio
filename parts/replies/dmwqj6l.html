<p>The idea is that you can move some distance closer to the object, as long as you are at approximately the same height, and based on the two angles, you can compute the height of the distant object to a good approximation, without knowing how far you are from it.</p>
<p>If the floor is not level, the problem gets a bit messier, but not too much.</p></div>		</li>
