			<div class="markdown"><p>This article nicely differentiates between health care outcomes and causes of death like accidents and so on.</p>
<p>But what it doesn't mention and which few seem to be talking about in this thread overall is that a MAJOR part of life expectancy is whether you avoid  smoking, exercise and avoid being morbidly obese (a little overweight may not matter much, but a lot will - with more HTN and diabetes and so on).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. However the discussion is not really about life expectancy but rather how misleading a statistic it is in regards to gauging the quality of health care.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you factor out things like violence and accidents the American life expectancy actually normalizes and surpasses all other countries.</p>

<p>Why would you factor out violence and accidents?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nature of accidents will differ by country for reasons unrelated to healthcare. For example, you're much more likely to be shot in America than you are in, say, France because of the relative difference in gun ownership. Similarly, you're more likely to be injured in a car accident in America than you are in <em>many</em> other countries due to the lower relative cost of petrol in America and a higher prevalence of road systems which support vehicle travel.</p>
<p>Now, if you focused the discussion on the quality of treatment for <em>specific injuries</em>, it would be fair to factor accidental injuries of that type. However, the question of the nature of accidental injuries themselves isn't normalized between countries, so using it to judge the quality of healthcare will give you a perspective that's influenced by a factor that has nothing at all to do with the actual healthcare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the best healthcare system in the world can't do anything for you if you are murdered or die on impact in a car crash. Somebody dying young from either shouldn't be an indictment on the quality of a nation's healthcare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that other countries' healthcare systems actually <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Accidents-to-children-in-the-home/Pages/How-to-prevent-accidents.aspx" target="_blank">do work to prevent accidents</a>, given that prevention is better than cure, so it seems odd to exclude the effect of those efforts.</p>
<p>Edit:  Of course my one example is simply that - one example.</p>
<p>Other, more physical examples of how the NHS spends money on accident prevention would be things like school visits to teach safety in the home, getting people on free bike safety courses as part of the cycle to work scheme (where the NHS pays for part of your bike if you use it to commute and so get healthier), etc.</p>
<p>And I appreciate that it happens in the USA too, which makes the decision to ignore the differing effectiveness of accident prevention all the more dubious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we're trying to figure out the efficacy of the health care system, not how good the US is at preventing murders. You would exclude them from other countries as well when looking at comparative data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd add that the U.S. also strictly adheres to the WHO standard of recording a live birth if there is any sign of life. Even some developed countries with modern recordkeeping do not do this, and only count a birth if the child survives for a period ranging up to a week. In countries without modern care and records, infant mortality is self-reported and likely heavily under-reported.</p></div>		</li>
