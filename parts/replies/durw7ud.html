			<div class="markdown"><p>As in you can cause permanent damage, or just fix the damage as in now. If your sleep schedule is off now you have very temporary damage to a lot of your functions that gets worse as your body doesn't rest enough . Wording was poor on that, sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if my sleep schedule consists of sleeping about 5 hours on the weekday, maybe an hour nap for 2 or 3 of those days and getting 8-10 hours of sleep on the weekend? This has been my schedule for almost two months and looks like it will stay that way until classes are over for the semester. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>How tho? </p>
<p>In all seriousness though I’m pretty sure I’ve got a sleep disorder where instead of my circadian rhythm being 16 hours awake 8 asleep my body consistently tends to prefer 20 hours awake and 10 hours asleep. When I didn’t have a job that was totally fine and I had a very consistent sleep schedule even if it didn’t match up with the days, but having a job means there are specific times I need to be awake so when my sleep schedule drifts to conflict with that everything gets disrupted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Circadian rhythm disorders are a thing. &quot;Non-24 hour sleep wake disorder&quot; is when your body wants to function on a daily cycle that's not approximately 24 hours. People with the disorder usually have a 25 or 26 hour cycle.</p>
<p>Treatment includes: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Getting bright sunlight in the morning right after waking up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoiding artificial lights and electronics at night after the sun sets</p>
</li>
<li>Taking melatonin at specific times. </li>
</ol>
<p>These are things everyone should be doing (except the melatonin) but they're especially important for people with circadian rhythm disorders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>try calculating it with how long a sleep cycle is. They're 90 minutes. Generally if you wake up between sleep cycles, or in the light sleep part of a sleep cycle (within the start portion and the end portion) you feel better and more rested as opposed to waking up in the middle of deep sleep feeling groggy and disoriented.</p>
<p>This website is good! You plug in your wake time and it'll tell you went to go to bed to get a certain amount of cycles. <a href="http://sleepcalculator.com/" target="_blank">http://sleepcalculator.com/</a></p></div>		</li>
