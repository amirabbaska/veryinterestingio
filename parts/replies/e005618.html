			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to build the various centrifuges and gaseous diffusion equipment, the Army needed a <em>lot</em> of copper for the electrical wiring.  As copper was a critical component of ammunition (copper-jacketed lead bullets), the Army ended up borrowing 15,000 tons of silver from the US Mint to make silver wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Borrowed. Used. Then returned. Then they burnt the floorboards under where they worked it into wire to recover the silver dust, and returned that, too. </p>
<p>Fun fact: they asked for 6,000 tonnes, and treasury asked what that was in Troy ounces. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oak Ridge didn't just enrich the uranium (at the K-25, S-50, and Y-12 facilities), it was also the location of the X-10 reactor, the second artificial nuclear reactor built and a pilot plant for plutonium production - it served as the testbed for the creation of the Hanford site reactors that produced the material used in the plutonium-based devices that the Manhattan project produced.</p></div>		</li>
