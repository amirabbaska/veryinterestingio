<p>all have debt</p>

<p>For what it's worth it's actually a good thing economically to have a bit of debt as a country since it opens up certain options; some of the problems that the US ran into the one time t actually became debt free are quite interesting.</p>
<p>The real issue is more in when the debt grows so large that you start to have issues based on its size (which the US isn't even close to yet).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I tell my students is that for every dollar we &quot;owe&quot; China, they &quot;owe&quot; us 89 cents.  It's not in direct cash, it's all in bonds. Those bonds can't be cashed out until they mature, and it means that their return on investment is directly tied to our economic success. They have an incentive to make sure we do well, and vice versa. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the effective value of a modern country's economy, and therefore currency, is heavily dependant on that country's debt. GDP in a vaccuum doesn't really show how well a country is doing, just like a person, you have to look at their GDP/debt ratio, and their stability and reliability.</p>
<p>Short version. Country's, like people, can't function in modern society without debt. And country's basically have a &quot;credit score&quot; based on very similar criteria, but on a world scale. One of the easiest ways to see it in action, is the relative value of your country's currency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No story time, but listen to this!! Planet money’s podcast on when the US was debt free and how it wasn’t so great overall. If the link does’t work the episode is called “when the US paid off the entire national debt” it’s very interesting</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in 1835, Andrew Jackson paid off the national debt, which led to some problems and the US hasn't been debt free since. I learned about this on a Planet Money podcast and can't do the story justice myself, so here's a link:

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate: the entire financial system assesses risk, at a theoretical level, with national debt as a benchmark. </p>
<p>The idea is that you have to adjust for relative risk in investing, and so you need a theoretical rate of return that is as safe as imaginable so that you can compare all other investment opportunities against it. Debt issued from a government is about the closest you can get to that, because you would have high faith that the government would pay its debts (it has tons of resources, has always paid its debts, etc). </p>
<p>So knowing that, whatever the rate of return on government bonds is, other riskier investments have to have a higher rate. </p>
<p>If the stock market is returning 5% every year, but with high risk of crashing, and the government is returning 5% every year with zero risk of defaulting, then why on Earth would you risk your money in the stock market? You'd buy up all the government bonds you could. </p>
<p>That's also the risk for high government debt - as it gets higher, it gets more likely the government will default, which means they need to pay a higher and higher rate to keep attracting investors. This reduces private sector investment because more people will put their money in government bonds. </p>
<p>But if you eliminated government debt entirely, you'd also throw the financial system into chaos. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you calculate per inhabitant the US is at $76.908 and Germany at €23.949. Though comparing per working inhabitant might be fairer, which makes it $132.282 to €47.898 (<a href="http://www.theusdebtclock.com/" target="_blank">http://www.theusdebtclock.com/</a>)</p>
<p>Now Germany is pretty low compared to many other European nations, the last number for Spain is €61.963 and for the Netherlands its €58.214 and France €72.408.</p>
<p>The total debt is also there and as of now(ish):</p>
<p>USA:</p>
<p>$23.943.874.000.000</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>€1.988.476.660.000</p>
<p>the Netherlands at</p>
<p>€480.702.750.000 </p>
<p>Spain</p>
<p>€1.680.997.150.000</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>€2.274.118.750.000</p>
<p>If you look at how fast it is rising, than that might be interesting as well. Per second: USA $45486, Germany €58, the Netherlands €335, Spain €5046, France €2665. Now these economies aren't equal but you can still clearly see whats going on. Especially with the one from Germany.</p>
<p>Another problem however is that because we have global economies and companies that operate worldwide, that a nation can get hit hard whenever a big companies of it fails to continue its business. Bailing out banks has been a hard hit on most of the governments, which is why Europe has such high loans right now. And in some sense the USA too. And on top of it its also why the public has been so negative about bonusses of all those banks that have been saved and now continuing like nothing happened.</p></div>		</li>
