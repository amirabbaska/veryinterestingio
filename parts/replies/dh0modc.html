			<div class="markdown"><p>I would genuinely like to know what an average day is like, a bad day is like for you. We had a young man come into one of our classes in college and talk about his experiences, and I wished we had more time to really talk to him and find out more about his personal experiences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pharmacist that used to work at a psych hospital told me of a patient intake where the patient was asked where the voices originate. Her response, &quot;My left butt cheek.&quot; </p>
<p>It's sad when you realize that as soon as you start hearing a voice, you will for the rest of your life. I'm sure some treatments will help, but does it temporarily eliminate it?</p></div>		</li>
