			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what we ARE paying Fireman in Orange County and L.A. county, California. My buddy was rolling in overtime and easily making six figures as a fireman paramedic in Orange County. They don't want people to know they are making stupid money but they get so much OT any time they want and bonuses and extra pay for stuff. And half the time they are at Starbucks, washing the truck, playing cards and video games, cooking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what does 100k a year get you in LA? Can you even buy a house with that?</p>
<p>Sure, I make 50k as a fire medic at my full time job, work 100ish hours every 2 weeks and still have a part time job, but I have a nice house with some land and the lights stay on. </p>
<p>Pay is certainly respective to where you live. Chicago fire medics might make close to 100k a year, but they still can't afford to comfortably live in the city they work in (at least in a nice are)</p>
<p>That's why I feel like rural medics make less (also the significantly reduced work load). If you can buy a 3 bedroom house for 70k vs 200k for me vs 500+ for la; and you make a quarter of the runs I do a shift- of course you're going to get paid less</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't mean you could get someone just as qualified for less money. I have 2 buddies working as firefighters in CA. Both make 6 figures and competition to get those jobs is HUGE. You have to know someone or fit the right demographic to even get looked at. </p>
<p>There are hundreds of qualified applicants per position,  and as long as they are working for us (the taxpayer), they should be paid just enough to get qualified applicants. </p></div>		</li>
