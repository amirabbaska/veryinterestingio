			<div class="markdown"><p>I could answer this one fairly well! You have two automatic nervous systems called the sympathetic and parasympathetic. The sympathetic system is typically referred to as &quot;fight or flight&quot;, but in other words it helps increase heart rate, dilate your eyes, decrease digestive functions, etc. Whereas the parasympathetic system basically does the opposite where it decreases heart rate, increase digestive function, etc. When you're sad or depressed, this creates an imbalance in your nervous system, causing you to go into &quot;stress mode&quot;. This &quot;stress mode&quot; activates your sympathetic system, thus decreasing digestive function and appetite. Hope this helps! And if anyone else has something to add or correct feel free to do so!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The parasympathetic system is coined as the &quot;rest and digest&quot; autonomic nervous system. The parasympathetics kick in when you are in a relatively calm state, and there's no immediate stress or danger nearby. When your parasympathetic system is on, your heart rate decreases, the bronchioles (tubes leading to lungs) constrict, your blood vessels constrict, your pupils constrict, and your body starts to digest any food it might have or might get soon.  In all of these systems, the parasympathetic system releases acetylcholine (ACh) on the effector organ.</p>
<p>Because I'm on the subject, I can give some more brief explanations for the effect on some of these systems:</p>
<p>Heart: There is a cluster of cells in your heart known as the pacemaker cells, or SA node. This node sends signals for your heart to beat at a rhythmic pace. When your heart doesn't need to pump much blood to the body, the parasympathetics release ACh on the SA node to slow their activity.</p>
<p>Lungs:  The bronchioles in your lungs are lined with smooth muscle (an involuntary muscle). When you aren't in need for increased oxygen, your parasympathetics will release ACh on these muscles to constrict the airways.</p>
<p>Pupils: I'm not nearly as well versed in this area as I am others, but the idea behind the pupil constriction is that during those &quot;high-stress&quot; moments, you'll want to perceive as much as you can. Therefore when you're just sitting on a couch watching TV, your parasympathetics will constrict your pupils.</p>
<p>Digestive Functions: When you smell, see, taste, or even think about eating food, your parasympathetics kick in. They activate the salivary glands in your mouth, and the cells in your stomach that activate acid secretion. Once food is delivered to the stomach/small intestine, the parasympathetics will release ACh on the smooth muscle in the GI tract to increase muscle contraction, otherwise known as peristalsis.</p>
<p>This is just an overview of the parasympathetic system, and I apologize if it's much longer than you wanted/anticipated!</p>
<p>PARASYMPATHETIC BONUS FACT:  The muscles that constrict your urethral sphincter and anal sphincter relax when ACh is released on the smooth muscle. So you use this system every time you go to the bathroom!</p></div>		</li>
