			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but I addressed that too. Hurricanes travel west in the north.</p>
<p>Hurricanes form in the Pacific. It is plenty warm enough. It's just that they travel west. That's why the east coast gets hit from the Atlantic, and the Pacific hurricanes travel to Asia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, storms tend travel to the west at low latitude, and to the east at high latitude. In the Pacific near the US, by the time a storm is far enough north to travel to the east, it's also usually in water cold enough to make it fall apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true. The pacific has just as many warm water coasts as does the Atlantic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_gyre" target="_blank">However, with the way the gyres work in the northern hemisphere (ocean current turning clockwise), the fresh warm tropic waters hit the east coasts before cycling up to the arctic, where they are cooled off, and brought back down to the west coasts.</a> This is why you also see warm tropical water in the 80's along the Pacific coasts in southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines throughout the summer months.</p>
<p>While yes, hurricanes like warm water, they are also dependent on high pressure zones for pushing the hurricanes, making them move across a greater area, and therefore picking up more warm water. If the high pressure zone isn't strong enough to move the hurricane, then the hurricane essentially dies and turns into a tropical storm. These high pressure zones also allow accurate prediction of where the hurricane will travel. The higher the pressure, the further away from the high pressure zone the hurricane will swing. The lower the pressure, the sharper the hurricane will swing in unison with the circular ocean currents. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores_High" target="_blank">The high pressure zone that allows for accurate predictions on the East Coast of the US is the &quot;The Azores High&quot; AKA &quot;The Bermuda-Azores High,&quot; or just &quot;The Bermuda High.&quot;</a></p>
<p>For example, Hurricane Katrina was able to travel all the way to Louisiana before making landfall because the Bermuda high was at a very high pressure for a long time. However, Hurricane Irene sharply turned north because the Bermuda high was at a high enough pressure to push it to the east coast, but then dropped in pressure allowing it to travel up to New York before dying out. </p></div>		</li>
