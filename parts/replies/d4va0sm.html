			<div class="markdown"><p>The surfaces of most metals are RIDICULOUSLY reactive. It doesn't matter if your gas only contains 0.00001% of oxygen, that oxygen will find a way to react with the surface. Only nobel metals like iridium, silver or gold will keep a somewhat clean surface in a very pure nobel gas environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally get that bit. The thought of an inert gas atmosphere is more doable than a vacuum though...I could see doing a final lapping/cleaning of material in an argon flooded environment and then sealing the constituent pieces in an argon-flooded can and welding it shut....Hrmmm...THAT might be doable...</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, they don't need to be elementally pure. Adding, for example, carbon to pure iron simple introduces carbon atoms interspersed through the lattice, which changes properties on the macro-level but has little effect on the lattice. The rule here is that the two metals being cold welded have to be similar. The rules on what is 'similar' are not hard and fast, but generally the more dissimilar the two metals are, the more pressure you'll need to apply to cold weld them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am unsure about this.</p>
</li>
<li>You can definitely bond dissimilar metals, assuming that you consider them dissimilar on a macro level. The similarity requirement is on a micro level. Most significantly, to enable a proper cold weld you'd want the lattice structure of the two metals to be the same. Ie a cubic lattice metal will not bond well to a trigonal metal, but may bond alright to an orthorhombic lattice. Again, the rules of 'similarity' are not hard and fast, rather they are very case specific. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick question if you don't mind chiming in. Now, from my understanding when these lattice &quot;snap&quot; together they're sharing electrons. Wouldn't this mean now there's an abundance of electrons in the layer where they bonded? Would this be able to be measured as voltage like static electricity, EMF, or an ion. I'm having trouble understanding were this enegery is coming from and going to. I know it called cold welding but I can't imagine heat isn't produced during this event. Also in a vacuum such as space would a solid, pure block of metal be under stress as if it were being pulled apart even with its on gravitational pull?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A block of solid metal in space would not experience stress as a result of the vacuum. This would require a pressure differential caused by e.g. a chamber within the block of metal filled with gas (e.g. the ISS). The block would still experience normal gravitational stresses as you'd expect and mentioned.</p>
<p>Regarding the electrons, note that I am a mechanical/biomedical engineer, not a chemical engineer. The mechanical engineering answer is that metal atoms do not hold onto individual electrons. Instead, metal atoms form a structural lattice in a 'sea' of electrons. This is in heavy contrast to, for example, organic molecules which are much more particular about which electron belongs to which atom(s). As such, I do not imagine you'd have a measurable potential difference anywhere in the system.</p>
<p>Remember that the number of atoms at the interface are a negligible fraction of the ions in the system. You'd have a TINY amount of heat produced. However, remember that heat is generated through friction. If we look at, for example, the gold atoms at a perfectly clean interface, you'd find that they can diffuse as easily at room temperature as the bulk could had we reached the melting point of gold. That is to say, there is practically no friction in the cold welding process, so negligible heat would be produced.</p>
<p>Caveat: again, this is a mechanical engineer's perspective. I would love for a chemical engineer to chip in. I also imagine other materials, especially dissimilar pairs, would experience more friction and thus heat generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for filling in some more detail here. As I'm used to ferrous materials, I'm really only familiar with the basic mechanics of cubic lattice materials.</p>
<p>Your first point makes me think a little more about the difficulties in forge welding high-alloy materials. I had always blamed most of it on some of the nasty oxides that form from certain elements (Cr is a real PITA for this), which is an issue, but there may be more at play. As I take a look at the process required for higher alloy steels (longer soak times at heat before and after the weld, etc.) I can see how some of these mechanics may be involved too. I'll need to think about it. </p>
<p>As to your third point...Oh, great, now I have to go research the microstructures of a BUNCH of materials now and relate it to what I know from anecdotal evidence. Yay! Another research project! :-/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's used to bond dissimilar materials that might not otherwise mate to each other. It makes use of the force of a shaped charge to push the two (very clean and flat) materials together hard enough to force a bonding at the atomic level.</p>
<p>It's used for weird aerospace composites and the like. <a href="http://www.uaarms.com/New_Lightweight_1911_Pistol_-_Explosively_Bonded_Metals/" target="_blank">This</a> is my favorite application so far though :)</p></div>		</li>
