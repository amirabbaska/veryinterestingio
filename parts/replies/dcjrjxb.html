			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this explanation, they're also not transcribing words and letters, but syllables. They're typing entire syllables at a time, which makes it much faster.</p>
<p>This does require a  considerable amount of skill and training to do correctly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And they do it based off of sound, not spelling (which you kind of got at with syllables, but didn't say explicitly). The machine does a lot of the figuring out what the correct spelling is based off of the sound and the court reporter also goes back to fix things/correct proper names when there's downtime.</p>
<p>That being said, they do have a limit of how fast they can type. I'm a fast talker and get asked to slow down if I'm not thinking about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they usually ask me ahead of time for names and such, presumably so they can go back and make the corrections as needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add on, modern court reporters have headphones and are recording the entire proceedings. So if there's ever a long pause or a break, they can backtrack and fill in any words they missed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most reporters also don't give the transcript right away, they go back to their office and edit it. Gotta be perfect in the court of law.</p>
<p>On a side note, my college employed court reporters for deaf and hard of hearing students. I met a few of them and it was fun watching them work in classrooms</p></div>		</li>
