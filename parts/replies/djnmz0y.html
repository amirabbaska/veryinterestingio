			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people in this thread retell the school textbook explanation bordering on university-level general physics course version. This is a phenomenological model that fails to explain a lot of experimentally observed phenomena related to friction. Complete microscopic theory, on the other hand, must be able to take chemical formulas of two materials and predict, for example, friction coefficient for various loads and speeds. Such a theory does not exist yet. Various bits and pieces of it are being developed in the last few years with the emergence of new kinds of scientific instruments with which to attack this problem. But it's in the early stages; something like the pre-quantum chemistry of the XIX century: most chemists then thought they knew perfectly how chemistry &quot;works&quot;, but throwing even simplest basic questions at them could reveal huge inconsistencies and astonishing lack of knowledge of what basic elements of their theory are on a microscopic level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thankyou! Well explained. Just another question. Regarding the standard explanation (uneven surfaces causing small parts of the two surfaces to collide thereby absorbing some kinetic energy and converting to heat energy), how much does this contribute to the total coefficient of friction? Is it 90 percent, 50 percent? Or is it such an oversimplification that you can't really give a answer like this? Thanks</p></div>		</li>

<p>there is no microscopic theory of how polishing works</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you explain that a bit more?  That's fascinating.  I'd love to read more on the subject, can you point me in the right direction?</p></div>		</li>
