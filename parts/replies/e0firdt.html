			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only part of the explanation. The most prominent side effect, especially for women, is that SSRIs stimulate certain serotonin receptors that can cause a decrease in dopamine and norepinephrine in an area of the brain, which can have an effect on libido.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, the top comment is simply wrong. Otherwise the sideeffect could be easily treated with Viagra.</p>
<p>It's the decreased libido that's the problem in both sexes, and not some superficial blood flow restrictions.</p>
<p>Serotonin and other neurotransmitters can have completely opposite effects depending on where in the brain they are doing their work.</p>
<p>SSRI are completely untargeted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic issue is no drug is side effect free and most drugs don't actually fix the root cause but simply create a desirable effect. So to answer your question it might be possible for some people but often isn't worth it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, no. We simply don't know enough about how our own brains work.</p>
<p>Not to mention that targeting drugs at specific organs (only being released there) is already incredibly hard, much less specific regions with an organ, and the brain is even harder than other organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I told one of my psychiatrists about this once, and that I wanted to get off the pills for this reason, in addition to telling her previously that I didn't have a girlfriend and she responded with this weird sense of surprise and incredulity. She actually asked me what the point of stopping was if I wasn't going to have sex with anyone. There was a long pause and then she asked &quot;is it because you masturbate?&quot; I was like.... yes. Fucking awkward af. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor, but for anyone having the issue of not being able to orgasm, I highly recommend asking their psychiatrist for an additional prescription for Buproprion (Wellbutrin). It's also an anti-depressant but actually has the opposite effect where it increases sex drive.</p>
<p>I had taken Paxil in the past but gave it up because I couldn't orgasm. Later on in life when I almost made actual suicide attempts they put me on Zoloft which had the same problem, but by then I had also heard about the counteracting effect from Wellbutrin. It's honestly changed my life, no longer depressed AND I can still get erect and orgasm.</p>
<p>Again, not a doctor so do your research but this has been my experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was what my Dr did for me and I was on Wellbutrin for like ten years.</p>
<p>It was the perfect mix of low side effects and
Anti depressant - i believe it’s also a stimulant so it ended up helping my ADHD as well.</p>
<p>Buproprion was a good drug for me I feel like it’s a little ‘old’ now - Arnt there newer better
Drugs yet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably will always be there as long as we use SSRIs. What I would like to see is a hybrid pill of SSRI and whatever Buproprion is.</p></div>		</li>
