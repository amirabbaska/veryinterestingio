			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important note. There are a lot of great shows that suffer from this trope, and end up losing viewership because nobody knows when or whether it will actually be on. This causes the initial cancellation. Sometimes, like with Futurama, there will be demand for the show's return during syndication and it comes back. Family Guy would have been a niche animated sitcom from the late 90's early 00's had Adult Swim not bought the rights to air the 3 original seasons religiously until Fox saw the cash cow potential in the show's revival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I remember Family Guy being cancelled like 3 diff times.... even tho I can't remember laughing so hard at an animated show in a very long time. Still remember seeing the first episode after the Super Bowl, but then so confused when it was canceled a few months later. </p>
<p>Sometimes shows just need time or the right time slot to gain momentum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it's been a while, but, what the hell happened at Sci-Fi?  They cancelled good science fiction shows and started in with all the fantasy soap operas targeting tween girls.  Those can't be getting better ratings/making more money than the older shows.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This dovetails in with the other issue: shows get picked/dropped based on their Nielsen ratings, which use a selection of &quot;average&quot; homes, mostly in the midwest, and what their viewing habits are.  So if you have a &quot;niche&quot; show that targets a demographic not covered well by Nielsen, and you're not on a niche channel (Fox definitely doesn't count as niche here), then the ratings are going to be horrible even though there's a large potential viewership that will follow the show instead of just watch it if it happens to be on.  So with bad ratings and a randomized time slot, the reality is that most of the target market is going to find an alternate method of watching it that Nielsen doesn't cover, which leads to ratings so bad that it gets cut.</p>
<p>Why are ratings so important?  That's how the networks bill the advertisers.  If they can't make money on the show, they're not going to run it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Let's tune in and find out if we'll be seeing a new episode of Futurama or some shitty football game!  Ohhh.......&quot;</p>
<p>At some point even actual fans stop tuning in, tired of being disappointed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I remember when Futurama originally started. There would be commercials all week for &quot;THIS SUNDAY ON FUTURAMA...!&quot; But then the episode would never show because it was scheduled at a time slot that football would ALWAYS over run. Sometime they'd start whatever should have been on right after the football stuff was done, but many times they'd start right from the Simpsons (which was scheduled to come on after) instead of Futurama.</p></div>		</li>
