			<div class="markdown"><p>It passed in the Senate. The bill will now need to be voted on by the House. </p>
<p>The House will attempt to add amendments to it, which could be anything from &quot;This shit is whack, this amendment will make it less shitty&quot; to &quot;The library in my home town needs a bunch of money.&quot;</p>
<p>If they make any changes, the changes will need to be voted on again by the Senate.</p>
<p>After it passes both the House and the Senate, it will be signed into law by the President. (Obama has already indicated he will sign it.)</p>
<p>The hope right now is that the House will kill it, which is extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>Edit: The other possibilities is that the House fucks it over significantly causing the Senate to effectively kill it, or that by the time it makes it back to the Senate support of it is a massive political minefield that they don't want to be known to actually sign it into law.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Taken from a recent news article, a former government security officer said that this bill basically increases the NSA's spying abilities, and that is supposedly the real point of the bill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One point is that most Americans that fear the NSA really mean the FBI.  The NSA only goes after foreign nationals.  That's because NSA is actually a part of the US military under the Dept. of Defense, and one of the laws that oversee the military - the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, actually prevents the military from being used as law enforcement within the US.  So, the FBI is instead tasked with that sort of thing.</p>
<p>This is why the Snowden leaks showed filters to filter out US communications intercepts by the NSA - it would be illegal for the NSA to act as law enforcement in America.  </p>
<p>(Foreigners are fair game for the NSA, though.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most important revelations regarding the NSA didn't come from Snowden, but from senior DEA officials, who spoke about a method called &quot;Parallel Construction.&quot; Basically, agencies who ARE permitted to spy in the US and on American citizens are able to obtain specific information from the NSA, and then are directed to &quot;recreate&quot; the evidence via 'legal' means against US targets. <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/dea-and-nsa-team-intelligence-laundering" target="_blank">From Reuters</a>. The other, perhaps insurmountable risk, is what Edward Snowden referred to as &quot;Turnkey Tyranny.&quot; It is true that the vast majority of intelligence agents, including the NSA, are law abiding patriots that completely respect the privacy of American citizens. But what would happen if a President or any senior official did not respect the law? Or decided the law was not in our best interests? They would have absolute power, not just over regular citizens, but over all other elected officials and other parts of our government, perhaps media too.  And the worst part is that we might not even know about it. This is not hypothetical, it's happened before....just never with the near unlimited capabilities the NSA possesses today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this.  By allowing &quot;anonymous&quot; data transfer from companies to the govt, your info can be handed over &quot;anonymized&quot; and then you pop up for something and they investigate you until they find cause enough to get the real thing they were after.  This removes the WHOLE concept of privacy rights.  You have the illusion of privacy, and when we find something we don't like we'll lie and tell you we never abused your rights.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Considering there are multiple senior officials who don't always see eye to eye- including the CIA/FBI/NSA(information sharing has always been an issue between them), someone's career would go down in a ball of fire. The director of the NSA is a general approved by the government. No one can make unilateral decisions on behalf of the entire intelligence community, and believing otherwise indicates a misunderstanding of how the bureaucratic process works at this level.</p></div>		</li>

From what I understand, it allows companies to share with each other, gov to company, and companies can submit to gov when they need assistance. I am also not a lawyer though... </p></div>		</li>

The way I have interpreted it, is that the government asks an ISP for data: Without the bill, the ISP's customers could sue them for spreading their private data. CISA gives ISP's legal immunity to being sued.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the hat tip! </p>
<p>/u/ebeneezerspulge -- I was perhaps a bit overzealous when I used the term 'requires'. More accurately, the bill would mandate companies share with the government 'anonymized' information related to imminent terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, cyber crime, violent crime, WMD's, or even &quot;serious economic harm&quot;. Those are some pretty darn broad categories. </p>
<p>As /u/RunsWithLava mentions, one concern is that due to the liability umbrella that comes with providing this data to the government, it makes the most sense and is likely to be cheapest for companies to just provide all activity data, properly anonymized, to the government, since the are then essentially immune to liability via the bill's liability umbrella. This extends to doing things which actually violate their Terms of Service and privacy agreements. So even though a company may not want to do this because of principles or something, if CISA is enacted, they would have an arguable legal obligation to their shareholders (in the case of a publicly traded company) to provide data to the government because it will reduce potential shareholder harm by eliminating liability. </p></div>		</li>
