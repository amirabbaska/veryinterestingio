			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for explaining tritium, it's in ACOG's (rifle optic used mainly in the military) to light up a part of the reticle in low light conditions. Whenever anyone asked why, I could only shrug and say &quot;it's got tritium in it.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tritium itself doesn't emit the light. The tritium is held in a phosphor-lined vial, where the beta emissions excite the phosphor. When the phosphor returns from it's excited state to it's regular state, the energy is re-emitted as light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most ACOGS are actually externally illuminated via a fibre optic feed across the top.  I know they do make self-illuminated models, but in four years, I never got to play with one :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>why don't they just use a dim LED and a small battery?  wouldn't it last just as long and be much cheaper?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do do that, for optics tritium was common in that mid range when electronics weren't good and optics were starting to get better(quality of optics has varied a lot and is actually driven more by the civilian market). Now you really only use tritium for things too small for electronics like night adaptations of iron sights. Otherwise it's electronic, when the lifetime on the battery is a few thousand hours and the battery costs so low then its logistically way easier and going electronic makes them adjustable.</p>
<p>Newer ones also come solar powered. But acogs were already kind of late for actually needing tritium at all which is why most used a fibre optic. Older European military optics used it way more and radium before it, but once red dot and holographic got popular and soldiers went from needing maybe one type of battery for a flashlight to half a dozen for tactical widgets then the need for tritium and its non adjustability went away. Outside of video games acogs aren't even popular anymore, they were always mediocre and newer optics are in a different league.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tritium exists at low natural abundance and is a soft beta emitter, so effects from its decay are minimal. </p>

<p>The key word there is natural. You could unnaturally bombard a sample of ethanol with neutrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting point is that a lot of enzymatic catalysis happens on a knifes edge energetically speaking. So much so a heavier hydrogen is actually not able to to the same chemical reaction, simply because its heavier.</p>
<p>So you can die from deuterium or tritium poisoning, even without the radiation it causes</p></div>		</li>
