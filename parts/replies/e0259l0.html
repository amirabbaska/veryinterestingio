<p>Read a bit, seems like both methods are used, but the first one involves huge gearboxes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When building engines for colossal vehicles, like trains, submarines, and aircraft carriers, it's easiest to have your primary power source generate electricity and then use that electricity to power motors which do the work. It would require an incredibly complex transmission to make a diesel engine move a large vehicle from a stop. Electric motors create all of their torque at any speed so they can just be directly connected to the output (propeller or wheels).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be pedantic note, if we’re talking aircraft carriers, the fission heats up one set of water that’s under such high pressure it doesn’t boil, and then that water goes through a heat exchanger to boil the water that makes the turbine go roundy-roundy.</p></div>		</li>
