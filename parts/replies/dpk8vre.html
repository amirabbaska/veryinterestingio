			<div class="markdown"><p>Keywords shouldn't matter. They define the constructs of the base language. But the development of types like struct/class/interface are the meat of the code. They may define the constraints to describe the base structure but newer languages implement generics like ALT in (C++) or Generics in .net, which can utilize any number of types to expand the concepts.
Such as List<string> and List<int> but utilize the type that is handed to it to form the same code. It basically constructs the type during compile and makes it strongly typed. </p>
<p>Function pointers (delegates in .net) are a prime example of multating types. As long as the function being pointed to meets the parameter structure it compiles. </p>
<p>Structs have unions and other things that expand the base types.</p>
<p>Furthermore, things in the languages become part of the compiler output such as <strong>FAR </strong>FAR LONG* or <strong>stdcall things that modify the way the compiler handles the code. (</strong>stdcall forces the compiler to push the resulting data into the ea register).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I understand your objection. Why wouldn't the keywords matter? Define them how you like, they're still English words that refer to specific concepts and you're still reading them, it seems to me that the brain activations involved should be very similar. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what relevance compiler output has here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am trying to say that the keywords aren't just the only source for learning and reading. While they define a basic structure of things that are happening like a story, they tell very little of the story in total. The point is that you can create new words that are not &quot;keywords&quot; as in reserved by the language but you can build new context to the entire statement. </p>
<p>typedef void (*myfunc)();</p>
<p>Is a prime example of a newly defined &quot;keyword&quot; in this instance is function pointer in C++, but is referenced in a context and synatically different access than other things. More like defining an int or long*. </p>
<p>You are right the compiler output doesn't matter per se, but it does matter if the language is in the code and it's underlying meaning changes how the compiler handles the output image in the final linked object. The compiler output matters when you are modifying the output in some manner. <strong>FAR </strong>FAR is a specific structure to some older Win32 API stuff but is there because the way the memory is accessed or a specific register is utilized for a specific operation. </p>
<p>The use of keywords are constructs of the language. The keywords may read as other lexical languages but the intruction of new types creates new keywords, not specific to the language itself but the program. </p>
<p>As Dennis Richie stated in ANSI C, &quot;this is the basic structure&quot;, it isn't all you can do with it and you can do anything you want with the language. It is also why many compilers implement their own keywords or specific features. </p>

<p>The point is this: A program is not just the keywords (no duh right?) but it introduces it's own keywords and data types. Keywords are useful for defining a rough scketch of the program but there are more than likely classes, structs, unions or abstractions that will define the totality of the project. The pre-defined keywords are very crude in their implementation and really tell you very little of it unless you know the compiler and the destination platform. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I️ think you made a good point that programming languages are for the most part based in familiar language and are often designed to have “human readable” syntax. Even concepts such as context (I️.e- this statement has different meaning depending on its relationship to the statements that preceded it) and implicit vs explicit declarations (I️.e, this). That said, keywords in programming languages always do a specific thing or at least try to. I’m curious to see if anyone has researched differences in meaning we apply to a word. For example, plenty of words in the English language have several often unrelated definitions, and we decide which to use on the fly when interpreting language. programming language keywords almost always have the exact same meaning, just the application can produce different results depending on its relationship to everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your question is interesting, and the answer is rather complicated. First, the parsing of word meaning depends on the modality of the language (i.e. spoken language is parsed very differently than read language though the two are intuitively similar). </p>
<p>Assessing the brain activation in terms of fMRI in this parsing of specific definition domain is rather challenging because fMRI's spatial resolution is relatively poor (typically ~2mm^3 , which is a whole lot of individual neurons). Luckily for you, there has been a ton of work in the EEG domain <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016705/" target="_blank">on specific language-based neural activation patterns.</a> </p>
<p>For instance, the P600 Event Related Potential (ERP) is a positive (P) deflection from baseline in the EEG traces about 600ms (that's the 600) after the event occurs. These are common when your brain detects an error in the syntax of a sentence (e.g. 'Went to the store did the boy.')</p>
<p>More relevant is the N400, which is most common when there is a semantic mismatch, especially when you are strongly expecting a certain word and another is there instead (e.g. The boy went to the fish.)</p>
<p>There has also been some work done in localizing these particular components and those brain areas are likely strongly involved in parsing these context-based word differences. </p>
<p>Does this help answer your question?</p></div>		</li>
