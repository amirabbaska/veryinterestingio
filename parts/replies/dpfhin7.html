			<div class="markdown"><p>Planck CMB results <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05644" target="_blank">disfavor high mass</a> primordial black holes. Other estimates making different assumptions <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04206" target="_blank">push that mass down further</a>. I personally prefer first generation stars as the seeds for SMBH, but it's an open question and reasonable, informed people can disagree. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The abstract and the conclusion say the same thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rule out PBHs more massive than âˆ¼10^2 M_sun as the <strong>dominant form of dark matter</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't that another topic from high mass PBHs?</p></div>		</li>
