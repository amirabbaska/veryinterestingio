			<div class="markdown"><p>Through a telescope Jupiter has color, albeit not quite as brilliant as the images we see. Those colors are real! Nebulae have some color as well, but they are faint enough that we struggle to make the color out and usually see only a smudge.</p>
<p>The big telescopes tend to take multiple exposures with film or sensors sensitive to very narrow frequencies, the images are later combined and the rough color image is produced. Color film for cameras works in a similar way, but the three or so layers are stacked in the factory for each roll of film, so all three are exposed simultaneously and can be developed at a single go in the darkroom; but if you wanted to you <em>could</em> take a variety of pictures with various types of film each &quot;peaking&quot; at a different frequency, combine them, and produce an image we would perceive as having &quot;color&quot;, though you might have to do post-processing to make the color depth match what we see with our eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there are stars we can't see. If we got closer, we'd be able to see them. Why shouldn't the same thing apply to nebulae?</p>
<p>Are there nebulae close enough that getting closer doesn't make a difference?</p>
<p>edit: oh. duh. There are nebulae around stars that we can see, like in orion...<br />
edit2: but then, since they're so far away we'd see them in essentially the same place as the star, so wouldn't they be subject to a glare effect or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are limits when you relate the system to your eye.  Basically,  once the object is so far it's just lighting up a single photoreceptor,  if you move 2x away,  now that photoreceptor is only getting 1/4 the energy.  So it actual does get dimmer.   For the human eye,  this might also hinge on how well we can focus light from a point source</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So wouldn't the total sky be 1/16th as bright? The luminous object has reduced by a factor of 4 <strong>AND</strong> it's brightness is 1/4 as powerful.</p>
<p>Edit: Nevermind, got it</p></div>		</li>
