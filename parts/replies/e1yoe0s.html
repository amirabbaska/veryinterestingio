<p>Zimbabwe is using US money the same way anyone personally can.  You and I don't have any control of it, we just use it.  You can't personally print it, but you can use it legally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>unlikely that anyone would want the trillions of Zimbabwe currency it would take to get a decent amount of dollars for Zimbabwe.  More likely, people in Zimbabwe sell their goods for dollars by exporting or something along those lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works the same as other countries that use the US dollar as official currency. Other examples are Panama and Ecuador. </p>
<p>The dollars make their way into the country when businesses (mostly) and tourists (less so) bring them and buy things.</p>
<p>The dollars stay there afterward, and stay into circulation. I'm American so I've never had to convert my dollars in those countries, but I've seen currency exchange shops so I assume they could swap out other currencies if needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5:</p>
<p>Most major countries use US dollars for deals on things like oil.  </p>
<p>You can just trade your countries money for US dollars, so it's easier to buy things.  </p>
<p>The US currency has been historically balanced, people believe in the value of it.</p>
<p>Edit:  You can buy US dollars with any currency, in the same way you can buy anything.  Buying US dollars is like buying anything, you have to think of money as a representation of products/services.  The point of money is that the 10 dollar bill could be a hat, or some meat, or a pillow, but you can also buy that 10 dollar bill just like you could buy the hat, but in another countries currency it may be 10,000.</p>
<p>The number doesn't matter.  The entire world has to trust the value of your currency, so the hat is worth 10 today, and 10 tomorrow.  In the US the hat will be worth 11 pretty soon, but it's still trusted, because we are better than everyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. </p>
<p>In Liberia you use USD bills as &quot;big money&quot; and Liberian Dollars as &quot;small money&quot;. </p>
<p>Anything worth more than $5 US was paid using USD. Taxi rides, vet bills, taxes, fees, fast food in Monrovia, or phone cards for instance. </p>
<p>You would use LD for things at the food market, street food, or tipping kids for helping you find the egg lady. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The US dollar is not the official currency of either Vietnam or Cambodia. They have their own currencies.</p>
<p>Ecuador however is another example of a country that uses the US dollar as its official currency.</p></div>		</li>
