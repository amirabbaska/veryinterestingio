<p>I don't remember where I read about it first, but it's hard to forget that analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the analogy comes from Pandemonium: A Paradigm for Learning in <em>proceedings of the symposium on mechanization of Thought Processes</em>; I first read about it in the book <em>AI: The Tumultuous History of the Search For Artificial Intelligence</em> by Daniel Crevier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was original when I wrote it this morning.</p>
<p>But as /u/wuop pointed out, my analogy has a lot of similarities to Oliver Selfridge's <a href="https://wolfe4e.sinauer.com/wa04.02.html" target="_blank">Pandemonium</a> model of cognition, proposed in 1957.</p>
<p>I do recall reading about it once, and it likely influenced my analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One small clarification to this example. RNN's are not typically used for image classifications. RNN's are required when the previous input is important for the next output for example predicting stocks or determining if a sentence makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
