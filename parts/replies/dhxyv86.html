<p>there is a higher density of particles and thus would actually transmit sound way more efficiently</p>

<p>In the medical world, this is also why if you have a blocked ear canal (whether from ear wax or say in-canal ear buds), you often hear your own voice much louder in the affected ear: the sound conduction through bone is increased.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the sound conduction through bone remains the same, your brain just adapts and recalibrates. </p>
<p>Usually, we hear the outside mostly using the aerial route, and our own voice through the bone route. When one ear has the aerial route blocked (e.g. with a wax plug), your brain gets used to it and accounts for that difference (as if it was amplifying everything coming from that ear).
Your own voice is heard mostly using the bone conduction, which is unaffected, but then the brain applies the &quot;amplification&quot; to the blocked ear and it seems louder.</p>
<p>So it essentially gets used to hearing less through the affected ear, and when you hear your own voice, it sounds the same through both ears, so it seems that it's coming louder through the affected one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I didn't word that well. It isn't increased from baseline conduction (except for some disorders like otosclerosis iirc), it's just that with air conduction being blocked there is more information being received via bone conduction as opposed to air conduction. As a result this is what you are going to hear more of.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why when in a pool underwater you hear everything (produced underwater) amplified.</p>

<p>Can someone please elaborate on this?  If my son and I go underwater and scream as loud as we can it is certainly not louder than if we were next to each other above water.  Not even close.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The screams that you are emitting are being pushed into the air that rapidly rises to the surface. If you were capable of producing sound directly into the water, things would be different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YES! That is a great example. I have done similar things in my pool out of curiosity. I was in awe when I realized that it sounds sooo much more crisp underwater - but the weird thing is, you can't gather where the sound is coming from very well at all underwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be wrong here but I think <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6cwkwj/if_you_throw_a_waterproof_speaker_under_water_and/dhxwrw5/" target="_blank">this post</a> by /u/tunnelFET above might answer that. Sound travels farther and stays clearer but loses some of it's higher frequencies due to the density of water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely because of the higher density of water, the speakers would create less sound because it would require more power to create the same volume, effectively cancelling this out?</p></div>		</li>
