			<div class="markdown"><p>Ants can survive all kinds of shit. When I was a kid, I got an ant farm for my birthday which happens to be in late November. This is relevant because ant farms don't include ants in the box, for obvious reasons -- you have to send a postcard in with your address and the company mails you the ants. It warns you to do this only during warm weather. Being a stupid kid, one randomly warm day a week after my birthday I sent the postcard in. I got the ants mailed back a week later but by then we were in the middle of a sub-zero cold snap and the ants were all frozen little balls in the vial they came in.</p>
<p>I put the vial on my dresser and after they had warmed up to room temperature, 90% of them came back to life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's common practice to freeze or refrigerate ants before putting them inside the ant farm to make insertion much easier. If you order them in hot weather, you're going to end up with a lot of dead ants. They usually ship them with ice packs but those only last so long.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If ants have concepts of time that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That explains something I discovered as a kid.</p>
<p>If you submerge an ant in water, it will flail around and be dead within a few seconds.</p>
<p>If the ant is attached to something and you submerge it, it will not die for at least a few minutes (child me was bored easily).</p>
<p>If you dislodge it, it will flail around and die within a few seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't there a book written saying that ants could survive a nuclear explosion?</p>
<p>Edit : found the book! I was referring to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Ants_%28novel%29" target="_blank">Empire of the Ants</a>, but turns out it's probably all fictionnal haha</p></div>		</li>
