			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always taught that absolute zero was a theoretical state at which all movement (read: heat) ceases. If that's not true, what is absolute zero?</p>
<p>Edit: you said it was ground-state and that it can't go any lower. So where does that clock in, is what I mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heavy water isn't toxic. </p>
<p>We use it to determine the total body water for drug administration specifically because it behaves very much like regular water- if administered intravenously and allowed to circulate, a concentration can be measured and used to calculate total body water. Very useful in administering anesthetic at the right doses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I suppose I am being a bit nitpicky. It's not chemically identical to water- but it is very close. In high doses it is dangerous. </p>
<p>I just don't want anybody getting the wrong impression- it has important medical uses and while you wouldn't want it as a staple in your diet, it's not generally what you'd think of as a &quot;toxin&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
