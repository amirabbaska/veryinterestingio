			<div class="markdown"><p>Same story pretty much. Cell towers aren't ever changed or updated because that would cost money and verizon owns most of them so they don't need to compete. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>False, towers are constantly changed and upgraded. I work for a general contractor company that does upgrades for Verizon in the northern west coast of USA and we are constantly upgrading towers with new antennas and radios that have higher capacities. Always upgrading from copper coax lines to fiber and changing out older equipment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since you seem to be an expert on Verizon's capital spending plan, could you please shed some light on where exactly the $17.8 billion in CapEx and $9.9 billion for acquisitions of wireless licenses in 2015 went? Would you say that if this $27.7 billion spent on Verizon network upgrades were instead withdrawn in $1 George Washington notes, it would be enough to wipe up all the nonsensical bullshit coming out of your mouth?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah my city has a bid with the local cable provider so any new company can't come in &amp; wire all over the place. Don't know the exact details but We pretty much have 2 options for a provider. Luckily they're not horrible but I'll always dreamed on fios or those other dreamt internet providers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where do you live? I live in Northern Virginia and I don't ever see myself moving out of the area for the reason that is the fierce competition between ISPs. Here, we have all the choices. If your current ISP starts screwing up your bill, call them up and threaten to switch. If they don't backtrack, you actually switch for a year. When you come back, ask for some incentive to switch back to them. If you're nice to the person, and explain your situation, more likely than not, they will give you a great deal.</p>
<p>Example: When we first moved into our house in 2008, we got Comcast. For a year or 2, it was ok. Then, for unrelated reasons, my dad canceled it. For about a year and a half, we used our neighbor's unsecured wifi. After that, we got Comcast again. After a year, they sent us a letter telling us they automatically &quot;upgraded&quot; our internet to their blast service. Turns out, their blast shit was about 1-5Mbps and double the price. I dad called them up to complain but they didn't budge. This was in 2013. We canceled and got Verizon Fios. For a year, we paid about $70/month for 50/50 Internet as it became available a short while after we got the service. After a year, they increased the price to $100/month. Keep in mind that we do not pay for phone or cable. Just Internet. So we canceled and endured Comcast for the entirety of 2015. After the hell that 25/5 was, we got an offer from Verizon in December 2015 to switch over to them. They offered 50/50 at $30/month for the first year(2016) and $40/month for the second year(2017) and then we would see from there. They said the reason behind the huge decrease in price was that since we had Fios in the past, we already had all the equipment for the fiber reciever at our home and thus, we were &quot;Fios Ready&quot;. It worked out pretty well for my dad and we still have it today only just transitioning into the $40/month.</p>
