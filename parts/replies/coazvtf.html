			<div class="markdown"><p>From above link, a description of one of the vaccines, for those interested in an example without wanting to read through all of them/click to another site: </p>
<p>Any vaccine can cause side effects. For the most part these are minor (for example, a sore arm or low-grade fever) and go away within a few days. Listed below are vaccines licensed in the United States and side effects that have been associated with each of them. This information is copied directly from CDC's Vaccine Information Statements, which in turn are derived from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for each vaccine.</p>
<p>Remember, vaccines are continually monitored for safety, and like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects. However, a decision not to immunize a child also involves risk and could put the child and others who come into contact with him or her at risk of contracting a potentially deadly disease.</p>
<p><strong>Adenovirus vaccine side-effects</strong></p>
<p>What are the risks from Adenovirus vaccine?</p>
<p>A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious reaction. But the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.</p>
<p><strong>Mild Problems</strong></p>
<p>Several mild problems have been reported within 2 weeks of getting the vaccine:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>headaches, upper respiratory tract infection (about 1 person in 3)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stuffy nose, sore throat, joint pain (about 1 person in 6)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>abdominal pain, cough, nausea (about 1 person in 7)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>diarrhea (about 1 person in 10)</p>
</li>
<li>fever (about 1 person in 100)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Severe Problems</strong></p>
<p>More serious problems have been reported by about 1 person in 100, within 6 months of vaccination. These problems included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>blood in the urine or stool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pneumonia</p>
</li>
<li>inflammation of the stomach or intestines</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It is not clear whether these mild or serious problems were caused by the vaccine or occurred after vaccination by chance.</strong></p>
<p>As with all vaccines, adenovirus vaccine will continue to be monitored for unexpected or severe problems. </p>
<p><em>This information was taken directly from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/adenovirus.html" target="_blank">Adenovirus VIS</a></em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>NOTE: this is one of the very many vaccines listed on the site, but a lot of at least the mild side-effects are similar.</strong> In addition, soreness where the shot was given, loss of apetite and tiredenss are also common. Fainting or allergic reactions are some of the more common more severe problems, and are typically pretty rare (but this is why, after a vaccination, you generally have to wait 10-30 minutes to leave the dr's office. If you don't after a flu vaccine at a pharmacy, it's probably because you indicated you haven't had adverse reactions to other vaccines).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned a 1% possibility of serious side effects within 6 months of vaccination, and an extremely small possibility of serious harm or death. Would it be possible to put a number on &quot;extremely small?&quot; I'm investigating my suspicion that the most dangerous part of vaccination is actually the car trip to the doctor's office, and am hoping to be able to present actual numbers to make it abundantly clear that vaccines are safer than many things we don't think twice about. Won't convince the &quot;true believers&quot; among the anti-vaxxers, but I've been hoping to find a way to get through to people who are on the fence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to everyone else replying, the government has set up the <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/index" target="_blank">Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System</a>, or VAERS, to compile any adverse effect from vaccinations.  This data is made public as it is compiled.  It includes a large amount of information on the patient.  Anyone who receives a vaccine can fill out a VAERS form and submit it if they see any side effects.  This ranges from minor swelling to more acute events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a note, the VAERS system is unrestricted in terms of input - anyone can submit reports.  Some of the reports cannot later be verified.  Also, according to a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccines/HPV/jama.html" target="_blank">CDC-FDA report</a> published in the Journal of the AMA:</p>
<pre><code>"The 32 death reports [from the HPV vaccine] were reviewed and there was no common
pattern to the deaths that would suggest they were caused by the vaccine. In cases
where there was an autopsy, death certificate, or medical records, the cause of death
could be explained by factors other than the vaccine. Some causes of death determined
to date include diabetes, viral illness, illicit drug use, and heart failure."
(from summary)</code></pre>
<p>...meaning that if you receive a vaccine, and get hit by a bus on the following day, that may be reportable to VAERS.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Which is great, because then they can do followup reviews, like they did, to determine if buses are attracted to vaccinated people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very good that VAERS exist, because the people doing research on vaccines can use it to make sure the vaccines aren't dangerous.
But it is very important to mention that VAERS shouldn't be used by laypersons, because it's impossible (for a layperson) to tell if the complaints are confirmed or not. Also, it's not statistically adjusted, so it's hard to interpret.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One possible risk is that we are increasing the numbers of Th1 cells (which are usually in balance with TH2). There are currently no vaccines that exploit cell mediated immunity. Thus we are left increasing Th1 and reducing Regulatory T c ells (FoxP3/CD4/CD25). This is by no means conclusive and an interesting area of research, but it is possible this is leaving us more susceptible to autoimmune diseases. </p>
<p>That is not to say that the benefits aren't worth this risk-- but it is something to consider as we continue to develop new vaccines. </p></div>		</li>
