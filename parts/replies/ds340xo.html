<p>What's stopping them setting up shop on the new coastline?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you're absolutely correct.  I'm in no way saying climate change isn't a problem that we shouldn't attempt to manage.  Actually, I think the coastal impacts are probably the least of our worries.  The famines will be things of nightmares.</p>
<p>Though humans are humans, and as a group we are panicky and stupid and don't solve problems well.  Let's hope the determined few bail our asses out of this mess.</p>
<p>I am just curious about the cold numbers of the thing though.  With no ice caps do we become a 77% water world?  More?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about the exact percentage, but we'd lose less than 10% of our land mass (possibly more if you count Tundra). </p>
<p>A lot of our economy is consolidated in coastal areas. Check out this <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-earth-would-look-like-if-ice-melted-world-map-animation-2017-4" target="_blank">visualization</a> to get an idea of how it would happen. Spoiler alert: Florida becomes part of the Atlantic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meanwhile, many areas which are now landlocked will become coastline, presenting new economic opportunities. </p>
<p>We'd be better off educating people as to the non-static nature of our planet, instead of creating panic over losses most people will never experience.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're right about educating people as to the non-static nature of the planet.  It's just not supposed to be QUITE this dynamic.</p></div>		</li>
