			<div class="markdown"><p>Chlorine in piticular (the active component of most bleach) does this because it really wants one more electron, and it really does not care how it gets it.  </p>
<p>So like a psychopath, it will rip it from the first atom it finds.  It does this by breaking the bond of whatever molecule that atom was a part of then bonding to it.  The old molecule that the chlorine stole the atom from is now unstable or completely different.  </p>
<p>Sometimes this does good things, because we wanted to rip apart that grease stain that was staining our shirt or obliterate the cholera in the water.  Sometimes it's horrifying, because the result is dangerously unstable or lethal to life.  But chlorine don't care, chlorine got it's electron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more specifically, it works by breaking up a long line of double bonds. Things that are pigmented typically have long chains of double bonds in their structures, and bleach is really breaking the double bond combos into two shorter chains of double bonds that aren’t nearly long enough to have the pigmenting effect. </p></div>		</li>
