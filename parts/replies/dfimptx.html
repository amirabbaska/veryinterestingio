			<div class="markdown"><p>I like it from the fourth dimensional perspective:</p>
<p>&quot;The guide invited the crowd to imagine that they were looking across a desert at a mountain range on a day that was twinkling bright and clear. They could look at a peak or a bird or a cloud, at a stone right in front of them, or even down into a canyon behind them. But among them was this poor Earthling, and his head was encased in a steel sphere which he could never take off. There was only one eyehole through which he could look, and welded to that eyehole were six feet of pipe.</p>
<p>This was only the beginning of Billy's miseries in the metaphor. He was also strapped to a steel lattice which was bolted to a flatcar on rails, And there was no way he could turn his head or touch the pipe. The far end of the pipe rested on a bi-pod which was also bolted to the flatcar. All Billy could see was the dot at the end of the pipe. He didn't know he was on a flatcar, didn't even know there was anything peculiar about his situation.</p>
<p>The flatcar sometimes crept, sometimes went extremely fast, often stopped-went uphill, downhill, around curves, along straightaways. Whatever poor Billy saw through the pipe, he had no choice but to say to himself, 'That's life.'&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One visualization that's interesting is to imagine the object through time as a solid object connected from it's start point in time and space to it's end point in time and space.  A persons line would, at one end, be a nearly microscopic egg that moves in the time direction with another entity wrapped around it as it grows, and eventually separates in space from the host entity.  It would connect every place the entity was through time, you could visualize a fleshy tentacle that starts inside another, larger fleshy tentacle, then separates, continues to get thicker as it connects between all the spaces and times the entity existed in, and at the other end it's also getting thinner, but not as much, but also getting wrinkly and grayish.</p>
<p>Inside the tentacle is a brain connected almost all the way back to the beginning, but it is connected in the time axis one-way, it can only reference information in it that's closer to the smooth end.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Phone thought I said &quot;access&quot;, not &quot;axis&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, the movie Interstellar did an excellent job of showing what 4th dimensional sentience would see, the tesseract that he ends up in at the end is a visual representation of the history of his daughter's room.</p>
<p>I like to think it helped me being able to, to the slightest extent, imagine what it is like to live from that point of view. Time being a physical thing would be pretty damn interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. If the 2nd dimension is used to describe parts of an object from left to right, the 3rd is used to describe an object from front to back, then the 4th describes an object before and after right now. It isn't quite simply time, but is related to it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why the statement that Earth moves in an elipsis through space (3D) and in a helix through Spacetime (4D) is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect. That video is just setting the motion of the earth relative to a different point of view. From the sun's point of view, earth moves in an elipsis, from the perspective of our local group of stars, it moves in a helix. From your point of view, the Earth isn't moving, because when you stand on it, the same piece of land stays under your feet. None of these points of view are wrong, as the motion of the Earth is relative to the observer, but I digress.</p>
<p>The video shows Earth's 3D movement OVER time, but not movement in spacetime, which is much more abstract.</p>
