			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember in the 90's buying a stereo from the early 70's at a second hand store. I remember thinking how well the red LED lights still glowed after 20 years and wondering why we don't use these lights for everything. This is a time before fluorescent lights were common and I lived in an apartment with bad wiring and was constantly buying and replacing light bulbs every single month. I've yet to see an LED light burn out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good electricity helps incandescent bulbs last longer, and there are higher-quality bulbs that have a longer lifespan.  Also, incandescent bulbs have their biggest chance of burning out when you first power them up, so avoiding turning them on in the first place can significantly increase their lifespan, if it's practical in a given situation (and it often is).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best reply here. Having worked in the research center that does the certification and testing of most LED and traditional lighting sources for the big companies in the US, I can clarify a bit. As for your comment about &quot;MTTF being the true mean/average&quot;:</p>
<p>For traditional lights, such as the old incandescent bulbs, Mean Time To Failure was simply determined by taking 100 samples, and testing them for weeks alongside each other, and seeing how long it took for 50 of them to burn out. If 50 of them were still lighting up after 1000 hours, that was your MTTF and expected life. As you could guess, this is not the best prediction of quality, as bulbs were often produced at such varying standards that 2 bulbs from the same package might vary in lifespan by 20%!</p>
<p>As mentioned in a comment below, since CFLs and LEDs do not technically fail like traditional bulbs (the power supplies inside the bulb bases are almost always are the limiting factors in lifespan), we have come to use a standard called L70, which means how long it takes for a bulb to decrease to 70% of its original light output. LEDs get dimmer with time as the silicon chips making the light slowly get polluted and decay.</p>
<p>Truly, if the power supply does not fail, your LED bulb will continue to put out light for multiple times longer than listed on the box! You can see this if you have any old fluorescent bulbs in your garage or in an office building. They are dimmer and might flicker slightly to the naked eye. These bulbs are likely 3-4x outliving their rated L70 life and have simply not been changed out. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly correct. The statistics for lighting products are calculated by a process called Lumen Maintenance Testing.<br />
LEDs will theoretically last for a very very very long time, but their light output will diminish over time to very small quantities. To set a &quot;lifespan&quot; they will usually measure. As another poster commented this lifespan number is usually 70% (usually). To test the light output they put the LEDs into an integrating sphere and test it's luminous flux output (lumens) at time intervals. I should also note that they will test it at different ambient temperatures. For instance it will be run at it's rated current (say 350mA) in a 55C ambient temperature and measured every 1000 hours of runtime. So in this scenario it is not being cycled on and off but ran at constant current.<br />
Once they have a minimum of 6000 hours of data then a natural log interpolation formula is utilized to find how many hours it will take to hit 70% (this formula can be found from the IES document <a href="https://www.ies.org/store/product/projecting-long-term-lumen-maintenance-of-led-light-sources-1253.cfm" target="_blank">TM-21</a> <a href="http://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/2012/11/the-elusive-life-of-leds-how-tm-21-contributes-to-the-solution-magazine.html" target="_blank">explanation</a>. Once they have that lifetime in hours number they divide by whatever they deem their runtime per day is <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Cree-65W-Equivalent-Soft-White-BR30-Dimmable-LED-Flood-Light-BBR30-06527FLF-12DE26-4U100/206097760" target="_blank">3 hours per day for this replacement Cree bulb</a> and voila. Hope that helps!
On a couple other notes</p>
<ul>
<li>item 1 generally any sort of capacitor involving transformer to low voltage DC power for the LEDs is involved the caps will burn out first (6-10 years depending)</li>
<li>item 2 The process for measuring the lifespan of LEDs and LED modules is LM79, LM80, and LM84.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly correct is what I aim for :)</p>
<p>Your answer is certainly useful for further (more detailed/technically correct) information: I was trying to keep things simple-ish to explain how they can come up with 24.8 years based on the information they have.</p>
<p>With the number of comments regarding it, I probably should have mentioned that the light output diminishing is used as a major factor in what is considered the &quot;lifetime&quot; (rather than just failure rate) however, I'd agree with that.</p></div>		</li>
