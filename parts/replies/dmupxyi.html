<p>CO2 is now at about 405ppm, while methane is at 1.8 ppm. Even taking the highest multiplier for methane only gets you to 144 equivalent ppm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You also have to be a bit careful when using these Methane -&gt; CO2 equivalent multipliers, since there's an implicit timescale built into each one - it would be a bit like if I were asked how fast my car goes, and I replied, &quot;100 miles.&quot;</p>
<p>Methane is a much powerful greenhouse gas than CO2, but also important to this is the concept of residence time: how long a given gas sticks around in the atmosphere before getting absorbed or transformed. Methane only sticks around the atmosphere for about 12 years on average before getting oxidized into CO2. For CO2, meanwhile, that average time is closer to 100 years before eventually getting absorbed by the ocean.</p>
<p>As a result, the &quot;amount of damage methane can do&quot; is a function over what timescale you measure: over 20 years, a mass of methane produces 86 times as much warming as the same mass of CO2, but past that, most of the methane has already turned into the much less potent CO2. Over 100 years, then, methane only produces 34 times as much warming as CO2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, that's why I qualified my description. Some people point out though, that because we're continually replenishing the methane, we should go with the higher number. The way things are, it seems like we should go on a year to year basis rather.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After 100 years a large part would be absorbed by the oceans and taken up by the vegetation, but about 20% to 30% of our CO2 emissions (depending on how much we emit in total) will remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years, and the resulting changes will effectively be locked in.</p>
<p>That is very different for methane. The human increase in concentrations would be all gone in a few decades if we stop emitting it. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I thought it led to acidification of the ocean and the organisms that &quot;absorb&quot; CO2 will prosper, but most other organisms will suffer. I've read that at one time, life on our planet went almost extinct except for CO2 absorbing corals in the ocean. So life will go on, but it may not be enjoyable or prosperous for humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the article /u/mutatron linked it states that Lamb and Beef are the least environmentally friendly and chicken, pork, and turkey all have less of an environmental impact. Vegetables are still much more efficient than meats though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But when it comes to floods, no one worries about a cow pasture. Hogs on the other hand, if their waste lagoons breach during a flood. I remember a major storm that flooded the Cape Fear river basin and took out several hog farms. Was a terrible disaster. I cant find the actual storm or events because apparently it has happened time and time again. Here is the most recent article about a different storm. <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article144520949.html" target="_blank">http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article144520949.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there's a great stuff you should know podcast about cricket farming that goes into the &quot;efficiency&quot; of different animals. From an environmental aspect the methane production of cows is bad, but the water use is crazy crazy high, as is the sprawling land use of pastures. I still eat beef though so... idk... I try to eat less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Methane, deforestation, inefficient use of the pastures themselves, just about the only thing they have going for them is how many goods besides meat they produce. I don't think chickens and turkeys can make much leather, though they do make good fertilizer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Also pork is better. The main difference is in their digestive system. &quot;Ruminant animals&quot; are the ones that chew their cud (including cows and sheep) and their digestive process produces significantly more methane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Cows are more efficient at extracting nutrients from grass because of their 4 stomach digestive system. Growing up on a farm with cattle and horses, cattle eat very little in comparison to a horse. During the winter a full grown horse will eat about 100lbs a day where an average cow is about 1/3 of that. Not that we eat horses but cattle are much more efficient at turning hay to meat. </p></div>		</li>
