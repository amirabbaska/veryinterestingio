			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny, I went to MEPS with a kid who had the conversation with his recruiter like... </p>
<p>&quot;so how many times did you smoke?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;like probably a couple hundred times, it was fairly often my senior year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;well remember, at MEPS you didn't do it ever.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course the kid broke down under questioning and told the guy, he still got a secret clearance though somehow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's because answering &quot;yes&quot; to any of those questions is not an automatic disqualification, and neither is lying about it when it comes to recruits. Recruiters lie, we report them for falsification to OPM (which OPM requires us to do), and the recruit winds up spending 2 to 4 hours with an Investigator trying to sift through the pile of shit the recruiter submitted and make it coherent. The recruit hates it, the Investigator doubly so, it takes time away from training and the recruits don't even have access to half the shit we need to do our job... Ugh. Bit of a sore spot, but my point is OPM/adjudicators know recruiters do this and so take it into consideration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you and I are in the same line of work.</p>
<p>And I can second the 'don't let your recruiter fuck up your SF-86.' I've seen investigations severely derailed and delayed due to recruiters removing employment history or not asking for it from recruits. </p>
<p>This doesn't just apply to recruiters, though. That can also happen in the private sector with government contractors. Sometimes you get security personnel or HR folks that finalize the paperwork, which can screw things up just as bad.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: don't let anyone else fuck up your forms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story. I have a relative who was being interviewed (not sure if it was a polygraph or not, also not sure what level clearance it was). He'd honestly never smoked weed. Not once in his life. The interviewer seemed to not believe him and kept telling him &quot;it's okay if you have, it's better to be honest, lying makes it worse, blah blah blah&quot;. Kept at it for a few minutes before the interviewer finally accepted that he'd never smoked weed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when I had to go for my clearance I literally forgot about a speeding ticket - while I pulled all my records and submitted them for my SF-86 that one had been an out of state encounter.  Came up and needed to chat with a investigator for a good two hours at which point my Cerebral Palsy came up and we got into the whole medical marijuana conversation which was really awkward because I've never touched the stuff but HIS brother (who had CP) used regularly and he wanted to be conversational about it...  it was a strange day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay that made me laugh. Investigators are human too, he either wanted to bond or he was legit trying to go all Sherlock on you, we'll never know.</p>
<p>I do sympathize with the out of state ticket, I unknowingly had one of those for like $95 sitting unpaid for years with a FTA finally smacked on. Thank God I never got pulled over in that state again before I caught it and paid it or then I would definitely have to discuss that delightful chestnut of a story on my next renewal. Ugh.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Every time someone finds out I've never smoked weed they don't believe me. Even my own damn parents don't believe me for some reason!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been through the process multiple times. Its always hilarious when 100% straight laced people go though and are heavily scrutinized. I just say, &quot;Yup. Smoked pot in high school on multiple occasions.&quot; They just go, &quot;Okay.&quot; and move on with life. </p></div>		</li>
