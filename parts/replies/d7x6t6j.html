			<div class="markdown"><p>this..   totally this...  if you wake up a few minutes before your alarm goes off,  don't go back to sleep..   those comfy '15 more minutes' will just screw up your circadian(spelling i know) cycle.</p>
<p>unless you don't have to get up.  when i'm on vacation,  i like to put on an alarm just so i can abuse that pure bliss of waking up, smiling, dropping a huge fart, turn around and go back to sleep..    </p>
<p>i'm a simple man.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually has such a good impact and makes getting out of bed much more enjoyable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it takes the average human 14 minutes to fall asleep</p>

<p>Is that true???! Man and I thought I was lucky because it usually only takes me about 30 mins. I guess all my friends and family are insomniacs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be that 14 minutes feels a lot longer, or that people naturally take into account the quasi asleep-awake state when estimating time taken to go to sleep. When they are in fact 'asleep'.</p></div>		</li>
