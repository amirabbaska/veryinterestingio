			<div class="markdown"><p>This, however. There is more to it. Fire allowed us to cook our food, which made it more caloric. As a result our brain was able to evolve in ways that require more calories and energy. Cooking food made us smart, basically. There's a whole ted talk on it.
And because we are smart, we have found ways to live in the cold that aren't just restricted to fire and fur. Igloos are made to keep warmth in, and they do their job very damn well, from what I've heard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something interesting: Some indigenous peoples don't technically start fires, but instead carry around pre-existing fires in the form of burning coals, which they use to ignite fires with. In this sense, they never &quot;start&quot; a fire, but just continue an older one. This is famously known in Aboriginal Tasmania, although evidence suggests they also used friction methods to generate new fires as well. I've read the coals method is suited for particularly wet climates which, fair enough, it can be hard to find dry tinder to rub.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surprisingly, it's because our #1 hunting advantage is our ability to <em>cool off while running.</em> In primitive civilizations, humans catch their speedy prey by running after it until it overheats and becomes exhausted. Other predators (say, cheetahs) can't manage that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'why' is mostly speculation, we probably lost our fur to better cool our bodies while hunting. Iirc, we determined when people lost our body hair around the same time pubic lice and head lice split genetically*. Its pretty obvious that having the ability to put on and take off as much layering as you need (and can create) is more advantageous than always having fur. </p>

<p>Wouldn't it be the other way around?  That the lice split genetically when the hair connecting those two regions went away?</p></div>		</li>
