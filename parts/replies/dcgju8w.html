<p>why do you WANT realistic graphics in every game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not every game, but there has yet to be a game that lives up to the tech demos that are clearly running in real time. I don't buy the argument that 'tech demos are not representative of a full game's resource costs' because, at this point, there are a lot of people out there with PCs powerful enough to sustain a game running at 4k ultra 60p and the power deficit just isn't as big of an issue anymore. On top of that, we have seen some quite ridiculous results even from consoles. Specifically, the demo of Silent Hills from Kojima just seemed so far beyond what we generally think of as possible on consoles which are not even close to as powerful as enthusiast PCs to begin with.</p>
<p>So, what gives? Not a single game has gone this route and I'd like to see at least one truly take advantage of modern machines. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is time consumption by the devs. It takes years to make a solid AAA title nowadays. A tech demo can be made in a shorter time, and with greater resources in the graphics (A reason I surmised is why we get downgraded demos from E3). You have to have all the assets, lighting, physics, etc. all lined up perfectly, with little to no dips on the dev's end. Then you gotta test and optimize, and then you got all the other deadlines and portions of the game outside of making it pretty. It's totally a doable thing, but the real question is, &quot;Is it worth the time, money, and energy?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>We have plenty of niches that are successful in their own right. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870984/" target="_blank">It's worth it to make a bizarre indy film about two psychologists who go out into the forest and work out their insecurities about sexuality by mutilating each other's genitals</a></p>
<p>If that film was worth it to make then I think ridiculously photorealistic games could probably also at least break even and fill a niche. Problem is that most indy game devs are freakishly obsessed with retro bullshit and they are just flooding the market with iterations on a style that is severely outdated and diluted by the sheer volume of games. Gaming needs to grow up... it IS growing up, and has been for a long time... but I wish it was faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean photo-realism. It isn't a pipe-dream anymore. It's possible to create graphics like that now on consumer hardware. It's just that most devs don't consider it to be profitable because most people don't have 'enthusiast'-grade hardware. But, enough people DO have amazing hardware now for it to be worth it to make such a game. Unfortunately, everyone would rather make some kind of 8-bit retro rehash or a blockbuster shooter limited by the fact that most people play on consoles or mid-grade PC's.</p>
<p>I just want someone to make a short, sweet 20-30 dollar game, 2-3 hours long, photorealistic graphics to fill the niche of people who have beast machines </p></div>		</li>

<p>Borderlands focuses on their cell shaded approach to their style. Telltale games also do this too. </p>

<p>Its not actually cell shaded, its hand drawn textures made to look cell shaded with thick lines on details such as clothing wrinkles, a line for a bicep bulge or a line serving as the tip of the nose on someones face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that what cell shading is as an art style, though? Everywhere I've looked, I've seen Borderlands as an example of it in games. Maybe I'm not current enough on the specifics of what fits in that style, I'm not an expert in art. I just draw shit with pencils, and make shit in Halo's Forge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its really confusing, it seems that Borderlands is indeed cell shaded because there's definitely a use of a thick outline around objects which can't be obtained from drawing on a flat surface. But its been said by people working on Borderlands in the past that it's not actually cell shading but only hand drawn textures, I chose to use their word as fact.</p>
<p>Doesn't seem to be 100% truthful though as it seems like they first hand draw all the textures including using thick black lines for details but then also either use a custom built shader in Unreal Engine or have a bigger &quot;shell&quot; model around the object which is pure black giving the effect of a thick outline around the object, this would be expensive on the GPU by having the same model twice with twice the faces/polygons but maybe they delete all faces except those visible outside of the main model.</p></div>		</li>
