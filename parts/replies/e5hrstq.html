			<div class="markdown"><p>Our solar system more or less orbits the sun in a roughly flat plane. This plane doesn't appear to correspond to anything. it's not in line with the flat plane our galaxy is on. It's not in line with our local cluster. There's galaxies above us, below us, to the west, to the east. Everything looks the same in every direction.</p>
<p>But for some reason there's an odd finding in this 'stuff' that permeates the entire universe, that appears to be in line with that plane, with no particular reason, that we can see, that there should be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot! Could you explain what you mean by the radiation aligning up with our position means? I’m assuming that the background radiation wouldn’t be uniform everywhere. But what does it mean that it aligns with our position?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the idea is that it would be roughly uniform everywhere, as a result of how the universe is expected to form. This is called being isotropic. An anisotropy is an irregularity in this uniformity. Some of these are expected, for instance we have to consider our movement relative to the background radiation, and interactions between the radiation and material in the universe.</p>
<p>But others are unexpected. Part of the Axis of Evil, for instance, is that if you sort of draw a cross section of &quot;the observable universe&quot; based on our plane of the ecliptic (slice the universe in half along the plane our planets orbit the sun on), there appears to be a distinction in temperature (of the CMB) between the two 'halves' of the universe. But there's no known reason why our plane of the ecliptic would have any relevance to the large scale structure of the universe (it doesn't even align to the plane of our galaxy), so this is quite odd, if true. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, even if some parts of the universe are warmer or colder, it's really, REALLY weird that the top half of it is warmer and the bottom half of it is colder if we turn our plane of orbit into an infinitely large (and thinn) pizza slicer?</p></div>		</li>
