			<div class="markdown"><p>I made an account with details that have no connection to me. It was only a few months before it started friend suggestions that I still don't understand how they got. I don't use their mobile apps, I use folio for Facebook. I used a different browser just for them, running my usual extensions that block a lot of shit. But the connections weren't even first connections. Just random things like someone I worked with years prior, so I have no contact with. Or a friend's gym, that is a 8 hour drive from me. </p></div>		</li>
