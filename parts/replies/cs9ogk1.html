			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding a little something.. there's actually something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_glasses" target="_blank">Pinhole Glasses</a> that make use of this effect.  Growing up, I had a friend who had a pair of these and it really was pretty amazing how sharp they made things.  I doubt they do anything to improve vision long term as they're often marketed, but they do sharpen your vision by quite a bit when wearing them.  You'd think they would be impossible to see through, but being so close to your eyes, the depth of field blurring eliminates a lot of the black plastic from view.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I first discovered this effect while looking through the holes in ritz crackers. It's funny how similar to crackers these look. </p>
<p>Also a note to OP, even though the aperture is smaller and making things clearer, it's at great expense to how bright the image looks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned about these from an episode of Home Improvement. Mark was shy about wearing glasses so Wilson taught him to make a pinhole with his fingers and that would clear it up. </p>
<p>I still use this to see the clock in the middle of the night without putting my glasses on. Thanks 90s TV. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if you or someone else can answer this. Not that I would want these for work, more of out of curiosity. I work as a 1st AC in the film industry, which means one of my jobs is to keep the cameras in focus and sometimes I need to look at the monitor to check focus. I have no known sight problems but sometimes looking at a bright monitor in a darker environment my eyes bug out and I am not able to tell if the image is %100 in focus. I wonder if these would help a normal visioned person in situations similar to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add something just in case you have keratoconus. This disorder can warp your cornea into a cone shape and for me having it I can say squinting  also improves my vision. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. I have Keratoconus as well and my corneas have almost a nipple shaped deformity.  Squinting my eyes pushes that &quot;peak&quot; in and makes my vision more clear.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed that when I spend too much time out in the sun, my vision becomes effectively clearer ( I have myopia, not that severe). And the effect lasts quite long. Is it because the amount I squinted has temporarily changed the shape of my eye balls?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spending time in a bright environment causes the opening in the eye to become smaller, like the camera &quot;f-stop&quot; illustration from /u/crnaruka's post. This will improve your focus in the same way. The decreases opening remains for a while after leaving the bright area. But eventually your eye's opening returns to a larger size and the benefit of greater &quot;depth of field&quot; is lost.</p></div>		</li>
