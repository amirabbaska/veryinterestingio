			<div class="markdown"><p>Jupiter keeps us alive, and is indirectly responsible for us having had the chance to evolve: without a giant swallowing up debris and erratics, the Hadean bombardment -- during which giant space rocks rained down on Earth like, well...rain -- would have lasted much longer and the solar system would be far more populated by giant mountains of doom, each moving far faster than a bullet. Impactors would be far more common. Impact events would have happened (and would still be happening) much more regularly. Think the end of the dinosaurs, but without enough breathing room on the other side for mammals to have evolved from little shrew-like nocturnal fuzzballs into people and elephants and whales and other cool things. Imagine that kind of impact happening every 10,000 years, or every 1000 years, or every century. Shit would be fucked the fuck up.</p>
<p>All hail mighty Jupiter, king of the gods! </p>
