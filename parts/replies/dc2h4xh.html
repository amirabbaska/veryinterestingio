Can't guarantee it won't be behind a paywall but it sounds like you're in college so hopefully your college can get you access. I'm sure you could find plenty by searching on pubmed too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should be able to cite the package insert. AMA style guides have instructions for doing so; I'm not sure about APA, but you could ask your instructor. Or, look at the bibliographies of the meta analyses you've found and see if <em>those</em> papers are helpful to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacist here. The package insert should reference trials and cite some very general methods and outcomes. You can usually search for the complete journal articles on PubMed.gov or on Google scholar and you will at least be able to read the abstracts and know who the researchers are. If that doesn't work you can call the manufacturer and they can send you the articles and also any supplemental information packets they have pertaining to the drug. Just make sure to call the brand manufacturer - I.e. For escitalopram studies, make sure you call the manufacturer of the brand Lexapro, which might take some research (was manufactured by Forest Pharmaceuticals, which was bought by Actavis, which is now Allergan...so look up Allergan's contact number). You might have to lie and say you're a doctor or pharmacist for them to give you the info. Hope this helps. Cheers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my big question about this study &quot;3 8 week periods&quot;. We know that tolerances build and effectiveness decreases over time for many medications. Big Pharma only has to pass enough tests to satisfy the FDA, not to prove long term cure or benefit.</p></div>		</li>
