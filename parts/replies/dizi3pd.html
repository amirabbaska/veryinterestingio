<p>It kind of had a calming effect on me thats really hard to describe. To me it was kind of like turning down the volume of the world around me which in turn helped calm me down from the sensory overload. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter doesn't bang her head but a common symptom of sensory overload for her is covering her ears with her hands or her arm this can also be accompanied by her closing one or both eyes. She does do self-harm though, but this is mainly her biting her hand and wrist out of frustration at what we believe is her perceived  inability to communicate her wants and needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on the spectrum and this makes a lot of sense man.
Iused to hit myself on the head with my hands a lot as a kid because that was the only way I knew how to relieve the pressure in there.
Too me it felt like my head was being pushed inward and as if something was trying to blow my head up at the same time.
Hitting myself on the head brought about kind of the same feeling (the pain part at least). By doing this the feeling wasn't in my entire head anymore, but only on the spot that I had been hitting.</p></div>		</li>
