<p><em>That is a particularly difficult application/region.</em> <em>Rugged relief and vegetation would likely require a hand-operated system (like HSTAMIDS, Minehound, or ALIS).</em> <em>Wet clay soils kill radar signals, so only dry sites/seasons would be allow work.</em></p>
<p><em>And thick vegetation would need to be cleared (which is very tricky in mined areas).</em></p></div>		</li>
