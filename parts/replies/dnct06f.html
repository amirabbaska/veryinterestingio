<p>I just realised that a contact lens has quite a curved form when it lays on your eye, very different to glasses, so I speculate that this also helps its focusing power.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's the other way around, actually.  The vast majority of the eye's focal power comes from the cornea.  The lens inside the eye is mostly just for adjusting/fine-tuning the focus.</p></div>		</li>
