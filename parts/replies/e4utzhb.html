			<div class="markdown"><p>I have tmobile and I have never had an issue like that which sounds very worrying.  I even get stuff like YouTube in China since they give a free VPN when you're traveling international.  Is it possible that there us a setting you tripped on the switch that restricts usage?  Like parental controls or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>But no chance of that. Can't even go to www.youtube.com. Just sits and spins (internet traffic blocked 100%). </p>
<p>And also the fact that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video stopped all at the same instant that I switched plans. </p>
<p>I remember thinking, 1) It sucks turning 55  2) Wow this 55 plan at T-Mobile is almost too good to be true..  (hah)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>T-Mobile love to tout cheap unlimited plans, etc. but they’re lying. My ex had “unlimited internet” with T-mobile. As soon as she used up 1 GB (maybe 2GB) of data, they capped her transfer speeds to 2G levels, making her wireless connection practically useless for doing anything on the modern internet. </p></div>		</li>
