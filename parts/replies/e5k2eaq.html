			<div class="markdown"><p>The satellite network I operate, my two remote sites are transmitting back with signal powers on the order of 1W at C-Band. It all depends on your uplink data rate, antenna size, satellite performance, and the receiving antenna. When I was doing SNG systems (Satellite News Gathering), we were using 40W on a 1m dish to uplink HD. (DVB-S2, H.264, 6Mbps).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never had much to do with X and C band equipment. I mostly worked on Ku and Ka when I was in the industry. I should have specified that 4W with a 1m antenna was about the lowest that my company frequently dealt with. On the other end I think we had some options for over 150W and 3m antennas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Satellite dish is needed only for high bandwidth needed for video transmission which is encoded with minimal error correction so that you can pack whole video signals into the bandwidth. You need the dish to receive such video transmission because you want to receive every bit of it clearly. GPS signal is just text. They can pack hell lots of error corrections and repetitions into the bandwidth. The GPS chip inside your phone use such error corrections to compensate for low signal power. This is all possible thanks to the ultra-low noise amplification transistors inside the GPS chip. </p></div>		</li>
