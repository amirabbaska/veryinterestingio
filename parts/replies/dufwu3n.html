<p>I think it's worth pointing out here that everything comes at a cost. While we generally consider being stronger, faster, and smarter as being &quot;better&quot;, these traits tend to mean you require more food. So if food is scarce, they can be disadvantages. And if food is very plentiful, they might just cost resources while not really helping you survive (if even a dumb animal can easily find enough to eat, being smart isn't really useful).</p>
<p>Evolution will simply favor whatever works best given the current circumstances. There are plenty of examples of species becoming smaller and weaker over time, as that was more beneficial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point. There are also limits to &quot;how fast&quot; an organism can adapt to its environment: genetic drift, for example, can slow down the rate of adaptation substantially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer, and I'd like to add something too for people reading this thread.  Ephemeroptera are the ONLY order of insects to have a subimago stage, which means they have the morphology of an adult (imago) but lack sexual reproductive organs.  All other insects progress from the nymphal or larval instar (growth stage) to the imago instar upon emerging from their aquatic home.  Mayflies are the only type of insect to have a subimago instar, which undergoes a final ecdysis (molting of the exoskeleton) to become an imago.  This means only Ephemeroptera produce exoskeleton molts, or exuviae, with developed wings, although I don't know if the wings are present on a subimago exuvia.</p>
<p>Lots of terminology in that.  Honestly I'm just exercising what I've learnes in insect bio this semester.</p></div>		</li>
