			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The concept in nuclear fusion is the same as chemical reactions; potential energy holds particles together. In either case, a force holds the particles together, and a reaction that lowers the potential energy releases that energy in another form. The only difference is that in nuclear reactions, it's the strong force holding neutrons and protons together, while in chemical reactions is the electromagnetic forcing binding electrons to nuclei.</p>
<p>That said, the energy in chemical reactions is <em>way</em> lower - essentially 0 - so it's often ignored. But in theory it's the same concept</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really sure, not a scientist here, I just did the calculations for the hell of it, but I think it should apply here too (perhaps there are other effects in play here, that's why I said the real process is probably more &quot;messy&quot;).</p>
<p>I think the mass-energy conversion comes from the chemical bonds being broken and that energy being released in the form of heat and light. But let me repeat myself I'm no scientist, so tkae this with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass is conserved in a chemical reaction, it does not convert to energy. The energy released comes from the the rearrangement of chemical bonds during the reaction. E=mc^2 does not apply to chemical reactions. </p></div>		</li>
