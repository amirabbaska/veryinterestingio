			<div class="markdown"><p>Ethylene is indeed a naturally produced gas. The point being that by harvesting before ripeness is achieved the plants do not have a chance to fully develop in terms of nutrient content or flavor. For example, if you were to buy a plum from the market today, and compare it to one picked from the tree at the height of ripeness there is an absolute world of difference. That being said there is no guarantee that the frozen products you buy were picked at their prime. Take a company like Dole for example. It's highly unlikely that they wait until ripeness is achieved. The logistics are just too expensive on that scale to make multiple harvests with added processes on the same crop. Hence why locally produced food is preferable in my opinion. I'm not even picking on the chemicals used to artificially ripen foods per se, only pointing out the practice and what it leaves to be desired.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have any scientific studies that substantiate?</p>
<p>The best I could find:</p>

<ol>
<li>Effects of ethylene on nutritive value</li>
</ol>
<p>8 . 1 . Vitamin C</p>
<p>The average content of ascorbic acid in ripe tomatoes for fruit harvested mature-green and red-rip were not signiﬁcantly different (Watada et al., 1976)</p>
<p>8 . 2 . Vitamin A</p>
<p>The b-carotene (provitamin A) content of ripe tomatoes varied directly with the ripeness of the fruit at harvest (Watada et al., 1976). However, the differences in vitamin A content were greater among the cultivars than among the ripeness stages at harvest. Vitamin A activity was not affected by C2H4, but was again slightly higher in ripe fruit that had been harvested ripe than those harvested mature-green. However, fruit harvested mature-green or breaker, the stages at which most fresh market tomatoes are harvested, did not differ in vitamin A activity among the cultivars tested.</p>
<ol>
<li>Summary</li>
</ol>
<p>A better understanding of C2H4 synthesis, perception and action should allow the development of postharvest strategies to enhance the beneﬁcial effects and mitigate the detrimental effects of C2H4 on the quality of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>But it should be kept in mind that many so-called detrimental effects of C2H4 are simply responses that are unwanted in certain situations, but which are beneﬁcial in others. Their alteration should not be global, but conﬁned to speciﬁc stages of development, responses to speciﬁc situations, or to speciﬁc tissues.</p>

<p>start eating better.  it sounds almost foolish, but, in reality, could actually save this place from total destruction.  we have the Dust Bowl to learn from and with the ability to ship produce so effectively (it isn't oil), if people just adjusted their diets at times, we would make it.</p>
<p>we are part of a CSA with <a href="https://www.bluestemfarm.net/" target="_blank">this group</a> and love it.  it has been a few years and i buy very few veggies at the store now.  we also buy beef and pork from the grower if possible.  this has reduced our cost, improved our quality, and helped our hearts...  </p>
<p>buy local, eat seasonally, health and wealth are related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree. I believe that a shift from mass production to production by the masses would do us a world of good.
Large scale agriculture is just not sustainable. Too many chemical inputs, too much destruction of the soil biology, too much money in too few pockets.
It's always good to see that more and more people are coming around.
Cheers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>we just have to remember <em>why</em> we moved from hunters-gatherers to agro producers...  it was to get fat.  </p>
<p>if we marry these two methods in the way that many ecosystems around the World have never left, we might just save this place.</p></div>		</li>
