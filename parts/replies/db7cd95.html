			<div class="markdown"><p>600 thousand is for total agricultural area.<br />
But the article is still wrong, lawns total area are one third of corn (not three times). 32,000,000 acres against 96,000,000 for corn.<br />
I'm using the 50,000 square miles (32 million acres) figure from the article for lawns, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_production_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">this</a> Wikipedia article for corn.</p>
<p>It's still interesting to note that if lawns all across the US were used for growing food, it would be a pretty significant boost to its agricultural output (almost 10% increase, assuming most of agricultural land is used for food.)</p></div>		</li>
