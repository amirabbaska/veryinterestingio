			<div class="markdown"><p>Phones will all have charging circuits built-in between the USB power connector and the battery itself.  These circuits monitor the state of the battery and control the charging current and voltages.</p>
<p>A good charging circuit will not allow overcharging or over-discharge of the  phone's battery.  So almost all phones WILL stop charging at 100%, and then maintain the charge as close to 100%.  Exactly how that charge is maintained varies a bit.  One way is to stop charging and let the phone drop to 95% (like in your example), then charge back up.   The problem is if the user disconnects at the wrong time, their phone will be at only 95% charge when they expected a full charge.  So the chargers are usually set to keep as close to 100% as possible with some other tricks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is usually what happens. However, your phone might still show 100%. Lithium cells have a range around their nominal charge where they work fine, going outside that range might damage the cell. This range isn't fixed and the line between working fine and damaging isn't very clear. The charge controller might change this range depending on numerous things. But yeah, lots of engineering work goes into maximizing usable energy storage and lifetime of cells. You can be sure they're using all the tricks possible to get there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are battery charging setups that are designed to do this; use external power to either charge a battery or directly power a load (or both?). They might actually do this? But it would be a size &amp; cost disadvantage. Likely not worth it for the added complexity.  </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes they do, li-ion certainly do die by getting overcharged.</p>
<p>But both the phone AND the battery has features to prevent charge state to go over 100%.</p>
<p>(I'm using slightly incorrect language here to keep it simple.)</p></div>		</li>
