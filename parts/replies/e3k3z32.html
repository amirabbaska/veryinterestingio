			<div class="markdown"><p>The process is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation" target="_blank">nucleation</a> if you wanna do more in-depth reading</p>
<p>Edit: so I misunderstood the question and it's not nucleation (for some reason I thought we were discussing bubbles coming from your finger when you dip it in soda).</p>
<p>However, I still encourage you to play with nucleation. You can do some cool shit with it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ice requires a nucleation site to begin to form. Ice itself is a nucleation site so other ice can form off of it. However if there are no nucleation sites available for a body of water you can cool it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercooling" target="_blank">below it's freezing point without it's state changing to a solid</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes this happens to bottles of water. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fot3m7kyLn4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fot3m7kyLn4</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nucleation is about giving bubbles or crystals a chance to form.  I'm talking about oil compromising surface tension.  They have nothing in common! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oil is hydrophobic. So, the same reason salad dressing separates. Oils dont mix with water. Oils on your finger (or touch your face first to supercharge the process. Especially with beer) are hydrophobic so they push the water that forms the bubbles away from your finger and break the bubble</p>
<p>Cheers! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think hydrophobicity is the reason why bubbles break on contact with finger oil... surface tension is originated from the inward pressure created by molecules at surface lacking neighboring molecules. This creates imbalance of cohesive force between the bulk volume and the surface.</p>
<p>Surface tension dictates what contact angle a liquid will form upon contacting another surface. I think /u/-skaffenamtiskaw- meant finger oil adjusts the surface tension of the bubble forming liquid this leads to contact angles that cannot form bubbles.</p>
<p>I do have to say that it is wrong to say this &quot;destroys&quot; surface tension. You can either lower or raise surface tension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still do it if I pour a beer terribly. You’re already drinking beer; your system can handle it’s own oils. I eat food that I dropped on the ground, too. Never hurt nobody. If anyone gives you shit you can point out plenty of things they do everyday that are more disgusting.</p>
<p>Trust in that immune system. And as George Carlin has said, “it needs practice.”</p></div>		</li>
