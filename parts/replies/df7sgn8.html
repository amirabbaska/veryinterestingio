			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Collision&quot; and &quot;interaction via Coulomb forces&quot; mean the same thing in this situation. Since these particles are quantum-mechanical wavefunctions and not billiard balls, there is no sense in distinguishing between a &quot;collision&quot; (meaning physical contact) and electromagnetic scattering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I didn't know that. In my line of work (nuclear power plants) we do focus on the difference. An alpha interacting with water is not the same as a neutron interacting with water.</p></div>		</li>
