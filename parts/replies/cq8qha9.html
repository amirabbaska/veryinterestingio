			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Caffeine mimics Adenosine and bonds to the same receptors blocking any Adenosine from bonding to that receptor. When you take Caffeine on a regular  basis, your body produces more of these receptors therefore you must take more Caffeine to make up for the increase of Adenosine receptors. </p>
<p>edit: holy shit guys my top rater comment by far! :) went to be and woke up with karma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So for people that generally feel little to no affect from caffeine, do they simply have more receptors than the caffiene can block?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you stop drinking caffeine for long enough, do those receptors still remain or do they eventually decrease in number? (i.e., if I start drinking less coffee will my body revert to needing less caffeine to get the same effect?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  Which is probably why we give the 6mg and then a 12mg dose.   I feel like this is something I learned but somehow misplaced in my brain </p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Theophylline has the same effect. In these cases a dose closer to 12mg may be required. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the whole reason why caffeine works to wake you up.</p>
<p>Interestingly, adenosine-A2A receptors block the effects of dopamine. Caffeine antagonizes those receptors, making dopamine mor effective. That's why amphetamines (like adderall) are stronger when you drink coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are we doing when we &quot;fight&quot;? Clearly we aren't prying the adenosine from its receptors. What does our will to stay awake translate into?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely, the &quot;fighting&quot; is a simple act of concentration. Forcing yourself to think and move stimulates the body to start clearing the adenosine from the system and preparing for daytime activity. The more demands you place on the brain, the harder it tries to compensate for the effects of the adenosine.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has there been a study on whether or not a changing &quot;wake up time&quot; has an effect on sleep inertia? IE, does getting up at the same time every day produce less inertia than someone who wakes up at different times in the day?</p></div>		</li>
