			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation for the flash and how the gun works but I don't think it explains the cool torus of fire. I've never seen a muzzle flash that looks like that from another gun. I'd hazard a guess that it's the same effect as blowing a smoke ring, but I have no idea and I don't know why it would be unique to the desert eagle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many muzzle devices are designed specifically for reducing or eliminating the effect. The AR-15/M-16 was mentioned so I'll mention the &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=birdcage+muzzle+brake&amp;newwindow=1&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAmoVChMI49W7gcOQyQIVzEgmCh0HHwnW&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=731" target="_blank">bird cage</a>&quot; style brake common on those. The slots are so that the release of gases is not so sudden. The gases are released gradually and redirected in such a way as to deny the vortex... or gradually enough that the fire ball isn't formed.  </p>
<p>Even with flash suppressors like the bird cage a fire ball may still form, with different brakes producing different effects. Bird cage style brakes often produce a <a href="https://youtu.be/uAE6Il6OTcs" target="_blank">rooster</a> tail like flash.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;es_sm=93&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=suppressor&amp;oq=suppressor&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.235781.237486.0.237701.10.8.0.2.2.0.115.809.4j4.8.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.10.813.LcxW9mERkss" target="_blank">Suppressors</a> work in such a way as that rapidly expanding gas is trapped inside the tube, and then slowed by the baffles inside of it. Sometimes suppressors are filled with fluid to further reduce the impact of the explosion.  </p>
<p>I say this not as a scientist but someone who has shot a lot of guns and has had only half a pot of coffee so far. So, the explanations could probably be a lot better.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ring of fire is not unique to the Desert Eagle. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QK6oyxv.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is the same thing happening with a Ruger Alaskan from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/3sjp1r/ring_of_fire_from_a_ruger_alaskan_44/" target="_blank">this</a> reddit thread.</p>
<p>If I had to guess why this seems uncommon or unique, I would guess that the ring is not visible in real life and real time. I suspect that the initial flash that can be seen in the OP gif overexposes the human eye long enough for the ring to form and disperse before the eye can adjust to seeing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what causes the torus. It seems to just be a certain volume of gas at a certain pressure. The 5&quot; 38 caliber naval gun, as used on US Navy ships in the WWII era, often showed a ring shaped flash. In small arms, large caliber magnum pistol cartridges seem to be the sweet spot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The ar15 is a civilian version of the m16</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As to the actual ring of fire, I'd bet that the shooter is firing very hot hand loads. Off the shelf rounds generally won't produce a ring of fire. </p></div>		</li>
