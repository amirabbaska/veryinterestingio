			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation for the flash and how the gun works but I don't think it explains the cool torus of fire. I've never seen a muzzle flash that looks like that from another gun. I'd hazard a guess that it's the same effect as blowing a smoke ring, but I have no idea and I don't know why it would be unique to the desert eagle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ring of fire is not unique to the Desert Eagle. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QK6oyxv.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is the same thing happening with a Ruger Alaskan from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/3sjp1r/ring_of_fire_from_a_ruger_alaskan_44/" target="_blank">this</a> reddit thread.</p>
<p>If I had to guess why this seems uncommon or unique, I would guess that the ring is not visible in real life and real time. I suspect that the initial flash that can be seen in the OP gif overexposes the human eye long enough for the ring to form and disperse before the eye can adjust to seeing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what causes the torus. It seems to just be a certain volume of gas at a certain pressure. The 5&quot; 38 caliber naval gun, as used on US Navy ships in the WWII era, often showed a ring shaped flash. In small arms, large caliber magnum pistol cartridges seem to be the sweet spot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So... When people say </p>

<p>The ar15 is a civilian version of the m16</p>

<p>Really what they mean to say is </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As to the actual ring of fire, I'd bet that the shooter is firing very hot hand loads. Off the shelf rounds generally won't produce a ring of fire. </p></div>		</li>
