			<div class="markdown"><p>But consider that the things belong to a set. Like if you were putting colored marbles into a bowl, the marbles would be the things, and the bowl is the set. How many different ways can you have no marbles in a bowl? Only one! If you think of the elements being arranged as belonging to a set it makes more sense as to why 0! = 1. Specifically it's called the empty set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just 0!=1.</p>
<p>Factorial is defined recursively across all natural numbers (for the sake of making Taylor expansion possible) like this:</p>
<p>n!=n•(n-1)! for n&gt;0 and n!=1 for n=0, and were it not for this last exception, the factorial of any number would just be 0 because you would have to multiply it with 0 in the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The long way: try looking at it backwards. </p>
<p>3! = 1 * 2 * 3. If we divide both sides by 3, we get (3!)/3 = (1 * 2 *3)/3 = (1 * 2), which is 2! by the definition of factorial.</p>
<p>2! = 1 * 2. If we divide both side by 2, we get (2!)/2 = (1 * 2)/2 = 1 which is 1! by the definition of factorial.</p>
<p>This suggests (does not prove) that a more generalized (n!)/n = (n-1)!.</p>
<p>So, what happens when n = 1? Then we have (1!)/1 = (1-1)!, which we can rewrite as 1/1 = 0! or 1 = 0!.</p>
<p>This also shows why we can't have a factorial of a negative number. If we could, (-1)! would be equal to (0!)/0 = 1/0, and this number is undefined.</p>
<p>The short way: The formal definition of factorial is that 0! = 1, and all other factorials are based off this fact (1! = 0! * 1, 2! = 1! * 2, etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, your professor wasn't wrong. That's how it is. At the end of the day, it's a convention, one that makes the most sense but a convention nonetheless. The above answer is not an explanation but rather another reason why we should define it as 1 and not say 0 or something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about a basic definition of division. 6 divided by 2 is 3, meaning I have taken 6 individual units that used to be in one group and separated them into two groups each containing three units. Dividing six kittens into two groups would result in two sets of three kittens. If I tried to divide my group of six kittens into zero groups, it would be impossible. Where would the kittens go? This is how I used to explain it to my middle school students. They seemed to enjoy it. </p></div>		</li>
