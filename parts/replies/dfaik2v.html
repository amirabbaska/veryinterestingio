			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhhhh! What the hell, I didn't even know tongues could look like that. I guess I haven't asked to see too many people's tongues, no wonder I was confused at the original question. Mine just has one line down the middle like a cartoon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for clearing that up for me! My mom had fissures in her tongue and claimed she had a &quot;geographic tongue.&quot; She said only women could have it. I have fissures in my tongue and am not a woman. Not sure if only women can have a geographic tongue. My mom was full of bullshit. </p></div>		</li>
