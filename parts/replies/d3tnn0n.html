			<div class="markdown"><p>As a pediatrician, I'll add on to this.  Kids tend to be little doorknob licking Petri dishes, and they haven't been exposed to as many things as adults and thus don't have the immunity from as many strains of viruses, they get multiple infections at a given time more often than adults do.  They certainly don't have to be immunocompromised for this to happen; just being in daycare and/or having multiple siblings can cause them to really get a nasty confluence of bugs.  We have a respiratory virus panel that we routinely use to figure out what is making a kid sick after they are admitted to the hospital.  Some of the little guys and gals really get sucker punched with stuff like flu, adenovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus all at the same time.  Then they might get a superimposed pneumonia that kicks them when they're down and the end up in the ICU on high flow oxygen.  Winter sucks.</p></div>		</li>
