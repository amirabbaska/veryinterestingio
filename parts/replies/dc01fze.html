<p>&quot;Yes&quot;, if it would be possible to see that. It is not.</p>
<p>Everyone in the universe sees the cosmic microwave background, but different places see different local fluctuations as they see radiation from different original locations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he's saying is, the observable universe does not have a physical ending point. &quot;Observable universe&quot; just means the portion of the universe we can see.</p>
<p>The idea is that the &quot;entire universe&quot; is thought to be infinitely large in every direction. Our &quot;observable universe&quot; is just a sphere within the &quot;entire universe,&quot; the boundary of that sphere being at the distance from which light had been able to travel to Earth since the big bang. There is nothing at the edge of the universe, because the edge is not a physical place, it's just how far you can see. </p>
<p>In other words, imagine an infinitely large universe popping into existence, not in an outward explosion from a single point, but just popping into existence everywhere all at once. Over the last 13.8 billion years, stars and other objects have been emitting light. Thus, from Earth, we can look outward into the universe in any direction and the maximum distance we can see is 13.8 billion light years away. In other words, our observable universe is a sphere with a radius of 13.8 billion light years with Earth at the center. There is a bunch of universe outside of that sphere, but we can't see it (it's unobservable) because light from that part of the universe has not had time to travel to Earth yet. </p>
<p>If an object is 14 billion light years away from Earth, it will be another 200 million years before we can see that object - the object exists, but is outside of our observable universe. If you could magically teleport yourself 200 million light years closer to that object, it would then be exactly at the edge of your observable universe. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>the question what it looks like to stand at the edge of the observable universe cannot be answered in any meaningful way. An observer is always at the center of their own observable universe, so - by definition - there cannot be an observer at the edge of an observable universe.</p>

<p>Current data shows, that the universe is probably at least 3*10^23 times bigger than the observable universe.</p>

<p>Follow-up question: How can we know about anything outside the observable universe? Obviously we can't observe it directly, so what evidence is there that supports one possibility over another?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Despite reading lots of books like stuff by s Hawking, it never occured to me that the distance we can see is the age of the universe but that even beyond that it could be so much more huge and we'd never be able to observe it all because it's expanding away FTL. Holy s*** my mind is blown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is mind boggling :)</p>
<p>However, the radius of the observable universe is considerably larger than <em>the age of the universe</em> * <em>the speed of light</em> due to the metric expansion of space.</p>
<p>The age of the universe is ~13 billion years.<br />
The radius of the observable universe is ~46 billion light years.</p></div>		</li>
