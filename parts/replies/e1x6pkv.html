			<div class="markdown"><p>Electron degenerate matter is supported against further collapse by the degeneracy pressure of the electrons in the material being unable to occupy the same quantum states and isn't very dependent on temperature. As the material cools eventually the motion of particles in the material will slow and the blackbody radiation emission will diminish, but bulk properties such as density won't change that much. In principle, if you were to wait long enough (very, very long), all the nuclei in the EDM will eventually fuse into iron nuclei but this shouldn't really affect the electron pressure support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EDM just means under such gravity all space outside the nucleus of the atoms is removed, correct? I never realized the electrons could flow, I always figured they were locked together in a crystal structure like state. Does EDM have amazing electrical properties?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, this does not appear to answer the question. It seems more to be answering the question &quot;would <em>ordinary matter</em> behave like a 'gas' with regard to a collision by a piece of EDM?&quot; The question that is posted, however, is asking what phase of ordinary matter <em>EDM itself</em> is most equivalent to: is it most like a solid, or a liquid, or a gas? If it's &quot;hard&quot;, that suggests it is most like a solid. However - as we know even from something relatively more ordinary, at least in an astrophysical context, like the dynamics of the matter inside the Earth, the properties of being solid, liquid, and gas are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The matter in the Earth's mantle, for example, is &quot;solid&quot; if you took out a small chunk and could somehow keep it at those conditions by magic while existing in ordinary atmosphere as you're imagining here with the EDM, yet over long timescales (hundreds of teraseconds or more) and distances (hundreds of kilometers or more) it behaves like a liquid, flowing round and round in giant convective currents. So naive inferences from properties like that can be misleading. &quot;Gas&quot; though suggests compressibility over a wide range of pressures (i.e. more than one order of magnitude) without changing phase or otherwise undergoing any sudden shifts. However, EDM is at least <em>very</em> far from an <em>ideal</em> gas - that's the whole point.</p>
<p>It seems the descriptors &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;liquid&quot;, and &quot;gas&quot; really only best apply to matter right around our ordinary human scale, maybe within a couple of orders of magnitude or so - so pressures on the order of 100 kPa, temps on the order of 300 K, densities on the order 1-1000 kg/m\^3, times on the kilosecond and perhaps single megaseconds scale (so up to order of 1000 ks). Get a bit of a ways out of that - and we don't even need to go to astrophysical extremes as our deep inner Earth example shows - and the lines become blurry and the picture considerably more complex. And an even less &quot;extreme&quot; example in terms of immediate conditions, which details the last point about time, consider pitch. Over gigasecond scales - so about a human lifetime and longer, it flows, yet if you take some in your hand, you'd be forgiven for thinking you were holding something rather chunk-like. In fact there's about a 100-year (3 gig) experiment that has involved dropping pitch, and it has dropped only like a 3 or 4 drops over that time. ADD: it's 9 drops. So about 1 drop every 300 Ms. And following the deep-Earth lead, if we go to slightly more extreme but still planetary contexts you get lots of phases that defy all three, e.g. what is the &quot;superionic water&quot; deep inside Neptune?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by ‘dropping pitch?’</p>
<p>And are we talking about a whole new elemental state? Or superdense gas that looks like a solid and acts like a liquid/gas?</p>
<p>I’m no physicist, but I find this very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment</a></p>
<p>As it says, &quot;pitch&quot; refers to a number of different, ultra-high-viscosity (ultra slow flowing) materials, thus effectively straddling the borderline between a solid and a liquid. In particular, the one used here is some form of asphalt, akin to the stuff used to pave roads, so thick that it is effectively solid, but over the extremely long timescales used in this experiment (3 Gs, a bit over 90 years, I quoted 100 as that's what I remembered, but here it says starting in 1927 so 91 years) its liquid properties become evident as its very, very slowly migrates through the hole in the bottom of the flask into which it was first emplaced (it was heated up and melted to pour in first) to form drops, as in liquid drops - taking about 300 megaseconds, or 10 years, for each drop to ooze out the bottom, roughly, at least in this particular setup. The point is there are processes occurring in the world that are too slow for you to notice ordinarily, but that once taken into account, provide yet another dimension of complication and nuance to the idea of &quot;states of matter&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, in this case people call it a Fermi gas because it's the state you get with non-interacting fermions, but it doesn't look much like a classical gas in any other respect. Some of the naming conventions in calling a quantum phase of matter a solid/liquid/gas are pretty misleading.</p></div>		</li>
