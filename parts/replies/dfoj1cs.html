<p>Not so fast there. That <em>is</em> one theory of why Neanderthals went extinct, but it's not the only one. There are more theories than there are palaeontologists, probably.  </p>
<p>Other theories include:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Neanderthals were slow breeders and were simply absorbed by the fast-breeding humans.  </li>
<li>Neanderthals, having much denser and thicker bones, were too heavy to swim. This was a competitive drawback in post-glacial Europe.  </li>
<li>Disease.  </li>
<li>Neanderthals lived in small, isolated bands and inbreeding became a problem.  </li>
<li>Climate change. As the glaciers retreated the large prey (bison, mammut) that Neanderthals hunted became rarer. Neanderthals couldn't run fast enough to successfully hunt smaller, lighter prey such as deer. Their heavily muscled bodies were poorly equipped to cope with the heat of an European summer.  </li>
<li>Dogs. Human had the advantage of tamed wolves, Neanderthals had not.</li>
</ul>
<p>The real reason may be any of these, or a combination of them, or none of them. We just don't know for certain yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh cool, I didn't know all these, thanks! The only theories I knew off my head were genocide through human co-operation, and breeding out, both of which led to humans overtaking Neanderthal populations entirely.</p>
<p>Disease would likely require the populations to be separated for a while first, though, wouldn't they? Rather than alongside - so that one group could develop immunities. Otherwise you'd get a genetic bottleneck instead. But then, humans being nomadic would cover that.</p>
<p>I can't claim to be precise or accurate. With pre-history technically nobody can, but in my case I can't even claim to be an anthropologist. Just an avid learner willing to help by sharing what I've learned. And I'm always up for learning more!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is one huge factor that is often overlooked, humans developed agriculture, whereas neanderthals continued to rely on diets based on meat and vegetables.</p>
<p>This allowed us to build stable settlements that eventually grew into cities and civilizations, whereas neanderthal population densities were greatly limited by available food supplies. However this dietary shift, and similar ones after it, had serious negative health effects.</p>
<p>Meat has important nutrients for brain health (vitamin B12, EPA, DHA, various fatty acids, phospholipids, choline, carnitine, creatine, etcetera) that are not provided by grains, legumes, or plants in general. Ketones naturally produced during low carbohydrate intake also have beneficial effects on cognitive health, but are absent on agricultural diets. Neanderthal brain size was larger than human brain size to begin with, and human brain size is steadily decreasing since the introduction of agriculture.</p>
<p>Metabolic health also suffers the more we base our diet on carbohydrates and the more processed they are. Type 2 diabetes is the quintessential example that can be completely prevented and functionally treated by carbohydrate restriction. Virtually all western diseases have varying degrees of evidence for ties to carbohydrate intake and quality. I am confident future research will clarify and solidify the role of carbohydrates in diseases, I expect huge breakthroughs in Alzheimer's Disease specifically.</p>
<p>Ironically, as food becomes more processed to increase availability, enable transportation, and prolong shelf-life, the less healthy it becomes. Refined cane sugar introduced ~1000 years ago is far more harmful than fruits. Refined grains introduced 5000-100 years ago depending on method and degree of refinement are in a completely different league than whole grains. Hydrogenated vegetable oils were supposed to solve rancidity, yet they introduced artificial trans fats.  These three are the triumvirate responsible for our current health epidemic. Nitrites and nitrates, preservatives added to meat have been linked to cancer. Agricultural subsidies, diet formulas, and synthetic meat attempts lead to similar issues.</p>
<p>So while Neanderthals drew the shortest straw, we still drew a short straw, and it is getting shorter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look, I'd recommend people learning about this to get some other perspectives on this, because I don't think this reflects scientific consensus. We don't really know what happened to our ancient cousins. This is just conjecture, there's actually no evidence of widespread, direct warfare between Neanderthals and Humans. Neanderthals did have larger brains than humans, and did seem to be quite advanced, but we're not very sure what the scope of their mental capacities were in comparison to humans. Just because they had larger brains does not entirely mean they were mentally superior. Without a doubt, we inhabited similar territory to them and competed for resources. Why precisely we survived is still something of a mystery. Some theories involve climate change as being a factor, or humans being more organized, or yes more warlike. These are theories, however, as direct evidence from that era is scant.</p>
<p>Edit: I know this is a late edit, but I feel compelled to make it all the same. I am not trying to imply that ancient humans were peaceful. There's good evidence that this is far from the truth, that murder and warfare were de rigueur for ancient humans. What I am saying is that our propensity for violence and war compared to Neanderthals is unknown. At least, to my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that you disagree with each other.</p>
<p>The commentor above didn't explicitly claim that <em>H. sapiens</em> killed <em>H. neanderthalensis</em> through warfare. The known facts are that Neanderthals existed in Europe before our own ancestors arrived from Africa, they co-existed for thousands of years (and had children, resulting in 1-4% Neanderthal DNA being present in European populations, meaning that they technically didn't go extinct), and then the Neanderthals gradually died out and were replaced by our ancestors.</p>
<p>There are many different hypotheses. Direct warfare is one of them, though clearly war wasn't all they were up to as that 1-4% DNA shows. One theory has to do with pathogens, saying that maybe <em>H. sapiens</em> brought some African disease(s) with them that <em>H. neanderthalensis</em> wasn't prepared for, like what happened when Columbus arrived in America though on a smaller (slower) scale. Depending on the timeline of the domestication of dogs, their domestication by <em>H. sapiens</em> could strengthen the pathogen hypothesis (populations that keep animals are exposed to more pathogens). One theory is more explicitly based on intelligence, claiming that Neanderthals were outcompeted because they were dumber or less organised. There are also some evidence of climate change which may or may not have played a role. All of these are reasonable ideas, and it's quite possible that the truth is some combination of several of them. </p>
<p>What's undeniable, however, is that after <em>H. sapiens</em> and <em>H. neanderthalensis</em> started sharing the same space the result was that all populations except for the one that was to give rise to modern humans — made up of 96-99% of one and 1-4% of the other — died out. This means that the <em>sapiens</em> part of humanity clearly had a large evolutionary advantage that aided them during the co-existence period, no matter what actually happened during the co-existence. So the conclusion is that if our ancestors had stayed in Africa, our cousins wouldn't have been displaced by them.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Wait....you can't conclude that from what you just said. There could be an environmental factor outside of homo sapiens affecting Europe at the time of the extinction that would have killed Neanderthals either way, but homo sapiens were more adapted for so they would have survived either way. Climate change, for example. So then even if h sapiens stayed in Africa the Neanderthals die anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true. For a long-time, Neanderthals were considered human ancestors. Then they weren't, and we thought they killed them all. Then we thought maybe we bred them out. But ultimately, it's all conjecture based on what we can recover that's survived the amount of time between then and now.</p>
<p>Without a window into history itself, we'll never really know for sure. Which is a shame, it's a really interesting topic. But every now and then science learns something that turns previous assumptions on their heads. Maybe one day we'll have a more reliable supported theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you, but I would go even farther and say that neanderthal was quite unlikely to be as smart as our ancestors. They did have fire and perhaps language, but when they went extinct, humans were already &quot;anatomically modern&quot;, as it is called. Without written language and because they were still hunter/gatherers, those humans were not as &quot;intelligent&quot; as we have become with passed down knowledge,  but their brains would have been indistinguishable from ours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going point out that we have no idea if they had a written language or not. We have no surviving evidence, but absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. </p>
<p>There are many possible ways of encoding speech and we might not recognize it as such even if an intact example were preserved. The precursors to ideographic language, for instance; are totem poles art or an early form of language? They certainly encode very rich meaning. So - not a written language in the sense we think of it is not quite the same thing as &quot;without the ability to encode meaning over time.&quot;</p>
<p>A shell belt, the knotted fringe on a strap, either could be encoded and if we didn't know and had no &quot;rosetta stone&quot; it could go unrecognized. And this is aside from the question of preservation. </p>
<p>&quot;Smart&quot; is such a slippery idea anyway. It's difficult to forget that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_\(gorilla\)" target="_blank">Koko</a> scored poorly on an intelligence test in part due to identifying a tree as a place to live - instead of a house. We now realize that intelligence tests that are not adjusted for culture can be very inaccurate - and that's within human populations. </p>
<p>We weigh tool-using very highly - since we are capable of using tools. But by this metric, a common crow is smarter than a dolphin. That seems unlikely. </p>
<p>We tend to define ourselves as the gold standard of intelligence, including understandings, perceptions and behaviors that are useful to us, socially and culturally, when they wouldn't be much use at all to a dolphin or an elephant. Both are certainly intelligent - but very likely in ways quite different from ourselves. We are just starting to realize that it's probably not even a linear scale.</p></div>		</li>
