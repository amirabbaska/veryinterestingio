			<div class="markdown"><p>So primate research is not my wheelhouse but like I've said, primatologists have frequently come out with things talking about some minor acoustic variability in primate calls they monitor, showing a vocal evolution leading to human speech and that primates are vocal learners. Sometimes it's good and sometimes (in my opinion) it's way overblown. Especially coming from an anthropology background though, I can see that being a significant because the whole focus is humans. Unfortunately anthropology has not really kept up with neurobiology that take advantage of other models like songbirds to develop theories that match behavioral observations with the molecular and cellular substrates they're built from. </p>
<p>Obviously anyone who believes in evolution knows that we developed speech from precursor primate vocalizations, but it just seems like a few things are missing, like a direct connection between the cortex and brain stem for fine motor control of the laryngeal muscles - this is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095943881400107X" target="_blank">hallmark trait</a> (paywall) of all vocal learning species examined. However, other things that were perhaps thought important are not, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/12/09/504890630/say-what-monkey-mouths-and-throats-are-equipped-for-speech" target="_blank">like laryngeal structure</a>. Maybe that's what your class was discussing, and is a very fair and adequate point.</p>
<p>One of my favorite studies was from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Todd_Preuss2/publication/5507313_The_evolution_of_the_arcuate_fasciculus_revealed_with_comparative_DTI/links/00b7d516bf7c5ad879000000/The-evolution-of-the-arcuate-fasciculus-revealed-with-comparative-DTI.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>, which showed from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI, using MRI to map gross connectivity in the brain) that there is a progressive strengthening of the connectivity between what is thought to be Broca's area (speech production) and
Wernicke's area (speech meaning) through to the human brain. That connection, the Arcuate Fasciculus, has long been known to be crucial for human speech, and it isn't really present in the chimp and totally absent in the rhesus macaque monkey.</p></div>		</li>
