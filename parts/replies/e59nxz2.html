			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  People are giving me crap for saying &quot;higher pressure under the lid&quot; is wrong even though I did the math and the pressure increase is minuscule.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>With a lid on, there is only a small crack for air/steam to flow between the inside and outside of the container, and once it's boiling and generating steam, that flow is outward only.  It will carry all of the air out over time leaving only steam filling the space above the water.  With the lid off, the steam rises away and dry air flows in around the edge of the pot.  Dry air vs steam being in contact with the bubbles is what makes the difference in how long they persist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;I have a related question: when my lidless pot of pasta is foaming up, I can make the foam temporarily dissipate by blowing on it. Why is this?&quot;</p>
<p>Which is for the same reason. The humid air doesn't escape fast enough even without a lid, blowing on it will dissipate it. If I keep a lid on with a minimal gap, the foam will build up, a quick blow into the gap and the whole foam collapses.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>From OP's explanation, it seems that what is responsible for increased evaporation (which he termed &quot;moisture&quot;) is really the partial pressure of water vapour.</p>
<p>Did you calculate that? Or the total pressure of the gas mixture? Cause I'd hazzard a guess that the partial pressure of water vapour does decrease significantly when you lift the lid, leading to the increased evaporation effect described above.</p>
<p>However, if the others saying &quot;pressure under the lid&quot; meant total pressure, not partial pressure of water vapour, then they'd be wrong just as you say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I calculated the pressure increase that would lift the lid of the pot and release itself.  Total pressure, not the partial pressure of water vapor.  </p>
<p>The partial pressure of water vapor will absolutely increase when you put the lid on the pot, because the absolute pressure will stay about the same but most of the air will be replaced by steam.  Same pressure but almost entirely water vapor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is right.
PV=kT
Pressure x volume = a constant x temperature.
The lid limits the volume. The temperature above the water is higher with lid on, which means the pressure must be higher. </p></div>		</li>
