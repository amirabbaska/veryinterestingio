<p>4 - 4.5 milliliters of alcohol per 1000 milliliters of blood.</p>
<p>BAC -&gt; 0.40-0.45 %</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In most states, a BAC of .10% is considered legally drunk. This means that for every 1,000 milliliters of blood, the body contains 1 milliliter of alcohol. In some states, the legal definition of intoxication is .08%, which means that for every 1000 milliliters of blood, the body contains 8/10ths of a milliliter of alcohol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To Answer your question divide BAC(US) by 10 to get your ‰ permille measurement.</p>
<p>BAC(US) is g/dL</p>
<p>0.40 g/dL (percent (%)) == 0.040 g/L (permille (‰))</p></div>		</li>
