			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a look at California's foothill cattle country on Google Earth sometime. You'll quickly notice countless little retention ponds built by placing small earthen dams across the countless tiny creeks and rivulets that cross the landscape. Even in dry years, those small ponds usually hold enough water to keep the cattle growing until late summer. As a bonus, the ponds also recharge the local aquifers, allowing the cattlemen to place relatively shallow wells near them to pull water from when the ponds themselves do dry up.</p>
<p>The drought IS putting a huge amount of stress on the cattle industry right now. While pumps can pull groundwater to supplement the retention ponds, the lack of rain has also reduced the grass growth in the hills this year. No grass = hungry cattle. Hungry cattle don't make great steaks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key to this being you hope your family chose the right piece of random farmland in the valley that will afford you the best water rights. Keep in mind that you likely had no control or strategy to affect the outcome for better or worse. </p>
<p>The moral of the story, if you have bad water rights, get into the time machine business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The valley I'm from is free range, and the cattle just eat grass. There's a creek that partly dries up in the summer time that they can drink from as well. Cows are a lot better at living in semi-arid steppe than we are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've wondered the difference between cowboy cattle and intensive farm cattle.  My dad has seen cattle being moved from high summer grazing to low winter grazing while he was Elk hunting. Does that beef get sold into the general market or is this the stuff bought by whole foods or fancy restaurants or Farmers Markets? I'd think the mountain cattle taste better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just tacking on to this since this is the top comment. A lot of people cite this statistic as &quot;1 lb of beef <em>uses</em> ~1000 gallons water&quot; as if the water isn't useful afterwards.</p>
<p>Water stays water. The cow might drink the water, or eat crops grown with the water, but that water ends up in one of two places: in the beef, or in the ground (poop). </p>
<p>And eventually, we eat the beef, and poop it out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the difficulty in returning that to the area though and back into storage for use. Sure the water will return to the ground, where in drought areas it is then evaporated and then windswept in clouds elsewhere to fall where it is of no use to the area.</p>
<p>Water remains on earth but distribution and rainfall is not equal across land. One area may be lush and 1000km away another in a drought. That drought area often cannot afford to loose 1000L of stored water that could take months or years until the next fall to replenish.</p>
<p>Desalination plants on the oceans and pipelines inland is one option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but that water used is returned as polluted water. If the water is too polluted, like if it comes from crowed feed lots, or large fields of crops where lots of fertilizers and pesticides are used then that water is no longer useful for farming and is no longer potable either. There is this myth that we can just use as much water as we want because it all re-enters the water cycle anyway. That is technically true but doesn't account for the fact that we pollute the water we use and usually don't return it to where we took it from (due to it now being polluted).</p></div>		</li>
