<p>Q:ELI5 Why do birds make nests?</p>
<p>A:Many birds make nests. An eagles nest is called an Aerie. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Turdus_merula_Nesting.jpg" target="_blank">Here is a picture of a bird sitting in a nest.</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I noticed that too.  It is amazing how people get upvoted when they give it a technical term &quot;dimunitive&quot; and then give examples in other languages -- that's more a taxonomy thing (observing similar phenomena in multiple languages and giving them a common name) whereas /u/diablo-solforge answer is an actual <em>explanation</em> (breaking it down into cause-and-effect based on the interplay of &quot;lower-level&quot; phenomena, in this case physics of speech).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not quite sure the explanation is valid though, since it doesn't work in many languages. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2wpkb9/eli5_why_do_we_frequently_end_words_with_y_when/cotjx47" target="_blank">Here I give some samples.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>The more you scrub the worse it gets with suds, and you can't just soak in up with a towel.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this idea compelling, especially in light of studying American Sign Language and what I've learned from the ASL linguistics classes I've taken. There's an aspect to ASL called &quot;mouth morphemes,&quot; which are basically ways your mouth can move during a sign that contribute to the meaning of the sign. For example, the mouth morpheme CHA conveys hugeness (which parallels the idea that &quot;ah&quot; has a low frequency component that tends to remind of us of larger objects). There are also mouth morphemes of EEE and OOO that usually convey smallness, thinness, etc. depending on context.</p>
<p>There's a theory that mouth morphemes occur from language contact with spoken language users - in this case, the first deaf residential schools in America forcing their students to speak instead of sign. It's interesting that this phonetic symbolism has seemed to be assimilated by a group of language speakers who (mostly) can't hear from contact with a language group that can.</p>
