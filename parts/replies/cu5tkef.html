			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks like the slogan in '41 didn't work out so hot, huh? Apparently sales went down a bit in 1944:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How about a Coke? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The very next year it was evidently necessary to put this one out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coke means Coca-Cola. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1944: Troops overseas. US markets introduced to new nickname for Coca-Cola, &quot;Coke.&quot; Becomes household (nick)name.</p>
<p>1945: WWII ends. Troops return home. Troops are like &quot;Wtf, Coke? The powder we'd buy on shore leave in Singapore? You can buy that shit at the corner store now? I LOVE AMERICA!&quot; Coca-Cola Corp. recognizes the mistake, immediately correcting it with a new campaign. Veterans are now familiar with Coke's new nickname. Disappointment ensues. Addiction skyrockets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never really saw the point of those videos. Take any drink that contains sugar, and what you'll be left with if you boil it is always going to be something like a drier form of syrup. Just pouring sugar into water and boiling that will yield the same result. It's not some dangerous black cancerous blob, it's just sugar and food colouring. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also on one of our campus new years we divided roles and instead of 'cheers' sang christmas ad (in localized version).</p>
<p>Here it is. Pretty impressive if sang by 20 people at once.</p>
