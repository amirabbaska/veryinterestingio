			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this for anyone wondering, there are observations that constrain the radius to that 11-13 km range quoted, it's not pure guesswork. They aren't super accurate and are all model dependent though. These observations include watching explosive bursts of fusion on the surface as the material expands, falls back, and bounces; using eclipses of the neutron star to constrain the size of the xray emitting region; carefully measuring the distance, brightness, and temperature of neutron stars to determine the radius. Even carefully measuring how quickly a neutron star cools down after a rapid accretion episode. All of these methods make assumptions about things like the atmosphere of the neutron star, though, and changing those assumptions changes the answer you get at the end. Not by so much that you could get a neutron star that's 100 km in radius, but maybe it moves the number from 15 km to 10 km. 10 km is the &quot;order of magnitude&quot; of the radius, meaning it's probably not quite right but it's not off by much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is all correct. </p>
<p>I probably should have mentioned a few observational constraints in my post originally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much do you think the NS-NS merger gravitational wave observation that will probably be announced next monday will help with this? I imagine that the shape of the waveform will depend on exactly when their surfaces meet, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It won't be better than current constraints. </p>
<p>They can get the chirp mass pretty well, but getting the individual masses is much harder, and it will unlikely give us an idea better than current constraints. </p>
<p>Additionally, tidal effects deform the NSs during the inspiral, which depend on the nuclear equation of state as well as mass and radius, and so it will break a lot of assumptions.</p>
<p>The only way I could be wrong (which I'd like to me) is if the inspiral is incredibly long (very likely) and clear, and the chirp is is far cleaner than the past BH-BH mergers. That would be a dream come true for a lot of people. </p>
<p>This (rumored) event is also going to be the closest NS merger in the history of sGRB observations, at a distance of 40 MPc. In short, this event is a miracle, and I also find it highly likely that it will be the best resolved NS merger of my career, similar to how SN1987A is <em>the observed supernova</em> that all theorists have to contend with. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're going to be watching two neutron stars merge? Can you explain it a bit more. Are you measuing the gravitational waves from when it merges? How are you measuing that? What do you hope to find out from that? </p>
<p>It's sounds incredibly interesting. Physics and astronomy are a small hobby of mine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By launching Voyagers 1 and 2 as well as NICER, shouldn't we have a better perspective given more distant travel within our solar system? Any Highschooler could use Pythagorean theorem to estimate its diameter given its perceptive distance from earth and from any point distant from earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the instruments aboard each of the Voyager spacecraft are no longer working. The remaining ones mainly measure ambient magnetic fields and cosmic ray activity. Even if the optical/UV/IR instruments were still in service, they are quite primitive compared to what we've got now and probably wouldn't tell us much of anything we didn't already know.</p>
<p>Regarding the pythagorean theorem: parallax isn't used to measure the diameter of the target object, it's used to measure the object's distance from us. The problem we're up against is that neutron stars, being absurdly tiny for stars, are impossible to resolve with any currently-existing instruments. Thus we are, for the most part, restricted to theoretical modeling of them, or measuring it in secondary ways (such as comparing the rotation period to the speed of light and thus putting an upper limit on the rotational velocity at the star's equator). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the Voyager probes would have powerful telescopes, that would just give a better estimate of the distance to us, not an estimate of the size.</p>
<p>Gaia will improve all distance estimates a lot in the next years, with its baseline of just &lt;= 2 times the Earth/Sun distance (as it orbits the Sun close to Earth).</p></div>		</li>
