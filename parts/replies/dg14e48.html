<p>This means your signal is actually travelling forever - it's just indistinguishable from every other signal that's travelling forever.</p>

<p>This isn't technically true - it doesn't account for absorption. When a particle absorbs an electromagnetic wave, that signal is dead. Like when the sun hits you and you feel your skin warm up, those photons are dying on your skin. They don't keep going. </p>

<p>My understanding is that absorbed radiation is re-radiated at a longer wavelength, eg. the greenhouse effect. But i'm unclear about whether or not that applies universally to the entire EM spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is true that all matter with a temperature above 0 kelvin radiates energy, it is not true that the same absorbed photon is re-radiated. A molecule has a certain amount of internal energy that increases when it absorbs a photon. As a reaction to the internal energy increase, the molecule emits <em>more</em> radiative energy than before, until it reaches equilibrium with its surroundings again. The emitted photons have no relationship to the absorbed photons. </p>
<p>As a sidebar - the greenhouse effect works because CO2 has a molecular structure that allows it to absorb longwave radiation that is emitted by the Earth. CO2 doesn't have a special property that allows it to &quot;re-radiate&quot; photons. It simply grabs a bypassing long-wave photon that is headed for space, increasing the CO2 molecule's internal energy. Some of the molecule's internal energy is constantly radiating in all directions, regardless of absorbing photons or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is the same principle a <a href="http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/travelling/yagi1.jpg" target="_blank">yagi-Uda antenna</a> works. Power isn't connected to each piece of metal, that metal absorbs energy from your feed and reradiates it. </p>
<p>The same is true as an inverse relationship when you receive signals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct sir!  When a photon is absorbed by a particle or molecule, the energy is radiated at a slightly lower wavelength or energy level. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, it is true that mathematically, 100% absorption is not possible because attenuation is exponential. </p>
<p>The &quot;never 100%&quot; argument is a mathematical one. In the same way that, if I push someone on a swing and leave them there, their momentum will never decay to zero, just asymptotically approach it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly un/related question: </p>
<p>I've heard about the possibility of harvesting the energy of ambient em waves/signals via to power/boost small devices inside buildings and in urban areas.</p>
<p>I know there are a ton of waves bouncing around from human created sources but is there enough energy bouncing around the average home to power anything useful? (I'm intentionally leaving open the definition of &quot;average home&quot; and &quot;useful&quot; - maybe 100mW?)</p>
<p>If so, would the antenna size need to be huge to capture enough waves in a major city?</p>
<p>Also, if I'm harvesting waves in the AM/FM or consumer electronics bands 2.4Ghz / 5.8Ghz, would this impact the availability of signals for some other receiver? Or, due to the small size of an antenna, the slice of the sphere that is &quot;blocked&quot; be me absorbing waves will be quickly filled be other waves being deflected?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of it as visible light. The further you are and more obstacles between you and the light source the dimmer that light appears to be. Of course that's not a perfect analogy because WiFi can penetrate walls, but it gives an intuitive way to think about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meta Eli 5....since you mentioned a lack of comfort with that aspect.... </p>
<p>The wavelength of signals is a very important consideration for how far waves go. Some waves like that at higher frequencies, like xa, get attenuated more by the atmosphere, clouds and moisture in general. </p>
<p>I think your post is the best one in this thread from an Eli 5 perspective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this a little.  A rule of thumb they taught us in undergrad is that longer wavelength --&gt; greater penetration.</p>
<p>Leaving absorption aside, the different types of scattering of EM waves is generally related to the size of the particle doing the scattering and the wavelength being scattered.  In this case scattering is inversely proportional to the wavelength raised to the 4th power.  This means doubling your wavelength decreases the scattering by a factor of 16</p>
<p>Application of this phenomena can be found in the Navy's use of ELF (extremely low frequency) radio to broadcast messages to submarines at depth.  Why don't we use this more broadly? Antennae size has to scale along with the wavelength, so you quickly outstrip the practical ability to transmit on that wavelength as you go up. Additionally, the messages take a lot longer to send when you get to the extremes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent. Yours should be a top comment. They taught you well. What school if you dont mind my asking? </p>
<p>Another interesting theory is that the actual wavelength of very low frequency waves can be used to more closely mimic the curvature of the earth, reducing interference. Of course this was a navy analyst telling us this during a seminar, so I am not sure how much actual impact it has considering the phase matching that must occur in practice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to touch on the antenna issue there - the USN ELF system (which they no longer use), was a ground dipole setup with two transmitters, each with 14<em>mile</em> dipoles, sat 148 miles apart, operating in tandem.</p>
<p>This was the compromise system they went with.  The original plans for Sanguine would have covered 40% of Wisconsin ..</p></div>		</li>
