			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation, but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luckily the gas well is isolated, about a mile from people. Even so, natural gas and the gas that gives natural gas it's unpleasant odor, are not harmful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to point out that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-gas-leak-20151203-story.html" target="_blank">hundreds of people</a> have moved out because of the leak, and many residents affected are complaining of the rotten-egg smell, headaches, nosebleeds, dizziness, and so on.</p>
<p>Edit because people keep mentioning it:  Yes, I know that natural gas doesn't smell.  I also know that there are other things that could be leaking along with it that do smell.  Did you know sulphur smells like rotten eggs?  Did you know the &quot;gas&quot; smell that gets added to natural gas doesn't smell like rotten eggs?  The odds that the smell people are complaining about is some other substance that's also leaking from the well, along with the natural gas, seem pretty good to me.  More than one thing can be leaking at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>H2s or hydrogen sulfide otherwise known as sour gas smells like rotten eggs. And unfortunately it's lethal. Anything over 100 ppm is basically instant death. You shouldn't be working without supplied air if it's 15 ppm or more. At 10 ppm, you're only allowed to work 8 hours and you must take multiple breaks. Otherwise the short and long term effects are crazy. </p>
<p>H2s, that shit kills you. </p>
<p>//edit: a word</p>
<p>I would know, worked the filling rigs in Alberta for 4 years before the crash</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for explaining this.  People keep responding to my post with &quot;lol gas doesn't smell&quot; and honestly - I'm just saying what the residents of the area have been reporting.  So here it is everyone!  H2s smells like rotten eggs and can kill you.  I cannot give you enough upvotes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it is heavier then air so it has a nice way of settling in valleys and not leaving/dissipating. They handle blown out sour wells with napalm, like <a href="http://www.fireflycriticalwellsafety.com/demonstration.html" target="_blank">so</a> .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually at 100 ppm you can no longer smell it but you still have an hour before bad things happen 700-1000 is where you get knocked down within a couple minutes. It's around 1200 that you're looking at an instant knockdown with minutes before death.</p>
<p>I would know I'm I just checked my h2s alive training book. Hang in there buddy, it's going to come up again. If it makes you feel any better I'll be shocked if this shift isn't my last.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually huge. I live in the area, and they're rapidly running out of space to put the displaced people. There are also concerns because a number of the schools in the area are directly affected by this. They're seeking possible office space to relocate to temporarily, but the logistics involved in all this area huge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is suburban LA. I'm sure there is plenty of room in The valley or Simi. It's only temporary. The leak is definitely a huge concern, but it will be fixed with minimal issues. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to the highest voted reply to this comment, H2S occurs in basically every natural gas well.</p>
<p>Edit:  ITT below:  Plenty of people who have strong opinions on what natural gas does or doesn't smell like, but have clearly never been within 300 feet of a well that vents sour gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The threshold for detecting H2S odor is an order of magnitude lower than the threshold for it to cause any ill effects. There's definitely a risk, though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You sound like you work in the industry possibly. I used to do r&amp;s work and couldn't find some answers from the articles. Any idea what the surface pressure is? Couldnt they snub in a plug below the shoe in the casing and then do a squeeze cement job above? Or even just cement the entire well like they do when someone drops a source down one?   </p>
<p>[Edit] figured it out. Methane everywhere around the site so they can't rig up or work safely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard news articles are written at 6th grade reading level, so I try to avoid them on technical facts. About 3200# at the surface. I'm not up to date on the &quot;latest&quot; snubbing equipment, but I'm pretty sure 2 3/8&quot; - 2 7/8&quot; were only rated around 1000# - 1200#. It's a hairy situation, would love to be on it.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know if they use (or have you used) any equipment to monitor the concentrations of gases that are venting out? I've been involved in studies that use mudgas to identify different formation layers. If infrastructure leaks, and the gas composition is measured, it can help determine the depth of leak and the formation that is leaking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Socal Gas isn't an exploration and production company, it's a midstream/downstream company. This means they don't find the natural gas, they buy it from E&amp;P, and deliver it to homes and businesses. Natural gas is has seasonal demand, ie heating (even in SoCal), so they buy natural gas year round, and inject natural gas into a empty known reservoir in the summer, then in the winter they produce the natural gas they've injected. These reservoirs are well studied, maybe a sandstone/limestone with an impermeable formation above and below it.  </p>
<p>So they have a pretty excellent idea where the gas is coming from, after all it does have the man made mercaptan odor in it. Where it's escaping from (maybe underground blowout) who knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, my mind wandered and completely forgot it was a natural gas being stored in a geologic reservoir and not exploration. I'm always curious about gas sensors so thats why I asked. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
