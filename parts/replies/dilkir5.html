<p>A glass of ice water takes about8 calories to warm up more than one at room temp. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but if you drink 8 glasses a day, that's 64 calories. Over the course of a week, that's 448 calories. You burn about 100 calories a mile so that's the equivalent of running an extra 4.5 miles in a week. Just because you drank cold water instead of room temperature water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anyone was curious on the math:</p>
<p>On most labels, they'll use kCal or Calorie (with a captial C), but I'm gonna start off my calculations with the small calorie. The amount of energy required to raise a gram of water one degree is roughly 1 calorie (small).</p>
<p>An 8oz glass of water is ~240mL (which, because it's water, means it's roughly 240g).</p>
<p>Lets say you're drinking a cold drink at 0C, and you're raising it to 37C. So somewhere your body uses around 8.8 kCal (probably less since the water is probably a bit warmer than 0C).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is, but you would have to be trying. People end up hurting themselves drinking way too much on a dare or trying to dilute their urine for a drug test. Way more than 8 glasses in a short period. If you just drink when you are thirsty and stop if you get  stomach cramps or lower back (kidney) pain, you'll be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You want to drink water throughout the day and not just at one point but the 8 cups a day is a mistranslation/misunderstanding. You need 8 cups of water a day but you don't have to drink all 8 cups. All food will have some water in it and all drinks as well so look to try and get around 1.5 liters or 4-6 cups of pure water and if you start feeling thirsty simply drink more </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor but I like your answer. However, number 2 is probably a negligible factor: in order to raise the temperature of water from 0°C (the coldest it'll get at atmospheric pressure) to 36°C (about your body temperature), you need 36kcal per kilo (liter) of water. So drinking a whole liter of ice cold water (that's a quart, for Americans out there) will only burn about 36 kcal.</p>
<p>That's tiny and nobody drinks all of their water <em>that</em> cold unless purposely trying to achieve weight loss via this method so the calories needed are even less (probably around 15 kcal/liter for tap water)</p>
<p>A better alternative might be eating ice, since it takes a lot more energy to melt it than to raise the temperature of water by a few tens of degrees but that sounds like torture (and ice burns all over your esophagus, probably?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, is it more likely that your body will go out of its way to generate more heat, or that it will just redirect blood flow to change the distribution of the heat it's already generating anyway? Kind of like how it first responds to cold temperatures - closing off blood flow to extremities just to preserve heat, rather than going out of its way to &quot;turn up&quot; heat production.</p>
<p>There's a kind of &quot;Occam's Razor&quot; I apply when thinking about how my body works. Basically, we're the product of billions of years of the most efficient blueprint winning out. Which means that in any given situation, we'll generally be biologically predisposed to expending as little of our precious resources (whether calories, water, etc.) as possible. If your body can get away with <em>not</em> doing something that'll use up resources, then it won't do that thing.</p></div>		</li>
