			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a friend that works in Information at LLNL.  Does a lot of crypto kinds of projects/conferences.  He once offered me a job that &quot;involved monthly travel to Russia.  You'll met people, and they'll be very happy to see you...&quot;.  Apparently the applicant needed a computer science degree.</p>
<p>And no more information.</p>
<p>I wonder if this is how they background check for that job.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, in the back of my mind, I was thinking I'm a bit to nosy for that kind of job.  I'd want to know more than I needed too, which would likely be a problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When getting a security clearance, it's like /u/NinjaJediSmurf said, it doesn't matter if you've done illegal things in the past. What matters is that you aren't doing them now, and you aren't lying about your past history. Don't lie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, security clearance is more about whether or not a hostile agent could use something personal as leverage to blackmail or otherwise convince you to betray your government.  You don't necessarily have to be a perfect person to get a clearance, they just need to know you're not swimming in $2,000,000 in debt where one of them there evil Com-u-nists could come up and offer you a fat wad of cash to act against your country when you're in a position to actually do so.</p></div>		</li>
