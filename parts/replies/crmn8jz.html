			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here for this. While it only runs small electronics and other things in the car, it's still very clever engineering. As solar power technology advances I think we'll see more things like this implemented and able to do a whole lot more to make the car greener/energy-efficient. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sunlight at its most intense provides an power density of about 1 kW per m^2.  </p>
<p>Surface area of a large car is ~5m x 2m, for a total of 10m^2.</p>
<p>Perfectly efficient Solar Panels would produce 10kW at most at peak conditions.  More likely maximums in power conversion and efficiency would limit it to less than 4kW.  A 24kWh battery on a prius has a range of ~75mi I think. So lets call that 1 hour's worth of driving - so a power consumption rate of ~24kW, which your solar panels would extend by ~15%. </p>
<p>This is very likely not worth the cost <em>or</em> the extra weight and drag.  Putting Solar panels on a car makes as little sense as putting solar panels on a road surface.  There is little reason to carry it with you - the extra weight would probably be better utilized by increasing battery size, and leave the generation to stationary generators.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Solar chargeable portable batteries for around $20. The tiny panels wouldn't fully charge the internal <del>panel</del> <strong>battery</strong> in under a week but you can charge them all from a wall wart via Android style mini usb.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has been brought up many times, and it always ends in the phone getting too hot. Phones really don't like getting over 100F, and really shouldn't be getting hotter than 120F ever. But if they are sitting in the sun those suckers will get cookin, fast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure, it's not as sexy as Audi's offering, but my next car will probably be a Leaf.  (I drive a Versa now.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your comment: It is possible to set the A/C to automatic while you are absent. This means when the car sits in the sun the A/C is automaticly switched on and cools down the interior of the car - and the power the A/C needs is generated by the solar panels.</p></div>		</li>
