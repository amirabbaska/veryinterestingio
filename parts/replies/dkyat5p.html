			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only speak from personal experience, and that of many people I know but sleeping on a tatami mat with a futon forces you to sleep on your front or back. If you're not used to this, first few nights are going to suck, however, after a short adjustment period, I noticed it's some of the best sleep I've had in my life. In temples we were given really fat pillows filled with a grain of some sort, the aim was to create a dip for your head at a comfortable angle, and it would restrict movement beyond that. This was effectively a hard surface, once that dip was created with your hands, the grain wouldn't budge with your head. </p>
<p>I have massive neck pain sometimes, and it disappeared entirely, while I was in Japan. At one point it was suggested that I sleep without the pillow, to correct the spine position. It works, again, takes a bit of getting used to but it works. I'm hoping there is some research into this somewhere, and I'm gonna have a search, but Japan is no exception with sleeping on the floor or a hard surface. Much of the planet does it and survives just fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that what they use? buckwheat husks? We couldn't figure it out and there was no translation for the word the monks used according to google. The whole pillow made of the stuff is glorious for my neck. I miss it. I'm guessing you could made one yourself if you could get hold of a similar filling? I live in the countryside, might stop by the wheat farmer's place and ask for a bucket of their husks.</p></div>		</li>
