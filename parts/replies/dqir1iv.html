			<div class="markdown"><p>TAN (total acid number), is really only a problem with really, really, bad oils these days.  Typically, high TAN is caused by naphthenic acid in motor oils, which do form over time due to oxidation. However this process is extremely slow (read decades) in the low sulfur, low nitrogen base oils used by every reputable motor oil manufacturer these days.</p>
<p>There are still some services where higher sulfur and nitrogen are acceptable, and even desirable due to certain other qualities it gives the oil, so they are still manufactured in vast quantities.  However, if you are buying motor oil, and you opt for any grade of oil above the absolute cheapest possible (read what jiffy lube and walmart will put in your car), TAN shouldn't be a problem in the 10,000 miles between oil changes.</p></div>		</li>
