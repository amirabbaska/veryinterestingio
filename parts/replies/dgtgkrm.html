<p>I think it was Biosphere 2 that exhibited the problems. The lack of stress from wind and such. Ahh. Yes. Here it is: <a href="http://awesci.com/the-role-of-wind-in-a-trees-life/" target="_blank">http://awesci.com/the-role-of-wind-in-a-trees-life/</a></p>
<p>It's also mentioned on the Wikipedia page for Biosphere 2. </p>
<p>Long and short, current theory is that without wind, the trees don't develop stress wood. Without stress wood, they cannot mature properly.</p></div>		</li>
