			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the last one that gets me. The first two he was still able to walk (albeit with crutches) so I can see him still being functional in the sack. The last one he was still able to talk but was in a wheelchair. He's always kept that sort of stuff heavily under wraps. There's a lot of possibilities though, the disease doesn't target the entire body at once so maybe he got really lucky and &quot;Little Stephen&quot; didn't get hit until later. Also it's possible to ejaculate without a full erection, so maybe a very patient wife could have made something work (even if it might have taken a hand job and turkey baster)... or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps you should let <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKPddDfk9AU&amp;t=13m10s" target="_blank">Jim Jefferies explain how his friend with muscular dystrophy gets an erection.</a>  </p>
<p>&quot;...can Dan get an erection? And the answer is yes. Even though none of the muscles in his body work, the cock is not a muscle, the cock is a bit of skin that fills with blood. If he gets aroused up here, blood will rush to there.&quot;  </p>
<p>This would be my best guess.</p></div>		</li>
