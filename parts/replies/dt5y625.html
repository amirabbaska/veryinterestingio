			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks like this is blowing up so I'll post a part two. The kids are the guys screaming into the phone. And their parents are on the other end of the line because they want to get in on this crazy stock that doubles each week. But the parents aren't allowed on school grounds. So the parent say &quot;buy me some. I'll pay you later&quot;. </p>
<p>And the kid is now a <strong>broker</strong> for their parents. </p>
<p>But the price keeps moving to the kid asks, what price are you willing to buy it at? And the parent (client) can say:</p>
<ul>
<li>place a <strong>limit order</strong> - I'll only pay up to $6.50 and if it moves past that before you can find a seller, cancel it</li>
<li>place a <strong>market order</strong> - I'll buy it at any price you can get it for over the next hour or so. </li>
<li>place a <strong>stop order</strong> - for some reason I only want to buy above a certain price. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way it used to work was there were floor traders who did the screaming and brokers in the gallery around and above the floor. The brokers had the phones and they were talking to the brokers back at the companies offices. So, you call your broker and you tell him what you want to do. Once he writes it down and you confirm it, he relays the information to the guy in the gallery. That guy doesn't need to know who you are or anything, just that you want to buy or sell a particular stock and the number of shares and the price. Now this guy gets the attention of the floor trader and he relays the info to him, by yelling and hand signals. The floor trader then starts yelling that he wants to buy stock X for price Y.  When someone else who want to sell stock X hears that the get together and try to figure out if their orders allow them to agree on a price. If they do, they record the trade and the price goes up on the ticker, so everyone can see what the latest trade was for all of the stock.</p>
<p>Now, that may seem pretty complex, with a lot of relaying of information, but remember back to the note before about <em>front running</em>? Front running is called that because maybe you are standing next to the trader when he gets the order to buy stock X and he is authorized to pay up to price Z. Well, then last trade on X was maybe a dollar lower, so armed with this information, you run ahead of the trader to the guy who last sold stock X and you ask him if he has any more to sell (remember not every one is buying and selling the same number of shares). He says he does so you buy all the rest at Z-1, and then you run back to the first guy and offer to sell it to him at Z. That is in the range so he makes the trade and you make a dollar per share with no risk and only holding the stock for about a minute. </p>
<p>So, to stop this from happening, they do that whole relay and scream thing, so everyone on the floor gets the information at the same time and they all know what deals are being made and no one can run ahead or make secret deals.</p>
<p>The don't really do it that way anymore, except in some places with commodities. It is much more efficient to do it all electronically, and keep an audit record, which is much more accurate than trying to keep track of the screaming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See my reply to the above comment. A <strong>future's</strong> is actually short for &quot;future(')s contract. It is a contract to buy the stock from the owner at a later date for a specific price. So if like you have stock and want to buy that comic book, but you think the price will go up in the future - but you're worried it might go down, maybe you're willing to make a pinky swear to sell it for $6 next week and get a little upside no matter what while the guy who buys it might be getting a great deal if it goes up even further. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most college courses simply expect that you have a rudimentary understanding; also college courses are often taught by people whose job is to do research and publish new information not artfully 'teach.'  The solution to this is to ask your prof for books that should be read before the class as a primer and to go to a college that has a rep as a 'teaching' college not a 'research' college. Also watch videos, lots of videos as a compliment to your instruction.</p>
<p>It's important to understand too that for every person like you sitting in a class totally lost not learning much there are just as many not getting anything out of the instruction because it's too basic.</p></div>		</li>
