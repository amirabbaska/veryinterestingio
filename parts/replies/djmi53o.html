			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently finished my social work masters where academically there is a lot of focus on attachment theory.</p>
<p>However, in practice, if the word 'attachment' is used in reports or in court etc everything we have said in the rest of the report is written off.</p>
<p>This shift away from attachment theory seems to be global in my field and less accepted as it has been in the past.</p>
<p>Have you found this to be true in your area of work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment is on point. At one time I had access to lots of academic journals and papers and I did a ton of reading about the transmission of anxiety from mother to child. I found it so interesting that learning about it became somewhat of a hobby for about year. It completely changed my thinking on parenting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that most people can <em>not</em> change their attachment style in adulthood, and that only a small minority had any success is becoming more &quot;securely attached&quot;. Could you please link me to some research that says otherwise? I've kinda dismissed the idea that I can do anything about this.</p></div>		</li>
