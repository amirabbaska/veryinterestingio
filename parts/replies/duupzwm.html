<p>Somewhere at the core of Jupiter is probably solid Hydrogen/Helium/whatever else is there right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know for sure, but I can tell you that Jupiter's bands of different colors are easily visible through a telescope, while Venus looks pretty much like a solid ball. The clouds of Venus are much more uniform than those of Jupiter, and I'm guessing early observers weren't even sure if they're clouds. You need some sophisticated instruments to say something about the weather of Venus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At one point it was thought Venus might be a tropical paradise. The dense clouds of sulphuric acid surrounding Venus make it impossible to view its surface from outside its atmosphere. It was only when radio mapping was developed in the 1960s that scientists were able to observe and measure the extreme temperatures and hostile environment. It is thought Venus did once have oceans but these evaporated as the planets temperature increased.</p>
<p>The Russians landed a series of spacecrafts on the surface of Venus in the 1960’s-1970’s. They didn’t last long however as the intense pressure, high heat, and acidic atmosphere rapidly destroyed them. I believe the longest lasting probe survived less than two hours after entry to the atmosphere. However, they did last long enough to get a few pictures.</p></div>		</li>

The only way it can work is if it convects really really deep so as the material rises it lags behind in rotation. So it has to be fluid deep into it.</p></div>		</li>

The first rocket that took humans to the moon and back had a simpler computer than your phone (much simpler, in fact).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: correction, I'm being told the OG gameboy is closer to twice as powerful as the lunar lander's computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that’s true, I think people tend to estimate how difficult a task is incorrectly. Sending a ship to the moon and back could theoretically be done with no computers and just hand calculations. Playing Angry Birds or watching YouTube videos on your phone is arguably more complicated (although far less is at stake if something goes wrong). </p>
<p>Like how juggling three knives would be a lot easier and less complicated than juggling thirty tennis balls. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not that bonkers if you realize at the same time there were thousands of people who observed the same phenomenon and had <em>incorrect</em> theories on why it is the way it is. When you look at things in hindsight, they seem more prescient than they are. After all, somebody correctly identifies winning lottery numbers before they are drawn--they must be geniuses!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to have such a big telescope. The Big Red Spot is visible by some not-too-expensive zoom lenses on ordinary cameras, and he was actually working on finding our the rotation period - all he had to notice was that some larger fronds of the bands are appearing 10 times while the BRS appears 9 times. And he was a pretty good observer, see his sketches <a href="https://www.itsokaytobesmart.com/post/86634597512/jupiter-red-spot-shrinking" target="_blank">here</a> (edit: added sketch url)</p></div>		</li>
