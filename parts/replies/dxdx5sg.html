			<div class="markdown"><p>The oil isn’t conductive either. There’s really only a couple of ways of causing harm. Be electrically conductive or acidic/basic. Mind you, this only applies to low voltage/low current things like 5v/12v digital electronics. Do not try it with mains power. </p></div>		</li>

<p>My favorite demonstration of deionized water used as an electrical insulator is in the <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/z-machine/about_z/how-z-works.html" target="_blank">Z-machine</a>.</p>

<p>The cables, some insulated by water and some by oil, are each as big around as a Volkswagen Beetle and 30-feet long.</p>
