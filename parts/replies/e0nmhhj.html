			<div class="markdown"><p>What speed does a rocket reach to get itself into orbit?  You seem to know numbers and I've always wondered that. I know things move pretty quick in space to stay in sync with Earth orbit... So how fast does a rocket have to go to get into space before releasing a satellite?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Layman here with only a little knowledge, so I cant give hard numbers and will assume a really good scenerio. Assuming you had a hose thats strong enough and that wont burn from the obscene heat of the rockets...</p>
<p>Liquid oxygens tricky enough to keep liquid inside the rocket, let alone insulated well enough for hundreds of thousands of feet (Remember, rockets dont go up, they go sideways) worth of hosing and constantly traveling through the obscenely hot exhaust.</p>
<p>You also need to transfer an obscene amount of fuel and liquid oxygen. The Saturn V rocket used 15 <em>tons</em> of fuel per hour. Thats insane, we all exclaim! Except it wasnt per hour, its per second. Those are going to be some big hoses</p>
<p>Also the best case scenario is that youre still carrying all the fuel in the hoes anyways, plus the hoses would likely be many hundreds or even thousands of times heavier than the weight of the rocket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a concept called asparagus staging, where you carry disposable fuel tanks. It looks like a conventional rocket with first stage boosters, except the boosters don't have engines themselves and instead feed their fuel to the main engine before getting jetissoned. After they're all used up and discarded, the engine switches to its main fuel tank directly above it. This significantly increases rocket efficiency, and also the fact you have only one big engine instead three, five, or even seven smaller ones.</p>
<p>The reason it's not used is exactly because of fuel lines - which are basically a pump with a hose - and how you have to handle them in flight. The largest issue is properly cutting the line. It's hard enough when the rocket is on the launchpad held steady by clamps, and doing that mid flight with all the vibrations acting on the vehicle is very challenging and not really safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation, just one small adjustment. The conversion of the orbital speed from km/s to km/h and mph got a zero too much added. It is 27,000 km/h and I always remember it with an ISS orbit is approximatly 90 minutes (1.5 hours) and the earth is approximately 40,000 km in circumference. 40,000 km / 1.5 h is my sanity check. Have a nice day. :)</p>
<p>Edit: circonferance not diameter. Need more sanity checks. :) </p></div>		</li>
