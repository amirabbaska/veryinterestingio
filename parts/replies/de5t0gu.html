			<div class="markdown"><p>I got stuck as the caretaker of a cat (roomate left it) who got pregnant and had a litter of six, she was a mean and terrible cat but I raised her children from Day One and they are amazing. I kept them all together for 8-9 weeks, found most of them homes, and surrendered the mother to the SPCA. Eventually it was just me and my girlfriend living with three of the kittens who were all very close until they were about 10 months old and she moved out with one of them. About six months later the one cat had to move back in with me and chaos ensued between all three cats! Even the two who always lived together would fight and everyone had to be separated. Adding a new/familiar/biologically similar scent to the house just messed up everything. That was about two years ago and they're all wonderful now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How did you manage to broker peace between them? I've got two cats, but one of them lives at my parents' house because my mom stole her (I guess she's my mom's cat now). Whenever I go home for the holidays we have to keep them separated because the original cat (who is about a third the size of my cat) has hated her new &quot;brother&quot; since he was a kitten. She lays in wait outside my bedroom door every time I go home with him, then wakes everyone up in the middle of the night by yowling at the closed door. When I crack the door open she starts swiping and hissing at me. She's also done that to one of our dogs (the dogs get along with both cats) when he looked at her after one of these outbursts. Just wondering if this is a forever thing, or if one day they'll be cute little buddies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Buddy and I adopted siblings a week apart. When we introduced them again it was kitten war. They are cool now but it took several meetings</p></div>		</li>
