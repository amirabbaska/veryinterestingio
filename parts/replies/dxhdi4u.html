			<div class="markdown"><p>Definite similarities. I play a few instruments and go automatic on songs I know well, mostly read music though. For me the music is visual symbols I have memorized and songs are verbal symbols with which I have done likewise. Something about the whole body movement taking a life of its own took me by surprise, really seems to be the same process though.</p></div>		</li>
