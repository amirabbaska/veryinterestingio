			<div class="markdown"><p>If you start from a single proton and try to build your way up to Oxygen one nucleon at a time, an absolutely <em>huge</em> number. Most would just be completely wasted. Frankly, I don't even think we have the technology to pull this off at all with any degree of reliability.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNO_cycle" target="_blank">CNO cycle</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process" target="_blank">Triple-Alpha process</a> could be used to produce Oxygen, but we aren't able to produce sufficient pressure to really reproduce these processes, either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Total layman here. Would it possible to charge a neutron already set in the cluster into a proton, avoiding the whole &quot;throw em at each other and hope for the best&quot; method? </p>
<p>Or would this cause things to go horribly wrong Fallout style?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you describe is beta decay. Basically a neutron decays into a proton and shoots off an electron and an antineutrino. This only happens in neutron rich isotopes of heavier elements you would have had to produce before.</p></div>		</li>
