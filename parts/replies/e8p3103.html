			<div class="markdown"><p>There are certainly merits to being conservative about including things. One could argue that it's better to exclude too many things than include things that aren't properly understood because the latter risks pathologizing and stigmatizing behaviours that may in fact be within the healthy sphere of human behaviours. A good question to ask yourself when thinking about this issue is &quot;If a diagnosis of psychopathy existed, how many people would it help get treatment who currently do not have access to it?&quot; If the answer is &quot;not many&quot;, then what is the reason for having the diagnostic label?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate the benefits of being conservative in creating new disorders. Yet I question the utilitarian approach of tossing behaviours that cannot be treated. I would posit that behaviour that exceeds the healthy sphere of human behaviour should be included, whether a credible treatment exists or not. Yes, some disorders are probably too nebulous to be clearly demarcated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's try it from another angle.  If a diagnosis of psychopathy existed, how many people regarded as untreatable (because of the conflation of ASPD with psychopathy) would receive beneficial treatment (because ASPD has a much better prognosis--on balance, since there is no broadly applicable treatment plan). </p>
<p>The absence of the diagnosis is beneficial to psychopaths, but unhelpful to the vast majority of people diagnosed with ASPD who are not, in fact, psychopathic.</p>
<p>Most people hear &quot;antisocial personality disorder&quot; and think &quot;psychopath,&quot; in the Cleckleyan sense.  And respond accordingly.  But ASPD is pretty far removed from Cleckley.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the aspect of helping people, however you might quantify that, we also use psychological conditions to decide if someone is safe to be around other people, no? That while they have to the to life and certain freedoms, we are obligated to keep them away from other people. </p>
<p>If someone were to be clinically diagnosed as a psychopath (however that process might look), should they still be able to buy an automatic weapon? Lead a major company? Run for government? Be a doctor? There are already plenty of restrictions we make like this for other diagnoses, I don't see how there's much difference...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it though?  What about patients facing sentencing?  ASPD is treated as functionally identical to psychopathy by the courts, but are not the same thing.  The former has a far better prognosis with treatment, lower recidivism, much lower violent recidivism, etc..</p>
<p>The conflation of ASPD with psychopathy has netted more than one irrationally long sentence or denied parole hearing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your response. That is definitely a valid point. I feel that this is an issue with legislation and legal implementation of psychology. I imagine it is an artifact of a lack of education on behalf of law makers and I wonder what steps, if any, could be taken to correct the discrepancy and mistreatment aside from reimplementation of psychopathy. I'm not sure there will ever be an answer. Homosexuality is still thought by some to be an illness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also think it best to leave subjective diagnostic criteria out of the DSM whenever possible, due to the massive influence confirmation bias can have on clinical psychologists. It's frightening how a easily a professional can &quot;fit&quot; a disorder onto someone based on loose criteria and gut feeling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there genuine controversy among psychologists about whether psychopathy should be included? Was it really just &quot;his feeling that it was not measurable&quot; or are there some deeper arguments? Do we really not have a reliable test for empathy?</p>
<p>I always figured that psychologists look down upon the pop culture idea of psychopaths while &quot;Antisocial Personality Disorder&quot; is the &quot;proper&quot;, deeper definition (I also figured that it also includes a lack of empathy?). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some controversy over psychopathy, mostly because it's so rare. Its prevalence rate is less than 1% of the population, so you have to think about how difficult it is to find individuals to study it. I think most agree now that there is a syndrome based on what's termed callous, unemotional traits, but some think that because it's so rare, it's meaningless to create a separate category for it.</p>
<p>Regarding the reliability for empathy, you have to remember that 30+ years ago when these decisions were made, our thinking about many of these disorders was nowhere near what it is now. I'm sure if the DSM was being recreated today, the categories would look different. Personally, I believe we can measure empathy accurately enough to include it as a criterion, but it's difficult to shift gears now for several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>The DSM is revised by the American Psychiatric Association, whose committees consist of many old school psychiatrists that support the original classifications and wouldn't push for change.</li>
<li>Even if the board decided to overhaul everything completely, what would you replace it with? Introducing new categories that haven't been evaluated in research properly risks creating epidemics of overdiagnoses of disorders because the criteria are too liberal, resulting in stigma and shame toward symptoms that weren't pathologized before. Change has to be gradual and well established in research before implementing it in practice.</li>
<li>Even if the DSM committee creates a change, it's a different ball game to get front line clinicians to use it as directed. For example, the DSM-5 came out in 2013. Here in Canada, most jurisdictions didn't start officially using it until 2014-2015 or so because it takes forever to train and have whole clinics shift their practice to match the changes. Can you imagine the difficulty of disseminating a completely overhauled DSM with multiple new categories or removed categories?</li>

<p>Somehow that 1% figure doesn't seem very outlandish. Aren't there other conditions this rare? What about schizophrenia? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1% seems super common. I mean that puts it at what 1.2m adults in the US? Major cities would have thousands of psychopaths. </p>
<p>That seems like it should be easy to find and study, not hard. Other sciences would be thrilled to have something so common. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a controversy if psychopathy is really THAT rare because most psychopaths are diagnosed while they sit in Jail, while on the outside they go largely unnoticed. To be honest: its also pretty easy to get diagnosed in Jail. Functional Psychopath on the other hand never even try to get help by psychologists. Why should they? The mix of NPD and the non-existence of complex feelings lead to two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>They don't feel misery or sadness. They don't feel the need to get help.</li>
<li>NPD is very often a part of being a psychopath. Why should someone try to get help from someone he isn't able to respect in any way? They think you are subhuman and useless. Why should they ask you for help?</li>
</ol>
<p>I personally think the ASPD concept is indeed much better then using &quot;Psychopath&quot; or &quot;Sociopath&quot;. There are so many mixed definitions of what is being necessary to be considered a &quot;Psychopath&quot; that this terms have been rendered useless. Especially when used in public.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm less than a year out from earning my doctorate in clinical psychology. Personally, idk the history of the DSM creation too well or the arguments used, but I can say that I've never heard of any controversy today about the diagnosis (there is about damn in general though).
I wouldn't say we &quot;look down&quot; on the idea of a psychopath, but we do acknowledge that it isn't a clinical term. Sociopath is another term that isn't clinical, but it is instead a legal term. Antisocial Personality Disorder is the proper term for these people. Part of ASPD is a lack of empathy and criminal behavior. But contrary to what OP seems to think, you can display criminal behavior and be a functioning member of society in that you're just a criminal who hasn't been caught yet. I've worked with a lot of ASPD because I work in a correctional setting. They absolutely have a (sometimes overwhelmingly so) lack of empathy. But no, there aren't really any tests strickly for empathy. We have personality tests that can give us insights into that realm of a person's personality. </p>
<p>Sorry if this reads a but rambly, I'm tired and about to fall asleep. Hope it was helpful though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that, technically speaking, people witih ASPD behaviorally learn to lack empathy - by growing up in a chaotic, dangerous environment, or through trauma and abuse, etc., whereas psychopaths are born or have a genetic disposition to just plain lack it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trainee forensic psych here. There is actually a fair amount of controversy as to whether psychopathy/sociopath really exists in a way that distinguishes it from other personality disorders. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It's not really possible to truly lack all empathy in a clinical sense, barring a severe developmental disorder like profound autism. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's a common misconception that criminals simply lack empathy - their reasons for committing crimes are much more nuanced than that, and there's no point in oversimplifying things. </p>
</li>
<li>There is also the fact that it's considered unhelpful in terms of treatment - it's the sort of diagnosis that implies there can be no improvement, which is generally avoided in psychology.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, Hare, the guy who made &quot;the psychopath test&quot; (the pcl-r, not the book) is somewhat unpopular due to his monetisation of testing materials and his eagerness to block papers that criticise his checklist. I've also heard grumbling that he's only pushing for psychopathy to be included in the DSM so he can make more money from his test.</p>
<p>So there are a few reasons why psychopathy as a diagnosis isn't really used or wanted, at least in the forensic sector. </p></div>		</li>
