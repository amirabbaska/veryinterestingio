			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting thing to note is that it seems some moons can have rings around them. Saturn's moon Rhea may have a tenuous ring system, for example. So it's possible for moons to have some form of debris in their orbit, even if it isn't necessarily an entire moon per se.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. Rings can be stable at a much lower orbital height than a moon, simply because if a moon is low enough it becomes rings...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're looking for a general formulation, maybe something like: &quot;Given a hierarchy composed of distinct bodies in three-dimensional space, where each member's orbit is primarily dependent on the gravitational field of the member to which it is directly and immediately subordinate, what is the theoretical upper limit of the depth of the hierarchy?&quot;</p>
<p>Though with such a general formulation I suspect the answer might be, &quot;There is none.&quot; After all, our spacecraft have orbited our own moon. Do spacecraft count as members of the hierarchy? Could we orbit a speck of matter around the spacecraft? At some scale we might get &quot;too small&quot; but is there any reason we couldn't just expand the other end of the scale - orbit the entire hierarchy around something appropriately more massive than whatever's currently at the top?</p>
<p>Speculation is fun but I don't have the background to answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but assuming the things being orbited around become lighter as it progresses, and also that the orbital distances become correspondingly smaller, then the problem becomes that objects higher up in the chain start to exert relatively more force.  </p>
<p>For example, earth orbits sun; moon orbits earth - the sun has a small effect on the moon; satellite orbits moon - the earth's gravity will affect that satellite relatively more; smaller satellite orbits the moon-satellite - now the moon's gravity probably affects this smaller orbiter much much more than the body it is orbiting, and so on.</p></div>		</li>
