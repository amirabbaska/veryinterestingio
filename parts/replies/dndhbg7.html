			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely don't think this is pure confirmation bias though. It depends on how much sleep I am getting, and has changed throughout my life, but I'm pretty sure it is a matter of internal clock mostly.</p>
<p>For certain periods in the past, I've experienced this effect pretty much every time I used an alarm. In fact, for a time I actually stopped using an alarm, and simply thought about the time I needed to wake up when I was laying down to sleep. That worked perfectly for about a week before I stayed up too late one night and I unconsciously made an executive decision not to wake up in the morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you could do is set up a video camera to watch you sleep and every day review it at high speed to see when you check your alarm and when you wake up.</p>
<p>Then chart that against your alarm time and see how many minutes before your alarm goes off you wake up each day. </p>
<p>Then you have more reliable data that disproves the confirmation bias hypothesis, at least in your instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other commenter said, you should record this and show evidence, both for us and yourself. It's extremely likely you're tricking yourself into thinking you were already awake when the alarm goes off.</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, there was a similar thread asking how people know when they're being watched. There were dozens of comments to the effect of, &quot;No, this happens to me all the time. Even when I had no way of knowing someone was staring at me until I turned around.&quot; Confirmation bias is so powerful that it literally convinces people they have ESP.</p>
<p>On the upside, if you do create good evidence to show that your body naturally and reliably &quot;tracks time&quot; and wakes you up before you know your alarm is about to go off (at varying times), you would literally expand human knowledge of the brain in a big way (unless this phenomenon has already been observed and recorded, which doesn't seem like it's the case). Worst case, you're wrong and identify your own bias, which is always a good thing. </p>
<p>The other possibility is that you have sleep issues and either wake up frequently throughout the night and only remember the time when you are interrupted by your alarm interrupts you before you fall back asleep. Our brains don't always bother to store long-term memories of short wake periods during sleep, such as when you get up to go to the bathroom. However, if something unusual happened to you while you were in the bathroom, you would certainly remember the whole experience.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing poor sleep quality, please look into having a sleep study done on yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>+1 on being able to think about what time to wake up. Though with me it's more like if I have to get up in 8 hours I'll wake up after 4, then 2, then 1, 30, etc. I don't decide to wake up that often but it's always exactly half the remaining time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad somebody already said this. I imagine much of it is to do with a type of confirmation bias. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, pending any actual studies that seems like the most likely answer.</p>
<p>They wake up on a continuum of time (say a half hour before to when their alarm goes off) and only note the times when they woke up just moments before their alarm went off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so....I don't think I do it often, but I absolutely do it.  Op isn't saying it happens often, he's wondering why it happens when it does.  In addition, I'll nap on the subway, and -very- often wake up at my stop.  Even if I'm going somewhere new.  And I no I'm asleep because I have no memory of the intervening 10 stops, and sometimes I jolt awake and it takes me a second to realize where I am.  I always make it out the doors, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would suggest that you do partially wake at each stop, but quickly go back to sleep when you know it is not your stop. When it is your stop you fully wake with no memory of the other stops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is that memory formation doesn't quite work in the way 100% reliable way you seem to think it does. Consider that maybe you did <em>subconsciously</em> notice the intervening stops but it's just that your subconscious mind didn't consider them important enough to wake your conscious mind and no memories are formed. Once you arrive at &quot;your stop&quot; the subconcious jolts you awake and the lack of intervening memories leads to an illusion that you always magically wake at the perfect moment. This whole question ultimately revolves around how memories are formed and not so much around circadian clocks.</p></div>		</li>
