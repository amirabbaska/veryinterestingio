			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a little and answer the original question, in Mr Robot they show some famous ways of hacking, like leaving a usb stick in a parking lot but most of the time in the show, the work implies creating programs and then execute them near some critical unguarded machine. Some other clever hacks involve web sites disguised as harmless pages that might help the hacker.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Never put that shit (or a USB) into your computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they commonly display kali linux which is a popular pen tool as well as common command line expression</p>
<p>fairly legitimate examples of hacking with existing scrips built.  the stuff they are hacking and the access they get is what makes it somewhat unreasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I liked the scene where they mention stagefright. Sure it's unnecessary to give vulnerabilities names, but it sounds way cooler than &quot;your phone was vulnerable to CVE-2015-3864&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to mention Mr. Robot. It’s definitely dramatized, but it’s the closest to anything I’ve seen. At least they didn’t try to come up with some dramatic visual to put on the screen. They aren’t throwing around made up words to make it sound intense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed! Time wise, things would happen at a much slower pace. Some actions or situations are sped way up. But the directors and producers pride on making sure every piece of code or line you see is real and functional. Kudos to them on that. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here for this. I'm not even a programmer, but I work with programmers and devs every day in my job and I know enough code to have been happily surprised at how much more realistic the Mr. Robot scenes are, even if they're also a bit silly. At least the screens are real and they're showing how boring CLI actually is, compared to Visual Basic GUIs, which can do anything.</p></div>		</li>
