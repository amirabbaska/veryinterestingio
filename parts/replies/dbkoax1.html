			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually both physical and psychological. Your body adapts to a change in homeostasis by compensating (physical). Environmental cues of  that occur, such as the setting where a drug addict shoots up, can cause the body to anticipate these changes and be more effective at maintaining homeostasis (psychological/physical). </p>
<p>This is also why it's important for recovering drug users to remove themselves from their usual atmosphere: their withdrawal symptoms are less intense when placed in a facility. By reducing environmental cues there's less drug tolerance built up (psychological) to morphine administration. I can try and find sources in the morning but I don't have my textbook for the specific ones here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is by FAR the only good answer I've seen on here. OP, read this one and ignore all the other handwaving! Your question is a medical one, not philosophical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top answer that's gilded is pretty medical. Homeostasis is basic physiology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Homeostasis is basic and real, but what the (current) top answer says about it vis-a-vis tolerance is too vague to really clarify anything — it pretty much just uses “homeostasis” as a magic word, after the first paragraph.</p>
<p>E.g. here's a very basic but important distinction that it doesn't address: does “homeostasis adjusts” mean that the body gets more efficient at bringing down alcohol levels (or whatever), or that the body accepts a higher alcohol level as the new normal? That's two <em>totally different</em> things that “homeostasis adjusts” could mean, but nothing in that answer makes it clear which is going on.</p>
<p>Besides that, at least one of its facts is completely wrong (the claim that safer cars haven't reduced fatal accidents — they have, hugely!) which makes me a bit less trusting of the rest of its facts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but we can do better than a vague mention of homeostasis followed by a handwavy monologue of mostly wrong bullshit. I'm also alarmed by the number of people on here defending their own personal brand of alcoholism as an answer to the question. OP deserves a medical answer with technical details!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, though functional tolerance (the brain's adaptations to function in the presence of greater amounts of alcohol) plays a larger role than metabolic tolerance (the liver adapting to break down ethanol more quickly). You occasionally hear about somebody being pulled over with a BAC of .45, a number that would leave most people unconscious -- alcoholics develop functional tolerance to the effects of alcohol and feel subjectively less drunk than non-alcoholics with the same BAC. Metabolic tolerance also increases but reaches its maximal effect relatively quickly.</p></div>		</li>
