			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of &quot;almost&quot; answers, but non exact.</p>
<p>The point is that:</p>
<p>(a) the actual explosion, when it starts in the star's core, takes some time to reach the star's surface.</p>
<p>(b) neutrinos go through matter with almost no interaction.</p>
<p>(c) photons do interact with (are stopped by) matter quite easily.</p>
<p>So the explosion starts at the core, emitting both photons and neutrino. Neutrinos go through the star and just keep on going, while the photons are absorbed (&quot;stopped&quot;) by all the &quot;star matter&quot; around it.</p>
<p>Only once the explosion reaches the edge of the star (maybe hours later) do the created photons start to actually travel uninterrupted towards... everywhere, including earth.</p>
<p>So we can detect the neutrinoes that were emitted by the core explotion and then have enough time to point our telescopes to see the photons emitted by the explotion reaching the edge of the star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrino are affected by gravitationnal lensing just like photons. You can't get any less weight than weightless...</p>
<p>Light is slowed down by the very dense matter of the supernova, and not the neutrino, but this has nothing to do with gravitationnal lensing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only should it appear to happen faster, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueshift" target="_blank">its colour would change as well</a>, although I suppose in this case a supernova probably gives off enough light all over the spectrum it would still look white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like that scene from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, where Sulu and the Excelsior go through  the shockwave from Praxis?</p>
<p>I think so, sort of - the neutrinos arrive first because they don't interact with anything. The xrays and visible photons take longer not because the travel slower (sorry, /u/Aqua-Tech, no magic advanced technology there), but because they are generated at the very beginning of the supernova, as the core collapses, and immediately radiate without being slowed by the outer layers of the star (they react with almost nothing). The shockwave generated from the first core collapse take some time to reach the surface (on the order of a couple hours, see SN 1987A), where it emits photons (xrays, gamma rays, visible light) that travel to Earth.</p>
<p>So, it's 1980, we take off on our relativistic space ship pointing towards the Large Magellanic Cloud. If we travel at .5c, we'll see the neutrinos about 4ish years Earth time later, or about 3.5 years ship time due to time dilation (and please, don't tell me how you managed to accelerate a neutrino detector to .5c, I don't want to know (the small ones weigh a million kg)). </p>
<p>Now, the question is what happens in those next two hours of Earth time... and I don't rightly know. I <em>think</em> you could get away with using the same time dilation ratio, getting about 1.73 hours from the neutrino signals to the first xray signals. This makes sense, because while the local frame of reference is c for both neutrinos and xrays, the time dilation will still contact the distance needed to travel for the two particle sources (similar to the Newtonian approach of two trains traveling towards one another). But I frankly don't have strong enough SR math skills to evaluate that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, you would witness it at ~3.6 times the speed.  The time dilation would make it slower by a factor of ~1/2, but the Doppler effect makes it faster by a factor of 1/(1-beta) ~7.1</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your experience of time is a result of chemical processes in your brain. You will therefore always experience time passing at the same rate. The star's explosion will appear sped up.</p>
<p>Differences in time can only ever be measured relative to somewhere else, there's no preferred reference frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would perceive it at twice the speed if you were traveling perpendicular to the star.  Due entirely to time dilation from the speed you are traveling.</p>
<p>If you were traveling towards the star, the two effects would add and you would witness it even faster, twice as fast due to time dilation and 86% faster on top of that due to your speed towards the event.</p></div>		</li>
