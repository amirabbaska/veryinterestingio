			<div class="markdown"><p>For clarification of those who may be reading this, I believe that transcription / translation are in the range of 1 in every 10^9 replications being a mismatch, which is usually quickly fixed by the cell. So... uhhhhh, yeah, that is a F***load of mutations that are possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. So does this mutation rate still make it ok to use retrovirus (or lentivirus for that matter) as vector for gene delivery, even though there's a small chance that the transgene will harbor some mutation upon reverse transcription? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In cell culture this works just fine. You take a dish with tons of cells, use a retroviral vector to deliver a gene to the cells, then select the ones that have the gene stably integrated. In this case, you are able to choose the events where RT didn't mess up or integrase didn't put the gene product in a bad place.
One of the main issues with retrovirus gene delivery in humans is that integrase will incorporate the viral genome randomly into the host genome. We don't know where it will integrate and can't foresee the negative effects (which there can be some, such as cancerous transformations). That's part of the reason why CRISPR is so exciting because the Cas9 protein can be essentially told where to integrate the nucleotide sequence. If genome manipulation is in the future for humans then it will be with CRISPR (or another novel protein) and not retrovirus vectors. </p></div>		</li>
