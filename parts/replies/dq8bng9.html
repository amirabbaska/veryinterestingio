			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work on a loading bay near a really huge refrigerated warehouse which used ammonia as a refrigerating agent - we once had a fairly large leak (it was pouring out of a pipe like a smoke machine) and had to keep working after it had mostly dispersed.</p>
<p>I can see why it might work the way you describe, that stuff was horrendous even after leaving it. Holding your breath only did so much because it would irritate the absolute shit out of your eyes and nostrils even if you weren't breathing through them.</p>
<p>Thankfully we only had to deal with that once!</p>
<p>Edit: Apparently this was mega dangerous and I'm lucky to be alive, thankfully I don't work there any more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I work at a curling club around two ammonia-based ice plants and the detection threshold for setting the alarm off and evacuating is really, really low. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. We had to hold product back at the end of the packing area for about half an hour, if memory serves, but it had to keep moving as quickly as possible because the stuff we were working on needed to hit the freezers ASAP. It wasn't that bad at the end of the day, but looking back it's odd the alarms didn't go off...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually relatively safe compared to other refrigerants because the threshhold of detection (odour, 5ppm) is much less than the allowable exposure limit (25ppm for 8 hours). Compared to other refrigerants that can poison you well below the detection threshhold, it's way, way safer. </p>
<p>Source: my dad worked at one of the largest refrigeration companies in Canada as one of the highest level techs. Always said that the danger of ammonia is overstated in comparison to other refrigerants. He did still have to keep clean-shaven in order to properly seal a gas mask in the event of a big leak. In his later years he was a health and safety guy for the company. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad used to work as an industrial refrigeration maintenance guy, the plant he worked at had just fucking enormous quantities of ammonia, like if it all gets out at once it could kill people outside the plant levels of ammonia. They had a comparatively minor leak at one point, IIRC no hospitalizations needed, but he said it was completely terrifying to be breathing it in and to know he had to get out or he could die. From what he said they didn't train people well, they have wind socks visible outside that are supposed to indicate which way you should run (upwind, away from the ammonia) and it was just chaos, everyone running everywhere. </p>
<p>Shit's scary, stay safe and always have an escape plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ammonia is NASTY stuff. I worked on a fishing boat that used ammonia freezers and during shipyard I had to climb up and pour some that had been mixed with water into a special receptacle. As I was pouring I took a quick wiff and it was strong. Then I took one more slightly longer wiff and I nearly passed out and fell backwards off the receptacle. It burned my nostrils. I also got a tiny tiny drop on my arm and it burned like hell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't already...the first thing to try is making sure you are lying down, possibly even with feet slightly elevated. It helps. If the tech gives you a hard time for wanting to be lying down for a &quot;tiny needle&quot; (especially a problem if you happen to be a big dude), ignore them. Or report them to their supervisor, because they're terrible at their job. </p>
<p>Make sure you're well hydrated when you get there, and aren't heading into low blood sugar (also both contributing factors).</p>
<p>Also, this reaction is partially a learned one. If you can set yourself up for success and manage to get through a couple shots without passing out, it'll become easier to do in the future because it breaks the (self fulfilling) expectation that &quot;oh, guess I'm going to pass out now&quot;.</p>
<p>(And if no doctor has ever mentioned, the medical term for this is &quot;vasovagal syncope&quot;; possibly helpful if you want to look up more)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My syncope is so bad that I pass out TALKING about the things that freak me out. When I was in middle school I passed out in health class because we were talking about getting HIV from used needles and people started telling stories about blood draws going wrong, like needles coming out of people's arms while they're getting a blood draw. I tried to raise my hand to tell the teacher and I fell out of my seat as I passed out and hit my head on the floor so hard that I bit off the tip of my tongue. I also passed out at my boyfriend's doctor appointment this summer because he was talking about blood in his stool and Jesus Christ bleeding assholes are not good imagery to keep me from passing out. That appointment is where I found out, after about 15 years of it happening, what my condition was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also helps to cross your legs above the knee and squeeze your thighs together tightly. That will help prevent your blood from rushing to your feet. I have pretty severe vasovagal syncope and, along with everything u/tarlton said,  it helps a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all a balancing act. If you're like me, then you're getting hit with syncope due to the stress of the injection, and essentially your body is vasodialating itself. I'm unsure if ammonia would actually do anything in this case, because (as it was explained by my cardiologist) your fainting is caused by your blood pressure dropping and your blood essentially pooling downwards. Just increasing heart rate and respiration in this case I don't think would do it, but laying flat, with your head and heart on the same plane should do it.</p>
<p>P. S. If anyone with more medical knowledge sees anything really incorrect here, let me know. Like I said, just doing my best to parrot what my own Doc told me years ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why another great trick to prevent it is to tense the muscles in your legs as much ad you can. It not only prevents blood from pooling in the legs, but also increases blood pressure and can even elevate the heart rate if it's done for a while, because it's like doing a bit of exercise, after all... </p></div>		</li>

They had me put my head between my legs as I was sitting in a chair and it has NEVER kept me from losing consciousness; I think they just had me do it so that when I did lose consciousness I wouldn't topple headfirst out of the chair. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It only works temporarily. If your body is still experiencing the conditions that led to fainting, smelling salts will become less effective. It can't keep you awake. If you're just 'tired', you weren't really fainting.</p>
<p>Not to mention that the adrenaline rush stimulated by the salts is going to wear down your body.</p>
<p>From your description, sounds like you've tried ammonia salts! So have I. 17 years ago. I still remember the feeling clearly.</p></div>		</li>
