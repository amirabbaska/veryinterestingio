			<div class="markdown"><p>Your definition of time works fine for everyday use. However, once objects start moving at very high speeds or experiencing very high gravity, unintuitive things start to happen.</p>
<p>Suppose one person is standing still and another person is flying through space very fast, close to the speed of light. Both people watch a piece of C4 explode, and they use a stopwatch to measure how long the explosion lasts. If they meet up later and compare their results, the times will be different. One person will say the explosion took longer than the other guy. This phenomenon is known as time dilation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the results may match depending on the frame of the C4.  Maybe it would have been better stated that the C4 was on the ground with one observer and the other observer was on an approaching ship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a kind of physical realm. In fact, &quot;future and past&quot; are, in most ways, just like &quot;up and down&quot; or &quot;left and right&quot;. </p>
<p>If you were driving down a highway, seeing mile markers pass you, you could imagine those mile markers being the ticks of a clock. As long as everyone is driving down the same road at the same speed, this mile-marker-clock would be indistinguishable from a clock that measures time. You could use it to measure intervals between events. </p>
<p>We (on Earth, at least) are all traveling into the future at almost exactly one second per second, so we can use that as a reference for all sorts of things. But just like someone on the highway can speed up or slow down, or turn off onto an onramp and pass the mile markers at a different rate, so too can objects in the real world make &quot;turns&quot; in spacetime, and pass through time at different rates. (That's actually all acceleration is!) Or you can take a more curvy road than someone else, and more mile markers will have passed for you before you both reach the same destination (that's analogous to gravity). It requires speeds near the speed of light before it becomes obvious in the real world, so we don't see it in our day to day lives, but it's relevant all the time in electronics, with satellites, with the orbits of planets... etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is a recorded time. Imagine 2 identical clocks. One stationary and other zooms past the stationary clock. Both clocks are were started at same time and both clocks are valid. But a phenomenon occurs when the moving clock feels/reads less time than the stationaryâ€‹ clock. Since both clocks are identical and work there needs to be some explanation. There wrap around that</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The definition of &quot;same time&quot; is relative.  In order to &quot;start clocks at the same time&quot;, the clocks must have zero velocity relative to each other at the moment of starting.   And so, to set up your scenario where they have non-zero relative velocity, one of the clocks must accelerate, which renders the thought experiment invalid.</p>
<p>Another problem with your scenario is that there is no absolute state of &quot;moving&quot; or &quot;stationary&quot;. There is only relative velocity. It is not possible to single out one of the clocks as &quot;moving&quot; and the other &quot;stationary&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how do we know that the moving clock reads slower because the movement adds mass, therefore making it harder to move, so it reads slower; But the actual time doesn't alter, it's just the mass that records time moves slower?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>mass only comes into play in acceleration. v is d/t (very idealized which is later added upon to include more complicated things). Special Relativity came out of Failling Newton physics (Inertial Frames) and dealing with the speed of light. Idk about mass recording the time but yeah one clock reads slower and both readings are valid</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While more massive clock-hands might slow down a physical clock, every observed process starts moving slower, from the POV of a stationary observer, in an identical fashion. </p>
<p>Greater mass, alone, would not have an exactly identical effect on everything: clocks, heartbeats, atomic decay, etc.</p></div>		</li>
