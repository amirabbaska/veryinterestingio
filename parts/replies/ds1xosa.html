			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for not explaining properly. It is done by the chemical reaction between the skin and two active ingredients. Pain is normally sent from the muscles through surrounding nerve receptors and nerve fibers. Sensations of hot and cold also travel through nerve fibers to the brain for response. However in some products the effect of cooling is done through evaporation of ethanol on the skin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Im assuming u/uwwstudent wants the actual chemistry not just how ICY hots themselves work. The icy part is easy, just menthol and the evaporation cools the skin like any alcohol based substance. The evaporating vapor carries heat off the skin. As for the heat, the gel or pad also contains a chemical that has an exothermic (heat releasing: if you arent familiar at all with how chemical reactions work you can think of it as the chemical is literally burning like firewood on your skin) reaction with the air. Same way one of those shakeable hand warmers work but they've found a way to put it in gel form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Menthol cools. It's what's in standard cough drops. Take some menthol, put in in water solution, it'll cool. The packs first cool you due to this process. I believe those packs don't contain any heating agent. Therefore the hot sensation you feel is actually just the rewarming of your now cooled skin and tissues. </p>
<p>You can show this to happen in a quick and fun experiment you can do at home:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get some ice water. Add salt for even more cold. Or if in north use snow!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stick entire hand into the cold ice water or whatever you chose. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave it there for a good few minutes. You won't get frost bite or anything but it'll get very uncomfortable. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go inside to a sink and turn on the cold water</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With your normal temp hand, feel the water. Now feel with your super cold hand. </p>
</li>
<li>Go to warm water. Feel with normal temp hand until it's a nice comfortable warm. Now feel with super cold hand. </li>
</ol>
<p>Done properly, the warm water, and possibly even the cold water will feel painfully hot. Like it should be burning you. But you won't get burned because it's not actually hot. This is how icy hot packs work: make you cold, then you feel hot in comparison while warming back up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Menthol just activates the receptors in the skin making it feel cold. As far as I know it doesn't actually make things colder like water by adding it to it. There may be some evaporation at play as well but the first part is the primary mechanism of action. Ice packs are an entirely different thing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. That’s interesting. Because heat packs and ice baths (from my understanding) can actually aid in healing. Icy hot is just imitating the sensations of those therapies while providing non of the benefits beyond pain relief. </p></div>		</li>
