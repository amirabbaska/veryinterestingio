			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed from your profile that you're in Australia. Australia is not like the US. Getting a credit card is not going to increase your credit score at all. We don't use credit scores. </p>
<p>I strongly encourage you to just not get one. It's not worth the hassle. Get a debit Mastercard instead, or debit visa. E.g. ING direct orange everyday. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to be honest.. and please don't judge. But let's take this example (that is real): </p>
<p>My friend and I wanted to do a 10 week yoga class that costed 260 bucks. When you think about it, it's not really that much ($26 per class). </p>
<p>BUT!
Being the person I am, I don't like the idea of spending 260 dollars all in one go, even though I have the money to pay it off (lol I know.. cue judgement) </p>
<p>So I thought, hey it'd be a great idea if I had a credit card to pay it NOW, but then subsidize that spend by transferring money from my savings every week to 1) help me with my weekly budget and 2) not make me feel like I'm binge spending...  </p>
<p>That's basically it.. that's what sparked my curiosity with credit card.. </p>
<p>But thanks! I always thought you needed to build credit profile to make home loans easier to be approved? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please, if you don't understand the benefits of a credit card then​ don't give out advice. </p>
<p>Credit cards have a lot of benefits other than building credit. E.g. they offer you certain customer protection services that you​ might not have with a debit card. Once I bought something from China for 100$ and it was not at all what was advertised to me. I ordered a charge back and received my money back without a problem. Without a cc the money would be gone. Also you will be able to collect points which might support you with buying Christmas presents. Generally it just offers huge convenience, especially during travelling. </p>
<p>Debit cards are a good alternative if you are not able to get a cc. But definitely more of a hassle as you have to load it with money on a regular basis I guess. You dont have this extra step with a cc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important thing to understand about all forms of credit, not just cards, is that credit is for cash flow, not income/expenses.</p>
<p>The difference is that cash flow is a temporary situation where the money you've earned or are very likely to earn hasn't come in to your possession yet. But if your income is less than your expenses, then no amount of loans are going to fix that situation. It will only start a vicious circle where you get temporary spending ability but add to your expenses later. If you have a plan to reduce your expenses, then it's better to execute it beforehand.</p>
<p>Case in point: my credit union offers holiday loans to help people shop for gifts. You'll get a loan in November or December and pay it back from January to June. But, they also have holiday <em>club</em> accounts where you deposit money from June to November and then take out the money in December. If you can afford to make the payments on the loan, then you could afford to make equal payments to the club account. By making a full year of payments for one year, you'd get ahead of the game and instead of paying the credit union interest, you'd be <em>earning</em> interest from the credit union. (Not much, maybe 1%, but better than paying.)</p>
<p>It all comes down to being aware of and in control of your finances. Knowing how much you can expect to receive as income and to spend as expenses, and then making the voluntary choice to cut expenses to take advantage of the banking system, rather than let the credit system take advantage of you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS. just do this. I have multiple stories about this as I grew up as credit cards were becoming a thing, but the bottom line is that you should NEVER use a debit card outside of a bank and if you are going to carry a credit card balance (which you should NEVER do) you should have a separate card that you pay off every month, thereby paying no interest. </p>
<p>There was a day that sears didn't take credit cards (how are they still in business?) and I (a young person with a high income) wanted to buy a DVD player for my brother. They wouldn't take my visa but said I could apply for credit.  </p>
<p>They denied the credit - me being 20 years old.  So, I'm, like, are you kidding?  The guy goes: &quot;I'll take a check.&quot;! </p>
<p>WHAT!!???  </p>
<p>So, you won't give me credit, but you'll take a random piece of paper that says I might pay!?!?!?</p>
<p>Went home with the DVD player. (Who TF uses DVDs now?)</p>
<p>I buy everything on credit cards. I pay it off every month. I'm at a grocery, buying bananas or whatever.  Small order, early 2000's. I put it on the card. </p>
<p>The guy behind me says &quot;you're guns take out a loan for bananas?!?&quot;  </p>
<p>Now, I've had a credit card since I was 18 and I've paid it off every month since I was 18. The idea that it's a loan had honestly never occurred to me. </p>
<p>But today it's totally normal to &quot;take out a loan&quot; for your groceries and I probably play pickleball with that douche. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You really shouldn't use a debit card for anything like he said. Being in IT I can tell you that if you ever have your information stolen a thief can drain your bank account if they have your debit card information. If they have your credit card information they can only spend so much and you are only responsible for so much of it as long as you report it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a credit union and handle loan applications, and this is good advice.  OP, Be aware that special fancy things like rewards points and incentives have a tradeoff:  usually the rate is far higher than a basic card.  OP, Be careful with credit card offers you get in the mail.  they are rarely the good deal that you deserve because that company paid the credit bureaus for a list of people who are in similar situations to yours.  That company is betting that you'll feel touched that this company thinks so highly of you so as to send you a credit card offer.  They're counting on that happy feeling so that you don't look at the fine print to see what that rate goes up to after the introductory period expires, or the default rate which is what it'll go to if you miss a payment.  rates 20% or higher are very high and you deserve better.  If you Google search for &quot;Credit Unions <your city>&quot;  you'll find a list of local credit unions who may be able to give you a better deal.  Good luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I don't think I've ever received inmail credit cards yet. But it's good to know (and makes sense) </p>
<p>Guess I'll go with one that doesn't have all those complicated fancy schmancies and stick with a basic card :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually if you're planning on just always paying your balance in full, you might as well shop around for a card which benefits you.</p>
<p>E.g. I've got a credit card for the sole purpose of travelling abroad, its got a high apr (who cares) but doesn't have any fx fees at all even for cash withdrawals! You just may find a card that rewards your circumstances.</p>
<p>Do you have moneysupermarket or comparethemarket or gocompare or similar comparison sites where you are? They usually provide good overviews of which cards suit which lifestyles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally to this, many companies require you to make a payment to allow you to have the card. A yearly fee. Some of the also charge a constant monthly fee.</p>
<p>Most of the credit cards a companies offer an insurance and you're usually signed up. You pay a lot of many based on your daily balance. Usually you can just call the company and cancel the I insurance.</p>
<p>In general always check the transactions and fees. You'll find surprises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is good advice for most things you receive via mail/email/phone call. Companies typically don't reach out to you to give you a great deal. If you didn't ask for it then it's spam. Try calling the credit card company after you get a mailing and never mention the mailing. Just tell them the rates and benefits you're looking for and you'll get a better deal. Then ask why the thing they mailed you doesn't match up and you'll get an even better deal. As an aside, always talk to financial institutions on the phone or in person. Credit card companies and banks will drop fees and charges at the drop of a hat if you speak to a live person. They know if they let you slide for a few things here and there, they'll be able to make money off you forever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add onto this, I'll put in some of my personal credit card uses.</p>
<p>I'm with Tesco bank in the UK for my credit card. I chose them because they offered 18 months interest free on a new account.</p>
<p>With that card I get a £2,100 limit. So say I took out the card today, I could go and blow £2,000 on, say, a new gaming PC and pay the minimum amount (£25 a month I think on mine) for the next 18 months.</p>
<p>After the 18 months are up, I will have to start paying interest on the amount that I owe which I think is around 2% a month or something like that.</p>
<p>Using a credit card for buying a gaming PC out right and then paying it back over several months is a very good way of doing it <strong>if you're smart</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>NEVER</strong> borrow more than you can afford to pay back or you'll find yourself spiraling into unpayable debt.</p>
<p>One example for something I have actually done recently is pay for my car's insurance for the year. That was £917 for this year (I think) which I could have paid from my savings, but you get into the what ifs if that happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if my car breaks down?</li>
<li>What if I need to get someone out of financial trouble?</li>
<li>What if I lose my job?</li>
</ul>
<p>That's why I paid it on my card. I get the good credit score for 1 and I don't lose £917 straight away. Instead I can split it over 3 months or however long I want.</p></div>		</li>
