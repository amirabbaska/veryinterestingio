			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with cans is not the cans themselves but their shape that releases a LOT of CO2 when you pour stuff out from them. The throat is not smooth, gradually narrowing to a smooth, rounded hole but it goes thru a different kind of &quot;nozzle&quot;; one that is less than 0.1mm deep with no funneling of any kind. The sudden change makes CO2 separate from the liquid. Pouring it slowly helps, so that the hole is not fully blocked by liquid at any point but we let air in to equalize things.</p>
<p>One thing to add: rinse your can tops if you really care about taste (and hygiene..), it is exposed to outside and the groove will gather all kinds of crap when the can is moved from warm to cool and it gets condensation, flushing the sides of the cans, deposits being collected on top of the cans and then it dries up in the groove. Usually they are quite clean but there are times when there is all kinds of nasty surprises in there so at least check before opening them....</p></div>		</li>
