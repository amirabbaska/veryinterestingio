<p>I would also add that most small animals are prey animals and there is strong selection pressures for them to have the capability to be able to accelerate very quickly. A species that has evolved to move constantly, but at a lower speed, would be eaten by a predator that can accelerate quickly. Larger animals, like horses or moose, don't rely on the need to accelerate away from danger, since they're Too Big To Mess With^TM </p>
<p>Ergo, to avoid predators, you need to accelerate. And when you're built for that, then it doesn't make sense to move around in a different way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Total biologie noob, but I could imagine that it also is evolutionaraly speaking an advantage. Its easier to follow smooth motions with your eye, a mouse jolting around, suddenly stopping and changeing directions is harder to follow.
It doesn't explain, how it's possible for them to be so fast, but maybe why genetic traits that would make then move more smoothly weren't successful.
It would also explain why medium sized animals like leopards vs antelopes move so differently</p></div>		</li>
