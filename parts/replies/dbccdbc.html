			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. sometime in the 1900's as they were starting to move away from bubbles a company ran a marketing campaign saying that they're competitors didn't have as many bubbles meaning it wasn't cleaning as well. So from then on the public belief is bubbles=clean. So soap companies have had to add extra stuff to make bubbles. It actually decreases the cleaning power because some of the stronger cleaners create a less stable film allowing for bubbles to dissipate easier.</p></div>		</li>
