			<div class="markdown"><p>iirc correctly, the logic behind it is that while heat is good at allowing muscles to relax, the heat also makes the area dilate, so if the goal is overall to reduce inflammation to allow maximum blood flow, then heating the area just allows things to stay swollen. While ice cause the muscles to constrict, it never does so to the point of stopping blood flow. So ice allows more blood because of less swelling and therefore more heating.</p>
<p>You can still flush the area heat/ice, but always end with ice. Of course in 2 more years the new science could say to do just the exact opposite of what I'm saying now. Our understanding is ever evolving </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the swelling as a way to stop the minor tear from becoming something more serious. The body doesn't care about pain. It needs it as part of its functionality and self preservation. Pain (to anyone/thing not at human intelligence) is meant to remind you something is wrong or injured. Also swelling puts pressure on nerves, etc., but the body would prefer you have pain to not make an I jury worse rather than you being comfortable and making things worse.</p></div>		</li>
