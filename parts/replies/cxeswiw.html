			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why a wife receives the female equivalent of her husband's title is because historically, her legal status is an extension of her husband's legal status, just like how all her property becomes his after marriage. These archaic rules mean she becomes a part of his estate so her title signifies she is his &quot;property&quot; (not literally nowadays). A man historically did not become of his wife's estate so he did not receive  a title that signified he was her &quot;property,&quot; and his legal status remained his individual right rather than being dependent on marital status. </p>
<p>I couldn't find information about the technical title of Sir Patrick Stewart's wife but I think a more apt example is Kate Middleton. She's a princess because she married Prince William, right? But she is not Princess Kate, she is Princess William of Wales. She isn't a princess in her own right, she is only a princess in extension of her husband's legal status because she is a part of his estate, hence the fact the title supplants her given name with her husband's name.</p>
<p>I suppose it comes down to personal opinion that having a title that means your legal standing is an extension of your spouse's is better than having no title at all. The whole title business is archaic itself so that's why it follows archaic rules that are unequal when it comes to gender.</p></div>		</li>
