			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, kinda/sorta. JWST will be riding at L2, which is in an orbit around the sun, outboard of the earth (so the earth is always between the telescope and the sun). However, that far out (beyond the orbit of the moon), the earth will only block a small portion of the sun. As such, the JWST has a large set of sun shades that will be deployed to shade the main instrument. </p>
<p>JWST will be able to observe from Infrared to approximately green, so to mak ethis happen the whole thing will be allowed to cool down to cryogenic temperatures. </p></div>		</li>
