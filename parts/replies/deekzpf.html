			<div class="markdown"><p>Nightmares are also associated with many diseases such as Parkinson's disease.  It's possible there isn't really a &quot;reason&quot; why people have nightmares in the sense that they are some kind of beneficial evolutionary ability.  It might just be a negative physiological side-effect of stress and disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with ptsd+ anixety disorder, I notice when stress happens or certain events remind me of the trauma I have horrific nightmares that can go on for weeks. </p>
<p>Lately I've been under alot of stress and those nightmares have started again. Some reliving the moments and others are just anixety. My grandma who I live with has gotten used to hearing me screaming occsaionally with pure fear in my sleep or crying. Sometimes she wakes me up sweetly and hugs me until i stop crying. </p>
<p>I feel bad I wake her up and embarassed by it. </p>
<p>My ex would sleepover sometimes and I'm not sure why, maybe being held all night or just the love I had for this person, but everytime he was with me, I wouldnt have nightmares. He's mentioned I've twitched and sudden body jerks in my sleep or would be gasping for air, but I wouldnt have nightmares any night he was with me.</p>
<p>Maybe thats why they started again. The only relief I get is to take meds before bed but even then I still have some pretty messed up dreams.</p>
<p>Any advice on how to stop these nightmares other than medications?</p>
<p>I'd love a real 8 hours of sleep without waking up multiple times a night. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at the average joe, about 5-8% of adults have regular nightmares. Now look at combat vets with PTSD, that number jumps to 52%, and some research suggests it may be as high as 96% when combined with anxiety and panic disorders. So it's not surprising to hear you're having nightmares. It's possible you have night terrors as well, with the twitching/gasping for air. </p>
<p>One treatment currently in use is Imagery Rehearsal Therapy.  In IRT, the person who is having nightmares, while awake, changes how the nightmare ends so that it no longer upsets them. Then the person replays over and over in their minds the new dream with the non-scary ending. Research shows that this type of treatment can reduce how often nightmares occur. Treating the underlying anxiety disorders and PTSD goes a long way to treating the nightmares as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're most common in children. As far as I can tell, no one seems to be quite certain why that is. They are different from nightmares in two aspects: first, they happen during the deepest part of the sleep cycle, midway through, whereas nightmares happen at the end of the sleep cycle during REM sleep. Second,  when a child has a nightmare, they can be easily woken and they often remember at least part of it. With night terrors, they can't be immediately woken up, and they have no recollection of it. Night terrors can cause a child to seem awake, eyes open and talking, but they're still in a deep sleep. They can also act out whatever is happening in their dreams so they may lash out, sleepwalk, talk, etc. </p></div>		</li>
