			<div class="markdown"><p>Surprised this was so far down. Spoilage is everything! The world's biggest cards and vouchers company, Blackhawk, essentially gambles that you're going to forget to spend your whole card. </p>
<p>Sell a $100 card for $90 to a reseller (e.g Walmart). As soon as Walmart sells it they've made ~10% profit. Blackhawk gambles that just over 10% of the value sold won't be spent (and it's always much higher than 10%).</p>
<p>It then gets better because Blackhawk gets their money now but the cards may not be spent for months. Over the average 8-10 months it takes to spend a gift card, they can make back 2-5% in interest.</p></div>		</li>
