			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't actually answer the question — that's about the rain affecting the explosion, not the explosion affecting the rain. It means that if you set off a nuke during a rain storm, the blast pressure from the bomb is not going to go as far. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means yea it will move all the clouds away but, it reduces pressure enough that all the clouds will be sucked back into the area soon enough. So to answer your question. Temporarily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't what it's saying at all. It's talking about peak blast pressure <em>from the bomb</em> — what it would destroy with its blast pressure, e.g., if you set off a bomb under a storm, the peak pressure levels felt from the blast will be 15% lower. It doesn't tell you anything about what happens to the storm or the clouds. </p>
<p>Here's the context of the quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It had been expected that wave forms from the Castle shot, largely propagated in cool air over water, would be clean and of ideal shape. But some records suggest dust and/or water loading, indicating that the lagoon water was not a perfectly reflecting surface as had been assumed. However, the non-ideal behavior apparently did not significantly affect peak pressure levels, whose curves in general conformed well with standard cube-root scaling theory. An interesting development on shot 3 [Castle Yankee] was a rainstorm, which at shot time apparently lay with one edge roughly over ground zero, which was in a cab on Eninman Island. Instrument readings to the east and west indicate that this unmeasured rain dampened peak pressure levels by approximately 15%, which is compatible with theory for a rain of quite moderate intensity. </p>

<p>Again, to put it in context: if you are a weaponeer, you care about how high and how far the blast pressure from the bomb goes. It's how you judge whether you can destroy something and with what accuracy/yield you need to destroy it. There are standard ways to know how pressure waves scale as a result of yield and height of burst of the bomb (the aforementioned cube-root scaling). What they're saying here is, if there's a rainstorm over the target, it will dampen (absorb) some of the blast pressure, and your peak pressure will be reduced by 15%.</p>
<p>So if we set off a 1 Mt bomb on the surface, under &quot;ideal&quot; conditions we'd expect that there would be about 20 pounds per square inch (psi) of blast pressure some 1.35 miles from ground zero. What they're saying here is, if there's a rainstorm, you're actually going to experience something like 17 psi at that range. It says nothing about how the rainstorm behaved other than as a dampener. Presumably absorbing that blast pressure had <em>some</em> effect on it, but they don't care about that (they only care about the reduction in blast damage). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is they thought the clouds would act like a mirror, reflecting the shockwave back down and increasing the intensity
instead they acted like a pillow </p></div>		</li>
