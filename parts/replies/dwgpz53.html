			<div class="markdown"><p>They do the same thing with the &quot;5th vital sign&quot; (pain) someone comes in with pain and the lawyers and shit force them to over prescribe opiates when there is unequivocal evidence that shows it is counter intuitive for long term pain. It creates opiate induced hyperalgesia, which means it makes your pain worse. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia</a></p>
<p>This right here is one of the biggest problems with the western world right now, and a MUCH MUCH greater problem that kills many more than guns ever will. And it's on an incline, while gun deaths are on a decline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not me, personally.  I know plenty of people who go to the doctor as soon as they have any upper respiratory symptoms, and beg for antibiotics.  There are absolutely doctors that will prescribe them, for whatever reason.  it's dumb, yes.  If I hear of people doing this, you bet they'll hear a mouthful from me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From your link: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the variability in the dose, formulation and duration of zinc use in the included studies, more research is needed to address these before zinc use can be generally recommended for the common cold. </p>
<p>However, as the zinc lozenges formulation has been widely studied, and there is a significant reduction in the duration of cold at a dose of ≥ 75 mg/day, for those considering using zinc it would be best to use it at this dose throughout the cold. When using zinc lozenges (not as syrup or tablets) the likely benefit has to be balanced against side effects, notably a bad taste and nausea.</p>
