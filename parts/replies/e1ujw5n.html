			<div class="markdown"><p>It's silly how the cheapo porn sites are often portrayed as webcam chat sites, and the girl you were talking to is there dancing on webcam but she's always too busy to do your requests. In reality, it's a pre-recorded video, half the chat is fake d00ds, and you never actually talked to that girl in the first place and never will. It was just a bot or some anonymous sweatshop chatperson that lured you in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never subscribed to it but a live scammer person (not a robot) lured me into wasting an hour talking and clicking on their site's link, and it was obvious what it was from there. They made it sound like I was about to head downtown and meet them in person for a quick hookup, then suddenly they can't but ask me to support them on their website. Disappointing, learned from it, didnt lose anything really.</p></div>		</li>
