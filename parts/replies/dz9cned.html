			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's something I've always wanted to ask:</p>
<p>There's a video that slows down a bird singing. When you hear it slowed down it sounds like beautiful music.</p>
<p>My question is this: There are people who can imitate the sounds of a bird's song. If a human were to whistle a bird's song would it sound exactly the same when slowed down? Are humans capable of doing this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since no one else posted one, here is a video of birds singing slowed down. Strange stuff, some sound similar to other animals or even sirens. </p>

<p>Bonus video of cicada chirp slowed down:</p>

<p>Sounds kinda like frogs croaking.</p>
<p>Bonus bonus video of a &quot;choir of angels&quot; slowed down (human voices). Hauntingly beautiful, sounds like what whale sounds in space would sound like:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some evidence that that smaller animals subjectively experience time slower than larger ones - electrical impulses that make up input and thought work roughly the same across all animals, and smaller animals thus simply perceive and react faster.  Perhaps more importantly, this allows them to have a higher refresh rate from their senses, and of course their brains keep up with that refresh rate, which implies slower subjective time, which would explain why small animals have very rapid shifts in their songs and mating calls.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Both birds and (some) whales are known to be able to imitate human speech.</p>

<p>Bird produce sounds with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_(bird_anatomy\)" target="_blank">syrinx</a> but some cetaceans actually do produce sounds with their <a href="https://dosits.org/animals/sound-production/how-do-marine-mammals-produce-sounds/" target="_blank">larynx</a> similar to humans, but some species have very different anatomy. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Odontocetes (toothed whales) produce a wide variety of sounds, which include clicks, whistles, and burst pulses. Some lower frequency sounds may be produced by the larynx. Most sounds, especially the higher frequency sounds, are produced by a complex system of air sacs and specialized soft tissues that vibrate as air moves through the narial passages. The sound produced in the air sacs is channeled through the fats of the melon. The melon shape can be modified by the animal to produce a narrow or broad beam of sound.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dolphins can imitate human speech through their blowholes, even going so far as to make the &quot;m&quot; sound by letting a little water in. <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/home-where-your-dolphin-is_podmash/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a podcast about it that will blow your mind. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnVAv77gEqo" target="_blank">here</a> is a short video where you can hear some samples.  </p>
<p>Fun fact: the whole experiment was canceled because they were giving the dolphin LSD and hand jobs. Because of that they totally stopped doing experiments like this with dolphins.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Really? Is &quot;they&quot; that specific group, or humans in general?</p>
<p>I mean, giving dolphins drugs without consent is obviously wrong, and I'm not sure how you could communicate with them that what you were giving them was a psychedelic, but that's not reason to stop attempting to communicate altogether.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiolab explains it better than I can but essentially these were hippies doing possibly psuedoscientific experiments on dolphins. There is still a lot of psuedoscience surrounding dolphins. Because of this it is difficult to get funding for experiments on doing things like talking to dolphins. People think you're a hippy.   </p>
<p>&quot;They&quot; are the scientific establishment, universities, sources of funding, etc. </p></div>		</li>
