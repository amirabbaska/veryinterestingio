<p>The running joke was that you could always tell a linotype operator because all of his pants would have holes burned in them from the molten lead that splashed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I worked part-time for a while in the late 1980sâ€“early 1990s on a free local weekly paper and at the end it was typeset by a small outfit that was just making the transition to Pagemaker on early Macs. They had the Linotron, the pasteup tables, and the huge process camera. They also had a couple of Linotype machines in the next room for doing wedding invitations. The main guy who operated them showed me the splashes of lead on the low ceiling above his head. If one of the matrices was not quite square in the line, it would leave a gap around it, through which molten lead could escape. He'd have a split second's warning as he heard the air that preceded the lead escaping from that gap, giving him just enough time to push away from the machine on his wheeled chair before a squirt of lead would fly up towards where his head used to be!</p>
<p>He also told me about the time he went to attach a new ingot of lead to the hook that lowered them into the melting pot, but the hook was facing away from him. His mind was on automatic and he forgot that the hook had just been sitting in a pot of molten lead a second or two before, so he just reached out and grabbed it with his bare hand to turn it to face him. Fun times.</p>
<p>I forget his name, but I think it was Dave. Norm owned the place (Bay Typesetters), and Jack showed me how to comp. Guys, I really enjoyed working there and getting to see how things were done before it all changed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can see one in the Smithsonian</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, stop by your local newspaper's office and ask if they have one. If they don't themselves, there's a good chance they'll know where one is. A lot of older papers have one sitting around in the back garage or what have you. As you said, they're difficult to move, and some sentimental newspaper folks are reluctant to chuck them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So... how could a newspaper be printed every day? Easy. These guys were GOOD. And FAST.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's true, these guys were amazing. But worth mention that old newspapers were not like today. Not all newspapers were published daily and even those that were daily, most of the days they had very few pages except for one day when they had the main edition with a lot of content.</p>
<p>Also, just few sections of the newspaper were really &quot;news&quot; (the front page, for example). A lot of the content were texts that could be prepared days in advance like novels, recipes, classified ads, horoscope and even some subjects like politics and sports were not updated so often like today, so they had time to write these and it probably could not change. They don't had politicians giving speeches and tweeting every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point.  Most stuff was prepared ahead of time and even the front page had pre-prepared items.  The &quot;last minute news hole&quot; was saved until.... well..... the last minute in case something important happened.  And yes, remember that there weren't the many many ways to communicate that there are today so nothing was really &quot;instantaneous.&quot;</p>
<p>Also keep this in mind:  The pages were set up with the ads in place first.  Then, the decision was made as to how many pages the paper would be that day and what news would go where.  (This sometimes made for funny goofs, like the time they put the whiskey ad next to the article about alcoholism.  Or the day the editor wrote &quot;put asshole dashes here&quot; -- this was asterisks -- and the typesetter put that verbatim.)  These were the days of proofreaders also, unlike today, and luckily, the proofreader caught that one before it was put in the newspaper.</p></div>		</li>
