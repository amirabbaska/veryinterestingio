			<div class="markdown"><p>I have &quot;dealt with&quot; LexisNexus before.  It's actually quite shocking to me that this issue is not on the front lines of the American mind.  We are worried about illegal immigrants and over-seas terrorists all the while our government (along with financial support of business) passes and allows laws so everything about us can be collected, stored and sold to the highest bidder.   It's not &quot;LexisNexus&quot; it's our government which allows any company to access an record on us.  When requested, they basically just go out and collect that information made available by your local county clerk (or whatever branch is responsible).  FaceBook does the same thing... ever wonder why it's able to show &quot;these people may be your friends&quot;... school records, addresses... cross referenced, simple coding stuff.</p></div>		</li>
