			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose there has to be a limit of some kind if the principle of cause and effect must hold true. If some force or some signal could propagate instantly then a cause and its effect could in principle happen at the same time, whereby two related events would be simultaneous. This would make it impossible to say which is the cause and which is the effect. Could entanglement be seen as such a situation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>c isn't a speed, so much as a unit conversion factor. There are 2.54 cm in an inch, yes? Well, there are c meters in 1 second. All of relativity essentially boils down to the geometrical constraints of our universe. Where you find distances in spatial dimensions by d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 , you find distances in space-time by s^2 = -(ct)^2 + x^2 +y^2 +z^2 . In fact, in a lot of physics we'll just choose to use a different unit of length or time so that c = 1, and we don't need to worry about it at all.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;speed limit&quot; part of it comes when you try to accelerate a mass past the speed of light; the energy required approaches infinity. So for things with mass, the speed of light <em>is</em> in fact a speed limit.</p>
<p>There is a theoretical partical called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyon" target="_blank">tachyon</a> which <em>always</em> moves faster than light. So far there's no evidence it exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>c can be derived from Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. In short, c is dependant on the permeability and permittivity of free space which govern how strong electric and magnetic fields are away from their source (they are analogous to the universal gravitation constant but for electromagnetism).</p>
<p>Doesn't exactly answer why, but it does tell us that c isn't independent of other fundamental constants of our universe and that a different value of c would drastically change other things like the structure of atoms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One could argue that c is more fundamental than the electromagnetic force, since all massless particles must travel at c, regardless of their relation to electromagnetism.  If anything, the permittivity and permeability of free space is constrained to give correct value of c.  In essence, there is only 1 degree of freedom between the two, with their product being preserved, if you consider possible universes with different values for the permittivity and permeability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A different vale of c wouldn’t change anything.  The entire universe would be at a different scale and our measurement systems would reflect that.  It’s why we can set c equal to 1 without loss of generality.</p>
<p>I think you mean the fine structure constant.  That’s a dimensionless value and would drastically change the structure of atoms if changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not think this is the best experimental constraints. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05834" target="_blank">Gravitational Waves and Gamma-rays</a> coincidence gives a constraint on the graviton mass at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06394" target="_blank">10^-22 eV</a>. The <a href="http://pdglive.lbl.gov/DataBlock.action?node=G033M&amp;init=0" target="_blank">PDG</a> continues to use the lensing data which provide a constraint at the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0204161" target="_blank">10^-32 eV</a> level. Note that this is also the range of constraint provided by accurate measurement in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0212069v2" target="_blank">Earth-Moon</a> system.</p>
<p>The advantage of the binary pulsar data is that it does not rely on models for modifying gravity by adding a graviton mass.</p>

<p>First time that quoting the particle data book gets me downvoted. If you disagree, please comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This of course is presupposing a graviton exist. And even then constraining its mass (assuming these are upper limit constraints) doesn't mean it's not massless. Other experiments, like the variations in orbits and their decays seem to suggest a speed of c . <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/grav_speed.html" target="_blank">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/grav_speed.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that does not. In fact I very much doubt we can ever detect a graviton. It only makes use of quantum field theory to describe effectively a modified gravity theory, so as to investigate experimental limits. What is interesting is that those limits are much better for gravity than for electromagnetism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a contributing author on the first paper you link. We didn't list the graviton mass constraints in our paper because they are uninteresting compared to previously established values, as you showed, but additionally they don't exceed the values set from the observation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03841" target="_blank">GW150914</a>. We did present the speed of gravity because it improved the prior limits by ten orders of magnitude on one side (and the previous limits are questionable). These are not equivalent things. The graviton mass limits come from dispersion limits. That is, these can constrain variations in the speed of gravity, but not the absolute speed of gravity itself. If they were equivalent then any of the previously cited papers would have set limits on the speed of gravity, and none of the authors nor LIGO/Virgo did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you agree that a massless particle travels at the speed of light?</p>
<p>edit</p>
<p>I think we may have a classic case of &quot;astrophysicist/relativist&quot; vs &quot;particle/quantum&quot; perspective. I certainly acknowledged that the direct measurement you reported did not depend on any kind of model. The reason I wanted to mention the other measurements is precisely because the bounds on the graviton mass are more stringent than the bounds on the photon mass, although those bounds have more model depends built in.</p>
<p>So again, on the one hand, I recognize the importance of bounding the difference between the propagation of light and the propagation of gravity. On the other hand, what I wanted to point out is that we have less confidence in the degree of dispersion of light than in the dispersion of gravity. I guess at this point I only make this note for internet archaeologist though...</p></div>		</li>
