			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this might be anecdotal, but I have a question you may be able to answer. Sometimes I've been drunk and all fine but as soon as I try to lay down, head spins become stronger and I feel better being upright for a while (at least that's the feeling I get). Is there a specific reason for this kind of perception?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, thanks for asking an interesting question. I've experienced the same feeling myself, but only when I've drunk a lot of alcohol. My guess, in this case is due to the anesthetic effects of alcohol. The brain cannot feel the ground, and thus only has the inner ear information for balance. Being in the upright position is the 'default' position, and as long as the head is not moving much, the brain senses and maintains balance. Once you lie down, the brain knows it's horizontal, yet it's confused because no information is available from the rest of the body. It's a very interesting question, and I'll try and upload any sources which confirm or deny my hypothesis asap. (They might not be ELi5) :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I believe the reason why people get &quot;the spins&quot; when they try to lie down when they are drunk has to do with loss of visual input. The body's sense of balance and its awareness of its location in space in general comes from 3 sources:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visual input -- your eyes can actually see where you are</li>
<li>Vestibular input -- aka the semicircular canals described above, which feed back into the brain through the same nerve that sends sound information from your ears</li>
<li>Propioceptive input -- special nerve fibers in your limbs tell your brain(stem) where they are.</li>
</ol>
<p>The brain puts all of this info together to figure out your location in space. Now, you only need 2 of these 3 to be working correctly for you not to experience vertigo and dizziness (compromised sense of awareness in space). Somebody said above that alcohol inhibits the information from getting back into the brain from the vestibular system but actually, the alcohol itself diffuses into the liquid in the semicircular canals and changes its density so the information the brain gets is all messed up. So when you are drunk you already have 1 of the 3 mechanisms of balance compromised; when you try to lie down and close your eyes, you lose a second one and hence the dizziness (and subsequently, the throwing up)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to know this ASAP. Every time I get rather drunk I face a choice of either keeping myself awake for an hour or so to sober up or risking throwing up as I lay down to sleep. It's a difficult choice, mate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One trick is to put a foot off your bed onto the ground, and focus your intention on the sole of your foot touching the floor and being &quot;flat&quot;. This will often help your body figure out where down is :)</p>
<p>A hand flat on your bed is less effective but also less weird looking, so you can try that first. Basically give your bod a hand with figuring out which way is down because your boozing has messed with its natural methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a bit late, but my A&amp;P instructor had once told us that when drunk, alcohol can displace the water in those semicircular canals. Since alcohol is thinner than water, instead of the liquid in the canals changing straight to that position and staying there, it sloshes around for a bit longer causing the spinning feeling. He also said something about pressure differences, but I can't remember quite what he said.</p>
<p>This may be completely wrong, but I thought I'd throw it out there in case someone else knew more about it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Think of them as 3 small hula hoops filled with a liquid. Now imagine a cube's corner. It has 3 faces meeting at that corner, each hula hoop occupies that face, i.e. the length, breadth and height of the cube. This is how the brain knows where it is in 3 dimensional space in time. Due to the liquid splashing about based on gravity, these tubes help in balance as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My liquid is more honey consistency than splashy water consistency. This is so serious that I might end up in a wheelchair. Bloody important hula hoops!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man.. sorry about that.. it really sucks.. what do the doctors say? Btw a change in diet might help if it's not a genetic condition, even then it might help in managing it. Is it due to excessive calcium carbonate crystals?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, menieres disease, it's irreversable and progressive, but I developed it young (most sufferers are middle aged and later, I was diagnosed at 14) and it's progressing really slowly, so I may well be good until I'm a pensioner or even forever. I'll just have shit balance, but not lose my ability to balance altogether!</p></div>		</li>
