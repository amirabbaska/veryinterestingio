			<div class="markdown"><p>The system of weightings described is also reasonably close to our understanding of how the brain works. The weights themselves also provide a kind of 'availability' of the nearest examples. Sometimes called heuristic availability. </p>
<p>Try this simple experiment. First ask a few friends to think of as many types of birds as they can in 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Next ask some other group of friends to think of as many types of birds <strong>starting with P</strong> as they can in 10 seconds.</p>
<p>What you may find is that the second group come up with more examples than the first. Even though there are less to choose from.</p>
<p>Why does this work?</p>
<p>Psychologists believe we store our archetypes for birds in a network of features. When more &quot;weight categories &quot; are available, we trigger more access points and therefore more memories.</p>
<p>Watch as the first group chooses from really broad categories as they score their heuristic:</p>
<p>&quot; Um large.... Ostrich... Um cold ... penguin&quot;.</p>
<p>Then watch the second group rattle off from some kind of internal dictionary:</p>
<p>&quot;Pigeon, Penguin, Peacock, Pelican, Parrot.... (they may miss Pheasant. .. can you guess why?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting explanation. But one thing that I don't grasp is where the original concepts come from. Color I can understand, it's an inherent part of a picture. But sizes, forms or whatever? If you were a newborn baby (which I assume such a computer would be like) you'd have no concept of sizes. Being shown a picture of the moon and one of a squirrel you couldn't fathom that those two things are totally different in size.</p>
<p>Or take a hundred thousand pictures of cats ... never mind that they can't spell, but cat's come in all shapes and sizes and in tons of different colors. How would I, if I have no concept of &quot;cat&quot; ever find baser concepts to describe catlike entities?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By building a database and cross referencing the size of the cats to objects in the picture. Objects you recognize and remember from other non-cat pictures. You would be able to build an approximate reference of things in cat-lengths.</p></div>		</li>
