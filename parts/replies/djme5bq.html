<p>I started developing a serious fear of people and having to interact/be judged by them... [Y]ears later... I finally feel like how I think I SHOULD have felt years ago.</p>

<p>Man does this hit home to me. I was ostracized in high school - I started after (sane, responsible) home schooling for most of my life, and when I started at my small high school, I was simultaneously the new kid, the smart kid, and the fat kid. I had plenty of friends as a homeschooler, but I didn't have a single friend for about five years after I started high school.</p>
<p>It set me back <em>years</em> of social development. I can confirm this by watching my younger siblings, who kept home schooling until college and are <em>much</em> better socially-adjusted than I am. I've only recently started to believe that people actually want to spend time with me. I've had friends, but some deep part of me has always felt that I have to walk on eggshells around them or they'll realize how worthless I am. I'm married to an amazingly brilliant and caring person, and there's still a part of me that insists that <strong>my wife</strong> is just humoring me for some obscure reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, at least, there are city-sponsored sports leagues, non-school clubs (Boy/Girl Scouts, etc.), and sometimes even homeschool collectives if there are enough kids in the area that have regular style after-school clubs. Nothing stopping them from interacting with neighborhood kids, either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Homeschooling being uncommon would preclude the solution my family found. I'm from the midwestern United States, for context. My parents put a lot of thought into our homeschooling, and one of their ideas was finding other homeschooling families. It turned out that there was a good-sized group of homeschooling families within ~30 miles of us, so we joined them.</p>
<p>We all started getting together. My parents drove us to other kids' houses all the time, and we hosted regularly too. The adults were generally centrist-to-liberal upper-middle-class people, so they had a lot in common and became friends. And kids introduced to each other in someone else's house almost always get along. (From experience, I think the &quot;neutral setting&quot; of schools permits a lot of hostile bullshit from other kids. When you're in someone else's house, with adults nearby, it's hard not to be chill.)</p>
<p>The parents taught classes in things they liked, too. One kid's dad was the manager of a cardboard box-making company, but he really loved Classical literature (the <em>Illiad</em> and things like that), so he held a biweekly-ish class where he taught kids about it. Anyone could sign up. Some parents spoke French or Arabic, and there were classes for that. They all collaborated to pay a music teacher for us. It was really idiosyncratic and communistic, but cool. I don't think I learned much content - I can't understand more than a tiny bit of French or Arabic today - but I learned to be curious and that there was more in the world to learn than I could ever hope to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Home schooler here. I definitely didn't have a ton of friends but I did do a bunch of the collectives. Ten years later I'm still best friends with some of the same people who did homeschool co-ops with me. I definitely don't recommend homeschool in rural areas like I was though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds so similar to my life except that I wasn't bullied much. And when I was, I hit one of them and kicked the other and they never bothered me again. Whatever started it (if anything) happened when I was young because I already felt like an outcast before kindergarten. Now I'm 35 with literally no friends and obviously not dating and I love being alone. But I don't love feeling like a failure. I'm always conflicted about what kind of life I want. </p>
<p>I'm very guarded now though and I refuse to make friends because I see this whole line of progression where I'm anxious around people and getting thrown into new situations. Then I hit it off with a girl and that's awkward. We get closer and that's more awkward, and all the things that come with that. Something as simple as hanging out with a new friend for a couple hours is almost enough to induce an anxiety attack, because I'm not seeing this one interaction. I'm seeing a chain of terrifying events. It sounds dumb saying it but in those moments I feel like my subconsciousness takes over my rational thought. </p>
<p>And I'm so sorry for typing all of that. All I was gonna say was hey, nice description of anxiety or something like that. Take care of yourself. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No you're not going to feel sorry for typing all that. Comprende? Because what you've said resonates with me strongly. And the part where you say &quot;my subconsciousness takes over my rational thought&quot; has accurately put into words my experience which I've struggled to even describe, let alone get an understanding/perspective on it. So thank you! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I said I was sorry for typing all of that because I felt it was completely unsolicited and I shouldn't dump my issues on a stranger. </p>
<p>I'm glad it helped you. Thinking about it now, I wonder if thinking of those negative subconscious thoughts as just a signal from the body that we should interpret rationally would help. </p>
<p>Analogy: pain. It hurts to touch a hot pan out of the oven. We know that's a bad thing to do. It also hurts to exercise. But we can force ourselves through it because we know it's beneficial. </p>
<p>Under moderate to severe anxiety, I know it's going to be hard to go through that process. But I'm gonna try to apply it to something simple when I get a chance. </p>
<p>I think too much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I've always wondered why my 37 year old brother doesn't have friends. Not being mean, he has never had friends. He has coworkers and neighbors he hangs out with occasionally. We're not really close as adults so I guess I assumed he was probably happy. He's never dated, either. I wonder if he has anxiety like this? I had anxiety in the past but got help and I always had friends and dated etc. I hope he's happy, I've tried to ask him in the past but he gets super quiet and awkward.
Thanks for typing this out, I might need to make a call... I wonder if he knows I had/have anxiety?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds exactly like an anxiety response. You should try talking about your own experiences with him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's certainly possible. I'd suggest if you do ask him about it, say something like 'hey, I've been having some anxiety and I wonder if it's genetic' and ease into it. That way he doesn't feel like you're saying 'hey, you seem pretty messed up, are you ok?' Anxiety can lead a person to assume the worst. Also a person can get defensive if ideas that cause anxiety are brought to the surface after they've put a lot of effort into suppressing them. I'm not a psychiatrist or anything, those are just some things that I have noticed about myself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no psychologist, but I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the spike of anxiety and depression  in young adults such as myself is tied to the ubiquitous parental obsession with raising immaculate trophy children for the past 20-30 years. </p>
<p>I can't look people in the eyes when I talk, I'd always get shit from my parents about how I talked growing up. It would always be beratement about how it's too slow, too fast, too low, or else they'd just tell me they don't care about what I'm talking about. If they ask a question, I'd get yelled at for not beginning an answer in under a second because I thought they looked like they were about to continue speaking-heaven forbid I interrupt his highness when he's starting a sentence after a long pause. The very manner I speak to them just feels so phony because they still become irate if I talk to them with the same tone I speak to anyone else. And if it isn't how I speak, it's the expression on my face they'll find a way to interpret as maliciously as possible. Smiling? stop joking around chucklefuck. Frowning? stop being a whiny bitch. Feeling drowzy? STOP MAKING THAT DUMBASS FACE SHITHEAD. Blank expression? Why can't you be happy and smile sometimes like a normal person instead of being so cynical?</p>
<p>I'm fucking 23, and I consistently get yelled at by my dad when I answer the phone because if I answer too soon he won't hear it and I have to say hello a second time literally no more than 2 seconds later-and then he'll tell me to stop fucking around and answer the phone right away when I pick up.   I try to keep it to texts as much as possible.</p>
<p>Basically, growing up, my parents saw me through this lens where everything I did was some form of passive aggression, and now whenever I converse with people I see every word I utter as a reason that person will hate me. I rarely speak directly to my boss because I'm convinced he'll find a reason to fire me if I say more than a few sentences to him in a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I'm sorry you had such a harsh upbringing. I'm a parent now and can't imagine how much pressure and shame that kind of treatment would have caused my kid. I hope you realize most people don't nitpick nearly as much as your parents did. I love talking to my little especially because he's at the stage where it doesn't always make sense, but he's so enthusiastic to tell me his thoughts that it's just fascinating and entertaining anyway. Maybe one day you can learn to believe that about yourself and the value of your own thoughts. Best of luck!!! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually you just kind of stop taking other people seriously. I've come to value objectivity and internal consistency over seeking approval from others. Evidently a part of why I got the job I currently have is because during the interview they were fascinated by how I take every word I say seriously. How, while everyone else is talking you can see this detached expression as I use the opportunity to take in the information and queues to calculate precisely what I'm about to say and how (even if ultimately my elocution has become lackluster as a consequence of only speaking approximately enough words to fill a double-spaced sheet of paper per day). It bothers me how much I've got in common with a garden variety sociopath, though.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call it abusive so much as it is frustrating. I also think half these stories people tell online sound way worse than they actually are. There's room to interpret things in a worst possible way and a best way, and one or the other may speak to you more based on your own experience. I was just trying to make a point that where some people are raised to be able to socialize more or less uninhibited, others may end up with social hangups because of the meme of treating any and all perceived negative feedback from children as backsassery.</p>
<p>Basically, I don't want sympathy, and I personally don't consider it social anxiety because it really doesn't present an obstacle. It lines up perfectly with my goals of never marrying and becoming a wealthy eccentric recluse who lives in a trailer on 50 acres somewhere in the mountains. But if you're into normie things like having kids, living in town, and having house parties... that's a different penguin to poach. Plus, I refuse to speak to a therapist, so I won't come out and say I have &quot;social anxiety&quot; without a diagnosis, though I will say it sounds relatable. I also wouldn't say I'm depressed, but I do spend long spans of time staring at trees outside windows and thinking about how I can't think of a time when I felt happy after 2009. I similarly don't see this as a problem- savings pile up pretty quickly if all you do every weekend is sleep in and shitpost... I'm doing just fine in my own unorthodox sense.</p></div>		</li>
