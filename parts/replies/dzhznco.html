			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a hard question and I don’t have a great answer. However, I have seen examples of autistic adults forming really strong interpersonal relationship in professional settings and elsewhere. Some things that can help are finding people who recognize and appreciate the autistic adults’ strengths; being really clear about what accommodations and supports one needs; customizing employment so that the autistic adult is best using their strengths and not having to do things that they can’t do; and building on areas of common interest as a way of connecting.</p></div>		</li>
