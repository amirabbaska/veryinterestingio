			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your story it is extremely empowering. At the moment I don’t believe I’m at higher risk than the average woman, I was more curious about the mechanism. I hope you’re tumour free now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different person than you asked, and I fucking <em>love</em> breastfeeding, but here are some reasons:</p>
<p>-You are the only one who can feed the baby. If you want your partner to feed the baby then you have to pump, which is such a pain in the tits that you might as well just feed the goddamn baby.</p>
<p>-You have to take your boob out in public. You have to either find a private place (your car, a bathroom stall, if you're fucking <em>lucky</em> there might be a &quot;mother's room&quot;) and step away from whatever you were doing, or you have to take your boob out in full view of everyone. People <em>will</em> shame you for this. People will call you a whore, or tell you that your child is &quot;too old&quot; to be breastfed, or whatever. Or, you can just never, ever leave your house. Ever. For anything.</p>
<p>-If you go back to work, you have to pump. You have to tell your boss that you are lactating and have them designate a private space for you to use. You have to go to your private space every 2-4 hours and stick your boobs in a robot. If you don't do this, your chest will become so full of milk that your ribs begin to ache, and you might get a clogged milk duct or even an infection.</p>
<p>-Babies bite. Babies have no idea that they are hurting you by biting. Even if they don't have teeth yet, it fucking hurts. You have to get the baby off your nipple and convince them to never, <em>ever</em> do that again in a way that doesn't hurt the baby.</p>
<p>-Some babies are not good at nursing. They don't know how to find the nipple, or how to create a seal, or aren't strong enough to pull milk out. You have to help the baby get onto your breast. The baby doesn't want help, it just wants to not be hungry anymore, and it will scream and thrash and accidentally bite you and just in general be no help at all. </p>
<p>-If you're not producing enough milk then you have to pump every time the baby finishes nursing, to encourage your body to make more, so you can't &quot;sleep when he baby sleeps&quot; because you have to stay up getting milked by a robot.</p>
<p>Again, I love breastfeeding. Love my built-in baby-soothers. But it can fucking suck sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And there are a whole slew of boob-maladies that come with breastfeeding. Thrush and blebs and my right boob actually still has a scar from when my daughter (then 16 mo) pinched me- just playing around with a tit in her mouth! Like she owned the thing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with all of that (and I’ve been breastfeeding for the better part of the last decade). </p>
<p>I can offer this though, by cultivating a resting bitch face that clearly communicates “I don’t give a damn about you or your opinion” you can avoid the hateful people. I nurse in public all the time, at church and everything, and nobody ever says anything to me.  They also don’t rub my belly when pregnant. </p>
<p>I really am friendly, I promise, I just don’t like strangers offering their opinion or touching me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is nursing in public really that shameful where you live? It sounds like a cultural problem, because I probably couldn't bother less about it here in Germany (I'm a male btw). it's fucking natural... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>bo-barkles, I just did not like it. And I have a lot of friends and MIL who tried to make me feel really bad about it, but I did what was best for me and my son. And you know what, he is a strong, healthy, solid little boy with a great immune system. I have heard that you have to want to do it, be dedicated for it to work and I struggled the whole time I tried and I did not feel that me breast feeding him &quot;brought us closer together&quot; if I was resentful and stressed out about it. I  had bad post partum as well. There is so much going on after you have a baby that no one talks about and each person's struggle is different. My husband and I both agreed that formula would help take a little stress off of me. And I am lucky enough to be able to afford it. Now I do not have the choice, but I am more at peace that I have cut my chances of developing breast cancer dramatically and that it is easier to find something now. I can take more time and energy in focusing on my children. I know a lot of people that breast feed and that's awesome! A happy healthy baby is all one can ask for. I just don't feel like this should be such a hot button issue as it is. </p></div>		</li>
