			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there's a tiny condom that comes out first. It's there to protect the tiny chute from ripping. Seconds after the main parachute is deployed, the condom is torn off by the wind and then it's off... Floating on its own, navigating the clear blue skies like it's the final frontier until it meets a lovely avian who might be it's partner in life as their fates intertwine or it starts to rain... In the latter scenario, the rain will send it crashing back down to earth and this is why you sometimes find random condoms in the street or in fields. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you're joking but no. The pilot chute is in a little pocket on the pack. The skydiver pulls it out of the pocket and throws it to deploy his parachute.</p>
<p>The pilot chute will inflate thanks to the air rushing past and create enough resistance to drag out the main chute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no. that would be a drogue parachute. drouges are for stabilization, not for deploying the main. however, in some cases, like on a parachute meant for a tandem (two person) jump, the pilot chute will not pull the main out until a second ripcord is pulled, allowing it to act as a drogue. this is needed on tandem jumps because two bodies strapped together (one of those bodies often being inexperienced) are not very free-fall friendly in terms of safe skydiving <em>edit</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More accurately, the drogue is for slowing the tandem master/passenger down rather than stability. Two bodies strapped together fall faster, which means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a camera flyer would not be able to keep up with them in order to film them</p>
</li>
<li>when the TM does deploy the main s/he has to wash off more speed which increases the risk of damage to the rig and injury to the TM and passenger</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pilot chute acts as an anchor. Through out the small pilot chute, it catches air which causes drag and anchors it. The jumper is still falling down and so the line (bridle) between the anchored pilot chute and falling jumper pulls becomes tensioned and pulls the main canopy </p></div>		</li>
