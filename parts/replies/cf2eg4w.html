			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And if you don't patch windows (install updates) after the reinstall then your computer would run as it did when you first got it.  </p>
<p>However. <strong>You should always install important updates</strong>. And have a good anti virus. If not your system is vulnerable to attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no reason to defrag before reinstalling windows. </p>
<p>Defragging re-arranges the memory blocks used by files so that they are physically next to each other. lessening the time needed by your HD to find them and run them because it isn't moving all over the disc. In the simplest way.</p>
<p>But when you reinstall windows, you are erasing everything on the HD, and installing windows on a fresh HD (or at least you should). </p>
<p>So you would be re-arranging your old files prior to deleting them. Which makes no sense.</p>
<p><strong>Guys, I was trying to put this as simply as possible. I know you can reinstall windows without 'removing' all the data on the HD. I know you aren't actually 'deleting' the data on the disc, unless you 0 it out (and even then it can still be recovered in most cases) you are merely opening up the blocks of data and de-indexing. Again, trying to put it all simply and in layman's terms.</strong></p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is called formatting or reformatting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not necessary to reformat prior to installing a fresh copy of Windows, unless something has changed with 8. But I wouldn't be installing 8 unless my device had a touchscreen anyway. While all installed programs become wasted data in this situation, I would rather go through and delete it than go through the process of backing up all my personal data. </p>
<p>If the current OS is Windows Vista or later I would probably not recommend defragging anyway, but I'd make that decision after looking at a fragmentation report.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Erasing everything on your HD&quot; and deleting all the files are two separate things. When you reformat, generally you're just removing all the file pointers, allowing the drive to free up that space. There are options to write zeroes to the entire drive, but generally this will not occur unless you tell the reformatter to do so. This implies that the data is still on your hard drive, which is how forensics can recover such data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider giving Linux a shot. For me, it gets noticeably better performance than Windows on older machines and doesn't degrade so sharply over time. Ubuntu or Linux Mint are user-friendly and pretty easy to get started with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. This. This. </p>
<p>Even if takes some getting used to, in my experience Linux on older  machines works much faster than Windows. The only downside are sometimes drivers that are not as polished as Windows drivers and you can't play all the games you can on Windows.</p>
<p>As an (extreme) example, Pentium IV 3.2 GHz, 1GB RAM with some ancient Intel integrated graphics (not even &quot;HD&quot;) running OpenELEC+XBMC (Linux HomeTheater OS) plays any 1080p video including 1080p Twitch.Tv stream at 35-40 FPS. And it takes up like 150 MB RAM (lol). Same hardware try running Youtube 720p videos on WinXP/7 and it starts to choke. :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I made the jump years ago, and the only real barriers anymore are games and familiarity. For games I have a console, and it only took about 3 months to become familiar.</p>
<p>If I start into all the reasons one is better than the other, I'm going to descend into fanboy holy war garbage, so I'll leave it at &quot;just go give Ubuntu or mint a try&quot;, and shut up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... But <em>dont</em> fill up your SSD, lest you slow down again due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_amplification" target="_blank">write amplification</a>. This actually gets pretty complicated, and you can end up with the similar latency problems as with HDD storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most computers run with a HDD which is the common hard drive that almost all your files are stored on unless you use a External hard drive. The SSD is a newer technology meaning Solid State Drive. Its faster. I put one into my 2012 Macbook Pro and there was a noticeable difference in performance.</p></div>		</li>
