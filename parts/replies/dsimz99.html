<p>Breeder reactors can be used to manufacture weapons grade fissile material though, so there's political aspects, as well as economic ones-- uranium is fairly abundant.</p>

<p>Where does the perception come from then that i've heard in debates in college that there is only 50 years of uranium supply left in the world from current mines ?</p>
<p>One source says 200 years but 30k with breeder reactors-

			<div class="markdown"><p>From current mines, that's the key point. As with any non-renewable, as long as there is demand, we will keep looking for new sources even if they are more expensive. Extraction from seawater could provide hundreds of years of fuel, but it's no where as cheap as digging up rocks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thousands actually if memory is correct. If i remember correctly, there's enough fuel in the ocean (uranium flouride aka UF6 ) to power modern reactors for 15000 years. Also we will find more ways to be efficient </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing happened with oil. I remember all the Peak Oil claims from 20 years ago about how we were about to run out of oil. Nope, we were just running low on the easy to get stuff. Plenty more in shale, under the ocean, or in other more difficult to extract places. There just was no reason to invest in getting at that oil until the easier deposits had been extracted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add to this, even if we depleted most uranium and it became very expensive, we could use Thorium 232 to obtain fissile Uranium in a reactor. When nuclear power was fairly new, Uranium was much rarer and expensive because many big deposits we know today hadn't been discovered, it was thought that we would have to breed uranium from thorium</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light water reactors (vast majority of nuclear plants) are ludicrously inefficient. They can only split U-235 which is an extremely rare isotope of uranium that needs a ton of processing to enrich. There isn't a whole lot of U-235 naturally on the earth in both existing mines and estimates of undiscovered deposits.  </p>
<p>Breeders reactors can use many other isotopes (including U-238, the more common uranium isotope), and they can create fissile isotopes from non-fissile isotopes using neutron capture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't strictly true, as there is some breeding occurring in LWRs, particularly in boiling water reactors, as some of the U238 is converted into PU239, and that is then used to generate energy. There just isn't sufficient breeding occurring to maintain the reaction until all the U238 is used up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't call U-235 &quot;extremely rare&quot;- it makes up 0.72% of natural uranium.  Also, I wouldn't say that LWRs are &quot;ludicrously inefficient&quot;, given the absolutely massive amount of energy that can be generated from 1 kg of reactor fuel.  They certainly aren't on the same level as predicted efficiency for modern breeder reactor designs, but LWRs still produce quite a lot of energy from a small fuel mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uranium is more common than Gold. However, it also tends to be thinly distributed so you would have to sift through other elements to concentrate it, which is where the cost of producing it comes from.</p>
<p>The value human society places on raw resources tends to come from a balanced equation on how much it costs to dig something up and process it versus how much you can sell it for. Uranium is 'worthless' for the most part because you primarily can only use it after processing it into fuel, and then you only use it in expensive power plants or to create apocalypse-causing weapons.</p>
<p>Uranium isn't the only material we're close to using up the easy-to-obtain stuff, by the way. Sand used to make concrete is very quickly getting used up, and one day we'll hit a point where all that good sand will be locked up in concrete, and eventually we will have to go pillage every small beach and go around testing every inch of dirt to locate secret stashes of that sand, or build huge energy-gobbling tumblers to properly weather sand into the kind we need for construction projects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It used high temperature reprocessing, known as pyroprocessing, rather than the traditional aqueous method. The reason it was considered a low proliferation risk was the reprocessing was done in the same place as the reactor, meaning the fuel didnâ€™t have to be transported - reducing the chances of it getting diverted to weapons, conventional or improvised. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm late to the party but I'm glad you've pointed this out. I always see a lot of misinformation about nuclear power on Reddit where everyone seems to assume fission it's the cleanest, most efficient energy source in the world because we can 'just use Thorium', 'it can all be reprocessed' or 'stick it in a breeder reactor'. This really isn't the case at all as we're so far away from having any of these systems be commercially viable which is the key driver for the industry unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>
