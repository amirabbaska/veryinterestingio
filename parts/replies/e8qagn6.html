			<div class="markdown"><p>Im glad to say i just made a post generally along your lines.  Someone said stainless is stronger and compared high yield stainless to 1018.  I mean theres a lot of factors other than yield.</p>
<p>Naval weatherdeck door bolts must remain adjustable for watertightness and a stainless bolt is specified.  These bolts spot rust then stop.  They're not like the stainless cladding of the Chrylser building, they actually look a little shabby.  But they depassivate and rust then the process stops again.  They are inspected and replaced but they tend to last decades.  </p>
<p>In other cases the rust may get started on a saltwater exposed stainless bolt and it's now junk.  </p>
<p>Just depends on what you select and how much you wanna spend.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In my industry, chlorine contamination is particuarly bad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here in the Netherlands we had some issues a few years ago when a loudspeaker installation in a swimming pool came crashing down and killed someone. Apparently they used the wrong kind of steelfor the bolts, and over time they corroded because of the chlorine vapors.</p>
<p>They then had to inspect and replace all stainless hardware in swimming pools.</p>
<p>These kinds of things are precisely why we need trained engineers and regulations to prevent people from making these mistakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres a lot of examples particularly with swimming pools where the roof collapses due to  corrosion and SCC in stainless roof structures. Its killed a lot of people over the years. All the Cholrine in the water,plus bodily fluid,heat and humidity are a perfect recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>My &quot;favourite&quot; annecdote is that in the investigstion after one of them the builder remarked that &quot;they noticed browning on the structure. On closer inspection it turned out to be rust, not corrosion so was ignored&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
