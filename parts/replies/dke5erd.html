			<div class="markdown"><p>While the other posts here make a great historical linguistic point, I also your post illuminates explains it on a more basic level (and maybe the underlying reason for the linguistic rules mentioned elsewhere). The tightness and quickness of the I sound make it seem like something is coming after, while an O or A sound are longer, more drawn out, and suggest a settling or a conclusion. </p>
<p>Essentially, the I sound, especially in the Tick Tock example, creates the same effect as when you put an up emphasis on the last syllable of a sentence. It is less of a declaration than any of the other vowel sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me just jump in here and explain that English vowels are uttered from the back to the front of the mouth in the order of A, E, I, O, U.  Just say or mouth the vowels A, E, I, O, U in an exaggerated fashion, and you will find your lips going from grin to pucker.  At the same time,  a part of your tongue falls and rises.  Now say an elongated &quot;OW!&quot;  The same thing will happen. This is the order that English prefers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know whether you're talking about the pronunciation of the letters A E I O U, or something else, but that's wrong.</p>
<p>The vowels in the pronunciation of A and E are front vowels.</p>
<p>I is a diphthong, is either back-front or mid-front or even front-front depending on how you say it.</p>
<p>O and U are back vowels. Lip rounding is not related. </p>
<p>(A and O are diphthongs too, but they stay at the same front-backness, so it's not important).</p>
<p>Edit: Much of this is based on American English, but the point should stand no matter the English you speak.</p></div>		</li>
