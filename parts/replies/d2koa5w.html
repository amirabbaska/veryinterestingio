<p>Beyond that, they likely have built relationships with the restaurants they sell to that rely on the fact that they are a business-to-business vendor, which helps keep products &quot;exclusive&quot; and prices lower. Restaurants might start looking elsewhere if the wholesaler were to start a consumer outlet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to tack onto this. The whole sale buys forks from manufacturing companies for $.10 sells forks for $1 to big box stores only. The Big box store sells them for $5 to customers. Everyone makes profit.</p>
<p>If the wholesale sells to end consumers (you) for $1 than target loses out on $4. And for the &quot;benefit&quot; of selling direct to you, they could lose their business with Target, which is much bigger more steady source of revenue.</p>
<p>There are direct to consumer wholesale companies, but they likely never sold to other companies to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Until the wholesaler has to increase its staff to handle am the consumers who used to go to Target but now can't get their forks there so they come to the wholesaler.... and eventually the forks cost $6 because running a fork store isn't as profitable as being either a true wholesaler or a department store....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its efficient to visit a store like Target to find lots of things you need in one place. I don't want to have to visit the fork factory, paper plate factory, bread factory, soda factory, ketchup factory, pickle factory. . . etc</p>
<p>every time I throw a BBQ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the wholesaler can't afford it, so they'll just go out of business if they tried to sell directly to consumer and remove that &quot;inefficiency&quot;. Retail is god damn expensive; why do you think Amazon is kicking mall stores in the ass and forcing Best Buy and Walmart to price match them? The staff and space and decoration for dealing in person with small-volume customers costs a lot. The full $5 isn't very much profit for anyone involved anyway, no one is gouging on forks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One is that what you think is a 'large quantity' could be their smallest sale ever, so it's possible they're not saying goodbye to much money, relatively speaking.</p>

<p>This comes up on the electronics subreddits sometimes.  Someone will come in and ask &quot;Where's the best place to get LARGE QUANTITIES of LEDs?  I want to buy in bulk and get a discount&quot;.  &quot;Well, how many do you want?&quot; &quot;Oh 200, 300, maybe even as many as <em>500</em>&quot;.  &quot;So rolls of LEDs are typically in the 5,000 to 15,000 range, and if you want a bulk order you're probably talking 100,000 minimum, probably 500,000 before a manufacturer will think of talking to you directly.  Just buy from Digikey or Mouser like everyone else.&quot;</p>
<p>I've also seen it in the DIY/homeimprovement subreddits.  Someone is renovating their house and wants to buy their drywall in bulk for a discount.  Have to explain to them that a) drywall is a commodity, even Home Depot isn't marking it up that much because the market forces it to be around the same price, so it's harder to get a bulk discount, and b) one house's worth of drywall is the basic order for almost everyone that matters, not 'bulk'.  Most construction supply places I know wouldn't think of cutting you a discount for a single order, you need to be making purchases like that several times a month before you might get a discount.  A developer might sign an agreement to buy 200 houses worth of materials, and <em>that</em> would get them a discount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly I work in Electrical wholes and we do sell to anybody. It's hilarious to me that some jackass will come in and buy $100 worth of stuff and think he's doing me a favor. It will take me 2 hours to get him to figure out what he actually needs and it's a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>On the flip side I'll check my e-mail and have an order for $200,000 that takes me 10 minutes to process. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I'm in scrap metal sales and the same thing happens.  Some small yard will want to haggle with me for an hour over $100 on a 5,000 lb load, while a 250,000 lb order with a big company will get set up in 5 minutes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I'm in the wholesalers I find my smallest orders usually take the longest time to sort out. I'll order Â£10,000 worth of cable one week and it'll take me 5 mins to sort but when I'm needing smaller items it usually takes 25-30 minutes discussing what I actually require</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I help everyone, I help small customers and big customers. </p>
<p>I have no issue with helping small customers as long as they understand it. I would say 50% of my customers are small $10,000-$20,000 dollar annually customers. The moment a small customer becomes entitled I usually just tell them to shop elsewhere. I'm also very upfront with people about how much time I can spend with them. </p>
<p>I actually like my job because I can help people find solutions. The small customers are usually more appreciative of the help.</p></div>		</li>
