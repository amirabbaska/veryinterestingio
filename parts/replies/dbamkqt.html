<p>So what you do is make the exam super hard, and then scale the grades so that they fit a bell curve</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bell curves are really out of style these days (outside of competitive law schools) because they <em>force</em> students to fail, even if they do adequately.   It's far more common to &quot;curve&quot; a test by just calling &quot;100%&quot; some arbitrary number based on the top score (possibly throwing out an outlier or two) and grading linearly from there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of my favorite memories from college is rolling into a calc4 final knowing I only needed a little over 50% to 4.0 the class. I completed half and walked out. </p>
<p>I ended up getting a 3.5 because... I'm not nearly as smart as I thought I was... on the plus side I got out early enough to see a shell shocked looking girl petting a duck outside the math building (god knows how she even got ahold of it)</p>
<p>Second favorite memory. A physics exam - yet again me thinking I'm smarter than actually I am - I got basically 100 on the first test (class avg in the 60s). So I decide I'm home free and I don't study for the next test. The second test is one of those murder college style scantrons where you have ~10 options per question. All the questions are all or nothing. I made a small error on every single question (class avg even worse this test). I almost certainly would have failed the class without a curve. </p>
<p>Curves are great. </p></div>		</li>

<li>What you're describing makes no sense with how grading on a bell curve works </li>
<li>What the parent comment describes would still allow for a similar outcome for the middle students </li>
</ol>
<p>There are different types of curves. He was specifically talking about a bell curve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an educator I disagree with this methodology vehemently. Students should be learning and tested on the material and how well they know it. Not how well they know it in reference to each other.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me ask you something: If every student who takes a test gets between a 60% (hard fail) and 100% (A+). Wouldn't everyone's time be saved by just not bothering to ask the 'easy' questions that the 60% students get right?  </p>
<p>And now, if we're doing that, would it not also perhaps be interesting to use some of that freed up time to try and differentiate the 'A' students whom are inevitably cramed into a deforemd bell curve that has to be fitted into a narrow sc?  </p>
<p>I used to help write tests like the OP is describing (i.e. where 'bad' scores were passing), we broke the questions up into 4 parts:<br />
40% of the points were things the students needed to know. If they didn't they were not going to pass the class.<br />
30% of the points were things that required in depth understanding of the individual topics in the material. Generally students were expected to get some of these points.<br />
20% of the points were things that required understanding not only of the individual topics but their relationships with each other. Most students couldn't do these at all, very good students could get some points here.<br />
10% of the points were for profound insight. Maybe 1 student every few years hit this level.<br />
When the class and tests worked well the result was very nice bell curves centered on 50-60%.  </p>
<p>In other words a 40 might be a passing grade because a 40 represents the amount of knowledge needed to have a basic understanding of the material. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what happens when you've designed your test to be bell curved and everyone gets below 20% on the original? </p>
<p>Edit: I've never felt the need to rank students so no I don't see the point in putting on nearly impossible questions just to differentiate them into an order. If 60% of the students all get the right answer that's great, I've done my job making sure that they know the necessary information that they took the class to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to play devil's advocate, all we ever do is rate how well we do in relation to our peers. Why should education be any different?</p>
<p>Personally, though, I do think it is a good idea to err on the side of making the tests too hard as opposed to too easy. But this is mostly so that I can figure out what they did and didn't learn.</p></div>		</li>
