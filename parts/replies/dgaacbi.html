			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically you're saying that the oxidize the bacteria to death? Another question, then. If it kills bacteria, why doesn't it irritate my skin when it touches me? My cells aren't chemically all that different from bacteria, right?</p>
<p>Thanks very much for the answer, it was very informative!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Touch a copper door handle. Then smell your hand. Now smell the handle.</p>
<p>The handle barely smells of metal. Your hand smells a lot of metal. The reason why is because your dead skin cells on the surface took in all of those copper atoms that would normally oxidize the bacteria, and then when you smell your hand you smell all those dead cells that are coated with copper. Also, we are big. The amount of copper to soak through our outer skin layer into our inner skin, and eventually our inner organs would be an insane amount, but it's possibly feasible. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Now to build a giant copper death trap.  Saw 10 escape the room of copper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. So how about in terms of having an IUD for 10 years. Not only is that skin much thinner, but how can it make sure to kill all the sperm 99.9% of the time? It's just a little T of copper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be my hypothesis... see disclaimer about not being a biologist.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind bacteria are single celled organisms.  Kill one cell and that's game over.  Humans have an epidermis with a layer of &quot;dead&quot; skin that is highly protective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Random person here, I'd guess that it has to do with the size of our cells. The average animal cell is usually much much larger than the average bacterial cell.</p></div>		</li>
