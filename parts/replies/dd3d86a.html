			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course it does, the answer is that the question is not relevant any more. There is nothing wrong with asking a question but sometimes you just have to say that the answer is only theoretical because practically speaking it is not going to happen.</p>
<p>Presidents can and do break the constitution and do not get impeached, they break the law but do not get punished via constitutional means. </p>
<p>The warrantless mass wiretapping of US citizens by the Bush administration is another example, it was illegal, it was unconstitutional, it seems obviously a impeachable offence but all you have to do is say terrorism and nothing happened, some people made a lot of noise about it for a while, including the opposition party at that time but as soon as they gained power many of the abuses were codified into law by Obama instead of being completely cut back.</p>
<p>Of course my answer reeks of politics, it is after all a highly political question. In my defence I am critical of both political parties and the courts, I do not support either side either, politics is not a team sport after all.</p></div>		</li>
