			<div class="markdown"><p>Aerospace engineer here. I want to reiterate that for a given engine the optimal altitude can be calculated precisely, and for all turbojets and turbofans it's somewhere near 30,000 feet. Air at low altitudes is dense but it's hot, and this heat makes it less efficient to extract energy out of it by burning it with fuel. At high altitudes it's cooler, which is good, but too high and the air becomes too thin, reducing the amount of oxygen you can stuff into the engine. The actual aerodynamics of the craft are adjusted around the engines ideal cruise altitude.</p>
<p>When things go supersonic the design gets more complicated, but commercial airlines travel at speeds right around the boundary where the compressibility of air starts to matter (mach 0.8ish). Obviously commercial airlines are entirely about minimizing costs, so fuel efficiency is pretty much king.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks for clarifying that, I didnt think temperature and engine performance would play a greater factor than thickness of atmosphere. kinda thought why they would still just build turbo-props to go higher? </p>
<p>Im gonna guess its because most turboprops are doing hour flights tops? theyd be descending before theyd even reach cruise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SirJelly finally mentioned a major point that has been missing. Jet engine thermal efficiency is a major part of the reason for the ideal cruise altitudes we see, it should be mentioned in the top comment. </p>
<p>To give you more info, the atmosphere (barring localised weather conditions) cools at a constant rate with increasing altitude up until you reach ~10,000m. See [this graph]
(<a href="http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/images/atmslayers.gif" target="_blank">http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/images/atmslayers.gif</a>) it's not a coincidence we fly at the corner of the first isotherm. </p>
<p>Thermal efficiency of a jet / turbo fan engine is proportional to the ratio between ambient temperature and max internal temperature.  Simplified, thermal efficiency = 1 -  (T_ambient)/(T_Internal). So all the time you're increasing altitude you're increasing your engines efficiency. But once you reach the isotherm at ~10,000 metres you no longer get any increased efficiency with increasing altitude.</p>
<p>Thrust, lift and skin friction drag all scale down with density but eventually with increasing altitude you need to travel at speeds where transonic effects dominate drag just to maintain the same lift which would ruin efficiency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The earliest planes, before 1960 were unpressurized.  They had to keep altitude low in order to keep the passengers alive.  Also, propeller efficiency drops when the air gets too thin (they need something to &quot;bite&quot; into).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they designed to have their optimal altitudes at 30,000 feet because that's the best place to fly anyways for the dozens of other reasons. So if hypothetically the best place to fly was 5000 feet, would we have differently designed engines  that would be optimal for that altitude. Seems like we probably would. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a knot, or nautical mile. its used to measure wind and the speed of airplanes and boats since its in a slightly better reference to the curvature of the earth. 1kt = 1.151 mph. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A knot != nautical mile. It's one nautical mile per hour; a measure of speed, not distance. Otherwise you are correct, though the &quot;better reference to the curvature of the Earth&quot; is dependent on where on Earth you are (at the equator it's correct by definition, by 50 degrees N/S kilometres are a better approximation of arc minutes). Given that I imagine the differences from altitude may matter as well.</p></div>		</li>
