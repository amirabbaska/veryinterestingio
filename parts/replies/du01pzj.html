			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's how I explain the concept of orbiting to young children: If you throw a baseball, it will fall in an arc and hit the ground.  If you throw it harder, it will travel farther, and the arc will be longer and more shallow.  There is a speed at which you can throw the ball, which will produce an arc that matches the curvature of the Earth.  If you do that, it falls endlessly over the horizon.  It's now in orbit around the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A cannon sitting on a mountaintop firing horizontally is often used too... Ignoring air resistance, there is some speed where the ground would fall away from the cannonball due to the curvature of the earth at the exact same rate the cannonball is falling towards it, and the cannonball would eventually hit the back of the cannon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I love about it is that there's scene in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (it's in one of the sequels, not the original book) where it's stated that flying is just throwing yourself at the ground and missing. And that's actually pretty much how orbits work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note, though, that this is not negating the force of gravity (as the fictional material Cavorite would) but merely cancelling it out with an opposing force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would feel similar to weightlessness though, right? As I understand it, a human floating this way would experience a support force on every water molecule inside them so they wouldn't even feel the weight of their topside on their bottomside.</p>
<p>Or is that already possible by floating in saltwater? I feel like it'd be different?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gravity is pulling them down, but there is nothing stopping them from accelerating so they experience the sensation of weightlessness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is something that's in orbit around the Earth in constant acceleration towards the Earth?</p></div>		</li>
