			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fascinating question. I am not aware of the latest in this field, which is a bit outside of my area of focus. There likely could be opportunities to use CRISPR to explore telomere biology and mechanisms of cellular aging. However, there would be significant challenges to figure out how to use CRISPR to manipulate these pathways safely in cells throughout the human body to reverse aging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem of telomeres shortened by aging or chronic inflammation (smoking, certain infectious diseases...) is that the shortening actually protects against cancer, since the highly mutated cells are unable to replicate. You could potentially activate telomerase (which increases telomere length) in aged people, potentially holding back aging worst traits but that comes at an increased risk of cancer. For that purpose CRISPR is not needed, there are better theorical tools for that (which don't work exactly well in humans for now) </p>
<p>That said, CRISPR should be great to treat telomere diseases such as dyskeratosis, which are manifested early in life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well CRISPR would introduce cells that live forever that end up being cancer. I don't think it can fix it because then you'd have so many cancer cells that you have to go back and try to kill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CRISPR technology is advancing really fast, while cancer is just.... Really complex. That's why there is no real cure for cancer (cancer develop resistance for chemicals, immunity system may overlook cancerous cells, surgery dont guarrantee cure since a single &quot;cancer stem cell&quot; can repopulate... Etc). CRISPR is a really powerful tool but I can't see it applied locally in cancer and, if done, non-transformant cancer cells would repopulate the tumour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cells aren't dividing much anyways, under physiological conditions. And stem cells which do divide have telomerase activity anyways. Telomeres do not protect against cancer by stopping division, rather they protect against DNA damage at the end of the chromosomes at division. It's a great misconception, likely coming from everybody working with cell cultures (esp. in toxicology): most cells do not divide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do divide nonetheless, and telomerase activity does not prevent telomere shortening in stem cells, it does rather slow the process down considerably. In any case, short telomeres do cause replicative senescence, stopping cell replication, and it does prevent cancer appearance. Yes, mosy cells do not divide and we could talk about how much does skin cells divide vs heart, but its not the topic here</p></div>		</li>
