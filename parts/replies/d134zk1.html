			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out that they probably don't use cryptological hashes (the ones that change completely if a single pixel changes), but ones that for similar images compute similar values. That way you don't only get perfect matches, but can find images that hashed to similar values as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is very likely that what they're using for this is an artificial neural network. Google was at the absolute bleeding edge of neural networks in 2014 and is only outdone by a small, small number of researchers now. They won the most notable neural network competition for image recognition in 2014, although Microsoft took the victory late in 2015.</p>
<p>One thing that neural networks are really good at is taking and image and reducing it from thousands or millions of bytes of raw data down to a few tens of bytes or less, where images that are semantically similar will be very close at the end, even if they're very different on a pixel level (e.g. a picture of an elephant from two perspectives. Both are elephants, but there's very poor agreement between the individual pixels).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They probably do use cryptographic hashes, but not exclusively.  They primarily want to know what images look the same, but they <em>also</em> want to know what images are exactly the same.  They like to know how files propagate around the internet, after all.</p>
<p>You're correct that from the user point of view, the hash is not terribly useful in reverse image search.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't help them identify images except for exact matches. But they store hashes because it helps them filter malicious content from their search results as well as files uploaded by their gmail and drive users. They use it identify illegal content too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really doubt it uses hashes, there's some memes of google image searches which aren't quite right and they're funny because they do look similar, but they clearly are not identical. They use computer vision to do their image search I think.</p>
<p>A better way to look at this is that there's a high order function which correlates to the features in an image and their spatial relationship to one another, and google is comparing this to what's in their database.</p></div>		</li>
