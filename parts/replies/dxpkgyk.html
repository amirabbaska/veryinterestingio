			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure of the build material, but every boat I ever had required desalination after being used in salt water. Basically had to hook up to a fresh water hose and run clean water through it. </p>
<p>Boats also have a sacrificial anode (To counteract galvanic corrosion you add a third metal into the circuit, one that is quicker than the other two to give up its electrons. This piece of metal is most often zinc.) Essentially the saltwater corrodes the replaceable metal first before the engine.</p></div>		</li>
