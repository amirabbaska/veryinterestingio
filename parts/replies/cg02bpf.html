			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only guess for the same reason it says 02 above it! I feel like we wandered into an introduction to two digit numbers as well. And it's <em>3, and the </em> is NOT multiplication in first grade! Again just uneducated spitballing here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using an asterisk in math for anything other than a multiplication symbol is just fucking over the teacher who eventually has to teach multiplication.</p>
<p>It's non-standard, irresponsible, and counter productive to consistent teaching principles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked my 4th grader if she could solve it and she had no idea.</p>
<p>I'm not going to pile on to the &quot;this is dumb&quot; masses in here. I am quite sure there was a lecture supporting this, right? Here in my district teachers will send out update emails and sometimes they will have links to information about assignments. Maybe you got one of those?</p>
<p>If not, then the district's got some 'splainin' to do because it's silly to send this home without instructions.</p>
<p>But like /u/IdmeetEgo said, I strongly believe this is a ... I don't know the word, but like a reinforcing lesson, an alternative way to think about concepts they've been touching on already. I say that because for my kid at least it's very common that the math teacher will present multiple ways of solving the same problem. Some I'm familiar with, others are foreign (lattice multiplication).</p>
<p>Give your kid's teacher the benefit of the doubt IMO, ask them if they have supplemental materials or links to the teaching method being used here so you can help at home. A misprint or typo is the least likely answer to why we don't understand this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not &quot;sum&quot;.  This is expressly NOT teaching arithmetic.  </p>
<p>&quot;*&quot; means &quot;skip over&quot;.  It's an exercise in moving along the number line using operators.  It is, in fact, the very essence of mathematics.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What kind of sorry ass school sends a kid homework without instructions for the parents to check it and go over it? I'd flip shit if that happened, education doesn't stop at school. Although, maybe it's intentional, so the parents don't figure out how brain meltingly retarded their lessons are.</p></div>		</li>
