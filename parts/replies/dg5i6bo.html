			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess so, becuase otherwise how would you know it was worth anything.  I just figure if someone sees something weird on their car that wasn't part of the car, they'd get rid of it without thinking about it, so there should be a strong presumption against charges in that situation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If a police officer were to just follow you in his/her vehicle while you drive home; you have lost some level of privacy but haven't been unreasonably searched for example.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is partially why I said the CIA works differently; And also, just because the CIA is not authorized to work ops in the U.S. does not mean they are not working ops on U.S. citizens located outside the country. </p>
<p>Also just because the citizen is outside of the country doesn't mean that their rights are completely suspended, therefore the CIA is held to similar, yet different standards when executing ops where U.S. citizens are concerned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. But strictly speaking regarding operating in the States, there couldn't possibly be rules regulating how they <em>would</em> work, even though they shouldn't? Seems irrational. Then again, it wouldn't surprise me, which is why i ask. xD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate that there are loopholes, like having a liaison from another agency added to an op to legitimize it, that's well understood. My question has to do with the wording that they work differently. I think it would stand to reason that they have zero limitations on how they work, if their working is practically illegal in the first place...</p></div>		</li>
