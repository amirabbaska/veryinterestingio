			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that. Maybe it's just me but if I were the guy in the above article, I'd prefer a specialized wheelchair to the iron lung just for the sake of ease in moving about on a day-to-day basis. I know he's paralyzed either way, but I can imagine he really can't move the contraption at all without help, whereas he could at least get around the house with a chair.</p>
<p>Also the whole &quot;being horizontal 24/7 and staring up at  the ceiling&quot; thing makes me really uncomfortable. Then again, I guess it's all he's ever really known.</p></div>		</li>
