			<div class="markdown"><p>Playgrounds just aren't fun anymore.  My city revamped the park across my street this year.  They spent $250k on a boring park.  The swing sets are way too short, maybe 9 feet high.  The chain is so short that any kid over the age of five (anyone who can swing by themselves) gets bored in 2 minutes.  </p>
<p>They put a merry go round in.  But it has a freaking brake on it so it's impossible and exhausting to push.  Forget about spinning fast enough to get dizzy.  The teeter totter is just a piece of junk, it only oscillates 20 degrees up and down.  The slides are textured, so they're so slow you have to scoot to actually go down.</p>
<p>We killed fun in the name of safety.  And then we wonder why our kids are so fat and they play Xbox all day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They got these jungle gums with bars that all are twisted and contorted in weird directions. There are weird rock climbing wall things and spinny tilted floodgate wheels that you hang from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really?  This playground set was built by little tykes.  It does have the platforms and rope ladders too, so it's not garbage.  But the swings are garbage as are the slides and the merry go round.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw 2 people doing touch up on a local playground set and their truck was licensed for a state 1,000 miles away. I talked to them and found out they were specially &quot;licensed&quot; to paint the equipment. This was using a standard paintbrush to apply paint from a gallon of standard paint after using a standard wire brush to clean it. The city already had full time maintenance people on staff just for the park.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder what the stats were on permanent injuries on old playground equipment. Like not a broken arm that will heal, but stuff that is actually worth worrying about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - these are cool. There is another one on Berkley.  They are by no means the norm though.  The average parks and rec department would lose it over the mere thought of this.  </p></div>		</li>
