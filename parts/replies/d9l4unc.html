<p>F.I. The bridge between Denmark and Sweden is 16 years old and needs to be repainted. This is difficult out on the water and during traffic. The estimated time for the paint job using robots is 16 years, so it needs to be repainted as soon as it has been painted..</p>
<p>It just goes to show that the maintenance is sometimes more difficult than the construction. This entire bridge was build in 9 years (the original paint was done while on land).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are doing just that. I don't know exactly what they will use, but it is different from the original due to environmental concerns.
They could obviously paint it faster simply by using more robots, so I think it's more a matter of accepting that this a continuous task.</p>
<p>Another example is the Golden Gate in San Francisco which is also being painted continuously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just building an occupiable office building should be enough, given the parameters, so maintenance isn't really an issue. The only problem with maintenance is attempting to maintain it as you're building it. </p></div>		</li>
