			<div class="markdown"><p>I am very sorry, but as an animal researcher I am not familiar enough with memantine to share an opinion or give you advice. If other members readying this AMA could pitch in, that would be super helpful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of continuing this question; I am wondering if upregulation of BDNF via memantine's action as a low-affinity antagonist of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors is thought to be the underlying neuroprotective mechanism that guides its use as a pharmacological intervention? I've heard that glutamate excitotoxicity is a part of AD's (and other psychiatric disorders') etiology and am wondering if memantine may help attenuate this issue in a particular brain region? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a potential mechanism for memantine action, however from what I understand additional research is needed to make these conclusions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently asked my father about this who is a neurologist and he said that people with higher IQs have a lower chance of developing AD, or develop it at slower rates, so we can assume that staying sharp and focused through activities that challenge your intellect, eg chess, can help prevent or slow down AD. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP...people with higher degrees (bachelors, masters, etc.) seem to have better cognition in old age in general.  I'm not sure about AD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there was a study I believe that talked about how puzzles, math problems, memory games, chess/pattern recognition tactic puzzles can all assist with slowing/stopping AD.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Disappointing, but still better than nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for sharing. In mouse models at least, I don't believe such a relationship has been described (i.e., mice that learn faster are less susceptible to develop AD).</p></div>		</li>
