			<div class="markdown"><p>correct, and the &quot;straight path&quot; is called a &quot;geodesic&quot;. this is true for any path where gravity is the only acting force, including the orbit of a planet around a star. that always gets me: orbits are straight lines in a curved 4d spacetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Either way, the source ray and the received ray are not coincident and I'm pretty sure everyone knows that's exactly what /u/KernelTaint meant, no matter the mechanism by which those rays are not coincident. And in saying this, he's right to clarify that /u/PowerOfRiceNoodles' comment &quot;light always travels in a straight line&quot; is at least a little bit wrong.</p>
<p>Aside from that, what about reflection off of space dust, or any other body?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Airglow occurs throughout much/all of the atmosphere while the other two occur largely along the ecliptic plane on which the planets rotate around the Sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The is probably the best answer I saw, based on how I interpreted the original question.  Pixels on a camera or apertures on a spectrometer have very small fields of view - the angular extent from which the aperture can receive light.  So basically you only get light from what you're pointing at, unless there is scattering going on that scatters light from outside the field of view into it, which is a very small effect in professional astronomy because of the altitude.  The only other isse would be if the field of view has more than one obect in it, a binary star for example.  Then you will get multiple spectra summed together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I routinely work with images that have multiple objects that are basically hitting the same pixels. However, we can usually isolate the effect we're looking at to the brightest object of the variability we're seeing is so great that it can't be coming from a fainter star</p>
<p>So for example, a 1% dimming event may be a small dimming around the bright star we're observing, or it could be a 50% dimming caused by a much fainter binary star system that is close to the same position in the sky.</p></div>		</li>
