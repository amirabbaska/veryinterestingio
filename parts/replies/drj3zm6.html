			<div class="markdown"><p>Pigment size is part of the answer you're looking for. The red of blood comes from a large molecule called heme, found in hemoglobin—the same protein that carries oxygen. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Heme_b.svg/200px-Heme_b.svg.png" target="_blank">See this lovely little dreamcatcher?</a> </p>
<p>The iron in the center is what binds oxygen, but it also rocks back and forth at the kind of frequency that produces visible light—which lets it reflect red like a small antenna. Due to its size, and the fact that it's generally bound to larger proteins in red blood cells, it's not going to work its way into the nooks and crannies of your skin the way that something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betalain" target="_blank">betalains—the red of beets</a>—might.</p>
<p>P.S. Fun facts! Chlorophyll bears a striking resemblance to heme, only with magnesium instead of iron—it's that same dreamcatcher structure that lets it catch photons and turn them into useful work. Green is to plants as red is to most animals, in a very literal way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That, and blood's pigment is in the red-blood cells, which are probably too big to get soaked-into the outer layers of dry, dead skin.</p>
<p>Ink's pigment molecules are much, much smaller, and dissolved in a solvent, soak right into the outer layers of skin.</p>
<p>Your skin is blood-proof. Which is good when you think about it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>really cool - looked up the molecular structure of chlorophyll - do we know of any other molecules with this shape?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Markers use ink. Ink is specifically designed to stick to just about anything. So it's a mix of your skin not being particularly susceptible to things sticking to it, and blood not being made of ink</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ink is a fine enough liquid that can get into your pours and tiny cracks in your skin. It's not a stain really it's just hard to clean out those tiny areas so it dries there. This is why workman hands are always dirty. They are so rough and full of imperfections that are perfect for dirt to build up. He might have washed his hands 4 times with mr.power exfoliating soap but it's not going to get the deep stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And ink sticks to most stuff by drying quickly. I'm pretty sure if you were to hold blood next to your skin while it's drying it'll leave a mark. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Marker doesn't stick THAT well to skin.
Even sharpies will wear off very quickly once you get sweaty. </p>
<p>Ink sticks better to skin than a lot of things, but it also rubs off pretty easy.</p>
<p>Although never when you actually want it gone. Then it lives there forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will add that the fabric absorb the blood, and then let the water out while keeping trapped the red blood cells, and more 'solid'. Getting those out is very hard as it cling to everything.</p>
<p>Your skin is already coloured, and the little stain do not show up much. Also, the skin is kinda smooth and will not absorb the bigger stuff like the red blood cells, or else they would also leak out. Water can't even really pass throught the skin, it can rehydrate the dead skin layer somewhat. but will also get out easilly.</p></div>		</li>
