<ul>
<li>You'll need: 1 straw (needle), 1 knife or scissors (the tip of the needle), 1 piece of paper (the skin)</li>
<li>Take the paper and cut a short single line in it. About as wide as the straw is thick. This is the needle piercing the skin.</li>
<li>Now push the straw through the hole.</li>
<li>See! No paper is stuck in the straw.</li>
<li>Pull out the straw, and what was a round hole a second ago, is now mostly back to being a line.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to, you can put a band-aid on the paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. If so, our bodies would be very gelatin-like and we would fall apart by a small slice. Every organ in your body (your skin is an organ) builds it's cells into a massive web of frameworks. </p>
<p>Take a spider web. A fly getting caught in it is a cell. Add a whole bunch of flies onto that web and you develop a layer of flies that aren't moving anywhere but are stuck in place. Now do that in the third dimension and you get thickness.</p>
<p>The paper is basically just the web framework, just more stiff.</p></div>		</li>
