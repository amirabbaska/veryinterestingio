			<div class="markdown"><p>It would need to be in a specialized pressure vessel to enable it to boil water with enough pressure. </p>
<p>A pressure vessel is susceptible to rupture. This means you need an emergency core cooling system and tons of control systems. Itâ€™s extremely expensive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They put the fuel into a pool, and (maybe) pump it through radiators.  The fuel doesn't produce much heat at all, so it's possible the open air is enough to cool the water.  It's not as dangerous as you'd think.  Heck, divers go in the pool all the time.  There's actually <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/29/" target="_blank">less radiation</a> a few feet down in the pool than there is outside.</p>
<p>Based on that piece though, the filters are still going to be radioactive.  Just from the small particulate matter.</p>
<p>Life after people talked about &quot;death clouds&quot;, but the truth is if the cooling system shut down, the water would take weeks to months to evaporate away.  Even then, the exposed fuel would merely make the containment building radioactive.  There's very little danger.*</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spend rods just sit in the pool of water, the water is enough to dissipate the heat without circulation through a heat exchanger, and acts as a radiation barrier (the water).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're overestimating how much heat is actually produced. It's so little that ambient losses would lose more heat than the heat that could potentially be gained.</p></div>		</li>
