			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, but culling the population is a firm of breeding control right? In your example, if we don't just train one wolf, but instead we kill all the wolves that aren't docile, then slowly the population also becomes docile.</p>
<p>Similarly couldn't that be said of another animal or insect species? Let's say ants farm the aphids, but they kill all the aphids that don't behave to their benefit, then ultimately over time they would be causing overall change to their benefit in the relationship. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes it's a form of breeding control, but it is not a method of domestication.</p>
<p>Culling is used to eliminate specific undesirable animals (like those that are sick or unusually small or weak) or to maintain a desired number or gender ratio in a group of animals. Killing all the animals without the specific trait you want is impossible because you'd end up wiping out the species. Culling doesn't introduce new and desirable traits to animal populations, it simply eliminates undesirable ones. </p>
<p>In essence, it is used to maintain the status quo of a group of animals, whereas the goal of selective breeding is to change the animals. </p>
<p>I don't think the ants are actually culling the aphids either, because as far as I know they eat them only occasionally and not with a specific trait in mind. </p>
<p>Culling involves the deliberate selection of individual animals for elimination based on the undesirable traits those individuals have, and ants don't seem to be doing that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the response! If a species had higher functioning intelligence, like a dolphin or grey parrot, do you believe this behavior could develop under certain circumstances if sufficiently beneficial? Or is this strictly a human behavior? </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>From the floppy ears of dogs to the curly tails of pigs, domesticated animals sport a different look from their wild cousins—a look that scientists chalked up to human intervention. Now, a new study of wild mice shows that they, too, can develop signs of domestication—white fur patches and short snouts—with hardly any human influence. The work suggests that the mice are able to tame themselves, and that other animals like dogs may have done the same before they were fully domesticated by humans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the first study to show that self-taming can produce the same traits as human-directed domestication</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I realize we're just discussing semantics now, but the difference between &quot;domestication&quot; and &quot;self-taming&quot; is the deliberateness of the process. </p>
<p>It's not just that domesticated animals are genetically distinct from their wild counterparts, it's that this genetic difference was introduced on purpose. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't believe that's any kind of part of the definition of domestication. From what I've read about the domestication of most animals (both &quot;house&quot; animals likes dogs and cats and livestock animals), the initial steps of the process were very much accidental and involved as much &quot;self-taming&quot; at the population level as intentional control of their breeding by humans, if not quite a bit more. Controlled breeding of domestic animals to create even more specific phenotypes then comes after the initial domestication, in most cases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, because the most important part of domestication is control of breeding</p>

<p>Why is that? Is there a scientific definition to domestication?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Domestication is essentially genetic modification and dependence on the domesticating species arising from interference with the natural breeding cycle of a species over several generations. You let the ones you like breed, you care for them, and years later you have subservient, dependent little buddies. </p>
<p>Taming is the process of making an individual animal tolerant to the presence of humans.</p>
<p>If you want an interesting example look at foxes. Domesticated foxes exist in very small numbers and can be purchased for vast sums of money. The scientist who domesticated them spent decades doing it. </p></div>		</li>
