			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, quite easily. The reason we don't is 3 part. 1 whatever we launch has to be able to survive ludicrous acceleration which means humans definitely can't take that ride. 2 We have to have some way of slowing it down once we get it to LEO which generally makes it too costly to be worth doing. 3rd and absolutely the most important, Rail guns are not very reusable. Every shot burns rails up like crazy so even if you give a cooling period between shots you'll still end up with unusably deformed rails in short order. This is the same reason we don't just have 100% rail gun equipped ships right now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 is not an issue because 1 is the issue.  Also, getting to space is easy, staying in space is the hard part.  </p>
<p>Earth's escape velocity is 11,000 m/s. </p>
<p>The dragon capsule reaches about 11,111 m/s to get into/stay in orbit, the US navy's railgun max velocity is 2,520 m/s, aka nowhere fucking close</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the rail guns suffer from the same damage when they're fired within an atmosphere?  There wouldn't be any gas to heat up as the projectile travels down the barrel, so there should be less wear and tear in space.</p>
<p>Edit:  Aren't weapons banned in space?</p></div>		</li>
