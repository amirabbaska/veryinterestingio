<p>See, that <em>sounds</em> shocking, but I'm assuming even the best software wouldn't eliminate everything? What can you expect from Microsoft Essentials?</p>

<p>it is free and makes sense that Microsoft would know the in's and out's of their own code better than some 3rd party like norton</p>

<p>Any recommendations for a Mac? Does Apple have its own antivirus I'm not aware of?</p>
<p>In any case, Norton is very expensive for only partial protection from an only-possible threat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bigger issue isn't the success rate, it's that it's a resource hog. One of the primary reasons behind having anti virus (other than security of personal information like bank information) is so a virus doesn't slow down your computer. If your antivirus is massively slowing down your computer, what are you accomplishing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Touche. </p>
<p>Is it proportional to the resources the computer actually has, or is it flat? E.g will it always use 100mb (literally chosen at random) of RAM regardless of how much RAM the computer has, or does it have a % dedicated to it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't get this at all.</p>
<p>I use Norton Security Suite on a moderately old computer, and it never gets above 2% CPU, with memory usage at about 25 MB, which is half what things like Steam use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Microsoft essentials doesn't get all the viruses either. At least it's free, so you don't get charged twice; once by norton and once again when you have to call the computer tech(me) to come in and fix it. I have no recommendations for apple. I very rarely work on them...Nobody brings me apples to fix; either cause they're not that popular, or they don't break. You be the judge... Apple claims they're virus free like linux, but that isn't true either. If it's got code, it can run viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks heaps for your input!</p>
<p>I currently have Malware Bytes and it seems to be working fine, given my lappy still runs fast as the day I got it. Wasn't sure if I made the right decision refusing the Norton add-on with my most recent laptop purchase though, and I'm happy I've been vindicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The general consensus is that the virus threat on mac and linux is lower because those OS's just have the marketshare to make it worthwhile.  If either of them explodes in popularity, we'll see a lot more viruses for those platforms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it might be more that few people write viruses for Apple.  Maybe they're not a big enough share of the market to be worth it.</p>
<p>I don't know how Linux is considered virus free, maybe because base linux gives the owner so much control that he can do whatever he wants with it?  Add/subtract/move processes such that a generic virus/worm/malware/whatever can't do as much, so it's just not worth the effort.  Not like the kind of vulnerabilities that come standard on a given Windows OS where the owner has less control.  (Though I thought that apple owners have even less control of their systems than most window owners.)</p>
<p>If I'm wrong on these guesses, please tell me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed even the best anti virus software can't stop everything and it's also not expected to. But the extremely hardy difficult to detect and get rid of viruses are pretty hard to get anyway. The antivirus software is expected to be backup, in the first place you're not supposed to get them due to simply knowing what you're doing on the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you have norton for free? Would you recommend to go back to Microsoft Essentials? I have had norton as my primary antivirus on my laptop for years now, since I found out it came bundled with my brother's xfinity package. I know my laptop sometimes gets annoyingly slow, but its normally not a problem for me (or at least, I'm used to it by now).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sad part is that back in the early days of the PC up to about the late 1990's, &quot;Norton Utilities&quot; was THE essential piece of software to have installed on your computer.  It included a lot of top-notch tools that were superior to Microsoft's default offerings (if they were even offered at all!), such as disk de-fragmentation, disk partitioning, disk imaging, un-delete, lots of diagnostic and performance analysis tools, in addition to anti-virus. </p>
<p>Then they got bought out by Symantec which then proceeded to rapidly turn it into a dumpster fire of crap. It was kind of inevitable though, because the built-in utilities in Windows started getting &quot;good enough&quot; and free or cheaper utilities became more readily available on the Internet.</p></div>		</li>
