			<div class="markdown"><p>I am going to try it.  I never am able to find comments again to thank people for their recos...I just paid a guy $2 to spend several hours looking thru my comment history so I could thank someone for a reco and he couldn't find it either.  </p>
<p>So, let's pretend I listened to this and it was amazing and I learned a lot, and I'm remembering to thank you!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of a plant embryo as a person locked inside a room. Just because the person is trapped and can't do anything doesn't mean they don't need food to live. The person will die if left alone long enough without food or water.</p>
<p>Similarly, just because the embryo is inside a seed case doesn't mean it doesn't need energy. It's not like a car that doesn't use any fuel when it's just sitting there. It's more like a fire, where you need to keep adding wood if you want to keep the flame going. If you don't add any wood, the fire will eventually die. So too will a plant embryo if not provided with the tiny amounts of energy it needs to maintain itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What maintenance processes does it continue doing? Are they not fully dormant? What is this tiny amount of energy used for? You explain things well, thanks for the input!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It requires very little energy (at our scale) to keep a regular sized plant alive (think about that plant in your office that has been living in the same pot for years), so think about a plant that is 0.5 mm long.</p></div>		</li>
