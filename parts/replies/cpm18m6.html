			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the hit should be the same but if we assume cars of equal mass and a mostly inelastic collision, in the 0/30km/h case you will have a tangle of metal that will slide gently to a stop with an initial speed of just 15 km/h, which is a quick jog. </p>
<p>In the case of a 90/120 km/h collision, you now have a tangle of metal moving at about 105 km/h.  There is a very good chance of rolling over, sliding off the road, collision with a third car or objects on the side of the road, etc.</p>
<p>The initial acceleration experienced by both cars is the same (about 15 km/h), but the end result is very different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in drifting we often have crashes at 90km/h and above. The damage to the cars is mostly negligible due to relative speeds of both cars and the fact that we aren't generally stopping after a crash, but we keep going as the crash is more of a nudge then anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again we go back to the spherical cow argument - for a real car, anything bad happening at 90 km/h is worse than something bad happening  at 30 km/h.  Real cars spin, flip and disintegrate.  This is going to be worse at 90 km/h than at a lower speed. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if it's a mile wide road, with no obstacles, then the main difference is with regards to the ground. If neither car tumbles, then there will be more friction in the high speed collision, you might burn through your tires, but otherwise the impact is the same. That's a pretty big &quot;if&quot; when your combined mass is out of control at 105 kmh and you've just sustained a 30 kmh collision. Get rid of that &quot;if&quot; and you're tumbling/flipping against the ground at 105 kmh, which obviously makes a pretty significant difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially if your first instinct after being slammed from behind at 30 mph is to slam on the brakes or something similar. In the 30/0 collision this makes sense and quickly brings the 0 car back to its original speed.</p>
<p>In the 120/90 case though the 90 car is going to fishtail and may have enough KE to do some fun* acrobatics.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to put it: you can see this a car going at 30kmph hitting a stationary car while the <em>floor (and everything else) is moving at -90kmph</em>. That last little detail means it's not exactly what we'd imagine: like it or not both cars are on the floor, with friction and forces from it alter the crash even before the impact occurs. Even if the crash is &quot;slow&quot; the &quot;fast moving&quot; floor (mostly through its friction) would probably still make a terrible thing to those cars, like in those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNkvK-bVc_s" target="_blank">treadmill accident videos</a>.</p>
<p>Now if it were cars sliding through a frictionless flat surface, or just floating through the void at those speeds, then yes, it would be no different at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the perfect explanation- the problem the poster presents is a &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; or &quot;holding all other things constant&quot; problem. There are many other forces that are being applied to these cars in reality, but, for the purposes of understanding frames of reference, the poster's (and this ^ person's) conclusions are correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lets say after the collision, both cars stayed at at least 90 km/m, instead of slowing to 0 km/h. Would it be similar to the 30 km/h hitting a 0 km/h that OP mentions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an inelastic collision to conserve momentum equal mass cars would be traveling at the average of their speeds: </p>
<pre><code>(120+90)/2 = 105 km/h</code></pre>
<p>In a simplified physics 1 homework problem, this would be a totally okay arrangement, but in reality you've probably significantly broken the cars and they're going to lose control. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think such a collision would be 100% inelastic though, despite the fact that the cars will obviously permanently crumple and deform somewhat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bringing the speed difference down to 1 mile per hour 90 and 91, the hit would be at the strength of 1 mile per hour, not enough to cause any damage at all. The cars would then continue to travel at the same basic speed, and would not have any difference to a car running into another at 1 mph.</p>
<p>With a 30 mph difference, the weaker of the cars will sustain heavy damage and will cause a catastrophic wreak, barreling down the road at between 90 and 120 mph, the average speed being 105 mph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a things going at over 90 km/h is going to attract a lot more drag from air than one that is pushed to go over 0 km/h. That is spesifying how the mechanism that keeps them at atleast 90 km per hour matters. If the gas pedal is kept at the position that would maintain a 90 km/h speed it is more similar to the stationary case. However a human trying to maintain a 90 km/h would ease on the gas pedal if the speed rouse above that and progressively return the gas pedal to the needed position as the speed approached 90 km/h. While probably the front driver doesn't have nerves of steel and maintain normal speed control through out the collision, the reaction of as that state of mind is disspelled by a sudden forward acceleration would be to step off the gas as you start to figure out the proper follow up to it.</p></div>		</li>
