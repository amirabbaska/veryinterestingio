In the Schrodinger equation we use a much simpler model of the electromagnetic field instead; we treat it as a scalar field with values that depend on the position of all the electrons and simply omit any relativistic- and quantum effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. If you have the point of view that physics only makes statements about reality in the sense of a permanent description of the entire dynamics, than there is no description of those interactions at all and we just don't know. That's my opinion.</p>
<p>If you say something like &quot;physics only talks about what we know&quot;, then these interactions don't really have a reality because they cannot be observed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are maybe reversing the roles of reality and mathematics here. The math describes reality. The word &quot;photon&quot; describes an artifact of the math. Specifically, that parts of the math only operate on discrete quanta of energy. What we can measure with our brains and our tools, and what we are capable of discussing in English, is not reality, but the results of our unique perspectives on Schr√∂dinger's equation which says when we notice things evolving over time, what we are noticing is always quantized.</p>
<p>If we decide that some waves represent a thing, and other waves represent another thing, and we notice those things performing something we have decided to call an interaction, that interaction will always be quantized. Since we perceive the interaction happening over both space and time, we need a word to represent that quantization of interaction, and in the case of the electromagnetic field that word is photon.</p>
<p>Or put another way, an electron is energy following a set of equations and a photon is energy following a set of equations and those equations share factors such that their combined equation looks kind of like an electron shooting a photon at another electron and causing it to change direction, but that's just one way of making a simplified description of the mathematics. Describing it that way loses a lot of the information about what's actually going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may be right, but to my mind, there still must be some kind of physical connection between cause and result. Even if it pops up as a virtual artefact in maths, I still think there is probably something &quot;real&quot; behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. QED is formulated on Fock space and uses a mathematically very different equation than Dirac, even though it looks similar.</p>
<p>It's the perturbation for a (actually non-existent) time evolution on Fock space.</p></div>		</li>
