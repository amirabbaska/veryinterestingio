<p>It is my understanding that the older C band satellites which required 10 foot diameter dishes were 2 Watts per channel while the newer 60 cm diameter dishes required 75 Watts per channel.</p>

<p>No, definitely not.</p>
<p>In both cases, the transponder power on the satellite is about the same. A typical 36MHz transponder (which was how much bandwidth was needed to transmit a single analogue tv channel back in the day) had a tx power of roughly 70W or so.</p>
<p>The antenna size difference comes in for a couple of other reasons. First, antenna gain is a function of frequency and antenna diameter. The lower the frequency, the larger the antenna that you need for the same gain. As such, a 1.8m C-Band antenna (the smallest you can go and legally transmit) has roughly the same performance as a (good) 1m antenna at Ku-Band.</p>
<p>The second issue is the 3dB beam width. The satellites in orbit are typically slotted every two degrees along the equator. A 2.4m C-Band antenna will have a beam width of about 1.5 degrees or so, vastly reducing the amount of adjacent satellite interference it picks up.</p>
<p>Lastly, between ye olde BUDs (Big Ugly Dishes) and the little 60cm TV dish, there were dramatic improvements in Forward Error Correction. The Polynomial Codes used in DVB-S2 are within a fraction of a dB of the Shanon Limit. Back in the days of the BUDs, there was no error correction, so they needed dramatically better antenna performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is an interesting math exercise to determine how much power reaches a 60 cm diameter satellite dish considering that the area of the U.S. is about 3,000,000 square miles or 7,650,000 square kilometers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back at one of my link budgets, one of the networks I Engineered had a flux density of approximately -112dBW/m^2. That's in the billionths of a watt per square meter or more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but once you to the energy spreading/scrambling (not talking about paytv scrambling), and do the other stuff you need to transmit it via satellite, it becomes 36MHz.</p></div>		</li>
