			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s worth noting, it is completely possible to have the hubs in line with the wheel for the front tires. The only reason they don’t do that is because of cost and interchangeability. If you have 2 different rim types, it makes repairs and replacements a whole lot more difficult. Because of that, we just use the same rims all around. Hence the wheel spikes. Some drivers like to spice it up a bit. </p></div>		</li>
