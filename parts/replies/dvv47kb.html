			<div class="markdown"><p>Great link, thanks.  Here's a similar link also from this year:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/instead-of-filling-cavities-dentists-may-soon-regenerate-teeth1/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/instead-of-filling-cavities-dentists-may-soon-regenerate-teeth1/</a></p>
<p>It uses a technique that mobilizes stem cells in the dental pulp to regrow dentin. This <em>is</em> proven to work. None of the differences between human teeth and the test animals are at play in the technique so there's no reason human teeth won't respond the same.
Human trials are expected within approximately 3 years.  It's important to point out similar testing and techniques are being researched by different groups around the world and these countries have different restrictions on human trials so we may see it tested on people sooner than the London team does.  </p>
<p>Although the process itself is fairly benign, stem cells are being used which can get out of control and replicate unexpectedly (think cancer) hence the caution for human testing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that it will not be a 'miracle' treatment, since its use will be fairly limited. It's also nothing new, since Calcium Hydroxide is used since forever with the same purpose, using it as a liner below a filling, or as a pulp capping technique when the pulp was accidentally exposed. (The article seriously oversells what the pulp is able to do to regrow dentin. For one, unless this treatment teaches your stem cells quantum tunneling, I fail to see how it would get the new dentin from inside of the pulp, to outside where the cavity is.)</p>
<p>It will not regrow teeth, or regrow dead pulp, or fix your pulp if either necrosis or gangrene set in. Pulp capping? Sure. Cavity lining, okay. Early stages of pulpitis? Maybe. (Usually the onset of pulpitis is acute.) Anything else? Ehhhhh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The London groups published work does have indications teeth can be encouraged to be regrown. This article is written by a science journalist and is covering only a light abstract of the entire work.
The actual, full research is published under 'Promotion of natural tooth repair by small molecule GSK3 antagonists’ by Vitor Neves, Rebecca Babb, Dhivya Chandrasekaran and Paul T Sharpe.
Doctor Vitor Neves has appeared anx discussed this and the future of this process many times onTakacs dentistry podcast.  They've also gone much deeper into the research than this article.
Dr. Neves has pointed out that stem cell treatments are not the only method that could achieve this.  Gene editing is in its infancy but depending on how progress goes with various stem cell research and CRISPR methods we could see not only teeth regrown but also limbs and organs within the body.  Some like to wave away such advances entirely or at least their timeframes but a decade ago anyone talking about targeted gene editing with the ease of CRISPR/Cas9 would have said such tech would either be impossible or fifty to a hundred years away.  Luddites - whether for technology or medicine - always end up losing their bets.
I'm not calling you one by any means. Just suggesting that we're living with literally hundreds of medical breakthroughs that not only were predicted to be either not possible or a hundred years away but in many cases not foreseen at all.
Between the two I personally think there's much more promise from gene editing than stem cell work.  Only because it's so widely distributed now in thousands of labs.
Also your points about teeth already mostly gone are of course accurate. I hadn't meant to impugn those comments if it comes across that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I read about it last year it was scheduled to start human trials late last year or early this year. Though from the article you linked it seems the human trials haven't started yet, hopefully they will soon. </p></div>		</li>
