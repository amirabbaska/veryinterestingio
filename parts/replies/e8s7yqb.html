The outer case is connected to the airframe with shock absorbing springy things. The brains and memory are inside the fire proof insulated super safe. They are tested by firing them onto concrete by air canons, frozen, burnt, shot with spears, put in a vacuum chamber, and soaked in ocean water at ridiculous pressures.</p></div>		</li>
