			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a good book called “The art of invisibility” by Kevin Mitnick that explains in a very understandable way how much work is required in order to be as anonymous as possible on the internet. He also mentions several times that if a govt agency is after you it’s only a matter of time before they catch you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you use proxies, a vpn, etc, how could they get around that? I don't know too much about how proxies work but I do know that if it's a reputable VPN service that doesn't have a backdoor (or if the backdoor is only available to certain agencies and said agencies won't share it with agencies like the FBI), the encryption can't be broken. How could they catch you then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only 2 things that together are fairly effective are hacked servers in unfriendly countries and TOR.   It's difficult to get Iran, Venezuela, Russia, or China let you into their servers for forensics.  The same with corporations, if you're knees deep in bribes and blackmail you don't want the feds poking around.   This becomes especially true if the attacker sets the logs to regularly wipe when they're in your systems.  When you combine this with tor and SSL tunneling it can get stupidly hard to figure out where the attacker is.   Very few people are doing hacking or other illegal activities that are worth the difficulty of obfuscating their presence this much.   As a result many hackers cut corners and/or make mistakes.   They directly connect to an email they're using to taunt the victim through their home connection.   They use their credit card (or their moms) to buy a URL and then use it to serve malware on accident.   They buy stuff with bitcoin gained from selling loot in an attack and then have the sweet gainz mailed to their home address.   99% of the time, standard detective stuff gets the bad guys, not elite counterhacking and tracing.</p>
<p>This creates a feedback loop where police are not really incentivized to fight those tools, and badguys don't bother with the effort to employ highly effective anonymization OPSEC.  A proxy in a difficult country is probably enough if you're just hacking schools and changing a few grades.   TOR is probably enough if you're just defacing some websites with slurs and some really low quality porn.</p>
<p>If you make a mistake and get attention from state level entities though...  If you say, hack stratfor, all of a sudden the NSA is making you its bitch in a back room while the rest of the law enforcement community cheers.</p></div>		</li>

Check this out, its the warrant for arrest for an old buddy of mine who was selling 100k+ credit cards&amp;paypals on a honeypot. The first few pages are a firsthand account from the detective assigned to track him down. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/nys/pressreleases/June12/cardshop/hatalaalexcomplaw.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/nys/pressreleases/June12/cardshop/hatalaalexcomplaw.pdf</a></p>

<li>The NSA taps fibre optic lines, and isn't afraid to work with other agencies like the DEA's special ops.</li>
<li>You can be as diligent as you want, but if you fuck up even for literal seconds, you're cooked. This is what ultimately brought down Ross Ulbricht: using his real name on Stack Overflow for like a second.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I can see that. The company I work for makes us do training courses from his company.  The conspiracy ive thought is that his end game is he is just using the courses as a front so he gets easy access to hack a bunch of companies and people.  People are probably using the same passwords for their work/personal email as their Kevin Metnik security training account.  E-Z-P-Z</p></div>		</li>
