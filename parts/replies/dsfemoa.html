			<div class="markdown"><p>On quaternion usefulness:  when I was starting out in computer animation in the 90s, we had real problems with rotating object sometimes, especially on more then one axis at the same time.  Using XYZ Euler angles could sometimes induce gimbal lock, that would force an instantaneous flip.  This would essentially break the animation and cause a weird sudden blur on the frame the object flipped.  Then the smart folks started introducing Quaternion rotations instead, and suddenly gimbal lock was gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That wasn’t 100 percent clear, but way better an explanation than the “simple” one that is top voted. After reading yours, I now realize how 100 percent useless the “simple” explanation was. Computer animation is an important context. </p>
<p>Edit: y’all are so correct to downvote me. My opinion is invalid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Euler rotations are like taking the pitch yaw and roll of a particular angle in 3d, which is great, but if you need to transition from one angle to another, you cant just linearly change each of those numbers into the other, doing so actually doesnt create a straight path, as each rotation gets affected by the one above it.</p>
<p>Quaternions are like specifying the angle of a skewer, then stabbing it into your object at that you are rotating, then spinning it around that skewer to get a rotation in a straight line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really like this analogy.</p>
<p>Adding on: The math lets you take multiple skewer-and-twist operations and add them together, to get a single skewer-and-twist step which gets the same job done in less work... Just like how adding a bunch of lateral movement vectors together gets you a single movement.</p>
<p>This is great when you're trying to do something like describe the position of a complicated robot arm (or CGI character) where the axis and twist of each joint affects the axis and twist of the ones &quot;downstream&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how I am with a lot of math. I can make things work fine in code but I still barely passed geometry in highschool and never even took algebra 2.</p>
<p>I even had some instances in math classes where we'd get some extra credit homework assignment with some sort of really difficult geometry or other problem and I was always one of two or three people to successfully solve it because I knew how to write a script to figure out the answer. Of course it would always just spit out an answer and no work to go along with it.</p>
<p>If you hand me a computer and tell me to create some sort of geometric shape or solve some problem with as few lines as possible I'll have it done by lunch. Hand me pen and paper and tell me to do it mathematically and you'll never have it because I just won't be able to figure it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIP: if you say &quot;interpolate&quot; instead of LERP you will start to sound more &quot;mathy&quot;.. Lerping is something a unity programmer does a lot, which is the alias for Linear intERPolation. And if you do animation, i hope you also use SLERP a lot, which is Spherical interpolation ;) It has &quot;acceleration/deceleration&quot; in the curve curve, it starts and stops more gradually, forming a &quot;cubic S curve&quot;. If SLERP is used for turning it will continue from the previous trajectory and then start turning, LERP will turn like a turret in linear fashion and the object seemingly has no mass or inertia at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ok, as a 35 year old but not assuming not a maths person</p>
<p>say you want to move and roll an object in 3d space. you need to calculate the rotation of a billiard ball on a table, because you want to know where the number on the ball will be after its rolled around the table and bounced into things a few times. is the ball facing upwards, and are the numbers upside sown from your viewing angle. </p>
<p>you cant easily solve that unless you use quaternions.</p>
<p>a single object, like that ball can be defined by having and x y and z rotation if you use a particular type of spatial reference the x y and z names refer to viewing angles. looking at the ball from the side, the top and from the front. so if you had some graph paper and slowly rolled ball, you could plot the degree of angle on those 3 sides on your graph paper. </p>
<p>now, because you've rolled the the ball forwards one full circle, youve passed 360 degrees, and if you slightly rolled a little to the side as well, youve now got a pretty nasty record of the movement. </p>
<p>however, there was another view point, and that was recording 'up', and not looking at the ball. so 'up' is the the ceiling. when the ball rolls anywhere from its starting point, there is that up value being recorded. </p>
<p>that ceiling up reference means that you can calculate where the number on the ball is, and which way it's facing so it can be read</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So we have 3 rotational DoF and one translational DoF? Or is 'up' just whatever part of the ball is pointing towards the ceiling? I did a robotics unit at uni which verryyy briefly covered quaternions (i.e. weren't tested on it). Do we need 4 values to solve the equations?</p></div>		</li>
