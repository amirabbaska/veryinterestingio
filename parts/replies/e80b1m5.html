<p>Just because I don’t immediately immediately visualize the details of the pirate’s finger doesn’t mean I’m not <em>able</em> to, which is what OP was referencing. </p>
<p>If you tell me to imagine a pirate with a scar on his index finger, I certainly am able to do that. </p>
<p>OP is asking how that is. He never said that the visualization happens instantly and completely, just that it happens. And it does. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a very useful skill for concept artists. The core of our profession is to visualize things that people don't normally see or think. Like how many buttons a pirate shirt has, how the leather strips hold the sword , how is the gun positioned relatively to the dominant hand? It's actually a matter of training,  the more we draw and observe stuff, the more we can remember properly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you'll realize you probably didn't &quot;visualize&quot;</p>

<p>It was actually really easy. Plenty of recent examples were already provided to us by Hollywood. I just pictured Jack Sparrow. And you see enough of him to have it completely fleshed out. A better example would be imagine an Alien. And the next question you ask is &quot;Where is it from?&quot; or &quot;what is its name?&quot;. People will have to stop and think to invent those, after the question, because it is not normally a detail found in media</p></div>		</li>
