			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing worth noting is that a lot of the people who were involved ended up losing a <em>lot</em> of money when the whole thing crashed. There were people who made a bunch of money by betting against the market. If more people had known about what was going on &quot;for realsies&quot;, realistically speaking we would have expected more people to bet against the market.</p>
<p>Some of them probably did know it would crash sooner or later, but still had their hand in the cookie jar, or at the very least thought that they still had time to get out. A lot of people were just being stupid, though.</p>
<p>People forget how prevalent the belief was that the housing market couldn't go down. It was stupid, but a lot of people believed it.</p></div>		</li>
