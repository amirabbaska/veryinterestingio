			<div class="markdown"><p>Really interesting stuff, and I would defer to my cancer biologist and medical colleagues who work on cancer immunotherapy to weigh in on that one.  What they tell me is that there's been some success in younger patients and initial trials, and it's an exciting first step.</p>
<p>What thrills me is how creative scientists are able to get with how much we’ve learned about genetics, basic biology, etc. And guess what: most of that knowledge comes from federally funded research! </p>
<p>You should be at least a little excited, but you should also be worried if those federal funds start to dry up: the private sector will usually only chase after things they know will be profitable, which means they already work. The public sector part of science is charged with trying lots of things to find out what might work and what might not. Keep that side of the house funded, and you’ll have even more treatments to get excited about in the future!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks you for your answer.</p>
<p>I definitely agree that research funding is important and would support its increase over military spending. Sadly, I doubt that view is shared in the spheres of the powers that be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I were you I would wait until the same technique is replicated in multiple patients in multiple stages of cancer. We're working on curing cancer, but the process is more of an ultramarathon than a 100m sprint. </p>
<p>While you're at it, please vote for pro-science politicians. Cutting funding for science and science education is <em>never</em> the short or long term answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Car-T therapy is one of those rare exceptions that represents a real breakthrough in cancer therapy. The hype may be overblown, but only barely. This really is a tremendous breakthrough for some previously very difficult to treat cancers. There are still challenges, but they seem addressable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other point is that they've been targeting specific forms of leukemia, and it may take a lot of effort to generalize and may never work as well for solid tumors. But I agree, it's fantastic work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be, and it might not be. Believe me, nobody's going to be happier than the scientific establishment (apart from the patients) if that's the case. However, as with all things in science in general, and biology in particular, replicability and reproducibility is key. Until that happens (and it may take months, even years), it's best to be cautiously optimistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603502/two-infants-treated-with-universal-immune-cells-have-their-cancer-vanish/" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link in question.</p>
<p>Some background on CAR T-cells:</p>
<p>CAR T-cells are immune cells genetically modified to target tumor-specific surface markers (antigens). They have been around for a few years with the majority of trials conducted in lymphoma and more recently in myeloma. These are predominantly B-cell tumors which can be targeted by engineering anti-B-cell surface marker (generally anti-CD19 or anti-CD20) T-cells. Patients' B-cells are generally wiped out completely until the CAR T-cells die/are cleared and are regenerated afterwards, which is okay with proper supportive care.</p>
<p>The problem with targeting leukemia, predominantly a cancer of T-cells, is that there aren't many antigens on malignant T-cells that don't already exist on healthy T-cells, meaning anti-T-cell antigen CAR T-cells may be autoreactive and cannibalize each other. Having said that, there are currently trials targeting tumor-specific T-cell antigens in certain types of leukemia.</p>
<p>Trials have shown them to be efficacious but they don't always work and they can cause significant toxicity. There's ongoing work to figure out how to tweak them to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity.</p>
<hr />
<p>The paper you mentioned is notable because remission was induced in patients with leukemia, an indication with a short track record with these cells. The problem is it was just a case report, not a trial designed or powered to show anything. They also received lymphodepleting chemotherapy along with the cells, which has the ability to induce remission in childhood leukemia alone (something we've known since the 1950s).</p>
<p>CAR T-cells are definitely something to be excited about. However, what people need to realize about any cancer treatment is that efficacy in one indication (sub/type of cancer) doesn't mean anything for other indications. There is no one cure for cancer because cancer is not a single disease. It's something that must be chipped away at indication by indication (each of which may have additional subdivisions and complexities based on stage of disease, genetic mutation, patient population). I don't think we'll ever have a big ribbon-cutting party celebrating having cured cancer but the field is making great strides towards improving treatment rates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to wiki t-cells and b-cells to understand your passage, but I guess I have a rough understanding now.</p>
<p>Thank you for the detailed response. Biology will continue to amaze me and I guess I am always excited to see progress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, my apologies. The gist was that the CAR T-cells have predominantly been used to target one cell type to treat one type of disease so far and are now being engineered to target another type to treat another disease (essentially cancerous versions of its own cell type, which is more complicated). Maybe I should've explained things a bit better but I can't say that I regret the fact that you spent time reading up on it.</p></div>		</li>
