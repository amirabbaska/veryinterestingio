<p>It’s not as flashy to study tardigrades as a pioneer species</p>

<p>Why not? You'd think anything to do with them would be awesome? Hopefully the new Star Trek has sparked some renewed interest in them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’d think, but unfortunately funding (even the minimal amount needed for tardigrade ecological studies) still requires a pitch getting people on board. As soon as you mention tardigrades people want their money to go to DNA. </p>
<p>I don’t know if macroscopic indestructible sentient 5th dimensional tardigrades will “raise interest” in studying the ecology of tardigrades haha. The whole tardigrade plot device was an extremophile they needed the DNA of. Great show tho hahaha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is a little silly since behavior studies compliment DNA knowledge.  I assume it's much easier to understand and predict what genes do when you know what the animal itself does.  </p>
<p>If you never knew humans could swim you would be confused by genes for the mammalian diving response.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would say Neil deGrasse Tyson's Cosmos put a big happy spotlight on tardigrades. ST:D just tortured them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that mating isn't that important (especially with parthenogenesis), but producing viable offspring is.  Mating is only the dancing part of reproduction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And people always bring up the lion and the pig comparison as a quantity vs quality thing when it comes to mating. </p>
<p>Comparing the lion and the tardigrade would be much better :)</p>
<p>From now on... I will always use the lion vs tardigrade instead.</p></div>		</li>
