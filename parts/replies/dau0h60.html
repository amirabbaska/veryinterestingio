			<div class="markdown"><p>That would help explain why whales, which float in relatively cold water, are the largest mammals. </p>
<p>Whales don't worry about bone strength much because they are rarely physically supported by their own bones. They suffocate on land because their bodies can't hold their rib cages rigid enough to breath properly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently whales are limited in scaling by the costs of increasingly large jaws necessary to harvest larger amounts of krill. As the overall animal size increases, so does energy needed, and jaw size.  That jaw size itself has an energy cost, and also incurs greater drag while diving. At a certain point scaling fails.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just cold. Water is a far more efficient conductor of heat than air. Drawing the heat away from the animal far more effectively than equivalent temperature air would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same goes with breathing through skin. At some point, it's not enough, so we switched to lungs. I believe similar structures could be used to dissipate heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a plot point in Gene Wolfe's Books of the New Sun. I hate to say more because it spoils a lot of stuff but the fact that there is an upper size limit to land based life is very important to a character who discovers that the secret to long life is to never stop growing, like a child does. (Or cancer, for that matter.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The amount of heat a body can give off by radiation, convection or diffusion (the three ways heat can be transfered) is dependend on the outer surface volume or radius by power 2.</p>

<p>There are ways to increase surface area with negligible increases in volume to get around that problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a point, yes, you can &quot;crinkle&quot; the surface of an object to increase its surface area without changing its volume much, but this only helps the heat issue -- it doesn't negate it. Even if you were able to make the boundary of a mammal into a fractal-like surface with infinite surface area, you're still limited by the amount of air itself in contact with the skin and that can circulate through those tiny folds, which is finite.</p></div>		</li>
