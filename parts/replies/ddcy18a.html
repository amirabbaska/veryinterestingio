			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer is no, it cools off in the air rather than warming up. Now you'd imagine that if it's cooling off it would return to liquid and that is true when it has something to condense on. Otherwise, it will remain steam by expanding (becoming less dense in the air) and thereby decreasing the partial pressure of the water vapour in air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you increased the pressure inside the container I.E. prevent steam from escaping to the point that the air inside had become saturated with water vapor. could the water in the pot surpass 100? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it needs something to condense on, I'm assuming a surface, then what process makes steam condense into rain? Can the sudden drop in temperature make it 'condense by itself' without a surface?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it most certainly does cool down to become a liquid again. This would be in the form of water vapor. The visible clouds coming off of boiling water that most people believe is steam, is actually water vapor. The steam is actually beneath it right above the boiling water, although it's not visible to the eye. This is why when you have a kettle of boiling water, you only see the &quot;steam&quot; cloud start to form a couple inches away from the spout. The invisible section between the water vapor cloud and the spout would be the actual steam. </p>
<p>With your logic, the clouds in the sky would be steam, as opposed to water vapor. Which isn't the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can, but as soon as it leave the container, it can't get any hotter, because it loses contact with the heat source. But if you can keep it in the container, it can be way hotter. Boiling point is just the temperature at which the water molecules can't keep contact with each over because they move to quick for the links to remain (hydrogen bonding), but it is still water.</p>
<p>Edit because I miss the point : no, the steam is not hotter than the boiling water, it just have take this excess energy to break its bonds with the rest of the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual steam would have to be hotter than the boiling water almost by definition. Once it drops past 100 c it condenses into liquid water droplets and/or becomes water vapor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At standard pressure, gaseous water must have a temperature of at least 100 C to be thermodynamically stable. It's hard to say what the temperature of the vapor would be though, because it's likely convecting around and mixing with the ambient air. It's not at thermal equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't measure &quot;heat energy&quot; with temperature, as temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy (more or less, there are more nuanced definitions) in the substance.</p>
<p>When you add thermal energy (measured in joules or calories) to boiling water, you convert more molecules of water from liquid to vapor. That doesn't affect the temperature as their kinetic energy is still the same. The energy you put in is used to break the attraction bonds (van der Waals, hydrogen) that hold liquid water molecules together cohesively)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  There is a ton of energy consumed in the transition from liquid to steam.  That transition happens at 100C.   If you are adding shitloads of energy, you'll just get to the transition point faster.  But the transition itself takes a lot lot lot of energy.  Google 'latent heat of evaporation.'</p>
<p>What happens in the pot is that not all the liquid is at 100C at the same time.  If you have a big flame on the bottom of the pot, the liquid at the bottom is hottest and transitions first.  Convection currents keep bringing more cooler water to the bottom of the pot to get heated to 100C.  But none of the water is really ever past 100C, because if it were, it would be steam.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You see, the steam forming is actually cooling down the water, almost acts like a kind of heatsink. The hotter the water, the more steam is created.</p>
<p>Of course takes a bit of energy to create steam. Water can be slightly hotter than 100*. That's why you can get superheated water, which people talked about further above.</p></div>		</li>
