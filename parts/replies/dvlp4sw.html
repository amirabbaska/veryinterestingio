<p>People also had kids younger and more frequently, which definitely ages women. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this. My grandma was like me and avoided the sun like the plague. She looked to be about late 20's/early 30's in her (second) wedding photo when she was 34. My mom at 34 after years of worshipping the sun looked to be about 40+. I am currently 34 and usually I have people guessing my age around early 20's. A customer recently asked me which high school I was graduating from this year. (Totally made my day, I turn 35 this year and that big number is wearing on me lol.) I think what's helped keep me younger looking is 1) NO SUN, 2) wear sunglasses as much as possible, 3) try to remember to use sunblock and anti-aging cream (ounce of prevention!). I would say avoiding stress definitely helps too, but I'm in full time college, I have two kids, and I work the graveyard shift. That's taking itself out on my hair color though. </p></div>		</li>
