			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your current tax situation and your future tax situation in 30-40 years.   If current income tax situation (earning wage, possibly supporting kids, possibly mortgage deduction) is more than future income tax situation (drawing retirement income, lots of healthcare expenses) then you're better off paying taxes 30-40 years from now (using deferred taxes ala 401k or individual ira) rather than paying tax on contribution now (Roth IRA) and withdrawing it tax free.</p>
<p>Most people would expect to retire on less income annually compared to working.  But since we don't know what tax law reforms are going to happen in next decades, it's a gamble either way.  Most advisors would tell you to do both, but weighed more on 401k...at least for now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not Roth IRA versus 401k, there's actually a Roth 401k option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make both traditional and Roth contributions to a 401k account if your employer's plan allows it, so saying &quot;weighed more on 401k&quot; doesn't really mean much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive heard Roth IRA thrown around a lot at work and never knew what it meant. So it just means with this investment you pay taxes up front rather than 401k where you pay taxes upon withdrawal? Its not a completely different type of investment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally you earn less by the time you retire, so your income might end in a lower tax bracket. In this case its better to pay no taxes now, and pay them after retirement</p>
<p>Of course you don't know how tax law is going to change, or if you start earning significantly more later in life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be wrong, but I believe that you if you decide go pay the income tax now, then invest the money, you don't pay anything on the gains you make. I read somewhere on Reddit that Elon Musk's buddies did this when they started up Paypal, netting them a big profit when Paypal's stock soared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same either way. If your tax rate is identical when you retire, both methods end up with the same balance.</p>
<p>Traditional: (principal <em> (1+return)) </em> (1-taxrate)</p>
<p>Roth: (principal <em> (1-taxrate)) </em> (1+return)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It just stays in your  account. You can roll it over to consolidate with another 401K but you can’t withdraw it without penalty, and different employers may have different rules about their part of the contributions. Anyone with taxable income can open a Roth IRA and contribute, even freelancers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The money isn't held by your employer. It's stored in an investment account in your name, at a brokerage like Charles Schwab or Vanguard. If you leave the company, the account and all of the money in it stay with you.</p>
<p>You can set up a Solo 401k for yourself if you're self-employed. I'm not really clear on the details because I've never set one up, but a bank can help you with the details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. Most 401(k)'s have a &quot;vesting&quot; period, usually 5 years or so. Meaning, lets say you put in $100 and your company matched $50 and you have a total of $150 saved. If you leave before your 5 years you get your $100 and the company their $50. After 5 years, you are vested, you get $150. </p>
<p>Generally its only available to actual employees. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you got it - basically just called Super for short. </p>
<p>It's mandatory that all employers pay super, and it can't be withdrawn until retirement age (except in unusual circumstances).</p>
<p>Contributions are usually set at 10% of your income, with additional voluntary contributions able to be made (and sometimes the government will match contributions, up to a point). The 10% isn't taxed, and usually jobs are advertised as &quot;+super&quot; or &quot;inc. super&quot; to describe whether the 10% is paid on top of the advertised amount, or is included in it (remember that when you're looking at job ads - a job that is +super might be a better deal than a slightly higher salary that includes super in the salary!)</p>
<p>It's a bit simpler in Australia since you don't have to set one up yourself - usually young people will enter the industry with a &quot;default&quot; super fund used by their first employer (usually in the retail industry, it will be a super fund like REST) - and you'll fill out a Super form when you get your first job. As you move throughout different jobs and careers, you can keep your existing fund, set up new ones, and roll your previous super into a new account (when I changed careers, I went through the roll-over process, pretty simple).</p></div>		</li>
