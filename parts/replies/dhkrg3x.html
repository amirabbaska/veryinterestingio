			<div class="markdown"><p>That article is a little frustrating.  &quot;The cave is teaming with life, including 33 species found nowhere else on the planet.  Here is a pic of a water scorpion eating a woodlouse.  Here is a pair of woodlice.  Here is a water scorpion in portrait.  Here is a water scorpion and woodlouse spooning.  Here's 10 more water scorpions....&quot;     </p></div>		</li>

<p>After reading the article, mostly the same as other insects, centipedes, spiders, etc. except pale and no eyes. Otherwise they are known creatures. The water scorpions and the completely new leech are the only rare animals of note. The bacterium are neat though they don't picture well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because they're otherwise similar to existing animals doesn't mean they're not a new species. There's lots of species that are distinct species, yet are very difficult to tell apart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not so much that evolution knows or adapts to fit the environment. It is that the species which lived long enough to reproduce likely had something ever so slightly different about it that potentially increased its likelihood of reproduction and the cycle reinforces itself over generations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution has no purpose.</p>
<p>Pigmentation became a non-important variable. Whether an organism had it or not became irrelevant. In fact, it may be, ever so slightly, beneficial to be deficient in pigments as the resources could be utilized elsewhere. Resource allocation; those without pigment, in an environment with the lack of need for it, would have better ennergy allocation and therefore better survivability. Greater survivability means a greater likelihood at the opportunity to reproduce. </p>
<p>Now multiply that by millions of cycles and you get creatures without color. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn't know anything.</p>
<p>Where protective pigmentation is useful, insects who randomly have it have a slightly increased chance of reproducing and their offspring have more chance of having the same pigmentation and therefore have a slight advantage over other insects of the same species.</p>
<p>In time, if this pigmentation is useful, it will naturally spread through the population as insects who have it will have a better chance of reproducing. There is no knowledge in the system however, at least not as it is usually understood.</p>
<p>In an environment such as an enclosed cave where it gives no advantage then this effect just doesn't happen since, by definition, there is no reason why a different pigment gives an insect an advantage in producing offspring.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>As pointed out in the replies, if the pigment comes at an energy cost and there is no benefit then a pigment-less insect has an advantage and so insects with this trait would very gradually spread throughout the population.</p></div>		</li>
