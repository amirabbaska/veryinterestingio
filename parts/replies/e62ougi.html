			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, this is part of the reason cities can be uncomfortably (or dangerously) hotter than other nearby areas.</p>
<p>With that said— solar panels may absorb more heat than, say, a forest. But compared to a black rooftop they’d be no worse. Similarly, they have disadvantages in how water absorbs/runs off compared to natural surfaces. But they’d no worse than rooftops (or parking lots) in that regard.</p>
<p>So there are “free” locations to put them where those particular disadvantages are cancelled because we’d have built something else there anyways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree with that. The best solution would be to incorporate solar panels into urban areas which ready act as heat islands</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good idea, but it doesn't take advantage of the economies of scale of a huge solar farm. It's easier to maintain solar panels all in one site, and you'd need fewer larger inverters, rather than dozens of micro-inverters for each roof. So if we're going to build solar panels somewhere, it still might be a better choice to put it somewhere else, then just paint the building roofs white. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Either way, I do think more should be done in that regard. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, wouldn't they be better? With a black rooftop, the energy is absorbed and then radiated out as heat, right? With a solar panel the entire point of it is to convert and redirect that energy, so the majority of it shouldn't be getting converted to heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell_efficiency" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, the best cells achieved 46% efficiency in 2014, meaning they converted less than half of their received solar energy to electricity. I'm sure that number has improved at least a bit since then, but I'd guess it's the barest of majorities, at best. I don't think such cells are commercially available, though, or at least they aren't coast effective. In any case, it looks like the theoretical maximum efficiency for converting sunlight to electricity is ~69%.</p>
<p>Still much better than a plain old roof, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All energy is converted to heat eventually, so considering <em>just</em> the heat, it's the same for solar panels that are the same shade as a black roof (in reality they are somewhat darker).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding storm runoff, solar arrays should arguably be pretty similar to natural surfaces. While the panels are impervious, the ground below is mostly pervious (sans footings, conduit, etc), so water should be able to absorb more or less evenly after running off the panels. In contrast, a parking lot or building is typically 100% impervious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reduction of albedo due to solar panels will probably be, at best, <em>measurable</em>.</p>
<p>The reduction of albedo due to the melt of large quantity of ice at poles is <em>stunning</em>, and is largely due to fossil fuel use.</p>
<p>Considering that solar panels replace directly or indirectly fossil fuels, the trade off is still highly positive on climate point of view, if that is ever the underlying question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would happen anyway. The only thing that matters is the albedo, which is how much is absorbed. Solar panels have some of the absorbed energy go through the electrical grid, but it will still become heat in the end.</p></div>		</li>
