			<div class="markdown"><p>When you play with 2 ducks, the screen draws a white box around one duck, then in the next frame, it draws a white box around the other duck instead. So based on the timing of when the light gun &quot;sees&quot; the box, it knows which duck was hit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider as well that most NES games were 128KB - 384KB in size with the largest being about 1MB. If you snap a picture on your phone it will use about 2MB just for that photo. These guys were fitting entire games into that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It only draws one square on the screen at a time. So duck 1 will have a square shown at time x, and duck 2 will have a square shown at time y. The squares are drawn milliseconds apart, so it's almost like they're drawn simultaneously, but they're not. Imagine a quick flash of square 1 immediately followed by a quick flash of square 2. If the sensor detects light at time x, you hit duck 1.  Likewise, if it detects light at time y, you hit duck 2.</p>
<p>Here's a slow motion clip of the process:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing as stated in other replies, it just flashes multiple boxes in sequence for each duck and the console can use the timing to know which square you were pointing at. If it sees a &quot;hit&quot; when it's only shown the first duck then it knows it's that one.</p></div>		</li>
