			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just plutonium. Each element has isotopes that are more or less stable. It technically is less accurate to say that certain isotopes <em>can't</em> be split/fused than it is to say that certain isotopes require more energy/pressure to do so.</p>
<p>Just like molecular chemistry is its own field of study, <em>nuclear</em> chemistry is a field in its own right.</p>
<p>Technically just about any element <em>can</em> undergo fission or fusion. Everything below iron on the periodic table will require energy to split and release energy from fusing, while everything past iron will produce energy from fission and require energy to fuse. Alchemy is a real thing, it just requires nuclear chemistry instead of molecular chemistry, and we can't really do it without a particle accelerator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we send a probe that is powered by the same or similar power source, yes. Though it would be very localized as probes with that kind of power source dont carry a lot of nuclear material.  </p>
<p>Plants suitable for life as we know it should have adequate solar energy to support probes with solar panels. Even the old solar panels that power Voyager still generate enough power to operate its transmitter and some sensors. The Huygens probe send down to Titan was powered by chemical batteries. </p></div>		</li>
