			<div class="markdown"><p>Nicely put. I'm not a fan of the whole &quot;spectrum and maintenance&quot; argument. Especially given the...$400 billion from the government meant for upgrading infrastructure that wireless ISPs took for themselves. This is very cut and dry: They figured out they could make more money off of data caps with ridiculous overage fees than the caps on talk and text were making them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Spectrum doesn't limit the total amount of data you can download. Only the rate or speed at which you can download. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well technically, if there's a maximum rate of data you can download (e.g., x gb/second), then there's a limited amount of data you can download in a month (~2 600x tb/month). </p>
<p>Of course, whether or not this is actually relevant to what the data caps are, what the equipment can handle, and what people actually would use with no data caps is another story.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Exactly: The <em>rate</em> is limited. Banwidth. Data per month is still bandwidth. However, instead of limiting it on the level of bandwidth, the ISP is imposing a restriction on the total amount of data in the billing period <em>irrespective</em> of the time it took to download said data. </p></div>		</li>
