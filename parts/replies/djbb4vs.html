<p>The air is moving fast, and the blade is moving fast in the same direction so the relative speed is near zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explanation is completely wrong. If the relative speed of air vs the blade dropped to &quot;near zero&quot;, the fan wouldn't move any air.</p>
<p>The correct answer is based around boundary layer effect, as I and /u/TheEtherealTony have described - on any surface where a fluid or gas is flowing over it, as you get closer to the surface, the flow rate drops.</p>
<p>Dust readily collects on all parts of a blade. On cheap box fans, the edge of the blade is usually badly formed due to the cheap molding, and the rough surface catches more dust.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What if it's the humidity of the ambient air that mixes with dust particles and causes the trailing edge to collect the combination of water and airborne filth?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The theory is basically boundary layer theory.</p>
<p>Fluids, such as air or water, have a viscosity, meaning they are 'sticky' to a degree. When fluids flow over a surface, they will tend to 'stick' to the surface. This has a chain effect where fluid molecules will tend to stick to the other fluid molecules that are sticking to the surface. This chain of sticking fluid molecules forms a 'boundary layer' where the flow of the fluid over the surface will be slower than those that aren't flowing over the surface. The closer you are to a surface, the slower the flow of a fluid will be. Fluid velocity will slow down until you reach the surface where the velocity of the fluid is essentially zero. </p>
<p>This is where the dust resides. Since there is no air flowing over the fan blades relative to the fan, the dust is just laying on the surface, the same as if it were merely on a wall or a desk. </p>
<p>Oil and other filth will surely add to dust being more sticky, but that would make it stick to any surface, fan blade or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What /u/pearcakes1299 describes is neither correct, nor boundary layer effect.</p>
<p>They're claiming that it is due to air being accelerated by the blade and reaching the same speed as the blade, at the edge - which is completely wrong. The air MUST have a different velocity from the blade, otherwise the fan would not blow any air.</p></div>		</li>
