			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, is it like when a powerful electronic device kicks on it momentarily dims the lights. The power is being diverted. And with the router it's happening on a smaller scale? Is wifi like electricity? I thought it was like radiation or radio signals. Is it like really weak electrical signals like a tiny tesla coil? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is, I suppose, kind of similar in the sense that there's a limited resource (the amount of data that the router can handle each second) and when one thing has a high demand it may elbow other things out of the way.</p>
<p>It isn't caused by a lack of electricity, though.  A WiFi device takes only a tiny, tiny amount of electricity and will never be enough to cause your lights to flicker or anything on that scale.</p>
<p>The limitation is that the router can only talk to one thing at a time (at least for the sake of ELI5).  It can switch between devices that it's talking to very quickly which is how you're able to have multiple devices connected at once, but if you have too many devices then someone is going to get ignored more often than they want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WiFi is like a radio signal that goes BOTH ways. A radio in a car only receives a signal, it doesn't sent one back to the station. WiFi uses radio waves that go both ways, like walkie-talkies. </p>
<p>So imagine that you're on a walkie-talkie in your house and there's another person next door who has an encyclopedia (the encyclopedia is a stand-in for the internet here) and another walkie-talkie. Any time you want to look something up in his encyclopedia, you can radio the guy instructions for what to look up, and he'll read the page back to you. But if you have another neighbor in his own house with his own walkie-talkie, you and he have to take turns speaking to the other guy, so he can hear you both individually and process your requests. If you have 3 people asking for information, it divides the encyclopedia guy's attention 3 times, and so on. So it becomes a slower process for every person you add into the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where faster wifi is important. A faster connection in this example is the same as being able to talk faster - if you can talk 3x faster, you can send your message 3x quicker and the next person can use the walkie-talkie quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, it is actually very similar to the example with the room where lots of people are talking. Conversations take longer time since people have to repeat themselves and people have to pause to wait for a time when nobody nearby is talking.</p>
<p>If two messages are sent at the same time at the same frequency they can interfere with each other so the receiver cannot understand either of the two messages. The two messages become jumbled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only about 10% of the actual problem.</p>
<p>Firstly, multiple devices &quot;talking&quot; at once to the router, even over wi-fi, isn't much of a problem.  This communication happens at absolutely lightening fast speeds and most home based routers can easily handle 10ish devices talking to the router at the same time.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is this:</p>
<p>When it comes to Wi-Fi, the router will slow down communication for <em>all</em> devices to the speed of the <em>slowest</em> device.  There have been a number of wireless standards over the years - Wireless A, B, G, N, and the newest is AC.  These &quot;standards&quot; all have to do with the speed at which Wi-Fi devices communicate with your router.  The slowest of these &quot;standards&quot; over the years has been Wireless B at 11Mbps, A and G are 54Mbps, N is theoretically capable of 600Mbps, and AC is theoretically capable of 3.2Gbps.  They also all operate in different wireless spectrums:  A uses 5Ghz, B and G are in the 2.4Ghz spectrum, and both N uses both 2.4 and 5Ghz, and AC is all in the 5Ghz range.</p>
<p>So, if you have 2 devices that are capable of wireless N speeds (600Mbps) and one device that is only wireless G capable, the entire router will slow down Wi-Fi communications to <em>all three</em> devices down to wireless G - 54Mbps.  This is one of the biggest problems people have with routers.  When you set yours up, there should be a setting to make it so the router is &quot;wireless N only&quot; (or AC in newer models) - you should absolutely set this.  This means that if, say, you set your router to N only, then people with A, B, G and AC devices will <em>not</em> be able to connect to your wireless router <em>at all</em> and keeps your communication faster.</p>
<p>The next biggest problem is using 2.4Ghz antennas.  AS discussed above, the different standards use different spectrums (think of it like a radio frequency (because that's what it is)).  There are <em>tons</em> of devices that talk at 2.4Ghz - cordless phones and Xboxes are the biggest culprits.  All of these devices broadcasting at the same time on the same radio frequency creates a large amount of radio interference (think of static on your radio between stations).  And Xboxes talk very, very loudly at this frequency, so they tend to just drown out any other devices, or at least make it so that they are much harder for the router to &quot;hear&quot;.  These things should not be placed near the router - they should be as far away as possible.  Additionally, in wireless N routers you have the option to just shut the 2.4Ghz antenna off completely and only allow connections in the 5Ghz spectrum.  This is helpful, especially in apartment buildings or very closely packed neighborhoods where your device can &quot;see&quot; many Wi-Fi networks.  If you set it to the 5Ghz antenna only then you will immediately see that there are far, far fewer wireless networks to compete with.  All of those networks talking on the same radio frequency also causes a ton of interference and can be eliminated easily.  As AC only works in the 5Ghz spectrum it does not suffer from this issue.</p>
<p>The last, but most important part, is the internet connection itself.  Let's say you have a 10Mbps connection from your cable provider.  That doesn't mean that all connected devices <em>each</em> get 10Mbps.  It means you have 10Mbps to <em>split</em> between each device.  Think of this as a pie.  If 3 devices are connected, each device gets 1 third of the pie (3.33Mbps).  If 5 devices are connected they'll each get 2Mbps.  If 10 devices are connected they'll each get 1Mbps.  So, as you can see, the more devices you add your internet connection starts slowing down dramatically.  This is why companies today are offering 100Mbps, 200, 300, and up to 1Gbps connections to your home.  When you slice those much larger pies up for all of the connected devices, they're still getting a big fat piece of pie.  Just in the instance of 100Mbps - you could have 10 connected devices and they'd each still get 10Mbps - plenty to stream hi-def movies over.</p>
<p>I hope that helps clear up the mud a little bit.  If anyone else has any questions I'll be happy to answer them.  Been a network engineer for 20 years and did Wi-Fi exclusively for 3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. So helpful, clear and comprehensive. Next time my home network begins to crawl I now have a starting point to figure things out. I probably have a B, A, or G device slowing my newer stuff down. Our slowdowns are far and few between and so far have been  very mysterious to me. If the slow device is not the issue, your other info will be helpful. Thanks so much for taking the time to write that up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any standards compliant 802.11 device shouldn't slow ALL of the devices down to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>The slow down comes from the fact that while the slower device is transmitting the others have to wait for it to finish.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>50Mb @ 54Mbps = less than 1 second to transmit.
50Mb @ 12Mbps = just over 4 seconds to transmit.</p>
<p>Basically, the slower device takes four times as much time to do anything and nothing else can do stuff while it is which leads to a slowdown to the average speed. Your AC device would still use it's full speed while it is transmitting but it can't transmit as readily as it could if there were only AC devices on the network since the other device is essentially wasting time.</p>
<p>APs also adjust the modulation of the signal (which affects the clients speed) based off of it's signal strength. So an AC device close to the AP with strong signal may get 256QAM modulation which can pass 8 bits per symbol while the same device at long range with poor signal could end up with QPSK modulation which can only pass 2 bits per symbol. So that poor signal device once again is taking 4 times as much time to pass 8 bits to and from the AP. If you have a lot of distant devices, they could all be running at low speeds dragging down the AP for everything that's up close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, I work in IT and actually just recently did a wireless install for an office of about 30 users. There are a total of 3 AC access points installed for them. When they have about 25 people on the network, everything is fine, but when they hit about 30, they begin to get packet loss, about 30-40% packet loss... the packet loss only occurs on the wireless, the connection itself (which is a 100MB fiber circuit) does not experience any. Our theory is that two of the access points are simply overloaded since they are both located in the main office area and the majority of users are connected to those two. We have changed the channels on these 3 access points to use channels that are not commonly used, which helped a little, but they still get this issue every now and then as they get close to 30 people on the network. There is also the theory that there is one particular user who is running something on their workstation that is using up a ton of bandwidth, but we haven't been able to narrow down the culprit or prove that this is what is going on. </p>
<p>As far as if they are using 2.4ghz or 5ghz, I think they may be using both... maybe the 2.4ghz should be turned off completely?</p>
<p>Any thoughts or troubleshooting tips?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you could try to set a maximum amount of bandwith per connected user, so that one user doesn't get every free MB/s for his p0rn download?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ScubaAlek" target="_blank">ScubaAlek</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone hogging the band wouldn't cause packet loss. The AP's use CSMA-CA (for standard 802.11 aps) or TDMA (for more expensive ones) so that all of the devices can work together no matter how much one end user wants to pig out.</p>
<p>You should band steer them to 5GHz if your AP's support it though. Band steering will push them towards the 5GHz signal even if they see the 2.4 band first.</p>
<p>2.4 won't interfere with 5 and vice versa so turning it off shouldn't make a difference unless the AP's processor is too weak to handle the traffic.</p>
<p>Do you happen to have records of which devices come onto the network when this issue occurs? If there is a common thread to a single device, you may have a &quot;hidden node&quot;. </p>
<p>A hidden node is a device which the AP can hear but other devices on the network cannot. Since it cannot hear or be heard by other end user devices it will assume that the radio spectrum is clear when it is not and will transmit when it shouldn't and in turn will interfere with other transmissions and drive packet loss through the roof due to it's corrupting influence.</p>
<p>Last but not least, you have the aps using different non-overlapping channels correct? It doesn't sound like you have co-channel interference (overlapping aps on the same channel) since they'd work together and would just slow down rather than have packet loss. But inter-channel interference (2.4ghz channel 1 and 5 for example) would cause high packet loss as they would fight with one another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they're not commercial grade WAPs then they could be overloaded.  However, you most likely have overlapping channels.  Set each WAP to a discrete channel, firstly.    Then you need to roam around the area with a laptop running Inssider and find out where you have issues.  That'll tell you if you're getting problems on either the 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz wireless spectrum.  I can't emphasize enough how awesome that tool is.</p>
<p>What size is the connection?   Are you monitoring the bandwidth usage at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for an excellent answer. A couple of more queries about mobile networks, if you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is a contributing factor to the lack of congestion on phone lines the fact that there's very few of them connected to the tower and actually exchanging information at a given time? I read that a PSTN will begin to fail in the event of natural disasters as a result of the fact that lines get choked due to it being designed only to handle 10% of its total connected load at a time. Is this also true of mobile networks? If yes, what percentage (roughly) will they begin to fail at?</p>
</li>
<li>Slightly more juvenile question, am I right in presuming that in mobile phones, all of voice, SMS and data are transferred on the same frequencies? If yes, shouldn't speeds be slower at certain times due to greater connected devices (due to data transfer) than others? Why is it, then, that this is not essentially observed?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that this concept is called multiplexing in electronics, and that the radio signals don't interfere with each other, so although this analogy is very nice for eli5, it may lead to misconceptions down the road.</p>
<p>When speaking and listening to multiple people in a room, you actually hear the other voices, but you &quot;tune out&quot; the others. The analogy should be accentuated on this point because it is more closely descriptive of what your router does with signal filters and Fourier transforms.</p>
<p>In electronics, Multiplexing is a simple way to design for one device to be able to trick us into thinking that it is multitasking, but it comes at the cost of speed, because unlike more advanced hardware, it is still only technically doing one thing. A multiplexer switches between tasks very quickly, while more advanced hardware can handle two or more tasks simultaneously.</p>
<p>The separation im trying to make is that your router is slow when multiple people connect to it , not because the router has trouble focusing on one voice, but because it has to devote time on tasks for each separate voice.</p>
