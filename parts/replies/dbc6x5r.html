			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the analogy, though if I can ask - what about the neck?  It has the spinal cord running through it.  Does it also follow the same principle?  I was on a spinning roller coaster ride once and decided to relax.  I think i pulled a neck muscle and also hit my head on the side panel.  In accidents, I think it's mentioned that the person should not be moved by untrained people unless it's a life threatening situation because there might be a spinal injury and we don't want the spinal cord to be severed.</p>
<p>Sorry - I'm not debating your information, just genuinely curious.  It's just that I'm trying to understand the specifics for the neck.  I think your info and analogy is very correct, but I'm just missing a the part that makes me go &quot;Ah, so that's why!&quot; :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does. There are a few videos of football players with their heads and necks at a disturbing angel from from their bodies, yet they are perfectly fine. It's just that if the neck breaks, it's much <em>much</em> worse for the human than say a hand or a knee. </p>
<p>It also probably has a significantly lower tolerance for bending and it breaking than the rest of the body but enough to make a difference in the tense versus loose situation. </p></div>		</li>
