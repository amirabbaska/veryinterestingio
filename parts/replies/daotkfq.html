			<div class="markdown"><p>It is literally printed onto the chips in the combination of different types of transistors and how they are wired together. The machine code might be something like 78 98 13 which in human might be add the number stored in address 98 in memory with number stored in 13  in memory. 78 will flip a series of switches that will activate a circuit to fetch number from spot 98 in memory, fetch number stored in spot 13 of memory, then add them and store the number somewhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a thing to remember is that an important consequence of storing memory as a long string of uninterrupted binary is that the computer never knows what the information represents. It is (usually) never stored where the information starts and ends and how to parse it, what it means. a string of binary is just a string of binary, that text file is just a string of binary, that .exe is just a string of binary, the computer sees no difference. it lacks context.</p>
<p>It's the job of the software (or the CPU architecture) to make sense of the information it requests. Like what happens in the example OP gave: The text editor knows that it is used to parse text, it is programmed with rules to understand memory as f.i Asccii text. so, anything it receives is interpreted that way, be it right or wrong.</p>
<p>The CPU assumes machine code, it understands machine code and gives that as context. But pass it a text file and it will throw an error, the information you passed it is meaningless under the context of machine code.</p>
<p>It's the software that translates the binary received, not the computer, if that makes sense. A chinese book is understood by a Chinese speaker, even if the library does not understand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't converted, mov would be an instruction that is actually a part of the cpu, down to the circuits. It would pass the mov &quot;signature&quot; along with the parameters. </p>
<p>So it would send electrical signals along the path that determines what operator to use on the data (don't remember what it's called right now) and depending on the opcode it would do something with the parameters along with it. </p>
<p>Just realized I'm not very good at explaining things sorry. Hopefully someone comes along who is better at explaining it. </p></div>		</li>
