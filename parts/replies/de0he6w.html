			<div class="markdown"><p>As an air traffic controller this is very interesting to me.  Bigger airplanes create more turbulence when moving through the air, which can wreak havoc on small airplanes operating behind them.  Because of this we have to put more distance between larger leading airplanes and smaller following airplanes (a small Cessna has to be 8 miles behind a 747!), which gives the &quot;wake turbulence&quot; time to dissipate.  The FAA is now using LIDAR to measure wake vortices more accurately than ever but prediction is still incredibly difficult and there are occasional surprise encounters, even though more that prescribed separation is being used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please correct me if I'm wrong. But I remember a physics class that I took a few years ago in college that mention that it is possible to use math to describe laminar flow and to describe turbulent flow (main language is not English so I'm hoping the translation makes sense) but that the real problem was that it is impossible (at least at that point) to describe the transformation from one to the other. The example my professor used was the smoke from a cigarette. The is first the laminar flow that comes from the cigarette and looks like a straight line, but at some point it starts to swirl in the air creating the turbulent flow. The point in which one flow transforms into the other is the part that was hard to describe and understand so we can avoid it when engineering machines that flow through fluids like airplanes. It is kinda what I remember but this was like 6 years ago and I was not in the physics program at my uni. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have lots of empirical models for turbulent flow from hundreds of experiments but there aren't many analytical solutions. So we know how to model it but we don't have a purely mathematical solution for a lot of turbulent flow cases (e.g. convective heat transfer with turbulent flow). Laminar flow is pretty easily modeled with functions already. </p>
<p>Transitional flow is basically voodoo magic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you're correct, that is definitely something that is not well understood yet. But even describing turbulence by itself is very difficult, and given the wide variety of applications of this phenomenon, mathematicians and physicists still have a long way to go</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually not easy and I'm not sure why you think that's the case. On a large scale, this is a very complex optimization problem. Some variations of this problem don't even have solutions; we just have ways to approximate solutions using numerical methods. </p></div>		</li>
