			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm honestly amazed there's not more regulation surrounding the entertainment systems in cars.  Everything is (and has been for years) going to touch screens now--that's like the dumbest way to control anything in a vehicle, where things should be easily accessible.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here that would be seen as similar to using the phone (I think, IANAL). You’re not allowed to adjust or play about with a sat nav if you’re not parked up (so no doing it at the lights) - I’m pretty sure the same applies to fiddling with the inbuilt system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate my car for this.
Setting up the sat nav is awful especially if you're already driving.
Fuck even changing play lists is touch screen and infuriating to use whilst moving.
It makes my infotainment system virtually unusable when driving.
Where as a simple click dial can be used when not looking at it to do simple stuff like make a call if need be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many features that should be easily accessible still are through dials and buttons. It’s mostly the fun stuff that’s on the touch screens, unless it’s a Tesla. Even then, there are still buttons on the steering wheel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my God, my mom was talking about getting a Tesla in the next couple years, and I was stoked because that means I could take it out occasionally.</p>
<p>I figured I'd do some research, being the techy son, and the controls on those things are so fucking shitty. Sub menus for basic controls? Really?</p></div>		</li>
