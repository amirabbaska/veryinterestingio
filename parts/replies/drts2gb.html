</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but day length is not the question here.  The question is about the asymmetrical changes in sunrise and sunset.  The asymmetry would go away if we used apparent (sundial) time instead of mean time.  Why is mean time different to apparent time?  The answer is orbital eccentricity, not axial tilt.  That's why earliest sunrise and latest sunset happen on different days, and not on the solstice.</p></div>		</li>
