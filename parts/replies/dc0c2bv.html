			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Increased processing power or new mathematical techniques can render a previously believed uncrackable hash crackable.</p>
<p>Additionally, not all hashes are designed to be uncrackable. MD5 is not usable for security purposes (as collisions can be created), but is perfectly viable for detecting random corruption, eg: in a download.</p></div>		</li>
