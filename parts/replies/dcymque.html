<p>This actually touches on a topic I've been thinking about recently so I really hope you'll be able to help me reason this out. As you know, the Fresnel equations are derived by solving Maxwell's
equations at an appropriate interface. When I did this in undergrad,
we described the interface by defining the index of refraction as a piecewise
function: one value on one side of the interface, and another value on the
other side, with the values changing infinitely rapidly at the interface.
From this setup, we derive that reflections only occur at the interface.
The more I think about it, the more uncomfortable I am with this
description of the system.  There are several factors that seem to
make this treatment not precisely correct.  </p>
<p>The step function description of the refractive index just isn't true.
First of all, we know that the wave functions of surface states spatially trail
out a bit into the vacuum. This means that the portion of the vacuum very
near to the surface actually has an infinitesimally different polarizability
(and thus index of refraction), compared to portions of the vacuum infinitely
far from the surface. While this point may seem pedantic because
the amplitude of these wave functions decays exponentially with distance,
it's actually crucial because it means that the index doesn't change discontinuously
near the interface, just very very rapidly. This means that reflections can happen
when the change in refractive index is just very rapid (i.e. they don't require a true discontinuity in the refractive index). This raises another problem. What is a &quot;rapid enough&quot; change to induce a reflection?</p>
<p>On a small enough length scale, shouldn't the index of refraction vary
spatially due to the discrete nature of atoms? For example, the polarizability between two atomic planes would probably be very different from the polarizability within an atomic plane. Wouldn't this result in a spatially periodic refractive index, and give reflections off of each plane of atoms? In the optical frequency regime, I imagine this could be negligible, but couldn't this manifest in XUV or X-ray reflectivity?</p>
<p>The index of refraction also varies as a function of depth into the solid. This is the case because the dielectric function is directly related to the band structure of the solid, and near an interface, the infinite lattice assumption used in deriving the bulk band structure breaks down. Maybe these spatial gradients don't usually result in significant reflection, but is it possible that they could result in a non-zero contribution to the reflectivity? </p>
<p>edit: Sorry for the formatting. This is my first reddit post. </p></div>		</li>

However, if you really want to describe the effect of things like surface spill-out on light reflection in-depth then you'd need to treat both the electrons and the light using quantum field theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>exactly, that's my point too. i find it hard to believe that there is a step function between refractive indicees. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks for ur answer. no, nothing to do with ellipsometry. the index of refraction is a somewhat imaginary (not in mathematical sense) quantity. the light will only see the atoms. i find it hard to believe that the first row of atoms immediately changes everything for the light and would expect some penetration depth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, at IR and UV-VIS frequencies, the wavelength of light is so much bigger than the typical diameter of an atom (for any sensible definition of 'diameter of an atom') that the light doesn't see the individual atoms, it only senses an averaged field, similar to how we humans sense water to be a continuous fluid rather than a bunch of molecules. The atomic nature of matter doesn't start to matter until you're working with hard x-rays with energies above a few KeV.</p>
<p>In addition to that, light doesn't really see the atoms themselves, it sees electrons. Atoms are far heavier than electrons and thus they do not really respond to the varying electromagnetic field at the same rate as electrons do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>of course, it sees the electrons of the material. in case of metals and semiconductors that's blurred out charges, distributed everywhere over the crystal. this makes the usual description of reflection even harder to believe to me. </p>
<p>i know these figures with huygen spherical waves originating from the first row of atoms leading to the law that the angles of incident and reflected wave are the same. However i have never seen them from the second or 10th row of atoms.</p>
<p>The &quot;school&quot;-explanation of reflection (and with school i mean uni) seems far too simplifying to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I'd like a little help understanding your difficulty. Is your issue with the notion that light completely reflects from a single layer of atoms on a reflective surface? Because that's definitely not true -- if you make a thin layer of aluminum, say 20 nanometers, it's still pretty transparent. In the strict spirit of your question, all I was saying in my comment is that light only reflects at surfaces/interfaces. The reason you can't see through a block of aluminum is because the light that doesn't get reflected is absorbed.</p></div>		</li>
