			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the camera bit, if you're using a camera made more than 15 years ago (ie. no digital screen to display the focused image) and have to use a viewfinder, you still have the same problem as you do with a mirror.  You'll have a difficult time focusing the camera (again, I'm talking about all manual stuff here, not fancy auto-focus) on a far away object without corrective lenses (either your glasses, contact lenses, or custom viewfinder glass, which I'm not sure anybody actually does, but in theory should work.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>But that's why film SLRs usually have a microprism or split prism focus screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I replied to another person, I've personally had issues (at least I think I do, it's been a while) even with split prism focusing screens (as in, I can focus the image, but it still doesn't look focused to me), but you're correct, those should negate the issue for anyone nearsighted.  Farsighted folks may still have issues, though most modern SLRs (modern being relative for film SLRs) have adjustments for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DSLRs are still in wide use in professional fotography and have an optical viewfinder (which is the whole point of the tilting mirror). Those optical viewfinders usually have an adjuster to correct for your eyesight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I know, but I haven't yet moved on to the modern age (I've been hopelessly waiting for a Pentax full frame so I can use my lenses and not get crop zoom) so I tend to forget there are actually people out there who both use a DSLR <em>and</em> the optical viewfinder.  Most people I know just use the screen, either because their old and have bad eyes so they need 108pt font to read anything, or they're young and just don't do things without digital wizardry involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if it's not an SLR (where you look through the lens), just a viewfinder, which is just a little window with markings, then your eye has to do the focusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've personally had issues focusing an SLR/TLR without my glasses, but a quick research tells me that my brain is messing with me and that you are indeed correct, for nearsighted people.  Anyone who's farsighted/needs reading glasses will still have issues with an SLR, since they're trying to focus on an image that's only a few cm/inches away from their eyes.</p></div>		</li>
