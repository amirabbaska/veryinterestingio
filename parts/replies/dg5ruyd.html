<p>The mantle is actually a pretty mysterious place. It has several layers, each with unique properties. There's a lot we don't understand: how magma plumes form, the Dynamo effect, exact compositions of magma in specific places. We do have pieces of the mantle, which have been very useful in putting together an image of what's happening underground. The mantle is mostly made of olivine, a very pretty bright green mineral. However, these samples are taken from places where they've been brought up to the surface, and olivine is fairly unstable. Most olivine on the surface decays into clays. Taking a fresh sample, as well as having direct access to the mantle for the purposes of sending down tools for measuring its properties, would be fantastic.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>If they can make it to record new depths we don't know what they would find. Sometimes you have go somewhere to understand it better.</p></div>		</li>
