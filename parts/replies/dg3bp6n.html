			<div class="markdown"><p>I had one of those. It was kind of waxy looking. I never thought twice about it. After having it so long that I don't remember not having it, I went to a dermatologist for a different spot. </p>
<p>My fair skin and red hair has caused others concern about my welfare. The derm saw my waxy looking (his words) uncolored spot that was raised like a mole he did a biopsy. Came back positive. I had to have it removed deeper. </p>
<p>It was very contained in that area. I've had no further issues. You might want to get your spot checked out. </p></div>		</li>
