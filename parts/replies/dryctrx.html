			<div class="markdown"><p>Star charts and telescopes have been the only reliable method of navigation until about 50 or 60 years ago. Although the invention of radio direction finding dates back to 1888, RDF didn't become popular until the improvements made during WWII.  Even still, it was years before there were rugged and accurate transistorized and microchip based units.  With the advent of satellite navigation in 1990, ground based beacons and systems have been shutting down.  The last LORAN stations were taken offline a few years back.</p></div>		</li>
