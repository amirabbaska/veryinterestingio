			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely not as complicated as that. Small organisms such as tardigrades or insects don't really need to indicate this. They're typically fertile for the duration of their lifespan after sexual maturation. I don't think much is known about pheromones in tardigrades, though. </p>
<p>I did find a paper that studied how reproductive they are: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10750-016-2643-8" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10750-016-2643-8</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I was responding to the statement in the original &quot;But from time to time this indifferent <strong>behaviour changes</strong>, in particular but not only when the females undergo a moulting process and when eggs are existing in the ovary. <strong>Under those circumstances</strong> it was not rare to find a male close to a female.&quot;</p>
<p>That indicated to me that there was some sort of signalling going on.  /u/DrLuny said based on their sensory organs it was likely chemical, and after reading up myself on their senses (or more specifically their lack of), that does seem the only route.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in high school my biology teacher told us a story in class about an experiment that I’m 90% sure used tardigrades, but I can’t seem to find any reference to it online. I’m going to refer to them generically in the story in case I’m misremembering that it was about tardigrades.</p>
<p>He said that if you put some meat in a pond, you can catch some. Then if you take a pan of water, cover half the pan to darken it, and put one right on the line between light and dark, it will swim toward the dark because it doesn’t like light. He said if you start giving it a small electric shock when it swims into the dark, it will eventually swim into the light to avoid the shock. The most interesting part was that he said if you chop up the one that learned this and fed it to another one, the second one will already have learned to swim into the light to avoid the shock.</p>
<p>The story always fascinated me, but I’ve started to feel like it was made up because I’ve never been able to find it referenced online. I’ll offer reddit gold to anybody who can find it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure you're thinking of a flatworm study that has since been mostly debunked.  Read up on the Thompson and McConnell study into biochemical memory -- <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/06/memory-transfer.aspx" target="_blank">here's one news article about it.</a>  Flatworms are barely trainable.  I doubt that tardigrades are trainable at all.</p></div>		</li>
