			<div class="markdown"><p>It is true that waking in deep sleep will make you temporarily groggy. However, the idea that you can accurately time your alarm to wake you in light sleep only really works in theory and not in practise. Things that wakes you up -  a noise from your phone, your partner rolling over, a dog barking - often &quot;reset&quot; the sleep cycle. You get woken up from the &quot;deep&quot; sleep and have to start again from &quot;light&quot; sleep again, meaning that the cycle is now much longer than 90 mins. Common medications and sleep disorders like sleep apnea will modify the timing and length of sleep stages as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Generally speaking, try to plan for ~90 minute intervals for sleep per cycle. So 7.5 hours of sleep would be more likely to have you waking up at the &quot;right&quot; time. 9 would be good as well. 8.25 is probably gonna leave you groggy, as would 10.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that if your cycle is shorter or longer than this average for 5 minutes, over the course of 5 cycles (7,5 hours) it makes 25 minutes of difference. I was always groggy after 7,5 hours of sleep so I did a journal for 2 months writing time of sleep and grading the grogginess and for me the proper times are around 6:40, 8:10 and 9:40. </p></div>		</li>
