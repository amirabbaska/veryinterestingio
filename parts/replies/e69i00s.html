			<div class="markdown"><p>The story i heard once wasn't exactly racist, but homophobic. The idea was a gay man had sex with a monkey and then spread it to humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few (maybe more, I cant remember) years ago there was a news story in Australia about an animal rescue group taking an orangutan from an indonesian village where the poor thing was kept as a prostitute. So maybe something along those lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The story I was told was “A French officer while stationed in DRC, had intercourse with a monkey and contracted SIM. The SIM virus mutated into HIV-1 which he went onto spread when he had sexual relations with the locals. Unknowingly causing the start of the AIDS Epidemic.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a doozy, but I thought the same when told the CIA imported the cocaine that fueled the crack epidemic, or we were the aggressors in both Gulf I and Gulf II.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I believe GWB and HIV, but I now feel government conspiracies are not the thing of the past I once thought they were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that’s a ridiculous notion too, but at least it was rooted in a long history of institutional power in America harming those groups and, once the AIDS epidemic hit, seemingly ignoring it because the damage it caused disproportionately affected those groups. </p></div>		</li>
