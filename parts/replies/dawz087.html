			<div class="markdown"><p>Just an irrelevant question, but is there several types of 7.62? As 7.62x48 or 7.62x36? Edit: sorry just read it again and got the answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are. The Mosin Nagant rifle used a 7.62x<del>51</del> 54 round, which is quite a bit larger and also the largest 7.62 round I know of offhand. Then they go as small as the 7.62x25, which is a handgun round used by the Russians in their WW2 era Tokarevs.</p>
<p>Also there's lots of .30 caliber rounds, which is just another way of measuring the bullets using inches instead of millimeters, which are also equivalent to a 7.62 round. A common one is the .308 rifle round, which is a fairly well known hunting round was used in the US military as the 7.62x51 NATO round. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor, but relevant correction:</p>
<p>The Mosin Nagant uses the 7.62x54R cartridge by default(There may be conversions because Bubba, but w/e). The &quot;R&quot; in this case stands for &quot;Rimmed&quot; meaning the base of the case extends past the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>30-06 is 7.62x61 and its bigger. There's also 300 win mag, 300 remington ultra mag and 300 weatherby mag. Any of those is a tossup for the largest and most powerful 30 cal round.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to compare, the 9mm parabellum is 9mmx19mm vs the AK's 7.62x39mm or a 0.30 which is 7.62x33mm or the 7.62x51mm.</p>
<p>As you can see the cartridges have different lengths which allow for different amounts of gunpowder.</p>
<p>The grain or mass of the bullet also impacts trajectory and velocity.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably the easiest answer.  The 7.62 intermediate round literally has twice as much propellant behind it.</p>
<p>Also useful for when amateur's confuse .22 and .223.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then you've got the .30-06, used in US military rifles like the M1903 and M1 garand. It's 7.62 X 63mm in metric, a real beast of a cartridge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a reason that after 110 years, it's still one of the best all-around hunting cartridges there is. Power, range, for just about every animal in North America, but not too huge to be hard to shoot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, the common 9mm (AKA 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum) is the 9x19, with 19 being he case length. </p>
<p>Not to be confused with 9x17 (9mm Kurtz or .380) or 9x18 (9mm Makarov).</p></div>		</li>
