			<div class="markdown"><p>Yemen is <a href="http://fsi.fundforpeace.org/" target="_blank">tied for fourth place</a> on the fragile states index, its the opposite of stable.  Besides the internal power struggles between the Houthis and the internationally recognized government (which is also a proxy war involving Iranian and GCC military forces), you also have the southern secessionist movement (sort of a leftover issue from the war between north and south Yemen during the Cold War), and the growing strength of ISIS and AQAP (in the area close to the Omani border) while everyone else is distracted (also AQ and ISIS fight each other, just to keep things interesting), and US drone strikes that frequently kill civilians.  Then add in the fact that Yemen is going through a major food crisis, and is about to exhaust their reserves of fresh water, and its hard to imagine a country with more going wrong.</p>

<p>edit: forgot to mention their population growth problem (birth rate more than double that of the US), which only puts more pressure on everything else.</p></div>		</li>
