<p>In your yard, on a tree, in the dirt, on your cat, in your carpet, full of competition for staph.<br />
On a disinfected towel cart only touched by humans, not much competition left. Go forth and multiply. </p>
<p>(This also applies to pretty much any human flora in a hospital: vre, cdiff, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im no expert but i disagree. I feel like the main factor is the  fact that there is alot of people in one place. In my humble opion there is a difference between a temporary injury and being immuno-depressed ( or whatever the right phrase is ). Most people are in the hospital for a short  (less than a week) stay. There are alot of people coming and going. They dont completely sanitize a E.R. examination room after a patient leaves ( from my experince ). I also read a article about super infections. It dont remember everything but the article mentioned those factors but also mentioned something called resistance. These bacteria will over time gain resistances to the chemicals and substances used to kill them and also passed these genetic adaptations on to future generations.
I disagree with your &quot;anti-hospital&quot; idea. My opion comes from personal first hand experince.
When i was in boot camp they gave us huge penicillin shots. A bunch of us still got sick. We were  all between 18 and 25 years old, healthy, not injured or immuno-supressed ( mabey thats the right phrase)
Tldr; based on a article i read its due to bacterial resistance wich comes from over use of                    anti-bacterial substances.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>&quot;SUPERBUG&quot; is just a catchy buzzword.</p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is just evolution on an observable timescale since the generation time for bacteria is so short.</p>
<p>Antibiotic treatments aren't a binary 0 vs 100 effectiveness, lets say a drug is 99% effective, that still leaves 1% of the bacteria, some of which survive your immune system, manage to reproduce, and pass on that minor resistance. That's called a selective pressure.</p>
<p>And the next time the drug is used it might only be 98.9% effective. Add random mutation, a generation cycle that lasts minutes, and it's pretty much an inevitability that a drug is going to lose effectiveness as strains inevitably build up resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see your point and i remember doing some inward reflecting after reading the article and coming to the conclusions that you mention. It sounds like you may be more knowledeable than me. Do you think that bacterial resistance has been hastened and enabled by over use of anti-bacterial substances?? What about the fact that if you kill almost everything off it produces an enviroment where there may be little to no compitetion for the surviveors. Yes i know i cant spell. What about the fact that (atleast to my knowledge) that some medicines wipe out almost all bacteria in our bodies.. even good ones. How does our over use and reliance on chemicals affect our daily lives? How does it affect the aggriculture and farming industrys? In regards to this issue what is better for children? Over expousure to bacteria and viruses?? I dont mean extreme here. Or over protection?? Like as in rush to the doc for every lil thing and blast with chems?? And finally why the hell did i not go to college so i could have flexed my mind and explored my curiosity?? I think my grammar was a bit off just now. Sorry for wall of text. Im a huge nerd i love the exchange of ideas and i love learning</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are a lot of people together. And they often present (show up at the door) with infections. And they are often subjected to invasive processes, not just surgery, but for instance catheterization and insertion of trachial tubes. And many of them are weak and at least somewhat immune suppressed. And a lot of antibiotics are used there. So my notion of the antihospital was a simplification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm this has got my gears turning. Looking back now i think i may have over simplified things in my own mind.
yes i feel like being injured and somewhat immune suppressed is a factor in  being more sussceptible to getting an infection but not in the proliferation of MRSA, wich is the focus of OP's question. If i am not mistaken that is. What enabled and hastened the advent of MRSA has allready been covered here.
I feel like my responses and opions are based on my E.R experinces and not on hospital stays. The in-patient enviroment is much more the situation with truly sick and weak people.
I feel like i need to learn how to think a lil deeper b4 drawing conclusions.
this is what i like about reddit. A true civil exchange of ideas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Schools and workplaces are often great breeding grounds for viruses and bacteria.  Lots of people in close proximity for extended periods of time, one person comes in with a cold, before you know it half the kids (or half the office) has it.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I seldom get sick when something goes around my office is that I have a fantastic immune system due to overexposure - my mother is a retired teacher.  Doctor's kids are often the same way.</p></div>		</li>
