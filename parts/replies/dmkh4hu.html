			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, absolutely.  2673 gave out a CME, a coronal mass ejection, which is now headed for Earth.  Here it is:</p>

<p>The CME, and solar flares from the sunspot, can impact Earth's magnetosphere, causing aurorae, disturbance of radio communications, and more.  A really severe impact could overload powerlines and systems, leading to something like the so-called Carrington Event, which happened back in the 1860s, IIRC.  That induced currents in telegraph lines, burning them out.  If something like the Carrington Event happened today, it could destroy our power generation across the country and around the world, leading to chaos.  It would be similiar to a huge EMP event.  2673 continues to develop, here's today's image:</p>

<p>2673 reminds me of a huge sunspot group that was visible during a partial solar eclipse that occurred in October, 2014, IIRC.</p></div>		</li>
