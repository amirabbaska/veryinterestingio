<p>Correct. Off-the-shelf tech available from Shell's Cansolv or Mitsubishi Heavy Industries promises capture of between 90% and 95%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bottleneck right now is that 100% a little too much energy, because thermodynamics gets unfavorable at low concentrations. You could create feedback loops in the capture part to go very close to 100% though. </p>
</li>
<li>I don't know as a % of plant cost, because current projects are retrofits on pretty old plants. Cost comparison is tough. That said, the two commercial projects that retrofit on a coal power plant cost $1.5 billion (SaskPower's Boundary Dam) and $1 billion (NRG and JX Nippon's Petra Nova). The former was on only 135 MW unit and the latter was on a 240 MW unit. The difference in cost can be put down to a few factors. Boundary Dam had to build more pipeline for transportation than Petra Nova. The latter used existing infrastructure in Houston area. Also, each were provided capture tech by different companies. </li>

<p>I've been out of the industry for twelve years (retired), but I used to trade energy for the company that owned the Midwest Gen coal porfolio. When NRG bought us they shut down just about everything because SCR retrofits were so friggety expensive that installing them would be a giant money-losing exercise in polishing turds (Some of those units are being converted to gas, though.) And if I remember correctly, CO2 emissions are a consequence of SCR use.</p>
<p>Are you saying CC tech has the potential to change economics like those? I know you know this, but the almighty $$$ is the only thing that's ever gonna get the big generation owners on board.</p>
<p>Edit: oh, and here's another question. Do you think this kind of CC tech could once again make it economically favorable to burn Appalachian coal over PRB?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Hence, we need policies and soon. In the US, it's great to see movement on the Republicans side for a carbon price.</p>
<p>Don't really know enough to say if CC tech could make Appalachian coal favorable again or not. Sorry!</p></div>		</li>

<p>What sort of policies did you have in mind? Are we talking about subsidizing these retrofits? Would that make sense over investing in renewable energy? </p>

<p>To answer one of your questions, CO2 emissions are not connected to SCRs.  Selective Catalytic Reduction system are a emissions control device which reduce the amount of NOx (a by product from the coal combustion) emitted to the atmosphere.  </p>
<p>Most of the U.S. coal fleet was built withought many environmental controls for NOx, SO2, Particulate Matter and Mercury).  Over the years, as EPA has promulgated new rules limiting the amount of these pollutants that can be released.  Each time a new rule goes into effect the plant owner(s) need to decide if it more profitable to retrofit the coal plant and add the controls, and operate it for many more years, or shutter the plant and call it day.  Each new EPA regulation has seen a wave of shuttered plants (or repowered to fire natural gas which don't have these emissions).  The Clean Power Plan, which was just gutted by Scott Pruitt, would have added CO2 to the earlier list of pollutants.  If that rule stood, then owners would have had to make the decision to invest in CCS or shutter.  To reduce the costs to the plant owners who wanted to deploy CCS, they would receive a payment for each tonne of CO2 that was captured and stored.</p>
<p>The scenario planning and modeling suggested the most of the older, smaller, and less frequently used coal fired power plants would cease operation, and the larger, newer plants would deploy CCS.  We'll all have to wait for the dust to settle at EPA and with several House and Senate bills related to CCS to see what the future holds.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>When asking about loss of efficiency. I was referring to turning coal into electricity. Either by hampering the process in some way or by consuming power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i think he meant loss in efficiency of the power plant and if there are bottlenecks or roadblocks to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>0.5bn to $1bn per 100MW sounds very expensive though, doesn't it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's not cheap. But if we want decarbonize within by 2050 or 2060, we can't get away from the costs. To be sure, doing it with only renewables will be even more expensive. Both CCS and renewables are needed in the most economical pathway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The EIA projects costs of new build technologies. The short of it is that CCS makes coal less efficient (more coal for the same energy) and about 75% more expensive, both on fixed and variable cost components.</p>
<p>Conversion likely runs in the $1-2b range for large coal, $750m-$1.5b for small and medium. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2Fj4L8t.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/2Fj4L8t.jpg</a> </p>
<p>EDIT: will also add that the EIA is awwwwwful at predicting emerging technology costs. Bad at predicting a lot of things, like renewable costs. They also project $10/MMBtu natural gas in 20 years, which no one thinks is even possible.</p></div>		</li>
