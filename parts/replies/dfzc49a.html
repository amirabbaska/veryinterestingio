			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this still true when accounted for over an entire year outside of the tropics? Deciduous trees stop photosynthesizing for a portion of the year, and while productivity is lower in fall and winter, evergreens keep going year round (except for the stinking larch, which we will not speak of again since it is an abomination).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time it would be too cold to actually do photosynthesis and thus produce O2/store carbon <em>efficiently</em>.</p>
<p>Some reasons: diffusion of gases down, light energy down (or even 0, because of snow blocking it), less water available (think winter: ice and snow are useless for trees in sense of photosynthesis), temperature down which means enzymes work slower, less heat means less water gets &quot;soaked&quot; up into the leafs to be processed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like the Coastal Redwood (Sequoia Sempervirens) would be a great candidate then. They grow fast, live long, get really big, and take a long time to decompose when they do die / fall down. It's a shame that they are at something like 3% of what they used to cover in the PNW. </p></div>		</li>
