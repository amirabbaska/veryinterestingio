			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same issue at the same age, my parents would lock all doors so I wouldn't walk away. One night I walked into their bedroom and just stared at them, it was pretty scary for them.</p>
<p>Years later, when I was 12 or so, I was watching a movie with my father late at night and I was falling asleep, I got up and grabbed a blanket (that we kept on the couch) and went to sleep in the car, which was on a lower floor. I have no memory of it, just waking up at my dad screaming at me. He got up and went crazy looking for me, and was just about to search for me in the neighborhood with the car. I was really confused. </p></div>		</li>
