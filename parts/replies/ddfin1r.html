			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone who does intermittent fasting can actually confirm that. Weirdly enough, even though one would think hunger should be caused by simple processes, once you are on IF for a couple of weeks, you no longer get hungry outside your window. But the last 20 minutes before you start eating hunger is real. Your body starts behaving like a 5 year old on Christmas Eve. Which makes me wonder how much mind over matter plays a part in it. Why does the body adjust to an eating window and just ignores the need for food at other times? </p></div>		</li>
