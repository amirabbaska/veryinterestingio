			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  It involved a lot of pork, and beef is a relatively recent development.  </p>
<p>There are no cultures that traditionally ate a lot of beef, because cows are terribly inefficient at producing meat in a timely manner, and the value of the cow (milk and work) was far too important.  Everyone knows about Hindu attitudes toward cows, but even some of the dairy tribes in Africa typically refrain from slaughtering their cows for meat, and instead slaughter goats.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chinese and Korean, yes. They raise lots of swine there. Maybe the poisonous grass was a while ago. (?) Japan does have its Kobe beef and we pay a pretty penny for it!</p></div>		</li>
