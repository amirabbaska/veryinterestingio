			<div class="markdown"><p>One of parents friends made some mashed potatoes and my mom was blown away at how good they were. She asked them what the ingredients were and they said 'a little butter, a little this, etc.'. My mom tried it and it wasn't near as good, so she watched next time instead. Turns out 'a little butter' meant a whole stick. </p>
<p>Even then, I'm pretty sure it wasn't 2:1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My secret recipe courtesy of Paul McCartney: Lots of onions. Potato to onions 2:1. Chop them pretty small but large enough to add a crunch and add them in while the mash is hot so they steam. They add this lovely sweetness. </p>
<p>And of course a LOT of butter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I make good mash potatoes. I probably use a half stick of butter, let it melt then add a little milk and a scoop of mayonnaise. Salt and pepper. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, I thought an extra tablespoon of butter or two was creeping up on the adding-too-much-butter line. Gonna have to try adding a whole potato's worth of it next time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Literally no such thing as too much butter. I put at least a stick in for every 4 russets. Sometimes I pretend the first one didn't made it and add another half. (Unsalted only 'cause I'm watching my weight)</p>
<p>Another secret: a splash (or 5) of heavy whip if you have it laying around for the ultimate experience. </p>
<p>Another secret: diced onions sweated or caramelized in (You guessed it) lots of butter and mashed in if regular ol potatoes aren't gonna cut it. </p>
<p>Experience: I'm Russian. Root vegetables: all I ate. And butter. Lots of that too. </p></div>		</li>

Do I know what the calorie count is? No. Do i care? Fuck no. These things are delicious! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At thanksgiving, family raves about my mashed potatoes. I try to tell them not to think about the calorie counts on the potatoes. Itâ€™s probably similar in calorie density to peanut butter. </p>
<p>10 russets</p>
<p>Green onions</p>
<p>Block of cream cheese</p>
<p>2 sticks of butter</p>
<p>Salt to taste</p>
<p>Pepper grinder until your arm cramps up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>step 1:steam peeled quartered salted spuds in a rational combimaster oven for 20 mins on a perforated gastro tray.</p>
<p>step 2: switch the combi-master to 140c steam+heat  for 5 minutes to give them very thin pale yellow skins.</p>
<p>step 3 mash them through a conical sieve using a stick blender's masher blade-head over a warm pan containing a tenth weight (or less!) of the spuds in just melted butter.</p>
<p>step 4: mix thoroughly with a spoon or  give the mash a quick pulse with the blender and it's ready to serve or spoon into thin non-perforated gastro trays for blast chilling.</p>
<p>That little bit of 140c Maillard magic paired with a little dehydration concentrates the taste and savouriness, and lets the mash easily drink up the butter up whist remaining stiff enough to support an artfully placed cut of meat... or sausages. Mash doesn't discriminate. :)</p>
<p>If I'm making enough mash i might swap the blender/chinois sieve for a moulin masher.</p>
<p>You can avoid using tons of butter if you try, give it a go!</p>
<p>I developed this method trying to make tasty, cheap mash for the staff evening meal. Oh the experiments I subjected them to!</p></div>		</li>
