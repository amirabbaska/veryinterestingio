			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangental to your question is cleaning vs sanitizing. Cleaning is removing debris and dirt from a surface. Sanitizing is removal, destruction, and deactivation of biological hazards. You have to clean before sanitizing as biological hazards (e.g. bacteria, viruses) can &quot;hide&quot; from the sanitizer in the debris. This similar to how a cat can hide from the rain under a car. If you move all the cars, the cat will either leave or get wet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t there a distinction between disinfectant and antiseptic where disinfectants are toxic to living organisms and antiseptics aren’t? </p>
<p>I’m not an expert or anything I just remember a friend of mine studying this the other day and can’t remember correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, antiseptics are definitely used against living organisms, such as bacteria.</p>
<p>In theory the difference is that antiseptics are for disinfecting living surfaces like skin, while disinfectants are for non-living things like needles and scalpels. But the terms are often used interchangeably.</p></div>		</li>
