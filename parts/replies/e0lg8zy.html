<p>I can see why someone wouldn't get HIV from contact with saliva that has <em>no</em> cells in it, but what about saliva that has <em>very few</em> cells? Is there some threshold, such that transmission of a number of HIV-infected cells below that threshold won't cause an HIV infection?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is such a thing as &quot;viral load&quot; which is a common measure for HIV infection. It refers to how much of a person's cells are infected with the virus. Someone with HIV can get to a point where their viral load is undetectable. Some recent studies are showing that having an undetectable viral load can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission. </p>
<p>This seems related in that if there are &quot;very few&quot; cells in saliva, it would still be less likely to be transmitted. Even when a viral load is undetectable, it doesn't mean it is nonexistent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only realistic way, and IIRC only confirmed case of infection by saliva, is if the both the carrier and the recipient had open sores in the mouth, resulting in blood being in the carriers saliva, and a transmission point in the recipients mouth.</p></div>		</li>
