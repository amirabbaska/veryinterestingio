			<div class="markdown"><p>Not op, but what I think they're getting at is Xbox devs don't use normal consoles. A developer can sign up through Microsoft and get dev consoles to test the games while they are being made. But those consoles aren't normally available to the public. I always assumed it was due to the kit on the console, but it might be because they are higher end machines so it can be tested more rigorously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My SO works for ID@Xbox, so I have no idea what AAA or first party devs have to work with, but their dev kits are usually XboxOneS atm.</p>
<p>Hell, you can't publish through this, but even your standard Xbox One can be pushed into dev mode. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What the devkit for a console looks like really depends on what generation of console you're looking at.  Today's consoles are basically the same as PCs so a dev system is just a high-end PC with a bit of custom hardware/software.  For older systems, it would be some sort of expensive-as-fuck pre-production version of the hardware with some easy way of loading code onto it (rather than having to burn a ROM every time). </p></div>		</li>
