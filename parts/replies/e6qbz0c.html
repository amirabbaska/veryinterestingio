			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fairly close to the mark regarding how EXTRAocular muscles work, however the problem OP is describing is an issue of accommodation and/or (l
presbyopia, which involve the INTRAocular muscles. Specifically the ciliary body muscles attached to the lens of the eye and the iris sphincter, which are not skeletal muscles so operate under a different set of rules (think heart and intestinal muscles).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you bend your elbow you are flexing (contracting) your bicep, while your tricep maintains tension to stabilize your arm. Same thing with your legs (quads/hamstrings). Same thing with your neck, same thing with your back/chest muscles. Same thing with the way we balance on our feet without falling back/forwards. Same thing with almost every muscle on your body. The eye muscles (whom are located on the sides of the eye) are the exact same concept. When you look left, the left side of your eye muscles contracts while the right side maintains tension and vice versa. For every movement you make, one side is contracting and one side is maintaining tension.</p>
