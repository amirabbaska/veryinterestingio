			<p>It really depends on the animal.  Musk Ox are so well adapted to brutal conditions their core temperature varies only minimally, even at temps of -50F.  Other animals like chickadees really do seem to feel cold.  They shiver to keep their body temp up during the day, losing large portions of body fat in the process.  Polar bears don't seem to feel the cold either.  From the inside of a vehicle with a portable heater, still freezing, I've watched a mother and her two cubs stand out in -60F with a windchill well below that and they're just chillin' out in the snow like it's  nothing.</p>		</li>

			<p>Some types of dogs appear to be most comfortable outside during the winter. They will beg to go outside and run around and play in the snow.</p>		</li>
