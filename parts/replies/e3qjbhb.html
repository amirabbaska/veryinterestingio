			<div class="markdown"><p>Forester here. This is very accurate. Not only underbrush though, the trees have reached very high densities across large areas of land that would not have existed under natural fire regimes. This in conjunction with drought, is creating some massive wildfires.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I believe so, but the problem with that is that the fires threaten rural homes and cities. Essentially, if humans hadn't expanded into fire-prone areas, it would probably be easier to let it burn itself out.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that human-caused climate change has made and is making the state hotter and drier, both of which only serve to encourage hotter, larger, and more frequent fires.</p>
<p>Note that this comment is not an invitation to debate anything about climate change. Any attempts to do so will not be replied to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Healthy fires have less fuel. Species like ponderosa pine can survive, even thrive, when smoldering fires pass through. Due to the high fuel load though, the fires we are currently seeing burn much, much hotter. The destruction is far more complete. This leads to very significant erosion when rains return, and absolutely destroys the biodiversity of the ecosystem. </p>
<p>Where there may have been a mix of dozens. Hundreds or even thousands of species before a fire, these hot crown fires generally come back as monotypic forests. Monotypic forests are much more susceptible to disease and destructive bug infestations, which kill otherwise healthy trees accelerating a repeat of the  cycle. </p>
<p>A combination of not allowing things to burn naturally for decades and building in the wildland/urban interface has lead us here, and going back isn't as easy as just letting it burn. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like someone said, that poses a danger to the homes in the area. Firefighters here in California will start &quot;controlled&quot; fires in these area prone to fire, however it can get hard for them to control it sometimes and they can only burn so much at a time to keep it as controlled as possible.<br />
On a side note, its basically raining ash where I am in SoCal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re touching on the right things here but a bit inaccurate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yep, they're both by bays on the west coast of a landmass. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’re not. They are really not.</p>
<p>California is clearly on the W coast of a major continent. The bay (I assume you mean SF Bay???) is trivially small at a continental/weather scale. (Do you live near it and are influenced by proximity?)</p>
<p>Greece sits on a Mediterranean Sea - literally an intra-continental sea. Even if you consider, as you suggested in another comment, Eurasia as a single continent (which it is really) then Greece still does not sit on the west coast!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's interesting how parallel biomes are across continents</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct, they both have Mediterranean climates, but this is despite the above differences.</p>
<p>It’s driven by similar latitude and for reasons which I will explain below California being quite dry for a west coast location.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the east coasts are usuall more humid, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite. You’ve mixed up some stuff (or possibly extrapolated based on experience of being in California?).</p>
<p>It’s hard to generalise but the dominant air circulation (due to Earth’s rotation) is W to E. </p>
<p>Actually due to equatorial heat forcing and equatorial-polar temp difference this sets up something called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell" target="_blank">Hadley Cells</a> which describe the macro trade winds.  This combines in N hemisphere above 30 degrees (ie US and Europe) to produce NWerly trade winds.</p>
<p>So if anything as a massive simplification in N hemisphere above 30 degrees the W coast is getting the (wet) maritime wind and is therefore wetter. Think BC, Ireland, Norway, Britain (and you should see the difference between even W coast and E coast Scotland).</p>
<p>However (still with me?) this isn’t everything because ocean currents massively influence the climate! California’s climate is due to the cold <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Current" target="_blank">California Current</a>. The cold water means that the predominant SW trade winds are not actually very wet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deserts are usually on the west side of land masses,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, not all deserts which are more generally in continental centres far from maritime moisture.</p>
<p>Coastal deserts specifically ARE on W coasts due to the above cold ocean current factor.</p>
<p>Additionally in the US you have a lot of desert on the western side since they sit behind and in the ‘rain shadow’ of the American Cordillera (Rockies/Sierra Nevada chain).</p>
<p>Hope that was useful....</p>
<p>Edit - <em>coastal</em> BC is oceanic/wet but as per US deserts east of Sierra Nevada, lots of BC is also dry and Mediterranean since it’s also east of Cordillera/Rockies (thanks to a comment/nudge by /u/TheQuek )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also wouldn't be such a big deal, but we are so heavily populated, that almost no matter where we burn, homes and lives are at risk.</p>
<p>Couple that with our extremely varied terrain, and it makes for a very difficult situation for fire fighters to help contain.</p>
<p>I was driving by Lake Mendocino just 2 weeks ago, and I watched the beginnings of the fire there that is now over 80K acres.  The fire was on the peaks of some very inaccessible mountain tops, and I remember saying to myself &quot;they are going to have a bear of a time even getting up into there to get it under control&quot;.  that was when it was only 1200 acres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beetle-kill is complex. Not sure on the 'imported' beetle idea, bark beetles adapt to species of trees but can cross over to other species given the right circumstances, so maybe there's an invasive species of beetle that really likes native California trees.</p>
<p>Colorado and neighbors, up to Canada, suffered mightily from a species of beetle that was adapted to lodgepole pine. There was a confluence of events: this species being prolific, the forests having large populations of mature (less able to survive beetle attack) lodgepole which was largely a result of mass logging and homogenous replanting a century ago, and a number of unusually warm winters in a row which allowed the beetles survive. Any region affected with similar factors is absolutely susceptible.</p></div>		</li>
