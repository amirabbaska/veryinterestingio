			<div class="markdown"><p>By &quot;upside down goggles&quot; OP means goggles that flip your vision upside down.  The ceiling is down and the floor is up.  That's all you see.  It takes a lot to get used to, but after a few days, you do get used to it.  Once you switch to not using that, you actually are as confused by seeing things normally as you previously were by seeing them upside down.  There've been a few experiments regarding this, and some are referenced elsewhere in this thread.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the human brain is amazing and can do some amazing things.  It's also really, really stupid and does stupid things.  This is a combination of those super fun features.  The brain adapts to looking upside down and then that's what it expects.</p>
<p>Now, as other people have said, you (probably) don't literally see things upside down when really they're right side up.  You (probably) just get used to moving your hand in the 'wrong' direction and things like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is part of research into how we 'see' things.  It turns out that simply 'seeing' our world is very complex, and requires a good chunk of brain power.  Your eyes aren't doing all that much, compared to your brain, which is 'instantly' translating the visual information, and processing it.</p>
<p>If you use goggles to artificially 'flip' your vision, your eyes 'don't care', but your brain has to change it's programming on how to decode that change.  It takes a few days, but it does that, automatically.  It's one of those little miracles...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So they are a real thing? Is this something for a video game? I feel like I'm missing so much information here. How does everyone know and have so much to discuss about upside down goggles? Especially if they are just for experiments...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for experiments about the brain. Such things usually have mirrors and lens combinations to produce images you want. Here, upside down. Elsewhere, expanded visual field etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like Schr√∂dinger's cat or the Stanford Prison Experiment. The experiment with the goggles is interesting and a lot of people have heard of it, even if they aren't scientists themselves. Search &quot;The Innsbruck Goggle Experiments&quot; if you're curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in many biology classes they teach you that the brain is interpreting signals from your eye to produce an image in your head. There have been experiments where you flip your vision upside down with mirrored googles and after some time your brain figures out the new pattern of signals coming from the eyes and corrects to the original image. This is typically a lesson in how adaptive your brain is. </p></div>		</li>
