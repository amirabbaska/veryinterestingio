			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the genes that were on the Y chromosome were lost or moved to other chromosomes.</p>
<p>This is called Y chromosome degeneration. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120474/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120474/</a></p>
<p>It is proposed that the Y chromosome will continue to degenerate into extinction and a new way of sex determination will form.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually Y chromosome already disappeared in certain rodent mammals. In these organisms, all the genes of the Y chromosome migrated mainly to the X chromosome. So they use an entirely different sex determining system that is not very well known for certain species. Most common solution evolution came up with seems to be XX (F) vs XO (M) system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In part because the Y has lost a lot of genes: everyone has at least one X, but not everyone has a Y, so genes that are not related to sex could be dropped from the Y (by mistake) without there being much of a problem. However, a few of your other chromosomes have two short branches, due to the location of the centromere very close to one end of the chromosome. See for instance <a href="http://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Karyotype_Denver_system.jpg" target="_blank">chromosome 14</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to what other's have said, it's advantageous to have nothing but sex-related genes on the Y chromosome. If a gene is potentially useful to both sexes, then it is an advantage when it migrates to another chromosome so that females descendants can inherit it. On the other hand sex related genes need to stay on the Y chromosome, or bad things happen (usually). So over time the Y chromosome has become small but highly specialized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more like:</p>
<p>====== is the X</p>
<p>= is the Y</p>
<p>However, the Y has a pairing center for recombination with the X during meiosis.  You can check out pictures of that on google.</p></div>		</li>
