			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent overview; thank you. Do you have any insight as to how home schooling fits into this, if at all? Specifically with regard to vouchers?</p>
<p>Also, is it accurate to say that vouchers could essentially sink an under-performing public school?</p>
<p>And is the school or board in some way responsible for busing students in if they're a good bit away from the school their parents want them to go to?</p>
<p>Sorry to barrage you, but you seem on top of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how homeschooling affects school budgets b/c, while families are free to teach their kids at home, adminster tests, and hand out diplomas, they are usually on the hook to pay for all of it, but I don't think they get a check b/c their kid doesn't use public school resources.  As a matter of fact, many homeschoolers still do got to public school for extracurriculars and electives.  I do not believe a family gets voucher $$ when they homeschool.</p>
<p>Vouchers can absolutely kill a poor-performing school. This is why many public schools and unions oppose vouchers.  Open enrollment schools and vouchers are one danger, but charters are much more dangerous.  One, there are open to anyone.  Charters can't deny kids access.  Open enrollment public schools can b/c the board sets a number and criteria for enrollment (often times this is bullshit in that the board makes this criteria to appease concerns from the community that low socioeconomic kids won't come into the district).</p>
<p>There's also a million charters out there, so many that some run with a school student count of 100 kids.  That's not to say they are better b/c of their small ration of student to teacher b/c again, their budgets are based off enrollment, so teachers get paid shit which means you get generally bad teachers, and you don't have an infrastructure to support.  Your school might literally be in a church basement.</p>
<p>Regardless, the big city schools are so miserable, parent look for alternatives, and they keep looking, and looking.  I know kids who change schools every semester b/c mom doesn't like this or didn't like that.</p>
<p>Charters don't have to bus, and those that want to keep a small neighborhood enrollment often don't.  Others, however, pay bus companies to pick up kids all over the city to bring them to school.
It's a matter of $$$, really.  More kids = more $$$, so it usually behooves a district to bus as many kids in as possible.  It's also a good marketing ploy to give parents transportation options b/c parents often work odd hours and have kids of a wide range of ages.  Brothers and sisters could be going to high schools that are 10-20 miles away from their siblings elementary.</p>
<p>The only time a school is required to provide transportation is when there is a special education need b/c again, charters can't deny services for anyone, so if they have SpEd students, they need to service them as needed. Do they have the money to do that effectively?  More often than not, no. </p>
<p>Another circumstance that requires a charter to provide transportation is when the child is legally considered homeless.  In that case, charters might hire a bus to pick them up, pay a cab, bus fare, whatever. And those kids can be an hour away, doesn't matter.  If they want to attend the charter school, they can't be denied, and so the charter has to pay transportation.</p>
<p>Aside from the distance issue, public schools have the same &quot;freedom&quot; with transportation.  I live near a few small districts that do not provide bussing.  </p>
<p>Edit: sorry for the typos.  Hungover in bed and typing upside down.</p></div>		</li>
