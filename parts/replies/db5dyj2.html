			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to highlight as much as possible the projects. If you've done projects in school, in your own time, or during internships (that you can talk about), put that shit on your resume. It <em>will</em> be a tiebreaker over another candidate with a higher GPA but no projects.</p>
<p>I'm interviewing three fresh grads tomorrow morning. All had projects that showed the types of skills I'm looking for. All will be asked about them in depth in their interviews. None of them were in the top 10% of GPAs I got on my desk from HR. I will also say, however, that none were in the bottom 50% of GPAs either. Those don't tend to correlate with strong other experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well-written. The only point I take issue with is your first school point. &quot;Grades are based on doing the things assigned quickly and well.&quot; </p>
<p>In all my years of education, I never came across a single assignment in which being done quickly was advantageous. Homework could usually be done in an hour or two at most. Big projects were given with a week or more to work on them. In college at least, people who finish the test within 30 mins got to leave early, but those who took longer than the 2-hour class were usually given extra time. Being 100% accurate was more important than how long it took to accomplish the task. </p>
<p>I'm one of the people who usually finishes tests first. this has been really helpful in the workplace. I'm awarded based on the volume of work I get done, and none of it is really hard enough that accuracy matters. Getting a project done in 4 hours, then having to spend 30 mins fixing a mistake is preferable to spending 8 hours on it and getting it right the first time. At least that's the attitude of the company I work for.</p>
<p>In school you are given an exorbitant amount of time to get things done as accurately as possible in one try. In the workplace, you are rewarded for getting things done quickly, accuracy only matters if it affects the bottom line.</p>
<p>ELI5 TL;DR In school, they grade you on building one toy as well as possible. In work they grade on volume of toys completed.100 toys per day with 90% of them working is better than 50 toys per day with 100% of them working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Perfection is the enemy of good enough.&quot;</p>
<p>I have to say this to one of the guys on my team all the time, because he gets so deep into the weeds on an issue that he could have solved it an hour before, but that solution wasn't definitely going to work and he'd rather keep digging to be sure than try it, fail, and make tweaks to fix it.</p>
<p>Which is why he's been there three months less than I have (and in this sector of the IT field seven years longer than I have, similar career lengths for IT in general) and he's still editing documentation while I'm leading projects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. It drives me nuts when I lecture because other profs are so detailed oriented they cant get anything accomplished. They then pass this on to students who then have to unlearn it in the workplace. Quality matters only to a point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this has to do with the kind of education? At my school I usually got 3-4 hours of homework from each 2-hour class with strict deadlines. If we were 5 minutes late turning something in, it was a flat 0. No make up, no partial credit for getting it in tomorrow. It was better to show up with a mostly-done project for an F than to be late with A quality work.</p>
<p>Design projects also tend to take longer: an illustration is roughly an 8-16 hour project depending on complexity, and I had deadlines as short as two days for some classes.</p>
<p>In that context, working quickly was necessary in order to get good grades while still meeting deadlines.</p></div>		</li>

<li>most of each grade is determined by a test that mostly grades ability to memorize and repeat knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I don't even look at GPA if you put it on your resume.  I've known too many people who had zero common sense or analytical ability who were able to get good grades just by regurgitating answers straight from a text book.  </p></div>		</li>
