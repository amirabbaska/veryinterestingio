			<div class="markdown"><p>The wave on that planet in Interstellar was caused by the gravitational pull of the nearby super massive black hole. Thatâ€™s the energy source that keeps the wave moving. Basically what the moon does with the tides but crazy strong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes more sense actually. Totally forgot about the effects of the moon on our waves. But if that was the case, I would imagine that planet would be tidally locked. I doubt it would be able to rotate on its axis with gravity being that insane</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moon doesn't effect waves, only the tide. Hence why the tide still goes in and out no matter if the swell in the water is 2ft or 20ft</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i think a planet in that position would very quickly become tidally locked, but i'm not sure it could then have travelling tidal waves - i imagine that the locations of high/low tides on the planet would become fixed. possibly it becomes a fluid dynamics question, comparing the viscosity of the water to the rotational velocity of the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah. The thing about the wave in interstellar was that it was really just an extremely concentrated tide rather than a traditional wave. That gigantic swell was actually more or less still, being pulled straight upwards in the direction of the black hole, but had the appearance of moving because the planet rotated underneath it. The rest of the planet had shallow tide because all of the water was being pulled towards that one spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a common misconception that the tide is caused by the upward force closest to the moon. That is wrong, that force is increadible weak, and if the water could be affected by it, then the ground would also be pulled up in a tide.</p>
<p>It is actually the forces parallell to the ground (on the &quot;side&quot; of the earth) which can exert work over a great distance. This also explains why the seas have tides, but not lakes, lakes aren't large enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to say what the effect of that would be near such a steep gravitational gradient as we see in the film though. But it does seem a bit unlikely; why is the water getting yanked up like that but the planet not getting ripped apart?</p>
<p>Cool effect though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the ground is pulled up by the gravity of the moon.  It moves large structures, like the Empire State Building, up and down daily.  It also causes natural surface features to move over the centuries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the extreme gravity had the &quot;illusion&quot; of making a tsunami, but was actually just an extreme high tide?</p></div>		</li>
