<p>Also, it is generally bad for you to ask about mathematics in reddit. Other comments are all misleading. It is better for you to dig up by yourself.</p>

<p>This sub is meant to be for getting expert responses from experts. You should feel confident that answers you get from panelists with flair in an appropriate field are correct. Please don't discourage redditors from asking questions here because of some perceived notion that the answers are generally wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you hit the nail on the head! my professor of applied math told me &quot;physicists do as they please and leave us mathematicians to prove it.&quot; it is extremely common that physicists use &quot;math&quot; that is in no way justified besides making intuitive sense or giving the problem a nice solution.  another example to add to the delta function, etc that is often seen is when evaluating integrals or derivatives of power series, physicists just switch the order of integration (or differentiation) and summation as if it were a finite sum with no regards for whether or not the series converges uniformly. </p></div>		</li>
