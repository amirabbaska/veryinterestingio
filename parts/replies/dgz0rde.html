			<div class="markdown"><p>it explains why op's expectations (reflected in the way his question was asked) are wrong. </p>
<p>i, for one, found the answer very reasonable, if fundamental. </p>
<p>others went into genes and biochemistry, which in turn isn't of much interest to me -- after all, i could say that everything can be broken down to genes and biochemistry without explaining the &quot;real why&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, OP was simply asked how other animals did not experience muscle degradation as humans do.</p>
<p>&quot;Because they evolved not to&quot; does not answer the question.</p>
<p>In fact, its a terribly wrong answer. Every advantageous trait is not developed due to evolution and disadvantageous traits can and do exist despite evolutionary pressures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Op's expectations are neither wrong nor does this explain anything. How can fish live in the ocean without drowning? Because they evolved differently. Oh gee yea real helpful. All of the other answers were real answers. Everything about  biology is due to evolution over time so that is as general and pointless as an answer as it gets. The real why? OP did not ask why, and if you are looking for a why behind evolution that sounds like you think there is some kind of intelligent design, otherwise it is a very simple why.. because they survived. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's true but it is important to understand that just having more musclemass isn't all pros and zero cons.  that there is a biological advantage to losing muscle.  and OP's question is worded and framed as if that hasn't occurred to them, OP didn't ask &quot;what are the mechanisms that cause one organism to lose muscle mass when sedentary and one organism to retain it despite being sedentary?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every trait that exists is not due to natural selection.</p>
<p>Traits which are useless or even disadvantageous can evolve as natural byproducts of other traits. For example, say deer benefit from increased levels of a hormone that helps them with run faster , but the increased level of hormones also causes a great increase in size of their horn. Does this mean their larger horns evolved because natural selection created a pressure for bigger horns? No.</p>
<p>Or they can just be byproducts of biological functions that did not cause enough of a negative pressure to cause the species to go extinct.</p>
<p>For example, disease. Animals don't get diseases because it's evolutionary advantageous. They do simply because of natural causes of how biology works. </p></div>		</li>
