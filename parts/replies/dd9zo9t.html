			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflation still remains the most well motivated idea, based on well-established fundamental physics concepts, for explaining the properties of the Universe on its largest scales.  It has done more than post-dict--the gaussian nature and spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, for example, was predicted well before it was observed.  It is true however, that inflation is more an idea than a model at the present time, and it is quite malleable, so that had the observations been different, various inflationary models might have been compatible with them as well.  Super-horizon sized correlations are hard to explain with anything else however.  The real test of inflation, in my opinion, will come from possible observations of gravitational waves from inflation, observed via polarization effects in the cosmic microwave background.  These are a ubiquitous prediction of inflation, and if these can be measured it will not only put inflation on a much firmer footing, it will allow us to test ideas about the nature of fundamental physics at a time when the universe was a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second old!  And it may even shed light on the possible existence of other universes!</p>
<p>Thanks for your kind words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me share since I've put quite a few hours into a paper of mine that was about this. I recommend you start with (what I consider the best overall-type paper on inflation) Paul J. Steinhardt's article in the Scientific American magazine (April 2011) titled <em>The Inflation Debate</em> though you might have to pay for it. Then you could have a look at John Horgan's cross-check with Steinhardt <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/physicist-slams-cosmic-theory-he-helped-conceive/" target="_blank">linked here</a>. </p>
<p>For a more scientific flavour, you could try &quot;Inflationary schism after Planck2013&quot; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6980v1" target="_blank">linked here</a> which is a follow-up/sequel paper of sorts to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2785" target="_blank">this</a>. You could also check out &quot;<em>Cosmology at the Crossroads</em>&quot; by Steinhardt as well but it is a bit dated, though. I would also feel remiss if I didn't mention perhaps the most famous <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.48.1220" target="_blank">paper</a> on cosmological inflation.</p>
<p>I refer mostly Steinhardt stuff because I believe that 1) he is central to cosmological inflation and is <strong>the</strong> place to start and 2) he is a physicist that first helped birth inflation itself and then later went on to heavily doubt it, a unique progression. From there on you're really free to fly wherever. A few other notable scientists to look up, imo, are Alan Guth, Andrei Linde, Frank Wilczek, Neil Turok, Anna Ijjas, Roger Penrose, John Earman, etc. Sorry for the lengthy reply.</p></div>		</li>
