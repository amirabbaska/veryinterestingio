			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the oval windows. They are 3 paned with gas between the layers. The outside layer can stop rounds from an anti-material rifle and the inside layer can stop heavy handgun fire at close range (to prevent SS from accidentally damaging the outer pane. </p>
<p>Each POTUS even gets a bespoke chair made for them for bullet resistance. </p>
<p>The oval is a negative pressure room, so you can overpressure it slightly to prevent air from getting in from the outside. </p>
<p>US Secret Service has blue and red exercises where senior SS agents join with intelligence and military personnel to ask &quot;If I wanted to, how would we do it&quot; and then the model them out, test them, and fix deficiencies. They do this regularly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>anti-material rifle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had to look this up, because it sounds like Sci-Fi jargon.  </p>
<p>To save everyone else the trouble, it's the opposite of an anti-personnel rifle.  Instead of being designed to work well against flesh, it works well against &quot;material&quot; (steel, glass, armor, etc.)  </p>
<p>edit:  Guys, I get it. Any type of gun kills people pretty well.  </p>
<p>edit 2: Materiel not material.  Materiel is military hardware, like vehicles made of steel, glass and armor...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is that it's &quot;materiel&quot; not &quot;material&quot;. Materiel refers to military hardware. I just clarify so it doesn't sound &quot;sci-fi&quot;ish. Also it's no the opposite of an anti-personnel rifle, since it works on people too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>so... they can just run ANY video through the program and it will get the audio at the time of filming??</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as the injected randomness covers the entire domain of variation in the signal, the signal will be destroyed for anyone who does not have a copy of the masking signal.</p>
<p>Not only this, but the system masking the signal can also use destructive interference using noise cancellation technology, alongside passive sound-proofing measures and random overlays. And if they are doing active noise cancellation, they already know the domain of the thing they need to mask</p>
<p>Not to mention that I'm pretty sure there are detectors for most laser frequencies all around the Whitehouse, and a few guys all around the area ready to canvas for the owner of said laser.</p>
<p>Long story short, it is entirely possible to render anything coming out of a space void of any information in that space, even to someone with the most powerful computer imaginable.</p></div>		</li>
