			<div class="markdown"><p>I was hoping someone would mention VADs! A VAD or Ventricular Assist Device can be inserted if the patients heart is failing and we put in both bridging (aka supportive while waiting for transplant) and destination VADs (permanent to support life until deterioration and death). People manage to live with destination VADs for very long periods of time, sometimes years, and they are portable, the old ones had a wheely bag to transport and the new ones are in a little pack you can carry by hand! There are multiple risks associated with VADs, especially clots due to the device, haemorrhage from anticoagulant meds to prevent clots and infection directly to the heart. However, they are effective as a last resort to support a failing heart and keep people alive. </p>
<p>It comes down to the fact that the heart, although a complex organ, essentially boils down to a pump. The function of the lungs however is much more complex then simply removing CO2 and replacing 02, and so artificially replacing them is more difficult. </p></div>		</li>
