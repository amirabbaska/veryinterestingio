<p>Gizzards are gnarly and super muscular, and they help basically grind up a bird's food.</p>

<p>Just a small note that this is generally done with the help of swallowed rocks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, don't birds digest food relatively quickly compared to other animals? As a sort of evolutionary advantage, where if they had to digest food over a long period of time, they'd be heavier and that would inhibit their ability to fly, so they digest the food quickly and push it out of their body without having digested it fully?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not super well versed in the specifics of bird digestion, but as far as I know, this really depends on the type of bird. Obviously, birds that don't fly are going to have fairly different metabolisms than birds that are almost constantly in flight. Most birds actually don't fly all that often, especially birds of prey. Golden eagles perch for something like 80% of the day. Lazy birds. So they'll gorge on food and then just kinda sit around and digest the rest of the time. I think parrots are pretty similar too. I'm not as familiar with seabird biology, but I imagine they're quite different. I don't think birds just push out semi digested food though, but I have seen whole kernels of corn in emu poop before. :P</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know, herons and squirrels do not normally share habitat, but this time they did, according to the informant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Herons and cranes are some of the most nasty, vicious birds out there. My dad saw a GBH stab an egret to death for a fish once. And I've had some very bad times with crowned cranes; they fucking suck. But I could picture that happening, although it sounds like a pretty rare sighting. I'd flip out if I witnessed something like that. Apparently they've been known to choke to death after eating stuff that was too large. Big dumb birds. </p></div>		</li>
