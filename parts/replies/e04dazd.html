			<div class="markdown"><p>Well technically with steel wool, it’s not burning the flame just acts as a catalyst which causes the steel wool to oxidize rapidly, well in typing this out I’ve realized that my statement although true sounds retarded. Technically nothing burns, it just oxidizes. But we call the rapid oxidization of a material burning. When iron rusts it actually gives off heat also. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In chemistry the line between redox (oxidation and reduction) reactions and combustion reactions is a blurry one. But generally speaking when we call something a combustion reaction it undergoes many different possible reactions with lots of different intermediates and products. Fire is messy while redox is neat and more easily understood. </p>
<p>For example burning wood gives you carbon dioxide and water most of the time, but if the fire isn’t hot enough or there’s not enough oxygen around it’ll make carbon monoxide instead. Then all the sulfur and phosphorous and other trace elements can burn as well, and I won’t try to list all the possible things that can happen to those, but suffice to say there’s a lot. </p></div>		</li>
