			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be some ways to use it but I doubt they would be enough to fully offset the salt production and would make the whole process too expensive. We could sell it. There are already huge salt mining operations around the world. We could sell the salt form desalination if it is pure enough. We could also fill old mines and quarries with the salt. Quarries would be difficult due to salt blowing out, but we could just add some water to create a slurry that would dry and form crystals similar to the salt flats we already have. This would also be similar to how the oil sands in Canada handles their tailings. They fill their old mines with a slurry of the tailings and water and let the tailings settle out. </p></div>		</li>
