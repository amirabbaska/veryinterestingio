<p>And as an added bonus if the learned conditions change, it'll completely throw us off our game. Say the gravity would change, good luck with your learned coordination.</p>
<p>Then again on paper you'd just update the new gravity values and the math would work out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's even cooler is that it can be body part specific, IIRC. </p>
<p>Ex. If you wore those glasses BUT only threw a ball at a target with one hand until you could hit a target, when taking the glasses off, your other hand would be unaffected by the newly learned coordination of the original hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun example - pit top male baseball players against a top female softball pitcher, <a href="http://www.si.com/more-sports/2013/07/24/sports-gene-excerpt" target="_blank">and she'll easily strike them all out</a>.</p>
<p>Not because of the female softball pitcher is better, because at the professional level pitchers are actually throwing the ball faster than humans can process visual information and react - the batter has to have started their swing before the pitcher has fully released the ball. </p>
<p>IE, watching how the pitcher is pitching is a key part of reacting fast enough, which is likely why you see pitchers do these bizarre little dances when throwing that do nothing to help the throw - they confuse the batter.</p>
<p>However, the way a woman pitches an underhand softball is just so different from how a man throws overhand is just too different to intuit without practise; the larger size of the softball and small reduction of speed (still faster than human reaction time) just adds to the confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to note, something that's mentioned in the article sort of in passing is that softball diamonds are smaller, so she's throwing from quite a bit closer. There's a significant reduction in speed of the ball (she throws significantly slower than a MLB pitcher's changeup), but because she's a lot closer, the reaction time is basically the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so that's why it worked in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107985/" target="_blank">Rookie of the Year</a>? I always thought it was weird how professional baseball players couldn't hit the underhand throw/pitch at the end.</p>
<p>Still, I feel like there would be rules against throwing underhand in baseball resulting in the kid getting fouled (wrong term? thrown off?)  the pitchers mound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh that's not correct . The distance between the pitcher and the player is approximatly 20 m . Assuming worst case scenario , a 105mph ball , that's 46m/s , which translate to 0.5 seconds of travel time , wich is much longer than the median reaction time (286ms) , so you can definitly see the ball . </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder how much of that is <em>calculation</em> and how much is replaying a slightly modified record of a previous throw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say it's probably a lot of replaying as any professional has probably thrown a pass to every part of a football field at some point in his life. I heard Aaron Rodgers in an interview recently talking about specific plays in the NFL and as they were playing out he would be reminded of a play just like it in high school or college and how it felt to let the ball out in that situation and try to do it again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's seems like a taxing and inefficient way to play. By now it should just be muscle memory for him, right? I feel like his way would add unnecessary time to figure out the force needed to throw the ball where he wants it to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For something like throwing a football to another player? I'd imagine it's a lot of repetition, and a little bit of calculation.</p>
<p>I'd say there are other things to use as an example for this question besides throwing a football. That's a pretty easy calculation for the brain, and probably not too hard on paper either. Sports have better examples of split-second thinking that would be difficult to translate to mathematics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of my physics teachers in high school would always say that truck drivers are some of the most knowledgeable people when it came to putting physics into practice, even if they didn't know anything about the theoretical part: every day they'd instinctively solve problems involving angular and linear momentum, friction, torque, braking distance, etc in order to properly drive their trucks along the road while dealing with high speed curves, rain/snow/ice, other (irresponsible) drivers, holes in the asphalt, situations that require suddenly braking or swerving to the side (like with a broken down car or a fallen tree branch on their lane) and so on. But ask them the formulas for calculating acceleration and most of them will just stare at you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of people are missing something about all of this as well.</p>
<p>If your job was to calculate how much energy a ball require to throw at someone, at a certain distance and angle, and you did it a few hundred times a few times a week, you would likely have a quick mental access to rough estimates of the required energy.</p>
<p>It's the same problem solved two different ways. Both to be able to be solved quickly, require tireless reputation.</p>
<p>Quarterbacks don't know the perfect formula for what they need to do. Just a very close estimate. So to compare it to someone who has to make perfect calculations isn't really a fair argument. </p></div>		</li>
