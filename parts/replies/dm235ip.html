			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides what the other guys said, you have to keep in mind those shifting plates are not at the surface, but a lot deeper, under countless tons of earth and rock.</p>
<p>So the 'softer' upper levels will be somewhat stabilized, and only sluggishly moving. In this case, the small fault line in the street was just the path of least resistence of the shift to affect the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know how much of this is caused by tectonic movement, and how much is caused by other factors? In California, it's pretty obvious what the cause is, but I've seen similar things in other places where land erosion, heat expansion, or simple bad construction would be more likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Shufflebuzz has linked additional images above.</p>
<p>The curb movement is clearly a result of continual shear forces.  Erosion can produce similar changes, but the photos show this area is generally flat.  Heat expansion would not exert a shear force like this, as expansion and contraction generally will produce compression and tension forces, respectively.  It also, by definition, will oscillate with temperature; it wouldn't result in continued movement in one direction over multiple decades.  Bad construction would similarly not result in this sort of persistent movement, at least not laterally.  It <em>could</em> result in vertical movement due to incomplete soil compaction.  You may have seen similar instances of this, but I'll risk assuming you haven't been returning to those locations over the course of decades to measure its movement.</p>
<p>Again, the key here is the continual lateral movement; while all the factors you mentioned may produce similar snapshots like you have observed, only erosion could mimic the continual lateral movement we see here.  And, as mentioned, the terrain here is relatively flat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are two long-term phenomena that cause it to shrink slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shrinkage occurs as the concrete dries out. Most people think of concrete hardening as &quot;concrete drying,&quot; but actually the opposite is occurring and the scientific term is that the concrete is hydrating: the concrete is actually absorbing water, and the resulting molecule is kind of like an H2O sandwich (you actually get the strongest possible concrete by keeping it wet as it hardens, a process known as curing). So hard concrete looks like a rock, but it's actually a very wet molecule; as it dries out, some of those water molecules kind of act like a sandwich where you remove the meat and kind of collapse. That phenomenon begins to occur quite rapidly, and if you look at anything made of solid concrete that's more than about 30' long you might see hairline cracks spread evenly throughout the concrete. That because the concrete is trying to shrink but can't, so it cracks a little bit. You can deal with this with saw cut lines (think of sidewalk tiles... Sidewalks are actually poured as one giant piece, but the grooves give the concrete a place to crack that won't be ugly).</p>
</li>
<li>Creep is mostly a long-term phenomenon and is the result of deformation under sustained load. So if you pour a column that's say 10' tall, as soon as you build something on top of that column it compresses a bit (like a spring, and if you remove the load it will &quot;grow&quot; back up). But if you leave that load there for 5 years, the column will continue to squish down a little bit. That long-term deformation can be more than the instantaneous one, and is permanent (if you build a 10' tall column in a house and come back in 50 years and demolish everything but the column, it will be a little bit shorter than 10' tall). This is proportional to the stress in the concrete, which leads to a few interesting things to consider in analysis: if you have a lightly loaded column near a heavily loaded one in a 50-storey building, for instance, you need to analyse how the difference in creep from one column to the next will affect the building long-term. You can get a difference of something like 1-2 inches between the elevator core and the nearest columns and need to address that in one way or another in design.     </li>
