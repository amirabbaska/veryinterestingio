<p>The Mongols are avid drinkers of milk.  Also, recent research is finding that many folks that think that they're lactose intolerant, in fact, are not.  Most dairy cows (especially in North America - Holstein cows) have a gene mutation that changes their casein protein (the variant being called A1); other cows still have the non-mutated form (the variant being called A2).  Humans, sheep, goats, and most breeds of cows still have the A2 variant of the casein protein and most folks do fine with this when the A1 variety of milk is removed from their diets.  This A1 variant has been linked to many issues including contributing to autism and cancers, not to mention symptoms similar to lactose intolerance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't make lactose intolerance the &quot;natural state&quot; or lactose tolerance unnatural. It just means more people are lactose intolerant than aren't. </p>
<p>Also, isn't something like 60% of the world's population Asian? Which could tally with your figures, although there are also Asian cultures which do drink milk.</p></div>		</li>

<p>E: guys, only like 8% of the world population has blue eyes, and almost no animals do. It's called genetic variability and it's the norm. </p></div>		</li>
