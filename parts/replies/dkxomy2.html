<p>The star continues producing iron for thousands of years at minimum before the supernova occurs, during which time the nuclear S Process is observed to occur.  This is the slow process of thermal neutrons being captured by the heavier elements in the star (including iron), prompting a slow migration up the mass curve, with one gamma ray being released for every three to four neutrons being added by this mechanism.</p>
<p>So through the S Process, it is hypothetically possible for trans-Uranium elements to be produced in star, but it's not too likely, and only a few atoms per star.  At the moment of supernova, there are trans-iron elements which may be fused in the instant of supernova to form trans-Uranium elements.  It's not too likely, but it's possible.  The mechanism is in place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The mass of Iron is irrelevant to the triggering of a supernova: The &quot;critical mass&quot; isn't a mass of iron at all, rather the point at which there is no more exothermic silicon fusion in the core; It's a <em>critical balance</em> of outward flux vs inward gravitational pressure. The sudden and dramatic energy loss during endothermic iron fusion is what leads to the collapse of the core. Incidentally, silicon fusion burns for about one day for a &gt;25 Msolar star, that's pretty fast in terms of stellar lifetime - I'm not sure where your figure of &quot;1000 year minimum&quot; comes from.</p>
<p>Fair point about slow neutron capture creating heavy elements, although the neutron capture cross section is pretty small and the (relative) number of thermal neutrons low, plus the half-life of heavier than Uranium elements is extremely short so the combined interaction probability has got to be astonishingly small - I'm not sure the odds are in your favour, but you're right - there is a theoretical mechanism in place, I just doubt it beats supernova synthesis. The S-process is certainly responsible for other stellar nucleosynthesis elements lighter than uranium.</p></div>		</li>
