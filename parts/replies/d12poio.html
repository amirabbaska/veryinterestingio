			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote in to the Discovery Channel and asked them this question, it was always like a creepy blue glow you could see in people's living rooms at night.  They aired the question, but I was hammered when I watched it, but I remember it just has to do with the rods and cones in your eyes.  One is sensitive to color, and other to just light in general, and at night that's the one you use more.  Why it always looked blue is the part I really wanted to know, and the part I missed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think that's down to the relative colour temperature of the TV. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature#Categorizing_different_lighting" target="_blank">CRT/LCDs tend to have a high colour temperature</a> (making the light &quot;bluer&quot;) but at night we're usually surrounded by artificial light with a lower colour temperature (&quot;yellower&quot;) which makes the blue tinge even more noticeable. Somewhat confusingly we perceive higher colour temperatures as cooler and lower temperatures as warmer (&quot;warm white&quot; bulbs have a lower colour temperature than pure white bulbs!)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, fire is generally percieved as being hotter than the sun (yes, the sun is actually hotter, but it's so far away that it feels less hot to us), so that may have a lot to do with it.</p></div>		</li>
