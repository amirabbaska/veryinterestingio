			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolutionary purpose theory: If two people can laugh together and share the same humour it builds a bond and certain closeness. As humans are very social creatures that cooperate in order to be successful, I believe humour is a social linguistic tool that we have developed that helps us form relationships and empathy that leads to the survival of our species. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea of a coping mechanism is <em>itself</em> weird. This is a thinking thing that damages itself with input and then, instead of just <em>healing</em> it, it comes up with things to distract itself from the damage? </p>
<p>Pretty wild. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a pet theory that as brains became more complex they had to evolve ways to stop their newly acquired insights from sending the host insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A coping mechanism is not a distraction. A coping mechanism is an emotional method for alleviating damage while an actual solution is a logical method for alleviating damage. Either way, it is not so much a fix for damage as it is a measure for preventing psychological distress.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hard to explain to ELI5 when nobody has a solid idea for why a joke might be hilarious to someone but only mildly amusing or dumb to their best friend. </p></div>		</li>
