<p>Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't Barr body selection random at an early stage of development?</p>
<p>IIRC from AP Bio a decade and a half ago, x inactivation is a random process of females after a certain stage of development. This accounts for why we see female calico cats, but not male calicos. The tricolor formation is really just two different two color formations.</p></div>		</li>
