			<div class="markdown"><p>It does not regularly get to 40 in new Zealand. I haven't even heard of it getting that hot here and I've lived here most my life. 30 degrees and up everyone will be commenting to each other about how ridiculously hot it is. The temp is normally under 30 in the summer and it will just be quite humid which makes it feel hotter than it is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>104F is pretty damn high. Even the US South doesn't usually get that hot (as measured by the weather folks; it occasionally gets that hot at sidewalk/street level due to city heat island effects). That's mostly a southwestern desert temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Son of a former pool builder and former pool cleaner/maintenence myself.  Always had at least five 10 lb boxes of sodium bi (baking soda) in the back of my truck. Great &quot;secret&quot; tool when the pH was running low.  Lots of customers always thought a brand name alkaline off the shelf of a pool supply store was needed, and were always surprised (and happy!) that they could just use the <em>much</em> cheaper and more readily available baking soda.  Thnx for the nostalgia kick :).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both can form buffer solutions, just at different pHs (carbonate-bicarbonate is around pH 10, bicarbonate-acid is around pH 7.5). Also, you can form a bicarbonate-acid buffer solution adding only carbonate, due to chemical equilibrium, depending on the acidity and the amount of carbonate added.</p></div>		</li>

Part jets not working and part electrical is going to require a professional.  </p></div>		</li>
