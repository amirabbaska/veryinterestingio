			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you familiar with Tor/darkweb drug markets? Bitcoin? They are a great example of the war on drugs continued failure. The Silk Road was the first - basically eBay but for drugs. It's popularity as a new way to achieve getting what you wanted soared in a way similar to Napster - MASSIVELY Authorities shut it down, gave its creator Ross Ulbrict life in prison with no possibility of parole. To make an example of him in the hope of deterring others. Within a week of it being shutdown there were several more market places created. Like Napster, the flood gates were opened - and law enforcement taking a site down means 10 more spring up in its place. Because there is just simply too much money to be made to let deterrents like life in prison stop people. The most popular market place right now is Alphabay. Far surpassing the Silk Road. It is 100x more popular (in terms of # of users) and powerful (in terms of the money being made) - than the Silk Road ever was. the site facilitates millions of dollars in bitcoin transaction every week. And in fact, it's almost every day. Millions... Almost. Daily. That, is why the war on drugs is a failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago I watched this documentary where a retired cop said in an interview that he worked in a maximum security prison where everything was extremely controlled - and yet, they kept finding shit loads of drugs from inmates. He asked that if we can't even stop the drug traffic into a maximum security prison, how could we stop it in a free society?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can not. We can. As a society we can decide to bring drug use and manufacturing from the black market in mass, by legalizing and regulating it's consumption. </p>
<p>There are many reasons the War on Drugs is a failure, but one of my favorites to point out was the entire reason for even creating the war on drugs had absolutely nothing to do with public safety, and everything to do racists in power that were looking for an excuse to lock up minorities and hippies of the 60s. They never considered the drugs themselves to be a threat to society. That was a useful excuse to perpetuate a true crime on society, which has turned into big business of mass incarceration. </p>
<p>People make money, a lot of it and they are trying to keep it that way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's especially crazy to me is that a former Nixon aide <em>admitted</em> that the War on Drugs was begun for this reason and Republicans are <em>still</em> claiming they need to ramp up said &quot;War.&quot; Maybe put some more effort into rehabilitation and fixing the insane opioid problem instead of just sending more jackbooted thugs into people's homes, assholes...</p></div>		</li>
