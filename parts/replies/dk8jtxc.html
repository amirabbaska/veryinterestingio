			<div class="markdown"><p>Its true. I stopped using the stuff four years ago and still want to every now and then. Because it feels really good. But I won't lose any sleep over not having it.</p>
<p>The experience is vastly different from when I had to stop using narcotic pain medicine after my years of medical treatment ended. I felt liek I would never be happy or comfortable again, and barely was able to resist harming myeslf in an attempt to get more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was very interested in trying weed once I got to college, since i had of course heard so many people rave about it. It was one of the more unpleasant experiences of my life, which is a shame! </p>
<p>I'm curious as to what makes the difference from person to person when it comes to weed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the weed and your circumstances. Some weed makes you more inclined to get hyper (read: paranoid), and if you're even a little anxious about getting high chances are the weed will amplify that. It became much more fun for me when I entered college since I knew there wasn't a chance cops would come bust the smoke spot which made me nervous before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer.<br />
I want to point out that anything can become a psychological dependancy.<br />
Foods, activities, even emotions. </p></div>		</li>
