			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember manipulating programs on my PC with an application memory watcher. I knew some value I wanted to find in memory and would suspend the process then search for it. I'd come up with a long list of suspects, then I'd continue the process and change the value then look for the new value in the list of saved memory locations. I'd continue this a few times until only one memory location matched the searches, change this, and I'd be all set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a simple example.</p>
<p>Back in 1989, there was a game called Welltris, a sequel to Tetris.  This game was at the time considered very hard to crack relative to the competition.  It wasn't until ~1991 that someone finally broke the protection.</p>
<p>When it finally was, it was as simple as <a href="http://www.gamers.org/pub/games/uwp-uml/romulus/cracks/welltris2.txt" target="_blank">this</a>;  it was nothing more than 3 bytes changed in an executable, which anyone could do with a simple hex editor.  They would search for each full string and change just the single byte needed to effect the change.</p>
<p>The reason cracks were provided in this manner back then was because many people looking for the crack did not or could not actually download the game, rather copying a physical floppy fisk from a friend then searching out how to bypass the copy protection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, before that they'd print out sheets with codes on them that they'd distribute with the games. The sheets had very poor contrast (thus were theoretically difficult to photocopy) and they'd ask you for a random code on the sheet and you'd have to type it in. I bypassed that by having a dad who worked in an office with a decent photocopier :)</p></div>		</li>
