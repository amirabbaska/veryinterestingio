			<div class="markdown"><p>Iron filings act as little magnets themselves, so they tend to repel each other. This effect isn't as strong as that of the main magnet. In this way, the filings line up with the field and separate from each other to create the lines. Gravity, on the other hand, clearly does not produce this effect.</p>
<p>Although, as /u/Pajamawolf noted, magnetic field lines are a visualization of the field, and the actual shape of the field is smooth. You could easily draw gravitational field lines, and they would look like the field lines of a negative point charge.</p>
<p>The way electric field lines are drawn is by figuring out what would happen to a tiny positive charge when placed into the field. This is why negative charges have field lines pointing in and positive charges have field lines pointing out. Magnets work similarly. A magnet is a dipole, meaning it has one of each &quot;charge&quot;. The field lines go out from the &quot;positive&quot; end and into the &quot;negative&quot; end. (Note that north and south are not positive and negative, but are analogous.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can easily see gravitational field lines in the same sense that you can see magnetic field lines!</p>
<p>Simple hold a rock on a piece of string and it will point straight down.  That's the gravitational field line!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment is Confusing magnetic and Electric fields!
B-is created by and affects <em>moving</em> charges (currents), whereas Electric fields are created by and affects charges. A positive point charge would trace the field lines of an electric field. The motion of moving charges in B-fields is given by</p>
<p>F = q<strong>v</strong> x <strong>B</strong> </p>
<p>^(^note ^the ^x ^is ^the ^mathematical ^vector ^multiplication ^and ^not ^a ^physical ^quantity ^of ^some ^sort)</p>
<p>meaning that a point charge with velocity <strong>v</strong> in a constant magnetic field would move in a circular path.</p>
<p>I know I am reiterating, but saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A magnet is a dipole, meaning it has one of each charge. The field lines go out from the &quot;positive&quot; end and into the &quot;negative&quot; end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is misleading. One of the four maxwell equations</p>
<p>div(<strong>B</strong>) = 0</p>
<p>states that in an enclosed volume, the generation of magnetic field inside is always zero. Thus no magnetic charges can exist as electrical charges do. Magnetic fields are always at the very least dipoles, like you said, but it is not created by a positive and negative &quot;charge&quot;. An ideal magnetic dipole is created by an infinitely small circular loop with a constant current running through it. The generated magnetic field will then look like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_dipole_magnetic3.svg" target="_blank">this</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>field lines are basically vectors. which is a simple arrow that points to a direction where a moving body will move. whether it exists or not is more of a philosophical matter and will ultimately depend on your definition of 'existence'. but in the context of physics, the only thing for sure is that field lines is neither a mass, nor time, nor space, nor energy but a function of these components. its more of a one dimensional graph of position(space) over time(as is)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, magnetic field lines are not real in the sense I think you probably mean. It's not like there is a physical thing where the line is.</p>
<p>Magnetic field lines are a visual analogy, and there are exactly two things you should take from that analogy:</p>
<ol>
<li>At each point on a line, the direction of the magnetic field points along the line, and at points between two lines, you can estimate the direction of the magnetic field by interpolating between nearby lines. (This is why the iron filings do that thing.)</li>
<li>When the magnetic field lines are closer together, the field is stronger; when they are farther apart, the field is weaker.</li>
