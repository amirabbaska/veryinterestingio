			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that's true. Do you know of any non-Asian nationalities other than Portuguese that end in &quot;ese,&quot; though? There's Lebanese—but I believe many people would still define Arabs as Asian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, many people categorize Arabs as Asian (if you're going strictly by continent).</p>
<p>But also many people categorize Arabs as non Asian. For example, in the U.S., Arabs are considered White, not Asian according to the official Census. <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html" target="_blank">https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html</a></p>
<p>I think the reason is that Arabs fall under definition of Caucasian. So they got lumped under the Census' White category. (Caucasian race technically is not the same as White, although nowadays Caucasian is used as a substitute equivalent word for White. It's complicated.) Anyways, the U.S. Census will be adding a separate category for MENA: Middle East North Africa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's because the terms &quot;caucasoid&quot;, &quot;mongoloid&quot;, and &quot;negroid&quot; aren't based on the color of your skin tone, but they have more to do with facial features. Arabs may have darker skin tone, but they're considered caucasians due to how their facial features are more Caucasian than East/southeast Asians. This is just a speculation though. I don't really know shit, just a few things I read off of wiki. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of Arabs who look whiter than I do (southern Italian background) the only reason people don't consider those Arabs (also Turks) to be white is the Muslim background which is stupid IMO</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This map is really cool!
A couple of follow up questions if you have any idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we distinguish between an -ian and just a -an ending that happens to follow the letter i? Eg why does the map list it as Boliv-IAN and not Bolivi-AN? Compare this to Argentin-IAN where we actually add the i to form the demonym?</li>
<li>
<p>Same for the -ean ending. Eg Kor-EAN vs Kore-AN?  In fact all countries listed here as being -ean could be classified as such because none of them actually adds/changes the letter e. Is there any difference?</p>
</li>
<li>Looking at New Zealand, do you know why it's shaded as either -er or -ic. Iceland is similarly double shaded but Icelander and Icelandic are both correct whereas nobody has ever called me 'New Zealandic'. Only thing I could think of is that -ic is the adjective form of the -er noun? Eg he is an Icelander, he is Icelandic. She is a New Zealander, she is...New Zealandic? But then why is Spain not shaded as -ish and -iard? SO MANY QUESTIONS!! haha</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The map creator seems to have been a little overzealous with the yellow. All the -stan countries have -stani as a possibility, but an alternate form without the -stan tends to be more common: Kazakh(stani), Afghan(istani), Turkmen(istani), etc. They should be grey/yellow splits.</p>
<p>Also, is it really necessary to have three different blue colors for spelling variants of the same suffix?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of those are fairly recent.</p>
<p>&quot;Malaysian&quot; and was coined from the country name after WWII. The ethnicity is Malay (from &quot;Melayu&quot;, in their own language). Same with &quot;Singaporean&quot;, it's not from an older ethnicity name, but a city name (a British colony). </p>
<p>&quot;Thai&quot; is also recent, and also from their native language. Used to be &quot;Siamese&quot; before the 1940s.</p>
<p>&quot;Indonesian&quot; is new as well, with the country being formed after WWII. The older ethnicity names (e.g. Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, Madurese) mostly follow the &quot;ese&quot; pattern.</p>
<p>&quot;Korean&quot; and &quot;Mongolian&quot; are the odd ones, I can't figure out why they doesn't end with &quot;ese&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Cambodian&quot; and &quot;Laotian&quot; is clearly French in origin (parts of French Indochina), though it puzzles me why &quot;Vietnamese&quot; is not. Perhaps they got named by the Portuguese before the French arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;Indian&quot; is not really East/Southeast Asian, and rather belongs to the group predominantly named by the British (along with Iranian/Persian, Arabian, Sri Lankan etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe India was also known to Europe for a longer time than other parts of East/Southeast Asia. The Seleucid Empire (established after Alexander's conquest of Persia) bordered it, and there was also a seperate Greek colony in the area that is now Pakistan.</p>
<p>EDIT: I think Mongolia is an exception because the country we now call Mongolia only came into existence in the 1900s, having previously been a part of China - its name comes from &quot;Mongol&quot; + the Latin suffix &quot;-ia&quot;. Up until then, the people were just known as &quot;the Mongols&quot; - and Europe was very familiar with the Mongols since Genghis Khan rose to power in the 1200s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it's a English thing. A lot of these that end in -ese require letters that force us English speakers to shut our mouths or make contact with the roof of the mouth (think consonants) whereas the ones ending in open sounds or vowels end in different sounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>PortuGuese</li>
<li>VietnaMese</li>
<li>ChiNese </li>
<li>JapaNese</li>
<li>SudaNese</li>
<li>
<p>BeniNese</p>
</li>
<li>ItalYan</li>
<li>ColumbiAn</li>
<li>AmericAn</li>
<li>MexicAn</li>
<li>MongoliAn</li>
<li>KoreAn</li>
<li>RussiAn</li>
<li>SomaliAn</li>
</ul>
<p>Weird ones: </p>
<ul>
<li>Swedish</li>
<li>Finnish</li>
</ul>
<p>More weird ones (maybe they ended in a different sound?):</p>
<ul>
<li>French</li>
<li>Dutch</li>
<li>German</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice these are weird but also could sound sort of correct if they existed/were common in English:</p>
<ul>
<li>BerliNese </li>
<li>GermaNese</li>
<li>
