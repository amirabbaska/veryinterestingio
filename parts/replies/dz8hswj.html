<p>I mean could we add two connections and receive double the power and store it in a battery down here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is enough power for a small city.  Perhaps you could use it to power the space elevator, but it wouldn't revolutionize the world energy market.  Today, a single power plant can put out more than 1000 MW, and they are frequently installed in groups so that the overall output from a single site is 5000 MW or more.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>A space elevator must in general extend beyond geostationary orbit, approximately a tenth the distance to the moon, for the counterweight to be able to support the tether. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any space elevator would be in excess of 35,786 km in length, and thus would definitely extend through the ionosphere, and need to be able to manage whatever potential difference existed. The total length of a space elevator would be a function of the mass of the counterweight and the cable tethering said counterweight to the Earth’s surface. The center of mass of the entire system must be above the geostationary orbit, so that the entire cable will be under tension. Otherwise the entire structure would collapse under its own weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, thunderstorms don't need the charge that they move to the ionosphere. At present, the return flow (1 kA) to sea level is distributed over all fair weather areas on earth. Thunderstorms would not mind if we redirected the return current to the tether. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They surely would though since now you have 1 kA flowing by its current means and <em>another</em> huge chunk of current flowing via the tether. That would reduce the voltage.</p>
<p>Unless the ionosphere is a perfect voltage source with zero output impedance which is pretty much impossible.</p></div>		</li>
