			<div class="markdown"><p>The key difference between a drink can and a tin can is that the drink can isn't meant to keep food fresh for years, tin cans are sealed with as little air as possible while drink cans are pressurised</p>
<p>It basically saves loads of material because most of the strength is from the internal pressure of the can preventing it from crushing during transport</p>
<p>There is a very good reason why cans are the shape they are, everything about them has been engineered to save as much material while being easy to transport</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think most comments have addressed the resistance this provides laterally, but it goes beyond this - it assists laterally, vertically and even torsionally. As you've probably already seen, tins still get dented even with the ribbing. The magic is that the consequence of that dent is reduced. A simple dent made to a tin with ribbing will not significantly decrease the structural integrity of the can when pressure is applied vertically (such as when stacking) or torsionally (e.g. if a stack of tins is knocked.)</p>
<p>A dent on a basic cylinder will grow when pressure is applied: laterally, vertically or torsionally. A bit like how a small crack in glass will spread when further pressure is applied.</p>
<p>Next time you want to crush a soda can, give it a twist while you push from either end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canmaking engineer here. The ribs or &quot;beads&quot; also provide strength for cans that are vacuum packed like cans for peanuts or coffee. Depending on the application some companies may apply up to 20 inches of mercury of vacuum to the can while packing which will cause the can to crumple into itself if the can is not strong enough. I have seen cans crumple from a little tap on the side if the beads on the can aren't deep enough. </p></div>		</li>
