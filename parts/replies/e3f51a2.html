			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in industrial electronics, we prefer our bit to fail as opposed to the fastener. If the tool fails, you just go find another one. If the fastener fails? That could be the better part of a day to remove in addition to risking damage to the equipment if the fastener needs to be drilled out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.</p>
<p>I generally don't support slotted, philips, or custom format interfaces for any purpose without a very strong argument.</p>
<p>In general, hex or torx or square are usually right depending on priorities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We almost exclusively deal with hex, although we have some phillips heads for some internal panels. Thankfully, 90% of our applications are low torque. In the few instances where we have high torque fasteners, I've always just broken the hex key trying to break them free, which is good since these particular fasteners screw directly into an air plenum for an electromagnetic rail. The thought of trying to drill that out gives me nightmares. </p>
<p>The only slotted screws we use are mounting screws for cable connectors, rack mounts and the like. And my screwdriver slips off. Every. Single. Time. </p></div>		</li>
