			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that, most of the battery usage of your phone is still just your massive bright HD screen. Also, running the equivalent of a super computer from 20 years ago in your pocket doesn't save to much on battery either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the fact that the console can control the controller (rumble, player number led, etc), the protocol that the controller uses likely has a way to guarantee delivery of a button press. This means that the controller must find out if the console received the button press or not</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why so?</p>

<p>that the console has it hooked up to Player 1's slot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think that's necessary either. The console can do the job distinguishing between different controllers' signals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that the console can recognize its mic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mic's an extra feature which isn't needed, and so is audio, rumble, feedback which a lot of people never even use. I think it would be nice to have controllers that don't have those extra features, but still have the basic functionality and also work for as long as TV remotes because of that. I'd certainly appreciate the option.</p></div>		</li>
