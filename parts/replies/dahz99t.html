			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the pre-flash is for red-eye (and for some camera/flash combos pre-flash is lit as an exposure meter), and can actually cause you to pick up blinking if the timing is right and your subject blinks with the right reaction time. By the time a person blinks from a camera flash, the flash is already over. But if they blink slowly enough you might catch it during the actual exposure.</p>
<p>For blinking you can alter the timing of the flash. When you use a flash you're normally working with shutter speeds (the duration the shutter is open, exposing your sensor to light) of 1/180 - 1/250th of a second or slower. However, the flash duration-the duration that the flash bulb is lit, is much faster. Flash duration is usually somewhere around 1/1000th to 1/15,000th of a second, depending on the type of flash.</p>
<p>That means that you can vary the point at which the flash fires during the exposure. For a flash that only fires for even 1/1000th of a second, a 180th, a 60th, or sometimes when you're working with a very low lit area-a quarter of a second, these shutter speeds are an eternity. Think of it as your flash is a very bright light bulb that you can light up for 1 second. But the time it takes to expose your image takes 20 seconds. That means you have 19 seconds where the flash isn't doing anything! The shutter is just open collecting relatively dim (extremely dim compared to the flash) ambient light. But the flash has to fire at some point-and thankfully most pro-level flashes have options for that.</p>
<p>These options are called rear or front curtain sync. I won't get into why they're called that, but just realize that it's the difference between lighting your flash at the beginning of that 20 seconds (front curtain), or at the end of the 20 seconds (rear curtain).</p>
<p>If you light the bulb immediately, you're going to light up your main subject for a brief second, and then collect ambient light on your sensor (or film) for the next 19 seconds. In second 2 you'll also probably be picking up the trail off of the flash bulb as it cools and dims, and then pick up what your subject is doing in ambient light for the next 18 seconds. This gives your subject PLENTY of time to blink, and for your camera to pick it up.</p>
<p>The other option is to use rear curtain-expose your background for 19 seconds, gathering photons to build up the setting of your photo, and then at the last second BOOM fire the flash-close the shutter. Don't give the flash any time to trail off, and have the shutter closed before your subject can even begin to blink. This will give you a tack sharp subject-and no blinking eyes.</p>
<p>Now, compress this whole process into 1/60th, 125th, or 250th of a second. 95% of that 250th of a second nothing is happening except that the shutter curtains are open. Hopefully with that in mind you get an idea of what is going on in the camera. </p></div>		</li>
