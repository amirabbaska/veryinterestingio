			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the filling's thickness makes no difference. It's about the thickness of the cookie wafer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains why the cookie would be more likely to break if pulled straight off, but not why the actual separation is easier with twisting. I expect the answer involves torque.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once the twist occurs you are shearing off the middle of the cream using the strong cookie as your tool. Once the cream is sheared in two, separation is trivial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it's that shearing that the question is referring to.  Put another way, if the cookie was made of titanium, it would still be easier to twist it off.  It's the same principle as a wine cork coming out easier when you twist.  Applying a force as torque as opposed to linear pull seems to work better in a lot of cases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Think about a bicycle wheel. You’re much more likely to get failure pulling the wheel sideways than applying rotational force (ie braking or pedaling). </p></div>		</li>
