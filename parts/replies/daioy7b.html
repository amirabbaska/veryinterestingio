			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for posting the correct answer! The continued spread of the myth that Planck was trying to fix the &quot;ultraviolet catastrophe&quot; is a pet peeve of mine. If you want to read more, the online excerpts from <a href="https://books.google.nl/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">this biography</a> are helpful too. To sum up a complicated story: </p>
<p>Planck was willing to tinker around with different theories to find a way to derive Wien's law, which appeared to fit the data when he started his work on blackbody radiation. He turned to Boltzmann's kinetic theory of gases for inspiration, even though he personally disagreed with the implication from this theory that gases were made of atoms. But his flexibility paid off, and he found some assumptions that gave Wien's law by treating a blackbody as a finite collection of oscillators. But he didn't find Planck's constant yet. This was 1899.</p>
<p>Then better measurements came out, and Wien's law was shown to be off. So Planck tinkered with his assumptions a bit more. In what he called &quot;an act of desperation&quot;, he assumed that not only was the blackbody radiation coming from a finite number of oscillators, but that the energy in each oscillator could only increase or decrease in finite chunks. He needed this assumption so he could calculate the entropy using Boltzmann's definition. He initially hoped that letting the size of the energy chunks to go to zero would give the right answer, but instead his calculation only fit the data at a specific value - Planck's constant. But with that value he got an exact fit to the data.</p>
<p>Planck did not appear to have any deep insight about why the energy levels should be quantized. He was very open that he had no idea what his constant meant, and he tried to find a way to reconcile it with a continuous theory of matter and energy with no atoms or quanta of energy involved. But despite his reluctance, he knew Planck's constant was needed to fit the data and refused to abandon it for philosophical reasons alone. He was frustrated with James Jeans for doing just that:  </p>
<p>&quot;I am unable to understand Jeans' stubbornness – he is an example of a theoretician as should never be existing, the same as Hegel was for philosophy. So much the worse for the facts if they don't fit.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And thank you for posting a good summary! To be perfectly honest, I had the same ultraviolet catastrophe-based misconception prior to finding this thread, and I stumbled upon the linked paper while trying to parse the Wikipedia page for a concise explanation of how introducing the energy quantum led to a non-divergent radiance spectrum. And to be more honest, I didn't have the time to read the article thoroughly enough to provide a faithful synopsis, but rather just skimmed it hard enough to recognize that it was a fine account of the historical truth. It was interesting, albeit frustrating, to read all the non-physical attempts in this thread at providing a heuristic explanation of the derivation, so I'm grateful this article is getting the attention it deserves. (With apologies to Physics World for subverting their paywall.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is. Some amazing people there. Curie, Rutherford, Sommerfeld, Planck, Einstein,... I'm sure that an actual chemist would recognize even more names.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live right next to this hotel. It's been 5 years, and every single time I see it I think about this conference</p>
<p>Went a couple of times in the lobby, just to drink a glass of martini next to this picture and stare at it, imagining being there with the greatest minds of this era.</p>
<p>This was such an historic moment for science</p></div>		</li>
