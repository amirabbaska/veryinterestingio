<p>38 special</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... Developed by Smith &amp; Wesson. But by their main competitor back then, Colt called it the Colt .38 Special. </p>
<p>Either way, not to be confused with the different dimensioned .38 Smith &amp; Wesson cartridge. Also known as the .38 Colt New Police. But when loaded with a 200-gr bullet is called the .38 Super Police. And as if that isn't enough, the Brits call it the 380/200.</p>
<p>Had a friend once traded for a nice vintage 1903 Colt Automatic pistol in .38-ACP cartridge. I'm looking it over and he hands me the box of ammo he got for it. WHAT THE...?!? He bought a box of Colt .38-Super for his old relic. No no no, don't not fire that higher pressure round in that nice pistol, though it will chamber and shoot it. But safety first, just don't do it.</p>
<p>And as if commercial ammunition companies can't get their act together for safety and non-confusion, then throw in the military to boot--</p>
<p>The 5.56-military round will chamber and fire in any firearm marked for the lower pressure commercial .223-Remington. Not always safe. </p>
<p>Then just the opposite with the 7.62x51 military cartridge, it being milder than the commercial .308-Winchester cartridge. But same thing, each will chamber and fire in firearms marked for one but not the other. Not always safe.</p>
<p>Up to us, Joe Blow Public, to do his homework and know what's what.</p>
<p>Excuse me now, feeling another headache coming on, better swallow some more aspirin.</p></div>		</li>
