			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually called Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) not electro shock therapy. We also use it with patients that are unable to move limbs (stroke patients, TBI, spinal injury, etc) for much the same reasons you mention above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And TENS unit is along the same lines. The &quot;T&quot; stands for &quot;trancutaneous&quot; which means it doesn't penetrate as deeply (or isn't meant to... although it can zap you pretty good if you turn it up high enough) so it isn't meant for muscle activation, but more so for pain relief - theories of which have been debated for years. My opinion about TENS: if it helps you, then use it until you can find a permanent solution to your pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A tens unit is a little different, they're more an untargeted system basically designed to overload the nerves and cause them to reset, hopefully helping to relieve pain and swelling. FES is more targeted treatment and helps elicit therapeutic movement. We use a number of different systems, but the Bioness is one of our more commonly used ones.</p>
<p>I had forgotten about the tens unit as we've largely stopped using them at our facility. It's actually highly likely that my above comment is wrong and he's receiving tens treatment, as that is a very common treatment in sports med and standard therapy clinics. Still not electro shock therapy, but I could see someone calling it that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electric pulses in reference are the same pulses you would receive from your own nerves. Your muscle can only contract in one way and that revolves around a complex psyiological and neurological process so the NMES or FES the PTs are using are not contracting the muscles, they're stimulating the nerves which then contract the muscles. The difference is, when you try to voluntarily contract a muscle with your mind, you stimulate the entire motor unit which would simultaneously contract the entire muscle. With electrical stimulation, you can just activate specific muscles by putting the electrodes over the target muscle and triggering those specific nerves which correspond with the muscle you intend to activate. It also allows for the PT to control the intensity of the muscle contraction which can allow you to contract your muscles without hurting yourself. </p>
<p>As far muscle growth is concerned, in theory you can build muscle by damaging it and then allowing it to heal, whether that be through electrical stimulation, massage, trauma, etc etc. However, muscle growth is largely different from muscle hypertrophy, strength, or power. In order to gain muscle size, you have to stimulate the muscle in a certain way, the same with muscle strength and power. I've never tried massaging the muscles to force them to grow, but that would be an interesting study if someone wanted to conduct it and I'm sure there would be no lack of willing participants - at least at first, until they realize the amount of pressure and pain they would have to go through lol.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure exactly. I had surgery for patellar subluxation, chondromalacia, and arthritis. It was just years of my knee not tracking in the right way. Instead of sliding forward and backward, my knee was sliding diagonally to the right. The grinding over the years wore down any cartilage involved.</p></div>		</li>
