<p>when you're getting into some higher-end stuff, garments can be delicate yet well constructed. I'd lump that in with construction</p>

<p>I think there is a pretty big trade off between durability and comfort. A cashmere sweater is not going to be a durable as a thick cotton sweater, but it's going to feel a lot softer and give you more warmth for less weight. Likewise a pair of Levis can last for ten years, but designer jeans are going to be softer, lighter, and more tailored. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, most designer jeans are going to be raw and selvedge, but your point is decent but just not really universal. </p>
<p>A well constructed suit lasts much longer than it's cheaper equivalents. Wool sweaters are naturally smell resistant and long lasting. Leather shoes from high end brands are stitched, so the soles of your Gucci loafers can be replaced for cheaper than joe blow pays for new Aldo shoes. </p>
<p>But in other cases, durability is not the concern of the clothing. It just depends on the item, material, and brand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I agree with u/morningwoodwilson and just want to add a point about your cotton vs cashmere sweater argument. There is food and bad cotton and there is even good and bad cashmere. I've also heard that by weight, wool is stronger than cotton. Cashmere is certainly more resistant to pilling because of its extra long fiber length.</p>
<p>Fiber comparison aside, you're definitely right in that there's an inverse relationship between a fabric's comfort and its durability when considering thread fineness. The tightness of a weave is a whole other discussion, but a coarser fabric will be more durable than a finer fabric and a finer fabric will be more comfortable than a coarser fabric when woven (or knit, if we're going with the sweater example) using the same type of fiber.</p>
<p>The reason a cotton sweater might last longer than a cashmere sweater is that the coarser cotton yarn resists damage better than the much finer cashmere yarn. However, if you were to care and handle them the same way over a long period of time, I think the cashmere one might actually win out. So the outcome of that scenario depends on your definition of &quot;durable&quot;.</p>
<p>Also, even the cheapest cashmere from uniqlo feels like wearing clouds, so I'm happy with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point. Damage resistance is exactly what I meant. I can go hiking in a cotton or wool sweater and not worry too much about damaging it. I've ruined a cashmere sweater sitting at a desk</p>
<p>A well cared for cashmere sweater is definitely going to look nicer for longer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wear polo shirts, and being chintzy I usually buy the cheapest I can find, and being nerdy, the breast pocket is usually over-stuffed.</p>
<p>Against my usually chintzy practice, I have bought more expensive Land's End polo shirts, and every one (n=3) has developed a hole at the inner top corner of the pocket. </p>
<p>That has never happened with the cheap Blair, Haband or Hane's shirts.</p>
<p>More expensive by no means means 'better'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, definitely. An increase in price of 25% won't directly mean a 25% increase in comfort and longevity. It might even result in an inferior product, as you described.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know much about what makes a good polo, so I don't know what an appropriate price range would be, but in a general, widesweeping statement, more expensive clothes will be better quality because better quality demands higher prices.</p>
<p>I recently went to an herm√®s exhibition and wow some of those pieces were exquisitely crafted and worth well more than a Walmart faux leather jacket. That's obviously an extreme example, though, and unjustified markups for brand prestige happens all the time.</p></div>		</li>
