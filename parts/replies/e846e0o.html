			<div class="markdown"><p>Greatly appreciate your response as I've had my fair share of confusion from the news in Canada as well. It boggles my mind that in this day and age with the internet, with basically everybody in a North America having access to it, that theres not an easier voting system. In your country and mine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few problems:</p>
<p>1) how to determine who is eligible to vote</p>
<p>2) how do you prevent people from voting more than once</p>
<p>3) how to make votes fully anonymous</p>
<p>Each of these problems are kind of easy to solve separately, but difficult to solve together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t forget not having a computer or poor internet access. My parents live in a rural area where it is a pain to get internet. The options are dial up (and hope the phone lines are up), some goofy line of sight that is maybe 5MB up/down, or forking out for a cell hot spot or satellite-based service. </p>
<p>I also deal with a lot of people at my job that are older, rural, poor, or just sick of tech that don’t have a computer. They might have a smart phone, but it might not be a good one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about if they've been released from prison but are still serving a term of parole or probation? They'd be out in the population (and therefore have an address) but still technically serving part of their sentence, so are they able to vote or no?</p></div>		</li>
