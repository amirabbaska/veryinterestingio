			<div class="markdown"><p>Err, I forgot that this was ELI5. I probably wouldn't be explaining this to a 5 year old but if I had to, here's my ELI5:</p>
<p>Lots of chemicals in your brain have effects on libido. Some make that drive stronger, some make it weaker. Your body's health also makes a big difference, so if you exercise more that will help boost libido too. Things that are new and sexually exciting will boost libido more than the things you are used to. But the mind is the most powerful sexual organ and can make your libido stronger or weaker no matter what is going on in your body or brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but it should still be understandable to people. As the sidebar says, &quot;friendly, simplified and layman-accessible explanations&quot;, and the above is anything but.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dopamine is counter-regulated by prolactin which is released after male ejaculation, so increases in prolactin cause dopamine and libido to drastically fall off. </p>

<p>Does this explain why I'm disgusted with the porn I just jerked off to after I've nutted? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.  Before you come you body is basically like &quot;come come come come come come&quot; to a minor extent all the time and it impacts your decision making.  After you come you body shuts that voice down for a bit, and your re-evaluations of your decisions can be sobering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very thorough explanation and really seems high quality. For someone who is not familiar with all these chemical terms, it is a little hard to follow. Could someone &quot;ELI5ize&quot; this answer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Libido is caused by a mixture of chemicals in your brain which are triggered differently. It varies between people because people have different sensitivity to these chemicals or because they produce more (or less) than others depending on genetics.</p></div>		</li>
