			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a CPA and agree with everything you said. One minor note (and it is minor, the point gets across fine) is that most charitable deductions are limited to 50% of your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) for the year. Anything over that limit is carried forward for up to 5 years. </p>
<p>My main point I try to get across to clients who are looking for some crazy tax savings is that they need to remember that tax is by definition a percentage of the economics. Unless they want to do something illegal, in which case they need to find someone else because they don't pay me near enough, I tell them that we'll write off everything they were planning on doing, but not to do things specifically thinking about taxes. Use the tax benefit in the decision making process, but don't base decisions solely on tax savings.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a fellow CPA, I can confirm this is why your clients aren't paying you enough. There is a difference between tax fraud and tax avoidance. I'm on your side, my interpretation of many of the proposed avoidance methods is that they're leaning towards fraud. I wouldn't sign those returns. But there are very smart CPAs who will, whi are confident in their interpretation of the code, and right or wrong, they're the ones getting paid.</p>
<p>This kind of treatment isn't unique to personal tax either, there are plenty of corporate tax professionals that stand by very aggressive interpretations of the code. See offshoring and legal entity repatriation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another point to make for avoidance vs. evasion is that greed is what separates it in my opinion. Like my profs said, pigs get fed, hogs get slaughtered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, agreed. I didn't mean to imply that there aren't positions we take on returns that are of a more ambiguous nature (even if they are few and far between in my practice). But being your stereotypical accountant, I am both risk averse and incredibly unimaginative. This works pretty well for the client base I have, but I know that the firms that charge more have more tricks up their sleeves, and accept more risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's a good way to find a CPA who is willing to cautiously and intelligently push the boundaries?  I'm the sole owner of a company that does around 2m in sales per year.  I pay a lot of taxes.  My CPA is decent but I feel like he can do more.  I'm just not too sure where to start my search.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you made $10,000,000 in a year and donated $9,000,000 to charity during the same year, you'd essentially be taxed as if you made $1,000,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not actually true, since the charitable contribution deduction is <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contribution-deductions" target="_blank">limited</a> to 50% of your income.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Revenue Agent for the IRS I'd like to point out that those scenarios you listed will rarely be considered &quot;tax fraud.&quot; Those are normally civil issues, result in paying the correct tax liability and  a 20% negligence or a 20% understatement penalty. Civil fraud (just a higher penalty, no jail time) is only pursued if there is clear and convincing evidence to prove that the understatement was due to fraud. So long as people can make the case for their estimates, there's no way the IRS will go after a fraud penalty. And also they don't come anywhere near criminal fraud (jail time, investigated by special agents not revenue agents).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the clarification. I have been using &quot;tax fraud&quot; as a blanket term when I probably should have said something like &quot;tax evasion.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more of a practical distinction than a legal distinction, right? It's still tax fraud if you do it intentionally, it's just difficult to prove without additional evidence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes, if you had the intent. But it's usually  never pursued unless it involves sophisticated schemes and/or large dollar amounts of understated income. </p>
<p>We usually do the standard 20% penalty on every case. In order to pursue fraud we have to get fraud technical advisors involved and It's a long process, so it has to be serious stuff. </p></div>		</li>
