			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanna jump in here about the Tasmanian Devil facial tumour disease. The disease is not thought to be spread sexually, instead through biting, as generally the devils will bite each other when fighting over food. It can also be transferred through eating the same carcass as an infected devil. Interestingly, it is one of the few forms of infectious cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transmissible cancers (that is, where the cancer itself rather than a carcinogen such as an oncovirus is transmitted) affect a few species of mammal and some marine bivalves. Typically they spread through populations with reduced genetic diversity that makes it difficult for the immune system to recognise the cancer as foreign; canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) spreads between dogs in this manner (and is a genuine STD, staying on topic). On the other hand, contagious reticulum cell sarcoma of the Syrian hamster is able to actively suppress the host immune response. This last transmissible cancer is particularly interesting because it is not spread by direct contact but via the bite of a mosquito, somewhat like malaria.</p>
<p>There have been isolated cases of cancer transmitted between humans, often to immune-suppressed individuals e.g. transplant recipients or AIDS sufferers, however there are no established cases of onward transmission resulting in a persistent strain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not the person you were replying to but here is another one. It's an STI in dogs.</p>
<p>The issue with transmitting cancer is the same as the issue with transplantation: the recipient immune system. The tasmanian devil face cancer is transmissible because the population is so incredibly inbred that the immune system often fails to recognise the tumour cells as foreign.</p>
<p>This dog cancer is transmitted in an immunoprivileged part of the body (the immune system doesn't &quot;see&quot; this area as clearly). Because of that, this cancer very rarely metastasises, except in immunocompromised dogs.</p>
<p>Another one is in Syrian hamsters, but I don't really know a huge amount about that one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Helicobacter pylori</em> can cause stomach cancer due to the severe ulceration that can result. Essentially, the irritation caused by the presence of <em>H. pylori</em> is enough to cause mutations in the surrounding tissue, resulting in cancer. Infection with <em>H. pylori</em> is the strongest risk factor of developing gastric cancer. </p>
<p>The most likely route of transmission is through ingestion of contaminated food products, as stomach ulcers often appear in familial clusters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're mostly right about Devil facial tumor disease not often being considered an STI, but I want to add a little bit of discussion about what makes something a &quot;sexually transmitted infection&quot; in the hopes it will be interesting to some people.  </p>
<p>The devils don't need to copulate to spread it, and they can and do spread it during non-sexual interactions like during social feeding, but in a species like devils where many individuals are solitary a lot of the time except when they're looking to mate, any disease spread by contact can be justifiably classed as a sexually transmitted disease if you allow a loose definition of the term.  Microbiologists sometimes get upset when we do this, but as a Ph.D. student in animal behavior studying (in part) the ecology of sexually transmitted disease, I can say that it's an acceptable way to think about these diseases in some disciplines.  </p>
<p>Consider the common cold in humans - we don't call it an STI, even though you could spread it easily while having sex with another human, because the virus is more often spread by non-sexual interactions.  But what if humans were solitary like tigers, and didn't physically interact with one another except during mating?  Then a rhinovirus would become a &quot;sexually transmitted&quot; infection because the behavior of seeking a partner and mating with them is the cause of an individual getting infected.  Behavioral ecologists thinking about the costs of sexual behavior in a species might consider any infection transmitted by the changes of behavior that accompany mating an &quot;STI&quot;, even if the disease-causing agent isn't actually spread by genital contact.</p>
<p>Now, in the case of Tasmanian Devils, what we know about their social interactions tells us that in the wild there are time periods (mating season) when most interactions between animals are male-female interactions, but that outside of mating season there are fewer male-female interactions and mostly female-female interactions, with some lone males possibly not interacting very much with anyone for that part of the year.  This suggests that sexual behavior may be, in part, driving the spread of the transmissible facial tumor disease, even though it's mechanically spread by facial biting.  (Of note, deep facial bite wounds are more commonly seen in the breeding season, and devils below breeding age are rarely seen with facial tumors, which lends some credence to the idea that sexual behavior is a partial driver of transmission.)</p>
<p>So is transmissible facial cancer in Tasmanian devils an &quot;STI&quot;? No.  But sort of yes.  It depends on the question you're asking, and the definition of &quot;STI&quot; that you want to use.</p>

<p>This is a somewhat unsettling. Does that mean I could lay on my lawn and potentially contact a sexual virus from a bird that sneezed a few days ago on the ground I laid on? </p>
<p>How much disease is living right around us on the ground that people walk by everyday and just happen not to touch it? </p>
<p>As I’m sitting here on public transportation, is it possible that the empty seat next to me has AIDS living on the seat cushion? </p>
<p>If so, wouldn’t objects like public handrails and doorknobs that get a lot of traffic spread serious sicknesses regularly? </p></div>		</li>
