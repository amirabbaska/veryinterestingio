			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Normal&quot; in Germany is 91.<br />
It just happens that due to the way the market is structured (and various rules on how much 'biofuels' refiners need to use) it's actually cheaper to produce a bunch of E10 95 octane gas.  </p>
<p>Or in other words, you don't see 91 because it costs more than 95, and so no one ever buys it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you break this down a little more for me?  I'm a few drinks in.  </p>
<p>Are you saying that there are regulations in place that make producing a higher octane fuel cheaper in the long run to produce?  </p>
<p>Are there 3 different tiers like in the US or is it all just 95?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many people, myself included before I bought a diesel, still buy E5 instead of E10.<br />
Octance is still 95 for that though.</p></div>		</li>
