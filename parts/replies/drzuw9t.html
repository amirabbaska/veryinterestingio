			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite part is that America and Canada have joint custody over one of the falls. And while I'm sure there's some treaty regarding shutting part of it off, I like the idea that if there's some feud one country could just turn their side off out of spite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, 90% water is diverted for power generation and 10% by law is maintained (min amount needed to keep natural look) . On occasion 100% can be diverted and stop the falls completely. Has been done in the past for projects  and will be done again soon for them to clear rubble and other things in the coming spring. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also read that the original river eroded the falls much faster, several inches or maybe even feet per year. The low flow today has almost stopped the erosion.</p>
<p>It would be cool to see like 50% or 75% of the total volume actually going over the falls. Just to compare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's where it goes.</p>
<p>The power plant is powered by the water falling through turbines instead of over the falls.  It's the difference in height that makes the whole thing work.</p>
<p>The water isn't used up by the power plant, it just goes back into the river below the falls.</p></div>		</li>
