<p>My mom let us feel her lump </p>

<p>That is actually a pretty good idea, seeing how many women including me are unsure about what those lumps should feel like, you sure have some advantage having a better idea of what to look out for.</p>
<p>edit: then again I don't know how much those lumps can vary sooo...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You won't believe this but they actually took a pair of those boobies you speak of and a pair of balls to my school a while ago.  You could feel them as part of a workshop on breast cancer and testicular cancer, which is a cool idea in theory but with a group of 17 year old guys involved you know the direction that's gonna head in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe they (US Preventative Services Task Force) have recently recommended <em>against</em> <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/breast-cancer-screening" target="_blank">self-examination of the breast</a>. Essentially they found that on average people were far more likely to find something benign than malignant leading to invasive tests with complications, but no real benefit on morbidity or mortality associated with breast cancer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do! When i was in 5th grade i went with my friend and her mom to some... health conference? I cant remember really, but i do remember a booth of model breasts with lumps in various places so we could practice palpating and knowing what to look for. We got a bit giggly at the time but im thankful we got the educational experience!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom shushes me when I try to talk to her about breast health. Her mother died of breast cancer so I think it should be important to her but she finds it vulgar to talk about. I tell her it is normal for a mother and daughter to talk about breast health and periods and stuff. </p></div>		</li>

I’ve found a large glass of wine and asking my mother very pointed and specific yes/no questions helps get he ball rolling.</p></div>		</li>
