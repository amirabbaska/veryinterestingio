<p>If the current is very high, the cable can move slightly, though most high current cables would be too heavy to notice much movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen a funny example of this - we were running an experiment at a particle accelerator (a fixed target muon beamline at the CERN SPS) that involved peltier coolers with a temperature controller switching them on/off (they draw a couple of amps) and a very powerful (1.6 T) superconducting magnet with a large bore (you could walk inside it - in fact one of my colleagues almost got stuck there once as he forgot that he was wearing bike shoes with cleats).</p>
<p>We switched on the magnet and the experiment, and went to close off the area so that we could take beam. But then we noticed a weird sound, a &quot;click-swish-clack&quot; sound with a few second intervals. Peering down at the experiment from a &quot;walkbridge&quot; above the beamline, we saw the the whole &quot;anaconda&quot; of cables running from the rack just outside the magnet to the experimental table inside the magnet swinging from side to side every few seconds. After quickly realizing it was due to the current drawn by the peltier coolers that was being switched on and off, we tied it down with a thousand cable ties probably a bit of duct-tape, and went on to collect some very nice data :)</p></div>		</li>

They powered it up and the traction supply cables running between the pantograph vehicle and the motor vehicles, which normally hang down, moved 90Â° in opposite directions due to the magnetic fields!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While trying to find the circuit breaker for a bunch of outlets in a large industrial building we decided to speed things up a bit and did a <em>don't try this at... ever</em> by making a wall plug with a dead short across the line and neutral. All the wiring ran through steel conduit so when we plugged in the short a loud 60 Hz buzz shot across the conduit until the breaker popped. Quite surprising, actually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha Ha I did this too but the breaker was defective and didn't trip. I was using a protected switch plugged into the outlet so I could turn it off before melting the insulation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you could use a circuit breaker tracer. They save so much time. Plug the one piece into the outlet then switch the wand on and go to the breaker box. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can actually mesure the cable length by this exact mean. By knowing how fast the electricity travel in the wire, you can then send a pulse and watch for it's reflection. Divide by two and you get the delay. Some math and you now have the wire length. (velocity / 1 sec = distance / mesuredtime).</p>
<p>I actually did that when I wanted to know the velocity in a coax, I mesured 241ft of coax, send a pulse at one end (signal generator), watched it come out at the other end (oscilloscope). And for the heck of it, I did the same but both at one end. Twice the delay, came very close to the same math. The error was due to the cable that deform the signal and the signal came weaker so harder to take precise mesurements. But it worked.</p>
<p>The signal actually travel at 85.23% the speed of light inside that coax.</p>
<p>Why did it mattered for me? Because I made an antenna out of it, and it's length is dependent on the electricity speed. It was some semi-random roll of coax at the store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when we used loops of coax to connect multiple computers (10Mbps Ethernet yay) I used a fancy cable tester to know where a faulty cable was. It told me how many centimetres away the fault was. Typically it was the connectors and not the cables.<br />
Then I could go there and wiggle it a bit and it worked until the next time someone had the audacity to move again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used similar tech back in the mid 80's on F/A-18 jets. They had microwave tubes running down the backbone of the fuselage to the back of the tail/vertical stabilizer. A once a year inspection called for checking the integrity of these. Making sure the connections from section to section were seamless. Would send a signal at one end and determine how far down the aircraft I'd have to start looking for cracks or loose connections. Pretty cool.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used just simple resistance once, inside an Abrams turret, to find a wire pinch in the GPS antenna. The total wire has a certain resistance, and a new harness is a known length. I measured resistance between the conductor and the shielding, got a value, and was able to infer that the damage was about 80% down the wire. Saved an hour or disassembling everything along the way just so I could confirm it was pinched.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a phone company, they use wire pairs for &quot;traditional&quot; telephone lines. These wires are conductors, and being wire pairs, they are separated by insulators, so they are technically capacitors. By measuring the capacitance across the wires, they have a reasonable way of gauging how long a given cable is. Of course, any equipment with capacitance that is hooked up to the line will throw off this measurement. I once had a line measure literally hundreds of kilometers, probably because of this effect. If the measurement had been correct, that line would have spanned roughly the distance from Amsterdam to Paris.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also have a similar &quot;water hammer&quot; effect if disconnected while carrying very high current.  The inductance will keep the current flowing momentarily, and if there's nowhere for it to it will pile up at the end of the cable and spark.</p></div>		</li>
