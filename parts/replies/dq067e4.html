			<div class="markdown"><p>You're close. You can target like that on any post regardless of media type. </p>
<p>Our Facebook reps (work at an ad agency) have told us just how well video does as part of a paid media campaign and just generally on their platform. That said, it's a specific kind of video. Something like less than :15 with a quick hook at the start. For example, if I'm promoting Justice League, it's in my interest in general to use a short video with a ton of action rather than an image. This is broadly speaking. </p>
<p>However, when you get into the nitty gritty this changes. If I just want people to know about Justice League, video works best. If I want them to click and then buy a ticket, sometimes video isn't the best at that objective. It's a difference between a campaign that's meant for awareness and one meant for conversion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But then why are these ads 15 second videos of static images? No action, cuts, it's 15 seconds of same image. What backend reason (either coding or marketing) is there for using that video instead of an actual image file?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FB's algorithm gives preference to video. That's all.</p>
<p>That means that it will show a greater percentage of your audience that post versus a still image. In general, if you have a million fans and 100-200k see that post organically, that is a win because Facebook by default doesn't show all 1 million that asset. </p>
<p>The way to guarantee everyone sees it? Pay them to run ads against it.</p>
<p>If you're already paying? This is a cheap way of making some sort of video content. I don't agree with the strategy but I can imagine someone with no creative background doing this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neo is clearly in the creative department lol. The reason for those &quot;videos&quot; is very simple: metrics. In digital marketing, reporting the success of an ad down to the eyeball-seconds is valuable data to provide your clients with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta guessing, but if it's a 15 sec vid of a static image, people may watch a second or five longer waiting for it to change only to realize it's just a static image. That's an extra 1-5 seconds of people viewing your ad. That's a long time in advertising. </p>
<p>Or they were told video works better and just took it too literally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you're right. Screen shots require work. It's easier to just right click and save photos. You can not do that with videos on Facebook.</p>
<p>You are correct. It kills me that so many people here are inaccurately making it more complicated of an explanation than it is.</p></div>		</li>
