			<div class="markdown"><p>I speak the truth, right? In the 'height' of my depression I was smoking $400 ounces almost every week. I did NOTHING else. For 3 years. I got through my sadness but spent a wicked amount of money and did nothing with my life. Nowadays I don't smoke anymore - it's all about the wax/shatter/crumble, and I treat it as a delicacy - I try HARD not to partake during the week because I like to get completely fcuked on the weekends like a responsible individual. I assume if I wasn't on a budget I'd partake constantly, but it loses it's purpose if you're high all the time. Been enjoying the weed for 20+years. All I know is when I'm 90, my robot will be flying me around while I'm baked as much as humanly possible. But for now, while I'm not rich, hold out as long as you can then get fuckkkkkkkkkeedddddddd</p></div>		</li>
