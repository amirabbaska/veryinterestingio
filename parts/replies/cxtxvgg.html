			<div class="markdown"><p>You're describing one possible link between depression and memory, but the hippocampus isn't really involved in a lot of other executive function tasks (e.g. attention, goal-directed behavior) that are impaired in depression. The connection between depression and inflammation is interesting, and it's getting a lot of research attention right now, but that doesn't mean it replaces all our earlier understanding of how depression affects cognition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even though we think of cortisol when it comes to stress and other generally negative 'things', cortisol is essential for survival and bodily homeostasis. You can Google &quot;Addisons disease&quot; if you want to know more about what happens when we're deficient in corticosteroids. Or &quot;Cushings disease/syndrome&quot; if there is an over production of mainly cortisol.
You need cortisol to uphold your blood pressure for example, you need it to be able to react to stressful stimuli for example running. Or maybe you want to regulate your immune system after an infection so it doesn't go haywire! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^^This. It's important not to oversimplify all these hormones and make wild guesses about their impacts. Cortisol, as DrLiv points out, is a great example, and does much more than cause &quot;stress.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
