			<div class="markdown"><p>(1) and (2) are often tricky ones to answer because I know people expect and want to hear that as individuals we can have a big impact on helping with this issue. Collectively, I think we can, but it has to be through large-scale systemic change.</p>
<p>There are the very obvious individual contributions (which we should be doing, regardless): minimise plastic waste whenever you can (as long as it doesn't have major knock-on effects such as food waste), recycle any plastic you do use, seek out brands who are really attempting to drive change (but beware of brands greenwashing and being ingenuine).</p>
<p>Beyond this, we really need large-scale policy, investment and corporate change. This will only be realised if we put real pressure on governments to tackle the big-impact options on this issue (i.e. investment in large-scale, effective waste management infrastructure at home and in lower-income countries). This is rarely on the priority list of votes for who they choose to support and vote for, and therefore is not even on governments' radar. If we expect them to take this seriously, it must be obvious that there is the public drive and pressure for this. Until this happens I think these issues (like many environmental issues will always have a back-seat). </p>
<p>This is difficult to do on an individual level (sorry!). But we can start with local policy pressure, but it must be collective if it's to make a difference.</p>
<p>The other 'pressure' or 'involvement' strategy is through corporate pressure: through public shaming campaigns of those companies taking little regard (shaming is actually often a very effective tactic: this is a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shame-Necessary-New-Uses-Tool/dp/1846146119" target="_blank">good book on the topic</a>), and through your buying habits.</p>
<p>In terms of (3) and (4): the worst-case scenario is that we don't get to grips with the problem and the quantity of ocean plastics continues to increase. It is likely to, regardless, in the short to medium-term since none of our solutions are an instant silver-bullet. But we can try to slow this rate. The ecosystem impacts are unknown: more plastics causing disruption to birds and fish life. At this stage my concern is in the impacts on marine ecosystems. I don't think we should be pushing the human health panic button (yet). I have not seen any evidence to support human health impacts (but we need to continue to investigate).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that the direct impact of individual efforts may not be that large, but I think the more individuals that work hard to be environmentally conscious will equate to more pressure on politicians an businesses to also become more environmentally conscious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think plastic bags are a great example of the importance of public opinion in policy. Had to write a couple assignments where they were fitting, lots of papers demonstrating the disconnect between what individuals agree with and what they actually do. Prior to plastic bag levies in many countries people would say how they supported reusing bags but few would. </p>
<p>Come actual legislation and it's usually met with little backlash where people support it but enforces people to act on how they feel and became normal with the added benefit on peer pressure / convenient for those who didn't even care to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Kc--v5EbE" target="_blank">this video of the author of the book talking about shame</a>. I think it shows up pretty well the point. Now I want to read the book to get to know how is the best way to use shaming tools and also how important is it to separate the person and the act when judging comes in (I personally think there's no bad people but bad actions, that's why is this so interesting and important to me)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the fundamental failure of capitalism. Businesses won't do good unless it's profitable. Businesses wouldn't even pay people if it weren't for the government. Government is the only thing between us and capitalists, but those same capitalists have ever increasing control and influence of that government. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loved the article title, was disappointed with the lack of a solution. How do we collectively take on corporate power?! Elections? Wallets? Grass-roots movements? These are all happening already now... but indeed, the speed of change is too slow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important and it's logical to wonder about it after the article, but it also doesn't have one answer and it's more speculative because you can't predict what will work. That's why it shouldn't necessarily be in the article. Also the main point of the article is important enough in itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>disagree. </p>
<p>there are people out there who like to virtue signal how green they are...while sipping starbucks in a disposable container.  </p>
<p>or how about eating out? by eating out instead of home cooking, you dramatically increase waste</p></div>		</li>
