			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for mentioning the brain/gut connection. Most people are unaware of this. My wife suffers from abdominal migraines which trigger extreme abdominal pain and cyclical vomiting. It took forever to get a correct diagnosis. Finally, she saw a neurologist who diagnosed her and she takes some of the same meds used to treat migraine headaches. Even the same migraine abortive meds when she feels an episode coming on. </p></div>		</li>

<p>*It's already in this post. The depression-serotonin link is more correlation that causation at this point. There is a bunch of newer research that suggests lower serotonin may be a result of depression, not the cause of depression. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have very high serotonin, so am monitored regularly. When my situation (earlier this year I went through a bad break up and lost some money) causes my mood to alter, my serotonin goes down (still above average) and when I'm happy because of how life is, it soars. </p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that my depression is linked to a situation and my serotonin adjusts, it's not that my serotonin levels are causing the depression. So my anecdotal findings agree with the new research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been studies that find a strong correlation between depression symptoms and serotonin levels, but there have also been studies that find weak or even no correlation between depression symptoms and serotonin levels and studies that have super mixed results.</p>
<p>Once you account for familial stuff (genetics), the highest predictors of depression include personal experiences (i.e. history of abuse/trauma, exposure to violence) and socio-economic factors (i.e. poverty, education, unemployment). We're not even talking purely biological factors. (This is true across many mental illnesses. For example, a predictor of schizophrenia is growing up in an urban environment.) Other strong predictors of depression include thinking styles, self-esteem, life outlook, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Serotonin probably fits in somewhere, but we haven't made it to the <em>how</em> yet. Some of the other theories floating around focus on inflammation, gut biome, emotional dysregulation, other neurotransmitters, various medical problems, side effects of medications that we don't understand, and there are probably a lot more out there. At the end of the day, it's quite possible that what we called &quot;depression&quot; is actually a constellation of illnesses that share similar symptoms caused by different mechanisms and therefore are best treated in different ways.</p></div>		</li>
