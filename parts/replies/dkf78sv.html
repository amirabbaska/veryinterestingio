			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago I heard about a study that linked extremely low incidence of peanut allergies in Israel to the widespread consumption of a peanut based snack food, Bamba.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothetically this should occur with any food that is withheld from a child then? That still wouldn't explain what biological mechanism is creating the allergy to peanuts and not other foods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Up until recently, doctors and other sources of parenting advice, told new parents to avoid nuts until age 2 or so. This was advised to avoid potentially fatal reactions in infants. However it may have compromised the good immune reaction effect in the rest of the population. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Money shot:  &quot;Among the 530 infants in the intention-to-treat population who initially had negative results on the skin-prick test, the prevalence of peanut allergy at 60 months of age was 13.7% in the avoidance group and 1.9% in the consumption group (P&lt;0.001).&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I must be an exception to the rule then.  Always ate peanuts.  Never had any problem with it.  And never had any allergies to anything else either.  Then one day, already in my mid-40's, I had a meal at my favorite Malaysian place across the street from me.  Spent some days in ICU after that.  Since then I've been allergic to peanuts, hazelnuts, and cashew nuts for sure, and also developed terrible hay fever.  Not allergic to Almonds.  And don't know if I'm allergic to any other nuts since I avoid them as much as possible.  Go figure.</p></div>		</li>
