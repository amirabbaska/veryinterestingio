USA is too but it's the USA not Obama himself. Big difference. Russia can talk to the USA. The USA can only talk to Putin, not to Russia as a government. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! And another very important point: Putin is an ex-KGB officer, who, as it looks like, want to go back and follow the old soveit ways. Which is not a way of people - the old soveit way is all about iron hand and oppression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the in-depth explanation. The only problem I have with it is that it makes the USA very much sound like the good guys and Russia as the bad guys in every single way. I don't think history ever was so black and white and there must be a lot of terrible shit that the USA is currently doing.. Whenever I hear a story about goodies and baddies I always get a bit weary, because when you live in a certain country, it's easy to learn about the fucked up shit your enemies are doing, but rather more difficult to get a grip on the kind of atrocities your own country is perpetuating..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's just shades of gray. Russians aren't bad people and if you think that people are bad for supporting Putin, keep in mind that many people in the US  voted for Trump. &quot;Russians love their children, too&quot;. And the US certainly has a habit of meddling in the internal affairs and politics of other countries. I think the scary thing now is that US politics are heading in a direction that's more like a conservative oligarchy. A small number of people and corporations running the country in a way that mostly benefits them while at the same time ignoring important topics that could undermine profitability like environmental regulations and promoting an agenda of fear and intolerance that still resonates with many people. </p>
<p>As a Dutch person living in the US, a thing to consider if you wonder if the US are always the &quot;good guys&quot;: the US has stated in the past (under Bush) that it would go as far as use military force in the Netherlands should US military personnel ever be detained in the Hague by the International Criminal Court; all this while running a prison like Guantánamo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a US citizen, the US definitely are NOT the good guys all the time. And the citizenry know it. We complain about it all the time. We point out hypocrisy all the time. The president himself knows it too, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/us/politics/senate-votes-to-override-obama-veto-on-9-11-victims-bill.html" target="_blank">see Obama's reason for his veto on the 9/11 Lawsuit Bill (which was incredibly stupid)</a>. See complaints about drone strikes. See complaints on how we aren't issuing enough refugee visas to protect the Iraqis who assisted US armed forces during the war (translators, militia, transport, informants, etc.). The US is SCREAMING in favor of environmental sustainability, but or corporate interests are undermining that.</p>
<p>We know Guantanamo is awful, but buearacracy isn't letting us shut it down. It'd be like if the EU had a prison that kept all the most dangerous terrorists that cannot be deported in it, and the EU wanted to close it down. The prisoners have to go some where. Would your country volunteer to imprison them, while none of the other countries do anything in that regards? Probably not, and that is why it isn't getting shut down.</p>
<p>The US is a very large country, the US (half sized) is basically the EU, where the US states are equivalent to EU countries. We have lots of conflicting interests, and we (mostly) acknowledge we aren't always the good guy. Really no one is the good guy. Its about striving to keep a stable balance. And for the US to do anything good, it basically has to drag a quarter to half the country along with it, kicking and screaming. In such a large country, inertia has a lot of power.</p>
<p>And on the other side, it seems, to me at least, Russia isn't striving for stability or playing nice. They seem to be striving for instability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an American who just moved back from the Netherlands, I think I'm OK with Bush's stance. I don't think it would go from 0-100 where we've got marines crossing the dikes. I think it starts with negotiation and escalates depending on the political implications. I think Bush was saying that worst case, the military option is <em>not off the table.</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like you trying to avoid looking at the world from monochrome perspective of good and bad. Let me add some colours to that.</p>
<p>As a person with the background of living in ex-USSR world for few decades (and especially in Russia) and few years in [let’s call it real global modern-world], I don’t want to argue over baddies or goodies… as everyone knows, it may take lots of time and nerves, and may be completely useless, leading the post to be just locked.</p>
<p>I just want to mention one very simple fact, and leave everyone reading my comment to mediate over that. Here it is:</p>
<p>From the very start of the USSR there was a huge extinction of the intelligence. For almost a century.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just imagine what that could do to a society.</p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper over the fact and the disasterous effects of that cruel action, if you please.</p>
<p>It all started with the idea that all people are equal, and people don’t need such a thing like money. That was an idea of communism as an opposition to capitalism, if saying very basically. In words it was a good idea (maybe, I myself don’t believe in that), but in real world that experiment didn’t worked out well, at least in the countries of the ex-USSR world (I know about China, which still has communism there. I am not competent enough to talk over them, but when I was in Hong Kong and was talking to locals I’ve been told there is a waaay better in Hong Kong then in China). </p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper and talk about two concepts: money and equality of people.</p>
<p><strong>Money</strong></p>
<p>Money, as a concept is “numbers for which you may buy yourself anything”. But in USSR that was completely fucked up for generations.</p>
<p>I see mostly two types of people here in the ex-USSR world: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Those who are poor and think only about money, because they don’t have the money. That is difficult, as the number of jobs is very limited and the society is still trying to understand what capitalism is.</p>
</li>
<li>Those who are rich and think only about money. Because they never had money before and cannot understand that having a gazillion number of money won’t help them to live longer (in most cases, on a global scale), won’t make their kids safer (in most cases, on a global scale) and won’t make their life better (in most cases, on a global scale).</li>
</ol>
<p>It is almost impossible to met a person who don’t care about money that much. Sure, you can find a different person, but that is what I saw mostly.</p>
<p><strong>Equality</strong></p>
<p>I hope someday the world will come to a simple concept: every person is unique, not equal. </p>
<p>Maybe everyone needs equal rights, I guess that is a good idea, but that is a long talk and I'm not going there now. But as a proof of an equality here — in post-USSR world — it’s almost impossible to find people who think about those with disabilities (unless they or their relatives are), almost impossible to find people who are really cared about older generations, find people who really cared about nature around them, not even talking about the world as a general. I didn’t mention their own kids, because I do believe that is a talk impossible to discuss in a comment, but… Just what I saw is people who punish their kids for being out of the masses. People who punish their kids for wasting a very little money away, people who punish their kids and abuse them for a great number of reasons. Just a simple note for those who are gay or have a gay friend: while it's officially accepted in the U.S. it's officially blamed in Russia. They argument they don’t want their kids to become gay (they really believe that is a thing a person may take from the people around).</p>
<p>There are huge number of examples of what is happening in ex-USSR world right now (I would even say &quot;right fucking now&quot; and let me explain why a little bit later), which are worth a book, not a comment.</p>
<p>But let’s go back to the concept of killing all the intelligence. Imagine a world where being intelligent is a weakness, not a power. That was made by those who started the USSR a century ago and that is still a reality in this part of the world today.</p>
<p>I know, the world is similar everywhere and the facts I wrote may be found anywhere, and in the U.S. as well. But here is one more thing again: the system. It works for smart people in the U.S. more or so. If you work hard, if you educate yourself you have all the chances to become anyone you want. You have those abilities. But that doesn’t work in ex-USSR, again. You have to befriend with “right” people, you have to do the &quot;right&quot; things and so on. I am not saying “it's easy there and it's too difficult here”. Not. Just the systems, they are very different. It's way easier to live in the U.S. if you're educated and skilled enough.</p>
<hr />
<p>The language. Another topic which isn’t worth a comment about, but rather a book, but just a very simple note: Russian language is very difficult, so it comes to the situation where masses don’t speak that Russian, they invented another one, much simpler, which consists mostly of the negative (so-called “bad”) words. It’s very common thing in Russia, just ask anyone from there.</p>
<hr />
<p>One more argument: how many people you know who emigrated from Russia (and any other ex-USSR world also) to anywhere, especially to the U.S. And how many people do you know who emigrated from the U.S. (actually anywhere) to Russia? Even Edward Snowden, who was forced to move there isn’t happy about living in Moscow, ask him.</p>
<p>Secondly. Look what all the countries did for the world and what Russia did. Seriously, what do you use is made in Russia? Except gas and oil, which isn’t their labour, but just geographical position. (Let’s not joke here about women, please.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Originally I am the one from the part of the world which is called Russia and the more I know about the world the more I understand what is happening anywhere, but Russia.</p>
<p>My opinion, I afraid, original commenter is completely right and looks like the U.S. more good guys than those in Russia. If you are looking from a perspective of intelligence, not those who bullying them with “force”.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>My world view is formed by many good books of a great people, of my observations from a number of travels and surely is just my humble opinion. If anyone interested in the theme I mentioned, I highly recommend to read [the book of Ayn Rand which is named “We the living”](We the Living <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002PA0LWA/" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002PA0LWA/</a>). That is the world she tried to describe (semi-autobiographically) from a perspective of the ones who are outside of the system.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Russia and the US play the same game. The US has been winning that game for a long time and they want to keep their position. They have a disadvantage though, which is that public opinion right now is against playing the game. So they have to be more subtle about it while Russia can be a lot bolder.</p>
<p>Both of them are the bad guy, but one of them is kept somewhat in check by their population. Everyone caught in the middle of their fight though, knows that there ain't no good guys in the game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it has to do with control of energy infrastructure. Energy transport infrastructure is particularly often overlooked. I'd post a map of oil and gas pipelines in the Middle East and central Asia, but I'm on mobile right now; it's not hard to find such a map. You'll notice there is a strong correlation between recent US military operations, and countries with developed or planned energy transport infrastructure. Particularly, Iraq and Afghanistan. (Who else invaded Afghanistan?). Of particular interest in Afghanistan is the Kandahar region, where a pipeline has been in planning for decades, and has also been the focus of a recent US offensive.</p>
<p>Also of interest is Syria/Iraq/Isis. Russia's support of Assad and US support of rebels is indicative of this. And nobody likes ISIS because they oppose the interests of everyone involved.</p>
<p>And keep in mind, Putin has a personal interest in his country's control of oil and gas.</p>
<p>Of course this is a drastic oversimplification, and there are numerous other strategic, social, political, etc concerns, but this is a critical element of the situation that leadership tends to sweep under the rug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The U.S. and it's allies aren't that secretive.</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union dissolved and took the Warsaw Pact with it, NATO strengthened its position and conditioned to expand its membership to Russian borders. The US continues to provide weapons systems to allies on the Russian border and conducts joint military exercises in Eastern Europe. We do the same on China's borders. </p>
<p>There's no strong Russian equivalent- the occasional overflights an airspace incursions don't compare with the buildup of NATO assets near Russian territory. </p>
<p>We're also just as engaged in promoting our interests around the world as Russia is, and we've had no problem in the last century toppling opposing governments in South America and the Middle East. </p>
<p>Chomsky summed up internal perceptions of American foreign policy quite well- there is no way that the US can interfere with the Peace Process, because by definition peace and aggression are what we say they are. </p></div>		</li>
