<p>So <strong>scrubbers do nothing</strong> in terms of stopping CO2 emissions and other smog particulates.</p>
<p>Instead China has forcefully shut down many thousands of coal-fired power plants in the past 5 years alone, in favor of replacing them with synthetic natural gas power plants, which produce zero smog emissions.</p>
<p>The only downside is those natural gas plants still produce CO2.  But it's still a step up from the traditional dirty power plants</p>
<p>And is also is why to address CO2 issues, China has been investing in Carbon Capture and Storage tech as of recent. The US also has some good experimental projects underway too.  </p></div>		</li>
