			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try, though i'm not that good at physics yet.</p>
<p>I'm guessing you know the basic idea of symmetry. Draw a line through a picture, and if the both of the halves are the same, the original picture is symmetric with respect to the line you drew.</p>
<p>In math, symmetry is defined more rigorously, and is expanded more, so that it is possible to be symmetric with respect to things other than lines. </p>
<p>Now in physics, we already know there are antiparticles. They have been predicted theoretically and observed experimentally. Antiparticles are symmetrical with respect to charge, which basically means the the antiparticle of the electron has the opposite charge. This means the the electron has a negative charge, while the anti-electron (positron) has a positive charge.</p>
<p>From what I understood from /u/JosGibbons' answer:
Supersymmetry postulates another kind of symmetry. Now in stead of charge, it is the spin of the particles that the symmetry is about. The spin of a particle is a quantum number like charge, and to be honest i don't really understand much about it. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you are saying that we cannot locate these partner particles because they may be too massive.  Seems counterintuitive, I would think it would be easier to find something more massive.  Am I misunderstanding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer:</p>
<p>Machines such as the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) smash particles together at high energies to create new particles. We can't observe them if we don't create them, and we can't create them if we don't have enough mass, and relativity equates mass to a certain amount of energy. This is part of why older machines didn't find the Higgs boson. </p>
<p>A footnote:</p>
<p>Most high-mass particles decay easily, so detectors tend to look for the byproducts. Very high-mass particles might decay into still quite high-mass particles that then decay even further, and so on. This can be quite hard to interpret to say, &quot;yep; it must have been that type of particle originally&quot;. Finding something like this for the first time requires a statistical analysis of a very large sample, i.e. we have to cause a huge number of particle collisions to get the evidence we need.</p>
<p>One version of the supersymmetry theory introduces a new conserved charge called &quot;R-parity&quot;, which is 1 for known particles and -1 for their hypothetical supersymmetry partners. It's called a multiplicative conserved charge, meaning the value that's conserved is what you get when you multiply all charges instead of adding them. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightest_Supersymmetric_Particle" target="_blank">lightest particle to score -1</a> cannot decay alone, since the only way to conserve R-parity would be to get more mass from somewhere (e.g. by colliding with another particle at high energy). This changes the detection prospects somewhat; you have to interpret a lot of energy in your machine suddenly not being detectable, or you have to invent some way to detect the particle directly (e.g. by it knocking an atomic nucleus hard).</p></div>		</li>
