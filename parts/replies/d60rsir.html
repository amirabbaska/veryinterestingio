			<p>Salmon that migrate between fresh and saltwater are called &quot;anadromous&quot;, meaning they begin their lives in freshwater, move into saltwater to grow as adults, and return to freshwater to reproduce (the opposite of this is called &quot;catadromous&quot;, and the most notable example is the freshwater eel).  Bullsharks are considered &quot;euryhaline&quot;, which means they can tolerate many different salinities.<br><br>Brackish water fish are often also euryhaline, but that term is usually used to identify fish species that specialize in living in brackish water environments for most of their lives.  Salmon exploit freshwater and saltwater at specific life stages, whereas bullsharks are generally marine, but are flexible enough to move into freshwater for extended periods of time.</p>		</li>

			<p>These fish tolerate a wide range of salinities, so they can be raised in freshwater. This is a common adaptation among fishes found near coasts, as they will frequently feed in estuaries and rivers.</p>		</li>

			<p>Biologist here, completely different kind. Thanks for the ELI5.<br><br>Followup question - what happens to the parasites of estuarine fish, or fish that migrate? Obviously there's a lot of variety but are there parasites that stick with them through a life cycle and undergo similar adaptation, or are just extraordinarily resilient? Or any interesting parasites that only infest during the freshwater or ocean phases?<br></p>		</li>

		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mynameismrguyperson" target="_blank">mynameismrguyperson</a>
			<p>That's a very interesting question.  I wish I knew more about parasites. I would imagine that estuarine fishes also carry parasites that are similarly tolerant of a variety of salinites, while fully-marine and freshwater fishes likely have higher proportions of less-tolerant species.<br><br>Some anecdotes from keeping aquariums: some treatments for topical aquarium parasites involve changing salinity; e.g., marine fish are given freshwater dips, and freshwater fishes get low doses of salt in their water (although the latter has benefits for osmoregulation as well).<br><br>I guess this one is sort of a cop-out answer, but it's not really my area.  Sorry!</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;There has been some confusion regarding my use of the word &quot;fishes.&quot; My use of this word is completely intentional. &quot;Fishes&quot; has a particular use among ichthyologists and fisheries scientists. &quot;Fish&quot; can be singular or plural. We use it as a general plural, as in, &quot;there are 20 fish over there.&quot; &quot;Fishes&quot; is used when one is discussing multiple types (species, genera, whatever), as in, &quot;a red fish and a blue fish makes two fishes&quot;. When I say &quot;fishes&quot;, I am referring to more than one type. When I say &quot;fish&quot;, I am referring to multiple fish of the same type.<br><br><br>Thank you for this.  I got an old book from ~1960s from my grandpa called <em>Exotic Aquarium Fishes</em> and it always confused the hell out of my why they used the word &quot;Fishes&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for the awesome explanation! The only thing I would add is that the mechanism behind the way freshwater fish absorb ions through their gills and saltwater fish excrete ions through their gills is the exact same mechanism. It is an ion transporter that is either on the apical against water side on freshwater fish or on the basal facing the body side (to quickly remove excess ions towards excretion) in salt water fish. The select few fish who can live in both environments have evolved a way to change the ion transporter from the apical to basal side at need.</p>		</li>

The remainder (the &quot;left behind&quot; stuff) is the salts (plus some water to make urine), which they expel as urine. Remember, freshwater fish are the ones peeing all the time.

			<p>As a direct answer, both work.<br><br><em>What kind of (individual) fish live in that lake?</em><br><br>encodes essentially the same information as<br><br><em>What kind of (species of) fish live in that lake?</em><br><br>thus the acceptable answers mostly overlap, but are technically slightly different.<br><br><br><br>Say, for instance, that the lake contains only largemouth and smallmouth bass, all of which are named either Steven or Alice, mostly Alice, and have had their scales surgically replaced with ceramic.<br><br>In the first question, you are asking the answerer to characterize most or all of the fish that live in that lake. Therefore, Alice would be an acceptable answer, because most of the individuals in that lake are named Alice. However, bone, keratin, or cosmine would all be incorrect, since none of the fish in the lake have natural scales.<br><br>In the second question, you are asking the answerer to characterize most or all of the species that live in that lake. Therefore, neither Steven nor Alice would be acceptable, because the vast majority of bass have no names at all, much less Steven or Alice. Meanwhile, bone, cosmine, and keratin would be okay, since these characterize the natural scales of bass species.<br><br>This is a highly contrived case, designed specifically so that the species characteristics do not apply to the individuals. In general, any descriptor that applies to the species will apply to the individuals, therefore, asking after the fish rather than the fishes is sort of a catch-all option.<br><br>BONUS: Similarly, you can use further in any case where you would use farther, but, technically, farther is only to be used to refer to a physical spacial distance.</p>		</li>

			<p>Hi, few salmon questions for you:<br><br>1) Is it so that they dont eat when swimming up river to spawn?<br>2) Once they spawn do they continue swimming up river or stay there until they die?<br>3) Do the males swim up river constantly fertalising eggs in the river bed and keep swimming up river?<br><br>I have been reading up on Salmon migrations tho havent been able to get a clear answer<br><br>Thanks in advance.</p>		</li>

			<p>1) Can you please clarify what you mean with your first question?<br>2) They usually remain where they spawned and die.<br>3) They swim until they find ideal locations for building their nests (called redds).  This is usually over gravel.  They tend to congregate together because the ideal environment tends to occur in a relatively limited area.  They generally return to the same streams in which they were born (although not always).</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for the information. Question 1 about when they swim in from the ocean up the stream to the redd do they eat along the way, is there any use of fishing in the rivers or only at the rapids in the gravel areas?</p>		</li>

			<p>It is somewhat controversial about whether or not they eat.  For a long time, they have been considered to cease all feeding once they re-enter freshwater.  However, many anglers note that Pacific salmon will strike at things that resemble fish eggs after coming back to spawn.  Some relatively recent research suggests that some of them do feed.  However, they are pretty guaranteed to die either way and are unlikely eating enough to make up for the toll that the whole trip has taken.</p>		</li>

			<p>They die from exhaustion rather than starvation?</p>		</li>

		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mynameismrguyperson" target="_blank">mynameismrguyperson</a>
			<p>Well, the exhaustion is related to starvation.  They undergo physical changes related to the trip (that costs energy), they devote a substantial amount of energy to producing eggs and sperm, and there is the energetic cost of the trip itself (often &gt; 1,000 km, including rapids, waterfalls, etc.).  Coupled with the fact that they aren't eating at all (or at least very little), they waste away.  They have enormous energetic outputs and very little coming in to make up for it.  I suppose you could simply say it's starvation, but there are a number of other factors.  Either way, they are pretty sad looking after they spawn, even before they get picked apart by birds and bears.</p>		</li>

			<p>When you take a fish out of water and you can see it is sucking in air , is that the same as us breathing in water and sucking in water if we drowned ?

			<p>Most fish species get the majority of their oxygen from gills rather than lungs (although there are always exceptions). In fact, most of them do not have lungs (again, there are some exceptions). Instead, they open their mouths and force water over their gills, which are located under bony flaps at the back of their heads.  If you have caught fish before, you have likely seen these.  They are very delicate structures, though, and do not work well in the air.  What you see the fish doing is likely a desperate attempt to force water over its gills while it's being held in the air.<br><br>This is somewhat similar to drowning in the sense that the wrong type of medium (air vs. water) is being forced over an oxygen-capturing device (lungs vs. gills), which isn't very productive!</p>		</li>

			<p>Here is part of a reply to someone else:<br>&gt;The urea is dissolved in the blood at such concentrations that the amount of solutes (things dissolved) in the shark's blood are essentially equivalent to the overall concentration of things dissolved in the saltwater. This means the shark's blood is &quot;isosmotic&quot; to sea water. That is, the two solutions (shark blood and sea water) on either side of a semi-permeable barrier (the shark) have the same concentration of solutes. Therefore, there is no &quot;push&quot; driving water from one of the barrier to the other. The dissolved urea allows the shark to avoid this struggle altogether. It's totally fine that the things dissolved in the blood are different from those dissolved in the sea water, too (technically, they actually have slightly MORE solutes than sea water, so they actually gain a little water, but let's ignore that for now).<br><br>&gt;So why don't all fish just do this? Well, urea has a nasty habit of damaging proteins, so sharks must also produce a substance called TMAO, which helps to protect their proteins from the damaging effects of urea.</p>		</li>

			<p>Here is my answer to a similar question, which will hopefully answer yours:<br>&gt;There are some fish species for which this is possible. In nature, these species are often found around river mouths near the ocean. Such fish move between the freshwater riverine environments and coastal marine environments, and often use estuaries as nursery areas for their young. Estuaries are unique environments found at river mouths where freshwater mixes with saltwater. Here, you have a wide range of salinities, so fish hoping to exploit these environments must be very flexible in their salt tolerance. The advantage of this is that estuaries tend be very productive (i.e., there is a lot of available food) and safe (there are many specialized plant species, which create hiding places); this makes them perfect for young, vulnerable fish.<br><br>&gt;In fish families where such adaptations are common, you will often also find species that are adapted to only fresh or saltwater, indicating that there was some slow &quot;acclimation&quot; process on an evolutionary scale. Additionally, within species, you can also find populations that are perfectly happy staying their entire lives in, e.g., freshwater. Steelhead and rainbow trout are the same species, but the former undergoes the traditional Pacific salmon life history, while the latter does everything (migrating, breeding, etc.) entirely in freshwater.<br><br>&gt;Perhaps closer to your question, there are fish that you can slowly acclimate e.g, from fresh to saltwater in an aquarium. Again, many of these are estuarine fishes that I mentioned before. One very common aquarium fish is the &quot;molly&quot;, which is usually sold as a freshwater fish. They are related to guppies and very easy to keep. They also have a wide salt tolerance and, if done slowly and carefully, can be acclimated to live in a pretty high salinity.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not sure how to give you a good answer.  Excluding fishes that regularly move between these environments, the effect of either is almost certain to be lethal.  Just HOW fast they die will depend on the fish.  If one fish survives 3 hours, and the other one a day, does that mean one condition was more lethal?  You'll start to see adverse effects (e.g., sluggishness) for either of these scenarios after 10 minutes or so.  Plus, it's possible that e.g., too much salt affects marine fishes less so than it does freshwater.</p>		</li>

			<p>Begs the question is widely used to mean something along the lines of &quot;makes me wonder&quot;. It's proper usage comes from Aristotelian logic. To beg the question is to make a conclusion based on premises which are contained within the conclusion. For example, if I said &quot;everything that grows in plants is good for you. Sugar grows in plants, therefore sugar is good for you&quot;. This is begging the question because I have drawn a conclusion based on the assumption that the premise statement is true, despite the fact that it may not be.</p>		</li>

			<p>There are some fish species for which this is possible.  In nature, these species are often found around river mouths near the ocean.  Such fish move between the freshwater riverine environments and coastal marine environments, and often use estuaries as nursery areas for their young.  Estuaries are unique environments found at river mouths where freshwater mixes with saltwater.  Here, you have a wide range of salinities, so fish hoping to exploit these environments must be very flexible in their salt tolerance.  The advantage of this is that estuaries tend be very productive (i.e., there is a lot of available food) and safe (there are many specialized plant species, which create hiding places); this makes them perfect for young, vulnerable fish.<br><br>In fish families where such adaptations are common, you will often also find species that are adapted to only fresh or saltwater, indicating that there was some slow &quot;acclimation&quot; process on an evolutionary scale.  Additionally, within species, you can also find populations that are perfectly happy staying their entire lives in, e.g., freshwater.  Steelhead and rainbow trout are the same species, but the former undergoes the traditional Pacific salmon life history, while the latter does everything (migrating, breeding, etc.) entirely in freshwater.<br><br>Perhaps closer to your question, there are fish that you can slowly acclimate e.g, from fresh to saltwater in an aquarium.  Again, many of these are estuarine fishes that I mentioned before.  One very common aquarium fish is the &quot;molly&quot;, which is usually sold as a freshwater fish.  They are related to guppies and very easy to keep.  They also have a wide salt tolerance and, if done slowly and carefully, can be acclimated to live in a pretty high salinity.</p>		</li>

			<p>There's two facts about the ocean, it's usually relatively speaking more food available there, and because of this there's a ton of fish and things viewing you as food as well. Chances of growing up is very low, therefore it's much more statisticly sound to bet on many rather than few eggs. <br><br>In freshwater there is usually less things wanting to eat you, but competition between you and your siblings etc. is higher to actually get the little food that is to be found.

			<p>Some salmon and their relatives are rather flexible in their strategies.  There are several species (e.g., rainbow trout, brown trout, and others) with populations that are entirely freshwater (although they do migrate to lakes rather than the ocean). These changes are genetic, but appear quite readily.  Steelhead, for example, are populations of rainbow trout that use both freshwater and the ocean. However, these populations have popped up in multiple subspecies of rainbow trout.</p>		</li>

			<p>Chiming in here from an entirely different perspective, as I'm an aquarium person myself.<br><br>In aquaria the term for a mixed-salinity environment is &quot;brackish&quot; and while niche, it is certainly not rare nor exceptionally difficult to do. However the setup requires fish from brackish environments, you can not acclimate a freshwater fish nor a marine fish into brackish water. It can survive for a short time but it won't be living in brackish water, just dying more slowly than in water opposite it's natural salinity. As for fish that come from brackish water naturally however, they have some very interesting traits.<br><br>Some brackish fish can exist happily in both full freshwater and full saltwater configurations, assuming they are properly acclimated. Slowly raising/lowering the salinity over a long period can allow these brackish fish to transition to and from full fresh and full salt environments. It is not linked to developmental stages and can be repeated back and forth. This is not ideal for the fishes health, but it is possible. There are other brackish fish however that require a true brackish environment to prosper. They can be held in full fresh or full salt (sometimes only one depending on the species) for weeks or months, but will not have a full lifespan, reach maximum size, or have the same behaviors they would if kept properly in brackish.<br><br>If you've ever been to a pet store with fish you've seen mollies before. They're a very common fish available almost anywhere, and they are completely happy to live in freshwater and saltwater tanks. They come from the gulf of mexico and live in estuaries (as the main post spoke about) so they have evolved the capacity to live in either environment.<br><br>Most mollies are sold in freshwater and kept in freshwater, but through a slow acclimatization process where you gradually increase the salt content of the water you can get them to full salt and drop them right into a saltwater tank. <br><br>Mollies are not the only fish capable of doing this, but it is not a common trait. The Colombian shark, actually a catfish, is another commonly sold &quot;freshwater&quot; fish that is actually a brackish fish and even prefers to live in full salt once it reaches adulthood. That said there are plenty of keepers that have adults in freshwater that are healthy.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>You are right on the money.  Here is a more elaborate response I gave to a similar question:<br>&gt;There are some fish species for which this is possible. In nature, these species are often found around river mouths near the ocean. Such fish move between the freshwater riverine environments and coastal marine environments, and often use estuaries as nursery areas for their young. Estuaries are unique environments found at river mouths where freshwater mixes with saltwater. Here, you have a wide range of salinities, so fish hoping to exploit these environments must be very flexible in their salt tolerance. The advantage of this is that estuaries tend be very productive (i.e., there is a lot of available food) and safe (there are many specialized plant species, which create hiding places); this makes them perfect for young, vulnerable fish.<br><br>&gt;In fish families where such adaptations are common, you will often also find species that are adapted to only fresh or saltwater, indicating that there was some slow &quot;acclimation&quot; process on an evolutionary scale. Additionally, within species, you can also find populations that are perfectly happy staying their entire lives in, e.g., freshwater. Steelhead and rainbow trout are the same species, but the former undergoes the traditional Pacific salmon life history, while the latter does everything (migrating, breeding, etc.) entirely in freshwater.</p>		</li>

			<p>I have a degree in Animal Ecology (Interp option) and this brought me back to my favorite class: Vertebrate Biology.  Dr. Adams couldn't have said it any better himself haha.  We covered biological systems of each type of vertebrate as a group (circulation in fishes, then herps, then birds, and finally mammals - so on and so forth).  I was very interested in this very concept and would have went into fisheries had I had more time.  The downside of being a non-traditional student I suppose, but none-the-less, I loved my time in NREM studies!!</p>		</li>

			<p>I'll give an all things being equal answer since there are so many species to consider... I have not exactly experimented with many fish by just plunking them into freshwater.  However, many saltwater fishes that are kept in marine aquariums are wild-caught and may bring with them any number of parasites.  For this reason, a lot of aquarium hobbyists will perform a &quot;freshwater dip&quot; on newly acquired fish in an attempt to kill as many potential parasites as possible.  It is not recommended to extend this beyond 10 minutes.  Now, exactly how long it would take to suffer irreversible damage and death... I'm not sure.  Most folks who spend a lot of money on a fish try to avoid this ;) But, beyond 10 minutes and they start to get really sluggish.</p>		</li>

			<p>I know that keeping salt water fish, you occasioanly give them a fresh water dip to clear parasites I guess?  Can you explain that practice and how a salty can be in fresh water for a little while, say 15 mintes?</p>		</li>

			<p>The fish are definitely stressed in such a situation.  The idea is that the parasites are also stressed and, being much smaller, will feel the full effects of such a treatment much more quickly and die.  The fish would eventually die as well, which is why freshwater dips are not recommended to last more than 10 minutes or so.  The fish can tolerate it for a while, but will become noticeably sluggish if left for too long.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is a great question. Salmon and their relatives have two different strategies for breeding.  In one, the fish invest nearly all of their energy in a single spawning migration, and die as a result (called 'semelparity').  The European brown trout you mentioned uses a different strategy. They invest much less energy into single spawning migrations, meaning fewer die as a result and can live to breed in a subsequent year (this is called 'iteroparity').  There are a number of factors that drive the evolution of these strategies. However, the result is that some fish species invest everything to have a ton of babies all at once, while others invest less energy per year and thus have fewer babies per year but the opportunity to breed multiple times.</p>		</li>
