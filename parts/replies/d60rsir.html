			<p>So as a follow up, does that mean bull sharks and salmon are brackish fish? </p>		</li>

			<p>Salmon that migrate between fresh and saltwater are called &quot;anadromous&quot;, meaning they begin their lives in freshwater, move into saltwater to grow as adults, and return to freshwater to reproduce (the opposite of this is called &quot;catadromous&quot;, and the most notable example is the freshwater eel).  Bullsharks are considered &quot;euryhaline&quot;, which means they can tolerate many different salinities.<br><br>Brackish water fish are often also euryhaline, but that term is usually used to identify fish species that specialize in living in brackish water environments for most of their lives.  Salmon exploit freshwater and saltwater at specific life stages, whereas bullsharks are generally marine, but are flexible enough to move into freshwater for extended periods of time.</p>		</li>

			<p>Hey thanks for the response. Sorry if it was a dumb question. I'm just an aquarium hobbyist, although I've never moved past keeping fresh water fish as anything else just seems daunting. </p>		</li>

			<p>Vague follow up. What is going on in the fish to make this possible? <a href="http://www.aquafeed.com/read-article.php?id=1883" target="_blank">http://www.aquafeed.com/read-article.php?id=1883</a></p>		</li>

			<p>These fish tolerate a wide range of salinities, so they can be raised in freshwater. This is a common adaptation among fishes found near coasts, as they will frequently feed in estuaries and rivers.</p>		</li>
