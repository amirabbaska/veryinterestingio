<p>Could you 'teach' salt/freshwater fish to live in their non-natural habitats by slowly acclimatizing them to lower/higher salt levels than normal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some fish species for which this is possible.  In nature, these species are often found around river mouths near the ocean.  Such fish move between the freshwater riverine environments and coastal marine environments, and often use estuaries as nursery areas for their young.  Estuaries are unique environments found at river mouths where freshwater mixes with saltwater.  Here, you have a wide range of salinities, so fish hoping to exploit these environments must be very flexible in their salt tolerance.  The advantage of this is that estuaries tend be very productive (i.e., there is a lot of available food) and safe (there are many specialized plant species, which create hiding places); this makes them perfect for young, vulnerable fish.</p>
<p>In fish families where such adaptations are common, you will often also find species that are adapted to only fresh or saltwater, indicating that there was some slow &quot;acclimation&quot; process on an evolutionary scale.  Additionally, within species, you can also find populations that are perfectly happy staying their entire lives in, e.g., freshwater.  Steelhead and rainbow trout are the same species, but the former undergoes the traditional Pacific salmon life history, while the latter does everything (migrating, breeding, etc.) entirely in freshwater.</p>
<p>Perhaps closer to your question, there are fish that you can slowly acclimate e.g, from fresh to saltwater in an aquarium.  Again, many of these are estuarine fishes that I mentioned before.  One very common aquarium fish is the &quot;molly&quot;, which is usually sold as a freshwater fish.  They are related to guppies and very easy to keep.  They also have a wide salt tolerance and, if done slowly and carefully, can be acclimated to live in a pretty high salinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have the articles, but I've heard about successful or partly successful attempts at this if you do it while they're still eggs, or fries. Which could potentially be an important development because the best fish to farm are usually freshwater fish because they tend to have bigger eggs than marine species, but in many places in the world freshwater is a limited resource.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious about landlocked salmon, it's my understanding that some salmon stay in freshwater sometimes even without being physically landlocked. Do these traits get passed on to their spawn, or is it just a one-off that is ignored, or something entirely different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP,  but yes, with hearty species at least. My science fair project in 7th grade involved converting freshwater guppies to saltwater. Started with freshwater,  and leaving control groups at each stage, I went in increments of 5 parts per thousand salinity up to 35ppt, the salinity of seawater.  It went quite well, but guppies are pretty sturdy fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biologist here, completely different kind. Thanks for the ELI5.</p>
<p>Followup question - what happens to the parasites of estuarine fish, or fish that migrate? Obviously there's a lot of variety but are there parasites that stick with them through a life cycle and undergo similar adaptation, or are just extraordinarily resilient? Or any interesting parasites that only infest during the freshwater or ocean phases?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very interesting question.  I wish I knew more about parasites. I would imagine that estuarine fishes also carry parasites that are similarly tolerant of a variety of salinites, while fully-marine and freshwater fishes likely have higher proportions of less-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Some anecdotes from keeping aquariums: some treatments for topical aquarium parasites involve changing salinity; e.g., marine fish are given freshwater dips, and freshwater fishes get low doses of salt in their water (although the latter has benefits for osmoregulation as well).</p>
<p>I guess this one is sort of a cop-out answer, but it's not really my area.  Sorry!</p></div>		</li>
