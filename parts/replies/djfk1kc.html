<p>Athletes sometimes go to train at high altitudes</p>

<p>I'd just point out that this is like 99% of athletes, at least for a few weeks during pre-season preparations, if not more. Many sleep in hyperbaric chambers to simulate the effect. Also many just take EPO.</p></div>		</li>

<p>*Youâ€‹ mean hypobaric.<br />
Athletes use both types. Hypobaric (low pressure) to simulate high altitude and stimulate RBC production. Hyperbaric (high pressure) to increase blood oxygen levels and speed recovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intriguing!</p>
<p>Question : if someone who is obese loses a lot of weight, will they then have more oxygen saturation, and if so, for how long?</p>
<p>If not, can you expand on what does happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what the intent is of your question but I think you might have phrased it wrong using oxygen saturation. Oxygen saturation is how many of your RBC's carry oxygen in percentages to the total amount of RBC. This doesnt get affected by losing weight. I think you are referring to how long you will have more RBC. Its pretty much the same duration as the turnover time for RBC. So about 120 days. </p></div>		</li>
