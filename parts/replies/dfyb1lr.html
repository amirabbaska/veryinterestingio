			<div class="markdown"><p>The aggressive radiation environment around gas giant inner moons would help sterilize things, but some bacteria really don't care and will gleefully grow in nuclear waste storage ponds or in uranium-bearing rocks. Some survive off radiation like plants use light.</p>
<p>Radiation creates oxygen when it separates ice, which poisons a lot of cool and weird bacteria but makes other mundane bacteria extremely happy to a point. I've read concerns that the oxygen levels in ice might be <em>too high.</em> Optimistically we might find something on  the ice volcanoes of Io or a comet geyser that's big enough and active enough to wiggle under a microscope, and I'll choose to believe that until somebody gets the budget to go check.</p></div>		</li>
