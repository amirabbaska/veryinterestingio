			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to scroll down way too far before someone touched on the very different nature of the 2 addictions. I'm a paramedic (EMT for you yanks) and while I am called to alcoholics who have had too much or too little to drink, barring STD's I doubt I will ever get called to a sex addict suffering from withdrawal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True story. Ive seen many of my clients have gran mal seizures from alcohol withdrawal. People dont realize that if alcohol was scheduled by the DEA, according to their criteria, alcohol would be a schedule one substance. Worse than heroine withdrawal. How often would you estimate you are responding to a situation where alcohol is involved?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For where I work, for every call we get for an alcoholic, more than half are withdrawal related, most times they do not realise it. In terms of percentage of work load overall, no idea, certainly less then other drugs that are out there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a certification granted from CAADE (California Association Alcohol/Drug Education) that enables me to be a SUD (substance use disorder, which is the clinical term for addiction) counselor. A counselor helps addicts through individual and group counseling, as well as all the aspects of case management (writing notes about the clients progress, providing referrals to social and government resources, etc.) Basically its like a degree that qualifies me to help people with addiction. It's obtained by completing a certain amount of units in addiction education classes, completing a set amount internship hours, and passing a state exam.  </p></div>		</li>
