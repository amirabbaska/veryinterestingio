			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonus: I answered another question here about why humans suck at sound directionality when underwater, I'll paste it here if you're interested:</p>
<p>If you're wondering why, it's because sound travels so fast underwater that it messes with our brain's ability to discern direction.</p>
<p>Much of the sound directionality we experience comes from what is called inter-aural time difference, which basically means the difference in time between a sound wave hitting each of our ears. If something is to your right, the sound wave hits your right ear a few milliseconds before your left ear, and this is a strong indication that it is on our right. There are other ways we discern direction too, but this is by far the most affective.</p>
<p>Underwater a sound wave travels nearly 5 times as fast, which means a sound wave coming from your right will hit your right then left ear much faster than it would in air. The inter-aural time difference is shrunk so much that our brain can no longer discern the direction! Combine this with the bone conduction and we basically can't locate sounds underwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... You just blew my mind. I can't say for certain but it at least logically makes sense. Flesh to water to flesh could be less detrimental than flesh to air.</p>
<p>Edit: interestingly the 'crack' sound itself is in fact a tiny pocket of air forming in the joint fluid, from dissolved gasses. This is why you often can't crack the same joint again immediately, you have to wait for the air bubble to redissolve into the joint fluid.</p></div>		</li>
