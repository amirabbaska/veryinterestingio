			<div class="markdown"><p>What if they're separated by a few hours. Ice cream 2 hours before dinner vs 2 hours after. Would that affect how well you digest it? I usually like ice cream after eating something acidic to neutralize what i just ate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key is that you have to eat something acidic after that to get the sweetness of the ice cream out of your mouth. Then more ice cream to neutralize the acid. And the process continues until you eventually have to sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the med. Some have to be taken shortly before a meal, some shortly after, some it doesn't matter. Where the advice is to take them after a meal it's often because they're harsh on the stomach. Others work better on an empty stomach. Read the instructions and follow them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this fact that certain meds need to be taken at different times with respect to eating essentially undercuts OP's statement that the order of eating different foods has almost no effect on nutrition/absorption.  For example, OP completely ignored the fact that small amounts of aspirin, other non-steroidal anti-infammatory drugs, and ethanol can get absorbed in the stomach.  So if you start dinner with a couple shots, then it'll start getting into your bloodstream and affect the rest of your digestion of the rest of your meal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meds mainly rely on two things for absorption,  the acidity of the contents of the stomach  (more acidic at meal times) and the amount of fat in the stomach. The latter only affects a few meds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't a complete answer.</p>
<p>Different foods affect satiety in different ways.</p>
<p>If you eat something high in fiber before you dig into a bag of candy, you'll likely eat less candy than if you ordered your meal the other way round.</p>
<p>This might not strictly count as 'affecting nutrition' but it certainly deserves a mention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question was if there was any nutritional diffrence; hence No it does not. A bag of candy is still a bag of candy even if you eat fibers first. But you are correct. It would affect diffrently, but not the nutrition.</p></div>		</li>
