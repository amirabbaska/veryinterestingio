			<div class="markdown"><p>On an absolute, no caveats basis, yes as the broad nature of the question would necessitate the comparison between pathological conditions and healthy conditions.  But that isn't really transferable to real world situations.</p>
<p>In real world situations, shivering doesn't require your muscles to contract anywhere near the peak contraction velocity.  That is, shivering requires an exertion significantly below someones maximum strength.  Since maximum strength doesn't enter into the equation, muscle mass wouldn't really have a significant impact.  That being said, pathological muscle wasting (IE catechexia) could potentially inhibit the ability to shiver, depending on severity of the condition.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having more muscle mass would increase heat production for other reasons too. Just by being larger your basal metabolic rate goes up, and metabolism creates a little heat. You also decrease your surface area to volume ratio, making you a smidge better at retaining heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep!  It's (one of the reasons) why some Arctic and sub-Arctic indigenous peoples can have extremely high-calorie diets without significant obesity problems, for example.  </p></div>		</li>
