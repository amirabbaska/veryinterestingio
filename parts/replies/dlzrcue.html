<p>We've discovered all the naturally occurring elements.</p>

<p>To add a bit, what made the Periodic Table such a valuable tool back in the day was its ability to <em>predict</em> what properties undiscovered elements would have.  Made it easier for scientists to find those elements, since they could ignore energy levels, atomic weights, etc., that were far outside of the predicted values.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The newest artificial elements require bombardment of already very unstable artificial elements. Supernovae definitely have the energy to create them, but the sequence of collisions required is so unlikely that it probably never happened. Haven't done the math though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need very particular nuclear reactions at very particular energies to produce the superheavy elements at any reasonable yield.</p>
<p>These perfect conditions are not the kind that you'd expect to find in nature. However using an accelerator, we can optimize the probability of producing a superheavy species.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In particle accelerators. Can you rule out that huge neutron fluxes (as in supernovae) work?</p></div>		</li>
