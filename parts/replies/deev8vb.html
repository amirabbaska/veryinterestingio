			<div class="markdown"><p>In the country I live in, you need to have successfully studied psychology (or medicine, i guess) to be allowed to buy psychological tests (not only IQ, but personality-tests, etc.).</p>
<p>So if you want to take an IQ-test, you should probably visit a psychologist.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is absolutely bizarre. What's the reasoning for requiring a degree to buy an IQ test?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of websites but i doubt they are accurate :/ one gave me an IQ of 141 first try. Seems a bit high, like I'm smart but I think it's just a site that over simplified it too much </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's what I suspected as well. I was hoping /u/msfrizzle319 could suggest a site/company that is more reputable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect those websites consistently give out &quot;genius&quot;-level scores to everyone. I've never met anyone who took an online IQ test who scored <em>under</em> 140, yet some of those people clearly aren't within miles of that figure. But, everyone likes to be told they're a genius, and it keeps people hitting those websites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mensa could be a place for you to start as you would be able to take a test and determine if you were in the top two percentile. Do a Google find their webpage and look for the tab that relates to taking the test. Many Mensa sites will also have a practice test that you can take. If it's not on that page you can go to Mensa international and there is a test you can take there, for practice purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious, can you explain how language impairments or being illiterate affects IQ score?</p>
<p>I used to score in the mildly retarded range as a kid and my parents always refused to believe the score was accurate and it did go up as I got older and then I got a 99 in 5th grade while I got 83 in 4th grade. My dad said it was because I couldn't talk well and I have read that even autistic people will score lower too. Even my clinical psychologist who tested my overall IQ score at 83 thought the score wasn't accurate because I scored higher in other areas. </p>
<p>Also my mom used to work with a student who was illiterate and he also got a low IQ score too so everyone thought he wasn't smart but my mother refused to believe it and taught him to read. Then he was reading at the 3rd grade level by the end of the school year. That kid learned quickly and it made his mother cry because she didn't know he was illiterate. She had believed everyone else about her son. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow SP; IQ tests have also grown in their accuracy over the years, as the tests, subtests, and testing items are constantly being refined to better represent how we measure intelligence. For example, the newest WISC now evaluates fluid reasoning skills, which wasn't available on any of the previous versions. Point being, as our understanding of these things grow/changes, so does the accuracy with which we measure them.</p></div>		</li>
