			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  In some cases, rate of change might imply specifically with respect to time, but I've seen people get confused when on person assumes rate of change is with respect to time and another assumes otherwise.  So I certainly wouldn't count on that usage being consistent, and it's always a good idea to say &quot;with respect to time&quot; if  that's what you mean or &quot;with respect to x&quot; if that's what you mean, just like u/Midtek did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer really gets into semantics. The scope (or range) of the term &quot;rate of change of a function&quot; is ambiguous.  To be a rate, it has to be computed over some interval; but it could be a single value computed over a single interval. Differentiation is the computation of the rate of change as function where the interval over which the rate is computed is limited to zero.  This is the basic first less of basic calculus: first you learn computing limits. Then you apply computing limits to the rate of change of functions. And, voila', you have differentiation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I have said many time in this post, &quot;rate of change&quot; always properly means &quot;instantaneous rate of change&quot;. If you are talking about &quot;the rate of change over an interval&quot; (which isn't a precise term), you almost certainly mean the &quot;average rate of change&quot; over that interval. the qualifier &quot;average&quot; is required. The derivative (or simply, rate of change) of a function is computed as a limit of certain average rates of change.</p>
<p>Again, just because there are laymen and students and teachers who are sloppy about this language and get it wrong doesn't mean that the language isn't actually precise. &quot;Rate of change&quot; unambiguously means &quot;instantaneous rate of change&quot; just as something like &quot;velocity&quot; means &quot;instantaneous velocity&quot;. That's all.</p></div>		</li>
