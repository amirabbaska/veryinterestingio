<p>Bees have individual brains, and they work well together, but they don't share thoughts telepathically or anything like that.</p>
<p>Also, individual bees are <em>very</em> intelligent by insect standards, and are quite capable of <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00891068/document" target="_blank">learning</a> and <a href="https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/young-naturalist-awards/winning-essays2/2011-winning-essays/memory-retention-in-landscape-learning-of-honeybees-apis-mellifera/" target="_blank">memorizing</a> new things, so they do &quot;know&quot; some things.</p>
<p>Also also, there's really no such thing as a &quot;soldier&quot; bee; some bees have duties to guard the hive, but they're not biologically different from every other worker bee.</p></div>		</li>

Examples would be construction of the hive, coordinated de fence and such things.
I wasn't referring to any kind of telepathic abilities, sorry if that was unclear.</p>
<p>As for the &quot;knowing&quot; part, it completely depends on how you choose to define that word.
If you choose to define knowing simply by the act of applying knowledge, then bees certainly know things.
In the same way that the computer Deep Blue knew how to beat the world champion of chess.
It brute forced all available options and chose to apply those that worked.</p>
<p>To me the word &quot;know&quot; is closely tied to sentience. You can't know something without being aware of both it and yourself.</p>
<p>As to the differences between the bees of a hive, I was referring to the roles that they have within it, rather to any biological ones. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Fair enough, but humans behave the same way- do we share a collective intelligence as well? </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Personally, I don't think this is the most effective way to think of animal knowledge, because it's really impossible to define and measure. While it may be easy to say for some animals, like dolphins or sea sponges, it's impossible to know how &quot;aware&quot; bees are. We know, and can measure via experimentation, the fact that bees can memorize things, learn new things, teach things to other bees, communicate with each other, and make individual decisions. Whether they have some level of self-awareness or understanding of their existence is (while I think likely) currently impossible to determine. How could you possibly determine it?</p>
<p>If it's impossible to know one way or another, it seems like a meaningless definition. </p>

<p>Ok, fair enough</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of that hunter x hunter anime where the chimera ants starting eating humans and evolved selfawareness and basically caused conflict within the colony and enevitably resulted in their failure due to the ant king's will to survive combined with the human lust for power, among other human emotions that ultimately contradict the nature of an ant.</p></div>		</li>
