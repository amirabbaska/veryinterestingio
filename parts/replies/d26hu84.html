			<div class="markdown"><p>Shouldn't it travel backwards even if there were no slipstream? If we take the original position of the bullet to be where the chamber of the gun is located before it's fired, wouldn't it end up slightly displaced in the direction of the car's travel? The car is moving at the bullet's final velocity to begin with, but the bullet needs time to attain that velocity. There will be a period of time when the car is traveling faster than the bullet, and so it will continue to move in the direction that the car for that interval.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing that matters is the bullet's speed at the muzzle.  Up until that point the gun, and even the expanding gases inside the bore, have 0 velocity relative to the car.  From a perspective relative to the ground, the bullet would be slowing down as it travels down the bore.</p>
<p>The most apt analogy I can think of is like in <em>The Martian</em>, when they needed to use the force of explosive decompression to slow down their ship.</p>
<p>If we think of the bullet as the space ship in that situation, then the expanding gases inside the bore would be the equivalent of the explosive depcompression. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But between the time of firing the gun and the point that the bullet reaches the end of the muzzle, the bullet has been going slower than the car. Otherwise it wouldn't travel to the end of the muzzle.  </p>
<p>But it's still travelling faster than zero relative to outside the car. When it leaves the muzzle, then it starts traveling at zero relative to outside the car. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand that same low pressure area allows a higher muzzle velocity, if the car's speed doesn't account fot that it would initially move forwards in fact, then it would decelerate to some point but it's hard to tell if it would come to move backwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge, air pressure has very little effect on muzzle velocity.  It has a large effect on drag, however.</p></div>		</li>
