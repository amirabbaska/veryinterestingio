			<div class="markdown"><p>They wanted to test the devices as weapons.  </p>
<p>They knew that the atomic bomb was a huge future superweapon, but they still didn't really understand how well it would work.  </p>
<p>The first nuclear test was with an implosion-type plutonium device.  A similar device was housed in Fat Man.  The implosion-type device was far more intricate, and so they decided that if they were only gonna have one test, this is the one they would do.</p>
<p>Little Boy was comparatively simple.  It was essentially a cannon that fired a uranium slug into another piece of uranium in order to make the uranium reach a critical mass.  This is as opposed to the implosion-type device, which needed to be detonated so that the uranium collapsed into the exact needed density at the exact right moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a third bomb (actually the fourth bomb) but it was unnamed and unused.</p>
<p>'Gadget' was the first bomb - plutonium implosion core - that was the Trinity test bomb.  Little Boy on Hiroshima was the more reliable, and so first offensive bomb. Then Fat Man, another plutonium implosion on Nagasaki.  The fourth was shaped such that it was almost certainly another plutonium core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was part of the rationale for dropping two bombs in rapid succession: to fool the Japanese into thinking that the Americans were capable of mass-producing the bomb, or already had inventory.  According to the Wikipedia, initial production would've actually been a bomb <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project#Bombings" target="_blank">every week and a half or so</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give people a sense of the scale of the undertaking of the enrichment operation, I give you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-25" target="_blank">K-25</a>.  It was an absolutely ludicrous-scale project.  Oak Ridge, TN went from a town of 3,000 people to a city of 70,000 by the end of WWII, most of them dedicated to producing enriched uranium.  Supposedly by the end of the war, Oak Ridge was consuming 1/7th of all the electrical power being produced in the US.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, it's not that Plutonium is easier to enrich.
Plutonium is a man made element that is synthesised from Uranium 238. </p>
<p>It's easier to make the Plutonium from U238 than it is to enrich U235 from U238.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make Plutonium by bombarding ^(238)U with neutrons. Then you separate it out from the uranium. Since it's a different chemical, it's pretty easy to do that step. I'm not sure whether or not it counts as &quot;enriching&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
