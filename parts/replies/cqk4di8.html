<p>This is a great illustration of the concept 'the more treatments there are for a condition, the less likely any of them will work'</p>
<p>There are literally hundreds of old wives tales from around the world about trying to get a boy or a girl. Women having been trying to control the gender of their kids throughout history. If there was a practical way to successfully do it, the old wives would have found it years ago, and there would be 1 successful way, instead of thousands of unsuccessful ones.</p></div>		</li>
