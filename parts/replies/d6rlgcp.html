			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that one of the other main points is that the vast amount we learn throughout our lives is completely useless if we only wanted to &quot;survive&quot;.  </p>
<p>A dog for instance really only learns to hunt from play fighting with other dogs.  </p>
<p>I imagine that once these skills are learned there isn't much else that the dog has to learn.  </p>
<p>It isn't required that a dog know how to &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;stay&quot;.  That only helps them in a human world.  </p>
<p>Similarly, once a human learns to hunt and eat, which can be done fairly young if it is emphasized, he will survive pretty well.  Making shelter etc will come with practice.</p>
<p>There is no need to learn French or math or astronomy if you are living on a desert island for example. </p>
<p>The thing that makes humans human however is that we learn these things anyway, and that we use the information we learn to make new information and create new things.  Other animals don't do this.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. Our brains are so complex, even from birth, that the sheer capacity for growth is staggering when you take a step back and analyze it like you did. Tying survival to creative instinct is a great perspective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.</p>
<p>Basically, the limits on human brain size are the dimensions of the female pelvis.</p></div>		</li>
