			<div class="markdown"><p>When we say the universe is &quot;expanding&quot;, do we mean to say that it is confined to a finite space that's &quot;getting bigger&quot; and that there is a defined limit to &quot;traversable volume&quot; by any 3 dimensional object? or simply that everything that is in existence is merely traveling farther away from each other in an infinite space?</p></div>		</li>
