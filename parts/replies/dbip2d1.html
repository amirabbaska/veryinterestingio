			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, of course teaching vs professional sports are two very different things, but I think I see your point.  It's also very hard to quantify exactly how much better one teacher is over another one.  I mean, grades are one thing, but it's what the students actually learn and put to use in their later school and work careers that would of course be impossible to actually measure.  And as others have said, teachers these days seems like they only have time to &quot;teach for the test&quot; to secure funding and grants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, something people have to take into consideration, especially when it comes to teaching is to not determine whether they did a good job or not based on their student's standardized test scores. It may sound crazy, but hopefully it makes more sense as you read. Take a poor school district like Philadelphia, I grew up in this school district and I'm going to teach in it. Depending on what part of the city you're in ALL your students may come from low income families who only have one parent working. It takes a village to raise a child, not just one parent and one teacher. Learning obviously doesn't only take place in school. Parents should try to be involved in their child's education as much as possible because it will only serve to benefit them. However, when your mom/dad is working several jobs to put food on the table, other more important things take priority. They won't have time to review their child's homework with them, read to them or be involved in their education. These are the types of things that teachers can't help with. There's only so much a teacher can do with the 8 hours they have with this child. They can't make sure the student gets enough sleep or food before they get to school. A tired starving student couldn't care less about education when their basic needs aren't being met. In turn, their grades don't have high chances of being great and you can't fault a teacher for factors that are out of their hand. </p>
<p>Edit: I know you put that comment out there, so that we can come up with different ways to measure they're doing a good job or not. I just wanted to hopefully prevent any, &quot;Let's just determine whether a teacher is good or not by using standardized test scores!&quot; comments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree. Unfortunately I think it's impossible to know a great teacher from a poor teacher by simple metrics, which is here my thought falls apart. These aren't batting averages after all!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You hit the nail on the head. It's hard to measure how much more of an impact teacher A had compared to teacher B. Because of this, neither teacher is in a position of strength the demand a higher salary, so neither of them get a raise.</p>
<p>In fact standardized tests, the only way to measure a teacher against their peers, are largely fought against by teaching unions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still don't have a solid opinion on them either way. Even if they were perfect and accepted at measuring teachers it may be detrimental to the children. Teaching is unlike most other capitalistic endeavors where value can more readily be calculated against a bottom line. No easy answers that's for sure. Cheers!</p></div>		</li>
