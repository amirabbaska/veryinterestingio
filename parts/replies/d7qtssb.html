			<div class="markdown"><p>First, great write up.</p>
<p>I can sort of follow how a computer can understand binary. Where I have trouble is how the computer understands a language. Is there a layer between the computer and the language that translates everything into binary? Where does this layer sit? How does the translation work? From your example - How would a set of on/off switches understand what a car is in the first place?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, the layer you're talking about is basically where the compiler comes in. It changes all of the C code into binary for the computer to understand (more specifically, it uses the C code to create a new binary program). In our case, it's nice to call it a &quot;car&quot; in the code so that we understand what's going on. We take our program and compile it so that now it's a program that the computer will know how to run. At this point the &quot;car&quot; identifier becomes a series of 0s and 1s that the program will keep track of.</p>
<p>For that last question... One thing I left out in the C++ example was the definition of the car object. That's something that programmers have to define for the computer, since they don't know automatically know what a car is. So, for a really simple example, imagine this...</p>
<pre><code>class StandardCar {
    int gas, miles;

    void accelerate (int);
    void turnwheels (int);
    void brake (void);
    void startup (void);
    void shutdown (void);
};</code></pre>
<p>This is the blueprint. Later, in your program, you would create an object called &quot;car&quot; that draws on this &quot;StandardCar&quot; blueprint. The first part, with gas and miles, is a place where we're going to store information on the gas and miles. The next five lines are functions (that we'd also have to define later) that show how the program will interact with the car, by accelerating a certain amount, turning the wheels a certain amount, and then braking, starting up and shutting down. It's through this programming that the computer ends up understanding not so much what a car is, but rather how we want to interact with it. We'd obviously need to pack more information into the &quot;StandardCar&quot; blueprint to make it function better, such as having data on the speed or the engine temperature, or else having functions like reversing or signalling.</p>
<p>That make sense? Throughout all this, the computer doesn't really need to know what a car is, it just needs to know how we want to interact with it. Turn the steering wheel, and it triggers the &quot;turnwheels&quot; function. Press the brake, and it triggers the &quot;brake&quot; function. If your display is constantly giving you information on the speed, gas, miles, etc. then it can ask the program to get that information, which the program can store for it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That said, Objective C became very popular in the projects that adopted it, so it got its own foothold.</p>

<p>Don't you think NeXT computer corp and it's successor Apple had a huge influence on the popularity of this language?  I mean without Apple supporting this language, I wonder if Obj-C would even be in the conversation today.</p></div>		</li>
