			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong but since paint isn’t actually radiating the color, but instead it’s absorbing all other colors (eg red paint absorbs all colors but red, and reflects the red away from it), if you mix the colors together, they’re actually absorbing all of the colors which reflects nothing, hence the black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s two types of color mixing. Additive mixing aka RGB is used for computer screens and things that emit light. Where as other color modes use subtractive color mixing. That’s where you get the CMY for prints and paint (Cyan Magenta Yellow).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of a Brown Dwarf, yes, but that's because it's too <em>cold,</em> not because it's too <em>hot.</em> Even then, some brown dwarfs are still hot enough to emit some visible light, and all Red Dwarfs are hot enough to do that (they're called &quot;Red&quot; Dwarfs for a reason).</p>
<p>And even if the brown dwarf isn't emitting any light, it might be reflecting light, so it wouldn't appear black to us. The inner planets of the Solar System look like bright points of light in the sky to us, and they're  way colder than a Brown Dwarf is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does the sun reflect X-rays at wavelengths where it does not produce them? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But they are close to a star emmitting light.  There is a brown dwarf out there less than 50C. I am sure there would be some light reflected from stars if you were really close, but if not, you wouldn't see it.  Black holes are the closet thing I can think of, but they are only emmitting Hawking radiation and not uv.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it would depend on your definition of &quot;so hot that&quot; :-). If you take it to mean &quot;of a temperature such that...&quot; then I suppose you'd be right. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf" target="_blank">Brown dwarf Wikipedia page</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WISE 1828+2650, was, as of August 2011, the record holder for the coldest brown dwarf – emitting no visible light at all</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but those are relatively “cool” compared to other stars, the opposite of the “so hot” condition OP was asking about. Many things in space that appear black might be radiating some infrared.</p></div>		</li>
