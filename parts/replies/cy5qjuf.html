<p>Isn't combustion a thermodynamically irreversible process, thus making recovering books from a burnt library impossible, even theoretically?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>.. I think that was the poster's point. :)</p>
<p>Although I would imagine it's possible to design a book or at least as sheet of papyrus that has a higher chance of recovering information after burning.  Say if you used a special kind of ink that contained iron and the pages were thick so they didn't crumble easily (but instead left behind a crumpled sheet of black carbon when burned), you might be able to reconstruct what was written on the pages from the little bits of iron left stuck to the charred carbon sheets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry replying late, just got on reddit after a long day. Irreversibility in classical statistical mechanics is not <em>exact</em> - even the Second Law of Thermodynamics is false on long enough timescales due to the Poincare recurrence theorem, but for practical processes (within the lifetime of the universe) the 2nd Law is true.
<em>Theoretically</em> speaking, all the zillions of chemical reactions that take place when the library is burnt down could be reversed (assuming all the products of the burning, the ashes, the fumes etc have been captured). Of course it is a practical impossibility.</p>
<p>In Quantum Mechanics reversibility of physical processes is guaranteed by unitarity - conservation of probability (or information) essentially. (There is  the problem of &quot;wave-function&quot; collapse which is non-unitary (and, in general, non-reversible) - but I assume that is not relevant here). But just like in the classical case, there is not a practical way to exactly reverse most macroscopic processes, even small ones, never mind Black-hole evaporation!</p></div>		</li>
