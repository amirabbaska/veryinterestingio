			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for sharing! It sounds like the key difference here is housing. You were able to buy a small house for $230k in today's dollars, it nearly doubled in value in 8 years, and that infusion of cash let you upgrade to a nicer neighborhood without taking on crippling debt. These days, 1000 sq ft in Oakland is at least $400k, and it only goes up from there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is such an important thing to note in my opinion. I keep seeing posts about young adults drowning in college debt and over and over again I just hear &quot;well they should have made a better decision.&quot;
Like an 18 year old who has heard their entire life that a college degree is THE ticket to a good life is going to critically think about whether or not college is worth it for them??</p>
<p>Same thing happened when so many folks lost their homes during the great recession. You kept hearing the chorus of &quot;oh they should have know they couldn't actually afford that house.&quot; When a paid professional who appears smart and by any account is &quot;legitimate&quot; tells you you can afford a mortgage you're probably going to believe them, even if you do your own research! </p>
<p>These are just people following the rules that were in place and getting fucked for it. And all I seem to hear is that they should have planned ahead better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rules don't say, &quot;someone being paid as a professional has your best interests at heart.&quot;  They should say, &quot;trust no one blindly, especially when money is involved.&quot; Some legitimate and seemingly knowledgeable paid professional might be incentivized to convince you by any means necessary to take a certain course of action, like stock brokers during the dot com boom.</p>
<p>Rather than diversify investments and build a safety net of cash, people leveraged two salaries and dumped them into real estate.  In their ignorance and hubris, they believed that it was possible for a very specific market to trend upward forever, and that nothing bad could ever happen to them while they placed themselves in an enormouslyâ€‹ risky situation for the long term.</p>
<p>Not learning about wise investing practices and financial theories such as risk when buying a home is like showing up to work at the business factory and saying, &quot;I'm not a computer person.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ah perfect example of what I'm talking about. 7 million people lost their homes in the recession. Seems like maybe an institutional problem rather than a personal problem to me. </p></div>		</li>
