			<div class="markdown"><p>The thermometer in my work Subaru only reads as low as - 30C. So I figure that means Subaru didn't do much planning on how their cars would work below - 30C. Hence why when it gets really cold the doors won't latch, displays don't work, engine won't idle consistently, and the thing sounds like it's rattling itself apart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Real Talk: why have them?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm a luddite, but on the last car I owned (91 Corolla) I could adjust everything on that car without taking my eyes off the road. From adjusting the seat, to tuning the radio - I could do it all.</p>
<p>I use a car sharing system that uses Priuseseseses and every time I want to do more than change the radio station I have to deal with the touch screen.</p>
<p>I'm not legally allowed to use my phone while driving, but I'm allowed to use an unfamiliar phone that's built into the car I'm driving. That makes no sense to me at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer: because it sells cars. Now that touch-based infotainment systems are common, cars that don't have them are seen by buyers as being inferior or old fashioned.</p>
<p>Touch screens can be done well in cars and can be just as easy to use and eyes-off as mechanical interfaces. Tesla-like giant car iPads are... not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I hate touch screens and the electro-gadget wizardry of modern vehicles. Just give me analog radio controls, real buttons, switches and knobs. I don't want automatic climate control, I just end up overriding the auto function anyway. Give me a car that is reliable but won't cost an arm and a leg to fix when something breaks. I do understand why things are like this though, competition is forcing everyone to try to innovate, do something new, something better. It won't be long before self driving vehicles are ubiquitous. Not looking forward to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't buy this, sure car computers do have specific requirements but it's not crazy. These cars are 10s of thousands of dollars, they could literally buy an Android tablet and USB to the car computer at that price. I think it comes down to the lack of innovation in the car industry. They aren't thinking of &quot;what is best for users&quot; their thinking &quot;how can we make our old model better&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like you’re overstating the difficulty a bit.</p>
<p>For at least the last five years, you’ve been able to plug an iPhone into a boring old car stereo system. It can both charge the phone, play audio, and display metadata.</p>
<p>20 years ago, you could plug a Discman into any car’s 12v system. I’m travelling right now, and I didn’t need to buy a 240v -&gt; 120v converter because it’s cheaper for manufacturers to just build that into their hardware than make different versions for different markets. If the power goes out, I’m not going to notice because batteries.</p>
<p>For sending signals to the air conditioning or whatever, Arduinos can do that. </p>
<p>In a world where all that is common and affordable and seamless, it shouldn’t be that hard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the point is, would your Discman last when attached to the console of a car for 10+ years? Is it certified to not smash into a million sharp pieces or catch fire in an auto accident?</p>
<p>The problems aren't directly technology ones, but it means car makers can't just bolt an off-the-shelf unit into a car and call it a day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Touch screens that can handle temperatures swings like that aren't known for their responsiveness, and are not cheap to boot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Visual responsiveness of a touch screen has (almost) nothing to do with the touch screen, itself. The only thing that affects that kind of responsiveness is processing speed.</p>
<p>Maybe true that more durable processors are slower, but it has nothing to do with the screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it comes down to resistive vs capacitive? I’ve never met a resistive touchscreen that didn’t look or feel like shit compared to even the cheapest capacitive touchscreens. But perhaps resistive has other advantages beyond lower cost? Humidity comes to mind as something that could mess up a capacitive touchscreen more readily than a resistive one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Resistive touch screens are far, far more durable. That's the main advantage of them. They get used a lot in situations where having a silky-smooth response isn't necessary (like ATMs).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, none of the other answers I see being upvoted are coming from senior engineers.</p>
<p>The main reason is development/BOM costs. You're selling a car first, the entertainment center nowhere near second. It needs to function and have 'features.' 99.9% of people aren't going to buy one car over the other due to the resistive vs capacitive touch screen. They're likely looking at cost, want a specific model due to appearance, performance, reliability, near the end of the list is features, and at the bottom of that list is how 'modern' the electronics in the system are. </p></div>		</li>
