			<div class="markdown"><p>Protons and neutrons <em>are</em> hadrons, and can most certainly exist in free space. Quarks are what make up hadrons, and to date they have never been observed &quot;free&quot;, only confined with other quarks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protons and neutrons <em>are</em> hadrons. Other hadrons, like pions, do exist in nature, but they decay very quickly. An example is that high-energy cosmic ray spallation reactions in the atmosphere generate showers of pions, photons, etc. that all travel down towards the Earth. The pions don’t love long enough to make it to the surface of the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A single neutron (which is also a hadron) can exist in free form, but it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_neutron_decay" target="_blank">decays</a> into proton, electron and antineutrino after 10 minutes by average.</p>
<p>A single proton (which is also a hadron as mentioned before) can exist in free form and is considered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydron_(chemistry)" target="_blank">chemistry</a>. Protons <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay" target="_blank">may or may not decay</a>, but if they do, then it's on timescales way beyond the age of the universe.</p></div>		</li>
