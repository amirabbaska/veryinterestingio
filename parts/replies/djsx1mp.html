			<div class="markdown"><p>Who knows?  Though in my opinion it is probably a cascade of many factors.  Most chronically ill children have increased metabolic demands.  Many have conditions that interfere with adequate nutrition, either from apatite suppression or other symptoms.  Then there is the impact of the disease on metabolic efficiency ... kidney diseases, for example, reduce the efficiency of translating consumed food into protein.  Then on top of all that there is the impact of the disease upon the hormonal growth regulatory infrastructure of the body.  And finally there is the impact of treatment ... steroids, for example, profoundly affect how the body adds mass.  So ... too many currents here to pull one out and say it is the most important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunologist here. I doubt it. Osteoblast differentiation is not dictated by just one or two cytokines. I imagine it's far more complex and involves a combination of chemokine mediated migration to bone marrow niche factors in osteoblast precursors.</p></div>		</li>
