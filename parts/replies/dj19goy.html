			<div class="markdown"><p>It's distinctive and easily recognizable, which is something good flags are. It's historical, since it's the same flag the Imperial Japanese Navy flew for about as long as there was an Imperial Japanese Navy, and serves as a link from that history to the JMSDF. And since the Navy was responsible for far fewer war crimes than the Army, its flag wasn't anywhere near as tainted and carries fewer negative connotations.</p></div>		</li>
