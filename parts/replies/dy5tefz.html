</blockquote>
<p>Yes , that is correct.</p>
<p>Each tooth in your mouth is an organ in and of itself. The criteria for what exactly defines an organ is somewhat in debate at this time, but it is generally accepted to be an aglomeration of differentiated sets of tissue working in synergy to accomplish a specific function. Teeth more than fill that criteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe teeth do, but is it really common to claim that an individual tooth passes that heuristic?</p>
<p>By that definition every lymph node is definitely its own organ as would be each fingernail or hair follicle.</p>
<p>Generally an organ can be somewhat heterogeneously differentiated (ie ducts within the liver), so would every finger be an organ? How bout the jaw? Or hands?</p>
<p>The skin is often referred to as the largest organ. But if every patch of skin that acts a bit differently (for example scalp, face, palms all have different patterns of hair growth) is its own organ, is the skin one large organ or a set of interconnected smaller ones? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sourced from embryonic defects caused by a phenotype anomaly.</p>
<p>Not really derived from the tooth, nor is it the tooth's &quot;fault&quot; if you want to say it like that. Not to mention that still wouldn't be &quot;dental cancer&quot;. Specifically, ameloblasts are notably NOT part of the tooth, they are the creators of a  part of the tooth during the process of amelogenesis which forms the enamel but that is a very specific function.</p>
<p>An ameloblastoma is not &quot;dental cancer&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontogenic_tumor" target="_blank">Odontogenic tumours</a> are a problem in impoverished nations with poor dental hygiene, unclean water, and a population without access to dental care. Often these tumours will be benign, so they won't spread to other areas like cancer cells, but they will eventually grow so big that they result in the sufferer either slowly suffocating as the tumour compresses their airway, or slowly starving because they can no longer eat. These people are also often ostracised from their communities because of their facial disfigurement. A problem that would just result in a pulled tooth in the developed world can cause a person to have a shortened life of pain and suffering in the developing world simply because they cannot access basic healthcare. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameloblastoma" target="_blank">Ameloblastoma</a> is an example of a benign or cancerous tumour that arises from the teeth, specifically the cells constituting your enamel. Enamel is a constantly regenerating tissue so it can be prone to tumours, but typically if you brush your teeth regularly and don't suffer from untreated dental abscesses etc. then the defective cells are removed before they can cause serious problems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got me on that one, but I don't really consider those to be &quot;cancer deriving from teeth&quot;  as I outlined or at least as I intended to outline... these are  phenotype anomaly occurring during the embryonic phase which cause a neoplasic response that then has the potential to become malignant. The term &quot;odontogenic tumor&quot; is a huge misnomer because they are not caused, created or otherwise produced by the teeth themselves.</p>
<p>That is to say, it does not fall within what I outlined, but it is a good example and you are right to bring it up. It is very important to note that none of those are actually deriving from the tooth but rather are continued damage caused by embryonic incidents.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No. That is not only false but wildly inaccurate.</p>
<p>An ameloblastoma is a neoplasic imperfection that occurs during amelogenesis or after imperfect amelogenesis happens. This isn't something that &quot;arises from the teeth&quot;, this is something that is already present prior to birth , deriving from something else entirely, that it affects a tooth is not the same as to say that it arises from a tooth. This distinction is very important because it is physiologically impossible for a growth to derive from the enamel matrix. It literally cannot occur.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>specifically the cells constituting your enamel. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The what...?</p>
<p>The enamel is <strong>not</strong> constituted by cells. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/enamel" target="_blank">It is constituted by a matrix of hydroxiapatite</a>  <em>Mature enamel is composed of 95–97% carbonated HA by weight with less than 1% organic material.</em>. There is no division or metabolic process here for a neoplastic incident to occur, doubly so because there is no innervation or irrigation to sustain it. </p>
<p>Point being, you are seriously wrong.</p>
<p>You are very wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Very wrong&quot; is a stretch - we're picking at details at this point. The point I was making is just that there are many tumours which can arise from the teeth or surrounding tissues; if you are going to consider teeth an organ then the odontogenic epithelium (where Ameloblastoma <em>actually</em> arises, apparently) must surely be one of the tissues which constitute that organ. Either way... It's all splitting hairs. I don't claim to be an expert on teeth or enamel or whatever, and we've already crossed the line of detail at which the average redditor loses interest.</p>
<p>Also, there's a whole ton of different congenital cancers. You can't discount these just because they happen during early development. Anyway, it really doesn't matter. </p></div>		</li>
