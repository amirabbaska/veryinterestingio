			<p>I know how to sharpen a knife - learned working in a fish factory where having a sharp knife was crucial. It's just that having something nice and sharp, like atom size sharp, would've been pretty damn cool.</p>		</li>

			<p>As mentioned, obsidian is brittle.<br><br>Might be nice having a very sharp blade when working with meat and what not.<br><br>You'd have to be <em>very</em> vigilant, and discard food wholesale if there was any sign of chipping. Lest, you know, little bits of very small ultra-sharp blade start working through your &quot;meat and what not&quot; from the inside.</p>		</li>

			<p>They used to be used to clean and carve animals in the field. They're easy to sharpen without tools other than a rock, and they hold an edge for a long time.<br><br>But they splinter and sharpening them means you remove significant chunks.<br><br>A group of archaeologists tested them out and found they were very good for field dressing kills. But for everyday use? Bad idea.</p>		</li>

			<p>No.  They are brittle and little chunks of it will break easily.  You have slivers of that shit in your food and it'll mess you up from the inside.</p>		</li>
