<p>(Sorry, off topic, ignore if inappropriate). This is one element of probability I have trouble getting. You say that the odds of getting 10 heads in a row is 0.1%. But every time you square up to a coin toss, your chance of winning is 50%. Every time. Irrespective of the previous results. So the odds of getting heads once is 50%. The odds of getting heads after 10 heads is also 50%. Where does 0.1% come from? </p></div>		</li>

0.5^10 =0,0009765625 ~ 0.001=0.1%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What of the gamblers fallacy then, that the longer a series of heads lasts, for example, the more likely a tail will turn up. On this basis the fallacy is actually factual. After 9 heads, another head is 0.1% likely which means that a tail is 99.9% likely. And yet we're told every toss is 50% (or am I wrong here - this is the bit about probabilities that does my head in).</p></div>		</li>
