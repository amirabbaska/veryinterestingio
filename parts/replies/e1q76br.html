<p><em>The Energy Expenditure of Stair Climbing One Step and Two Steps at a Time: Estimations from Measures of Heart Rate</em><br />

<blockquote>
<p>Stairway climbing provides a ubiquitous and inconspicuous method of burning calories. While typically two strategies are employed for climbing stairs, climbing one stair step per stride or two steps per stride, research to date has not clarified if there are any differences in energy expenditure between them. Fourteen participants took part in two stair climbing trials whereby measures of heart rate were used to estimate energy expenditure during stairway ascent at speeds chosen by the participants. The relationship between rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate was calibrated for each participant using an inclined treadmill. The trials involved climbing up and down a 14.05 m high stairway, either ascending one step per stride or ascending two stair steps per stride. Single-step climbing used 8.5±0.1 kcal min−1, whereas double step climbing used 9.2±0.1 kcal min−1. These estimations are similar to equivalent measures in all previous studies, which have all directly measured VO2. The present study findings indicate that (1) treadmill-calibrated heart rate recordings can be used as a valid alternative to respirometry to ascertain rate of energy expenditure during stair climbing; (2) two step climbing invokes a higher rate of energy expenditure; however, one step climbing is energetically more expensive in total over the entirety of a stairway. Therefore to expend the maximum number of calories when climbing a set of stairs the single-step strategy is better.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It started for me at my high school where all the steps were extra shallow because they were some sort of handicap semi-accesible design. Now I love that double step life through and through. Even on steps that are already too steep. No staircase can stop me at this point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly I can’t exercise more than once a week so every chance I get, I fly up the stairs when I come across them during work. Four flights usually as fast as possible. One step at a time so I don’t cheat. The first weeks I tried it I was seriously panting. Nowadays I get a minor pulse elevation. I even got an intern assigned to me to do it with me after I had to wait 2 minutes for her to catch up.</p>
<p>Reminds me also of a story I read on here some time ago. Someone asked his professor why he was running on campus always.
The answer: to get faster where I need to be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Currently they're outside stairs in Texas though...you really feel the difference when it's over 100.   In the 70s it's just a casual dart up the stairs, but at 105 every now and then I feel old</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm.  So does this mean a person on a stair master type machine isn’t doing as much work as a person actually climbing physical stairs?  </p>
<p>They aren’t climbing up against the force of gravity, they’re just moving their legs to a different position on the moving belt?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as the machine is of the type with discrete steps that move constantly downwards like a treadmill, as opposed to the type with two lever-like pedals that just move up and down with some resistance, walking up the machine is physically identical to walking up real steps on Earth, or walking up steps in a rocket accelerating at 1 g. It doesn't matter whether you're moving or not, only how much force you're experiencing, because of inertia and relativity and stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a little less. </p>
<p>But energy transferred (lost/burned in the context of exercise) is force times distance. A walker on a flat surface uses force to support their weight, but only applies force starting when the foot touches the ground. They don’t push any further “through” the ground, or lift their body. So little effort goes into that upwards/supportive effect.</p>
<p>If the stair climber machine makes them place the foot higher and push <em>downwards</em> for some distance, against some resistance, this would require the use of more energy than walking on flat ground (or a flat treadmill). </p>
<p>I’m not sure how it compares to actual stairs, but if you walked faster on a stair machine than you did on actual stairs I’m sure you could burn equal or greater amounts of energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an objective, physical sense, no, not unless they move their center of gravity upwards. It's still a lot of work for your legs, but if the center of gravity is fairly stable, it's not going to be anywhere near as much energy expenditure as actually raising your CoG. </p>
<p>That said, it's probably lower impact, which can be very good in a workout.</p></div>		</li>
