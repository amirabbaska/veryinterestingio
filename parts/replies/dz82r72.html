			<div class="markdown"><p>But why, for example, would someone do this with a television show? Like ones made for Netflix, that have unintelligible dialogue with loud BLAAAAMP noises. It's never going to be seen in a movie theater. You'd think it'd be optimized for viewing at home, but you can't hear shit using a television so you end up putting English subtitles on a show where the dialogue is all in English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been having this problem with Westworld lately. Most of the time the audio is okay, but some scenes the characters are basically whispering to be &quot;intense&quot; and I can't hear shit. Turn up the volume and not only can I still not hear shit the next scene starts with a gunshot or the thundering hooves of a bunch of horses and it deafens me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, yea exactly. Maybe they're trying to be extra dramatic? But it's not dramatic at all if I have to go back and rewatch that part four times to understand what they're saying. Spend all this money on writers and then have the actors whisper the lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At my house I have a cheap surround sound and it is never a noticeable issue but I watch at my moms and it is impossible to watch some movies through her tv only sound system.  My brother has a silly amount of money in his home theater and would probably complain if the audio was inferior, netflix use to have the option to use other audio set ups but it was taken away.  I guess you could start a letter writing campaign I would put you in touch with my mom she has shit else to do all day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The thing is, although a lot of people own shitty $300 TVs with shitty built in speakers, a lot of people also own $300 soundbars that sound half decent, and a lot of people own $600 surround systems that sound pretty alright.</p>
<p>The truth of modern home media is that, accounting for inflation, the low end has become more available than it was 30 years ago, but if you want a good experience then you still have to pony up a little more, because nobody's catering for your broke ass; they're catering for the mid and high end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's not it. It doesn't work on super high end systems either. You need to play things at a volume level that just isn't reasonable to hear the quieter stuff and then you wake up the neighbors dog when the action starts. The equipment can manage the range easy and the sound is reproduced wonderfully. But the relative volumes are idiotic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're implying that most of the issues are due to under powered mobile speakers. That's not the complaint.</p>
<p>I suspect the majority of homes today have a HTIAB at the least. I personally have a pretty high-end 5.1 setup and there is not sweet spot for the settings. It certainly isn't due to changing listening positions.</p>
<p>I flip channels and need to be able to hear the diolgue in the news, the commentary AND the crowd noise in a sporting event and the dialogue with full surround in the latest Marvel movie on both HBO and Netflix. The equipment and the setup isn't the issue, it's the variation. The biggest offender is the movies. They have explosions that shake the house and wake up the neighbors at modest listening levels while the voices are sometimes unintelligble even when they aren't whispering. It's the mix.  </p>
<p>I understand that the theater sounds a certain way. The person with a decent 5.1/7.1 system sounds another way. The luddite still using the built in TV speakers sounds another. And the headphone setup for private/mobile viewing is another. Then there's time of day and type of content. The variation is impossible but everything except the movies tends to be close enough, but the &quot;art&quot; gets on the way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is you have no idea how good your sound system really is without independent testing, even if you buy an expensive or well reviewed HT system. For a multispeaker setup you need to calibrate for room size and wall/ground material, something very impractical that almost no one does unless they build an entire room specifically for home theater. Formats like dolby truehd are specifically designed to be as close to the original theater response as possible, which means that, in most cases, its just going to rattle the walls of a regular home theater setup.</p>
<p>For home audio there are things like DRC/normalization that will compress the audio, making quieter sounds louder and louder sounds quieter and keeping volume relatively consistent across anything you're listening to, which sounds like what you're really looking for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to go through your set up again you should be able to set levels independently just take the sub down so you don't rattle the walls and up on the center so you hear dialog. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have great speakers on my PC. You guys just make the loud too loud and the soft too soft. I'm sure everyone in your field disagrees with me but I've yet to meet a person that was happy with the super dynamic volume of stuff like what's described in the OP. Bottom line is I want my max volume at a certain level because neighbors, pets, roommates or just my own sanity. And too often if my sound is at a level where the loudest parts are below that maximum then there's going to be parts that are just too quiet to enjoy or hear properly. I've never in my entire life met a person who is happy with the volume up volume down dance ... </p>
<p>They don't sound good across a ton of devices they sound bad on a ton of devices and it's not speaker quality or what ranges they can produce it's that you guys have too large of a range on min and max volume. It's that simple. Bring the min and max closer to the middle and the entire problem is solved. I promise it really is just that simple. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's what dynamic range compression is for. Just turn it on.</p></div>		</li>
