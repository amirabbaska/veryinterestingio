<p>(note that even gas clouds and asteroid fields still constist of &quot;basically nothing&quot; if we use our earth-bound terms for &quot;a lot&quot; and &quot;basically nothing&quot;)</p>

<p>This is one of the more disappointing realities to understand about the asteroid belt and Oort Cloud.   Sci-fi and even science shows usually display these as crowded, densely packed with objects.  The boring reality is that you could push the Earth through the asteroid belt and probably not hit anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, that &quot;probably won't hit anything&quot; is essentially a 0% chance of hitting anything.  The asteroid belt and Oort cloud are that sparsely populated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Another way to think about it is that it's like saying earth is in the earth belt. It's the belt you are most likely to find earth, but if you flew an object through it, you would need to be mighty unlucky or extremely slow to hit earth. Asteroid belt is just where you are most likely to find asteroids. The mass of the asteroid belt about 4% of the moon, and the belt is much wider than the &quot;earth belt&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I say plausible, I know you're joking but why not? Is it seriously THAT unrealistic? If our probes can survive for even a million years, they will get pretty far. What's to say something predicted to last a billion years won't last 100,000,000 years? Then it gets to go REALLY far. So assuming there are other planets with life similar or on par with humans, why would we dismiss the possibility they are sending out probes with comparable life-spans? </p></div>		</li>
