			<div class="markdown"><p>I had surgery done laproscopically a few years ago. With a ROBOT! It's so cool to me that we can do that now. Funny thing is the first doctor I went to wanted to do regular surgery and told me the recovery time would be the same. According to the doctor I went to for the final surgery, that is definitely not the case. </p>
<p>The worst pain was the nerve pain in my shoulders from the gas they put inside me. My abdominal pain/weakness was minimal compared to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That pain is the worst! I had it after an ectopic pregnancy needed surgical removal and it was worse than going through labour (having had 2 children already by that stage). And my nurse on shift didn't know what it was!! D: D:</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My surgeon told me that my shoulder would hurt while I was coming out of anesthesia and still high do I forgot until the next day when I was like &quot;holy shit my shoulder hurts so bad, why?&quot; And my mom reminded me. But yeah that shoulder pain is brutal, especially because it's nerve pain and nothing soothes it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon here. Just so you know, the recovery actually is the same - the laparoscopic or robotic approach has never been shown to be better, at least not in any major study. Possibly faster return to work, but unlikely. Only benefit is cosmesis.</p>
<p>The only thing studies have shown is that people who do one of the operations really well, open vs lap, do that one better than the other. In other words, don't get someone to do the surgery they don't want to, their results will be worse. But, all things equal, exact same results. Personally, I enjoy doing lap hernias more so do that, but that's just because it amuses me.</p>
<p>One last thing, the robot is not better than laparoscopy - people who are bad at laparoscopy are aided by the robot, and the robot ergonomically is more comfortable for the operating surgeon (laparoscopy really puts a tremendous strain on the surgeons body and shortens your career) but offers no clinical benefit. It also costs an insane amount of money, which in the end is paid by us as a society. For no benefit. It's fun, and maybe will be the way of the future once the technology improves (currently there is no tactile improvement) but right now any competent lap surgeon can do everything that people do robotically just as well lap, and much much cheaper.</p>
<p>Tldr: lap and open hernia repair (at least inguinal) have the exact same outcomes, surgeons are better at one and should stick with that one, and the robot is a massive expense with no benefit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He shares why cutting calories only works for a short time, and why the weight comes back on (due to metabolic slowdown).</p></div>		</li>
