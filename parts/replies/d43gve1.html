			<div class="markdown"><p>And without getting too technical, hedge funds, unlike other funds often use &quot;short&quot; positions and &quot;derivatives&quot; to &quot;hedge&quot; away certain risks. </p>
<p>A short position is just an form of investment where you profit if the price of the stock goes down. So an overly simplified example: a hedge fund might buy $1M of a mining company that produces 50% copper and 50% nickel but they only think copper prices will improve and don't have an opinion on what will happen with nickel. So they might short $500k of stock of a nickel mining company. This way if nickel prices go up or down, they won't have any effect on the hedge funds profits. They will only be exposed to copper prices movements.</p>
<p>Derivatives are a little more complex, mainly because there are many different types and combinations. One of the more simple derivatives is a call option, where you buy the option to buy a certain stock in the future for a predetermined price. For example, I can pay you $2 now, to have the option to buy apple stock from you for $100, 3 months for now, regardless of where apple stock is trading in 3 months. Derivatives are also used to hedge. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I get what you wrote above, that they are reducing the risk of nickle movement through a short... but what <em>is</em> a short, and how does it reduce the risk?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you short something- say the nickel miner in the other guy's example- you borrow someone else's nickel miner shares, and sell them on an exchange. You then take that money and do other stuff, while paying a fee for the privilege of borrowing (usually small amounts like 0.1% or something). </p>
<p>You're betting that in the future, the price of the nickel miner will fall (likely due to a fall in the price of nickel), and you can &quot;close&quot; the short by buying nickel miner shares in the open market and giving those back to the entity you borrowed it from, with any profit being the difference between the price you shorted it at and the price you close the trade at.</p>
<p>Although that's not really ELI5... much simpler, shorting is selling something now (whether you own it or not). If you're shorting for profit, you expect the thing you sell to decrease in price, so that in the future you can buy it back for less than you sold it. If you're shorting for protection, you do it in case it falls and the value of your other things falls- you would make some money from the short and your overall performance is slightly better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shorting: you borrow a dvd from a friend, you know its worth $20. You sell it for $20 today. You have to return it next week. Lucky for you the price dropped between now and next week to $15. You buy it for $15, return it to your friend, and have made $5. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shorting a stock is selling a stock you don't own. You borrow the stock from your broker and sell it. Eventually you buy the stock to return it to the broker. This is called covering the short. </p>
<p>If the price went down, you made a profit. If the price went up, you lost money. </p>
<p>It's risky though because your potential losses are unlimited. You could sell for $1 and be forced to cover at $100. Speaking of being forced, your broker establishes a margin limit that tells you how much you can borrow, usually as a percentage of your total portfolio value. As the shorted stock increases in price, your debt increases and if you hit your margin limit, your broker can sell other assets in your portfolio to cover the short. This is called a short squeeze and could be very costly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So let's say you're a pretty powerful big-wig since you can invest in this hedge fund and since there seem to be much lower regulation on these, would you be allowed to use your influence to lower the value of the stock your shorting? </p>
<p>I'm assuming the SEC has rules against this, and it would be obvious if you shorted a company/industry you are in control of or a major player in, but at what level can you indirectly influence stock price? Is there lots of oversight on this? I know stock prices are not easily manipulated and if they were predictable, everybody would be making money, but I feel like if you're enough of a power player, you could take advantage of this and how closely is that regulated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are very strict rules against manipulating the market and changing the value of the stock you're holding. You can state facts and to some extent your opinion. Basically you cannot short (or buy) a stock, with the knowledge that something non public and material will happen to the company in the future, whether or not you're the one causing it. </p>
<p>There is a lot of oversight on this. It is illegal and with the largest players can and has resulted in multi multi million (maybe billion) dollar fines. Naturally the regulatory agencies would add resources where they can find the largest return. </p>
<p>However, if you short a stock, and then based on public information you publicly (and correctly) expose that its a pyramid scheme, and the stock declines, then generally you should be in the clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, roughly speaking that´s the gist.</p>
<p>As /u/Manticore_ mentioned the name &quot;hedge&quot; fund comes originally from hedging measures, that means any measures that reduce risk from your investments. E.g. investing in multiple countries instead of investing only in the US to secure against a US specific economic downturn, etc.</p>
<p>However a hedge fund doesn´t have to employ hedging measures to be considered as such. And many public funds do hedging as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI your example (investing in multiple countries) isn't a hedge, it's just diversification.  Diversifying is spreading your money over multiple assets so that if there is an idiosyncratic shock to one asset, the rest of your portfolio is likely unaffected.  Hedging is investing in two assets that are negatively correlated, so if one asset goes up in value the other will go down.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. Hedge funds do not invest in private companies. Those are called Private Equity funds. </p>
<p>Also, hedge funds do not sinply diversify. They invest in derivatoves such as options, futures, etc combined with long and short positions of the underlying assets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there is something known as being an Accredited Investor. There are lots of things you can't do without being one, and if a hedge fund only allows accredited investors they have more freedom.</p>
<p>The requirements to be an accredited investor is very high income or very high assets (aka: be rich). They're allowed to invest in small private companies (such as startups for example), the logic being that every day joe is more likely to get scammed by non regulated companies.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This point can't be understated enough. This is why most people cannot invest in Hedge Funds. Once you are an accredited investor you have access to different world of investing options and strategies, private equity, warrants, etc. Completely different ball-game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important aspect of hedge funds (vs a mutual fund or an actively managed ETF) is that there are significantly fewer restrictions on the investing. As such, a hedge fund can short sell a stock (betting that the stock price will go down), take on huge positions in a company (mutual funds typically can't have one stock be over 10% of the total fund), which allows the fund to make concentrated bets and,  in special cases, drive change at the company, and invest in any asset class, including derivatives.</p></div>		</li>
