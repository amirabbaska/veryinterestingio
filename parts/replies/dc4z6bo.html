			<div class="markdown"><p>Purified water is not the norm, hence the name. In fact, it's a time consuming and sometimes expensive process, with destilation  and deionization and whatnot.</p>
<p>In fact, &quot;water&quot;, as we use the term in everyday life, is never just H2O.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My treated drinking water has ~1.5 mg/L of free chlorine, ~0.030 mg/l of Polyaluminum Chloride, and a salinity of ~0.2 mg/L. Well today it did. It'll vary but not by much. Not including the list of a dozen metals and minerals naturally found in the raw source water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The molecule is H2O. There are almost always other molecules within it. What we think of as 'fresh' water freezes at 0C, but ultra pure water (measured with a resistivity above 18.2 ohm) can be chilled below - 20 C and remain liquid because it has no nuclei (ions, dirt particles, etc) around which to form ice crystals. By adding a particle to the super chilled water, you can flash freeze it. (There was a good radio lab discussing this a while back). Additions to the solution change many properties. Much of what we think of as 'alcohol' is a water based solution with alcohol molecules and impurities for flavor. </p>
<p>I further wonder if ions (Na or Cl, others)  play a factor in bubble formation. I always wanted to know how artisanal ice (with no bubbles or cracks) is made. With deionized water and slow chilling? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when new molecules are formed, they do that by sharing electrons with each other to form a more stable, even loaded form.
Sodium by itself is unstable, and when it comes in contact with water, forces an hydrogen off the water molecule. (Na + H2O -&gt;NaOH +H). But in NaCl, the sodium is already happily sharing an electron with the chloride. When they dissociate, the chloride does not mind having gained one: NaCl -&gt; Na+ + Cl-. What reacts with what depends on the number of electrons the elements have in their outer electron cloud, and how many they need to be in a happy, stable state (reactivity). The periodic table shows that: first row likes to give away electrons, middle rows are picky, second to last row is greedy when it comes to electrons, and last row does not care (inert gases: have all the electrons they want).That is why free radicals are so problematic: they have a free, unbound electron that could bind just anywhere it wants, basically (within limits).
Dramatically simplified for understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you mean by the sodium reacting.  Maybe you're asking why a hydrogen doesn't dissociate with the oxygen in the water molecules?  Because the O-H bond is covalent whereas the Na-O bond and Cl-H bond are ionic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you only took minimum chem you probably didn't cover this, but matter is composed of an ensemble of particles with differing energy levels. These differing energy levels mean that reactions that don't happen at &quot;low&quot; energy levels but do at &quot;high&quot; energy levels will happen at room temperature. This is important because it means when you're given a plausible reaction equation, such as Na^+ (aq) + (OH)^- (aq) &lt;-&gt; NaOH (s) you can figure out which direction the reaction will go by comparing the energy levels of the two products and seeing which is lower. The side of the equation with a lower total energy is the one that is more stable. This is a valid assumption because the ensemble nature of the particles means that even if the transition to the more stable side requires &quot;high&quot; energy, it will happen, albeit it might be slow.</p>
<p>Now I didn't mention entropy and entropy is important, but that's a lot harder to understand intuitively and why it's why chemists look at gibbs free energy rather than enthalpy when they do this in real life.</p>
<p>And if I misunderstood you're question and you're asking why Na^+ (aq) doesn't violently react with water once dissociated like Na(s) does, that's simply because Na^+ (aq) and Na(s) are chemically distinct species. An ion and it's elemental form just simply don't have the same chemistry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never actually considered the molecular reasons salt water freezes at a lower temperature, but just seeing this picture made it pretty clear why that is. Would I be wrong in assuming introducing a chemical to water that comprises only of negative ions have an even lower freezing point than salt water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wound find it incredibly hard to create a solution of only negative ions.  I guess the resulting explosion would very thoroughly melt the ice while violently reacting to... everything.  </p>
<p>Negatively charged ions packed together are pretty much how you describe static electricity.  </p></div>		</li>
