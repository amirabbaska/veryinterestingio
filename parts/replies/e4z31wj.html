<p>- A lot of astrophysics MHD codes are open source, like gadget, enzo, and FLASH, so download them and start poking around! They won't mind.</p>
<p>- The current cosmological model does not explain *why* we find ourselves in an epoch where dark matter and dark energy are roughly equal. What's up with that? Should we even care about it? Open questions.</p>
<p>- This universe is really freaking big. As in, Big McLargeHuge. It's kind of mind blowing that we can even *begin* to address some of these tremendous time and space scales. We really shouldn't be able to do that, but here we are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>or put another way, </p>
<p>&quot;Space is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist’s, but that’s just peanuts to space.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<li>I will definitely check out those codes.                      </li>
<li>I do not think science has any claim on 'why' questions in general. If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#/media/File:WMAP_2008_universe_content.png" target="_blank">this graphic</a> is correct, roughly equal is a bit of a stretch.                          </li>
<li>Agreed, it is awe inspiring to even contemplate such numbers, even if imagination is not up to the task.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just finished my PhD in computational astrophysics this year. I've since left the field, so take from my advice what you will. :)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learn how to program.</p>
<p>Writing code is fairly easy, but actually designing programs that implement solutions to problems correctly with good performance is very, very hard. Learning how to program will make this much easier because it will force you to think about the larger structure of what the programming language can do for you and then how to leverage those features to make writing correct, fast programs so much easier. As /u/PaulMattSutter noted, Gadget, Enzo, and FLASH are common MHD solvers used in astronomy. They are, respectively, implemented in C, C++, and Fortran and have fundamentally different software designs even though they are solving the same physics. As a note, I have used Gadget, but my work was purely N-body galaxy dynamics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like all models, it's incomplete. It also doesn't help that it already tells us that we know almost nothing of 95% of the Universe's energy budget. So many questions! If you are interested in computational cosmology (vis-a-vis galaxy formation), then we can talk more.</p>
</li>
<li>Carl Sagan said it best: &quot;We are a way for the Universe to know itself.&quot; That is my personal awe of astronomy. It's insane to think about how much we know about the universe, where we come from, and where we might go.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were many reasons.</p>
<p>Academic jobs are extremely difficult to get. This will only continue to get worse until the federal government (US) readjusts its attitude about funding higher education because the states can't (wont?) pick up the slack. This means that as professors retire, most are either not replaced or adjunct faculty are hired. In astronomy, it's pretty much required that you do at least one postdoc before you apply for permanent positions. Again, there's no money and postdocs are no exception to that. Competition for fellowships is insane, and most faculty don't have money to pay a postdoc (it's usually about twice the salary of a grad student).</p>
<p>I am also more interested in the computing side of things. My dream job is to help scientists (from pretty much any field) use very large computing resource like the national supercomputers to solve larger problems that can bring bigger discoveries in less time. There is a real need for this right now as pretty much all of the sciences (and many of which are not the physical sciences) require large computing resources to solve their problems. Most researchers simply aren't equipped to make that transition.</p>
<p>Lastly, I was ready to be done. Last Tuesday marked the 17th anniversary of my first day of university. I have taken more classes than most four-year students take credit hours (last count was ~150 classes). I'm looking forward to not being in school, but it's hard to say where I will go next. In astronomy, it's actually only about 40% of graduate students go on to do a postdoc and then maybe half of them get permanent faculty positions. I think, but I'm not certain, that is probably higher than most of the other physical sciences. We just have a lot of diverse skills, so we tend to have a fairly open field of employment opportunities.</p></div>		</li>

<p>1) I should probably have mentioned that I actually do scientific computing - yet I wanted the response to be of value to many others as well.
Although I did not get my <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html" target="_blank">10 years</a> as of yet, I am quite confident in my programming abilities.<br />
A great way for me to improve (in non-scientific programming) has been to re-implement projects and
follow the advice of <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/" target="_blank">Matt Might</a>, he has a great list of what all computer science majors should
know.                    </p>
<p>My own background is in chemical physics (computational QM, MD, MC), now soft matter with a focus on applied probability theory (starting PhD next month).
I will definitely check out those codes.                     </p>
<p>2) I am very interested in learning more about our universe. My current knowledge about fundamental physics is mainly informed by Penrose's Road to Reality, and all my research that went into 'understanding'
it (I don't plan to stop), as well as an ongoing self-study of John Baez's list on Maths and Physics, some advanced books of which deal with the theoretical aspects of modern cosmology. </p>
<p>3) For me it is stars. They incorporate all the known forces in the way they function, it's like (if we accept inflation) the forces split in the beginning
of time to be brought back together inside stars, objects of such immense mass-energy, that they can breed life in far away places. </p></div>		</li>
