<p>1) The donation gets you something that you would have purchased anyway, but now you can write-off the cost. </p>

<p>Especially important at, say, a charity auction, or a benefit party. Let's say I'd like to take a trip to Europe. If I pay for it up front, I have to pay for it with after-tax dollars. However, if I buy it at a charity auction, I get to pay for it with pre-tax dollars. If you're in the top federal tax bracket, 39.6%, you effectively get to buy that vacation for ~60% of the cost (and that's ignoring state and local income tax and the Medicare portion of FICA, which is 2.9% and does not have a cap). Benefit parties, same idea - you get to go to a party with good food and unlimited booze for much less than the nominal ticket price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is misleading. You can't deduct the full amount you paid for the trip; you can only deduct the amount you paid above the fair market value of the trip (which in my experience with charity auctions isn't usually a positive number).</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are correct that you can't &quot;make money&quot; by donating cash and writing it off, though, as others have mentioned, donating other assets can result in a net gain.</p>

<p>You can make TONS of money donating cash to <em>your own</em> foundation.</p>
<p>It's written off your taxes and the charity is tax-free. Put all your charity expenses on the foundation: travel, food, hotels, etc. To top it all off : some foundations are very very profitable, yet tax exempt. It means a great tax-free life for the rest of their living years.</p>
<p>That's what most &quot;philantropists&quot; do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a Land Trust that protects natural ecosystems, water sources etc. Most of the landowners who donate to us have large properties in pristine or close to pristine condition that they use for hunting and family recreation, with no plans to alter the property in any major way. </p>
<p>They donate the development/subdivision rights and various other rights to do things that would threaten the natural resources on the property, which are often worth significant amounts of money. The land is protected <em>forever</em> and they get a large tax write off without actually changing how they were going to manage the land anyway. We both win.</p></div>		</li>
