			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad to be able to help :) Good luck with your friend. I hope she can stop as soon as possible. Even the dizziness that can come from short-term dehydration and electrolyte imbalance can lead to fainting and hitting her head on something sharp. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A healthy body is pretty good at self-regulating electrolytes, and so as long as you eat and drink normal amounts, you should be fine. You'll get all the electrolytes you need from your intake and you will pee out anything that shouldn't be there. </p>
<p>The only instances you should worry about electrolyte balance is if you experience excessive diarrhea, vomiting or (really excessive) peeing/sweating, or some other major loss of fluids from your body, either intentional or not, since electrolytes are dissolved in those fluids. You can buy electrolyte-replenishers at a pharmacy to keep on hand, or you can make your own! Just search for &quot;how to make my own pedialyte&quot;. Drinking a large glass of milk with a pinch of common table salt stirred in it will give you pretty much everything you need too.</p></div>		</li>
