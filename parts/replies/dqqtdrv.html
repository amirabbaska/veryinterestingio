<p>Walker: Of course, sir.</p>
<p>Shawn Spencer: Then speak to me like I'm ten years old.</p>
<p>Walker: He had a sudden drop in blood pressure, which deprived his brain of blood. He also suffered a contusion and slight cerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<p>Shawn Spencer: [pause] Talk to me like I'm five.</p>
<p>Walker: Uh... his blood pressure went boom and his brain got an owie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This one time I pushed too hard while pooing and stimulated my Vagus nerve. Nearly passed out, scared the shit out of me (not literally unfortunately) which triggered a panic attack. Was almost certain I just pooped my way to a heart attack. Thought I was going to die like Elvis. But (haha, butt - because of the story  get it?!) I didn't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like, we pass out from pain so our body can not bleed as much and possibly survive a dangerous wound?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there's no direct correlation between low blood pressure and &quot;not bleeding as much&quot;. Your body automatically compensates for reduced blood volume by shunting blood away from the non-essential stuff, but this raises your blood pressure (where normally it'd be low due to blood loss). It isn't helpful to have low blood pressure when you're bleeding.</p></div>		</li>
