			<div class="markdown"><p>The rate of gastric emptying depends on few things. The volume (more food volume, promotes emptying), liquid vs solid (liquids are faster), and types of food (fats takes longer) are some. Other examples include diabetes (can cause neuropathy that makes the process slower, called gastroparesis), elderly status, pregnancy (progesterone), post surgery status (ileus), certain drugs, etc. That said, I think Total emptying o the stomach does take 4-5 hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The majority of people have 1 hour gastric emptying time (GET), anything over 4 hours is abnormal and considered a delayed gastric emptying time. If the patient is sick and the digestive tract is affected, this is expected of course, but if this is a chronic issue, medication and dietary modification can help reduce the gastric emptying time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If this is the case, why can I vomit food that I ate 18 hours earlier? Does it work it's way backwards through my intestines?</p>
<p>Example: recently went to a concert. Had dinner at about 4pm. Went to concert. Went to the casino after. Had quite a few drinks in there. Woke up the next morning about 10am throwing up my dinner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ate some green capsicum today (slowly reintroducing food after a drastic elimination diet due to allergies) </p>
<p>It immediately didn't sit right and I vomited about 3 hours later. </p>
<p>Only I vomited capsicum <em>and</em> pasta... </p>
<p>I ate the pasta last night, over 26 hours ago... Also no sign of breakfast (oatmeal) or lunch (potatoes and cucumber) </p>
<p>My allergies cause gastroparesis, and I have a connective tissue disorder that caused gastroparesis too, so I know my stomach has delayed emptying. It's just so weird that my stomach let's some things through (oats, potato) but not other things, like pasta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It varies between 1-3 hours, with 1 hour being the most common gastric emptying time. Anything beyond that is considered abnormal and can exacerbate reflux symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An infected/obstructed digestive tract would not perform at its normal gastric emptying time. As with every organ and system in our body, any disease/problem will greatly reduce the efficiency of the organ. If the stomach is trying to break down food but cannot empty into the small intestine, it gets irritated. It is only meant to be a temporary holder. The stomach doesn't like to have food contents in it too long, and if the small intestine is infected and not performing well either, the stomach will rid itself of its contents the other way and vomit. This of course can vary with each illness or the contents of the vomit itself (alcohol, rotten food, etc.).</p></div>		</li>
