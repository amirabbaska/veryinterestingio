			<div class="markdown"><p>It's remarkable how negative the portrayal of men in a relationship are. I've been planning my wedding with my fiancée, and actually going to appointments for hair, makeup, dress shopping, picking up flowers and so on, and every single time, the person there will be like &quot;wow I have never seen the groom come to any of these&quot;. Why not? I'm not trying to control it, my fiancée wants me there to offer my opinion. Then I look at all the wedding toppers and see that a lot of them are the woman dragging the man somewhere, or him with a literal ball and chain with a facial expression of &quot;what did I get myself into?&quot; Is this why there is so much divorce? Is the normalization of a man not contributing to the relationship and being &quot;stuck&quot; what leads to so many failed marriages? I've technically been married for over a year and a half to my wife (fiancée used for simplicity, we had a small courthouse wedding, and are now doing the real thing) and they say the first year of marriage is the hardest. What's so hard? It was probably one of the easiest of my life.</p>
<p>There's just so much negativity and sexism against men in this situation, but it's fine because it's impossible to be sexist towards men right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate that too, I hate it when people say &quot;game over mate LOL&quot; when someone gets engaged. Like, did she force him to get married? <em>he</em> asked <em>her</em>! It's nice you took so much interest in your wedding! I think it's so sexist on both sides; that the woman has to &quot;put up&quot; with her husband and the man has some how been forced into it even tho he proposed. </p></div>		</li>

Such a funny show that just seemed to drown in &quot;oblivious husband/naggy wife/annoying family&quot; tropes.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an excellent point! Off the top of my head, that's the only reversal of this stereotype that I can think of, and probably the most successful.
Although, Lucille Ball was classically attractive, so that probably contributed. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There is also one argument that it's done because it would be un-PC to have the wife be the one to do stupid things. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This certainly has happened, and got the expected response.</p>
<p>In G4 of MLP, there is a &quot;dumb, slurring idiot&quot; male character that appeared a few times, but nobody ever seemed to have a problem with him. Even when he was literally drooling and saying things like &quot;huhuhuh I like pudding&quot;, not a peep of complaint from anyone.</p>
<p>Then, in the second season, they had a female character being clumsy and speaking in a bit of a slurred voice, in just one short scene......and there was just a massive eruption of &quot;ABLEISM!&quot; and &quot;SEXISM!!&quot; cries from Tumblr. Every which way you looked, there was someone crying that it was so horribly offensive and sexist and ableist to have a character act like that, completely ignoring the fact that we already had a male character doing that, a whole season ago, and nobody complained about it.</p>
<p>There was such an outrage over it that Hasbro pulled the episode from the network, and had the voice actor re-dub the scene with a less &quot;offensive&quot; voice. Even though they said they only made &quot;minor audio alterations&quot;, they also edited the animation to remove the character's cross-eyed look in a few scenes as well. They also censored the character's name out (the voice actor just didn't say it at all), since apparently &quot;derpy&quot; is a horribly offensive slur now... /rolleyes</p>
<p>I'd actually argue that the male character was a more offensive stereotype of &quot;slow&quot; people, but still, nobody complained about it, but then when a female character comes along and does the same thing, suddenly it's a massive issue that everyone is whining about.</p>
<p>So yeah, people definitely react badly to female characters being the &quot;drooling idiot&quot; archetype. Sadly. Seems it's okay to have a male character be a drooling idiot, but if you portray a female character as a drooling idiot, suddenly it's &quot;sexist and ableist&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
