			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is now <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5e-20+c" target="_blank">4.5e-12 m/s</a> (4.5 picometers/second). It takes 7051 years for light to travel 1 meter.</p>
<p>Compared to the universe's size, light is <em>slow</em>. Which it kinda has to be, considering &quot;observable universe&quot; is so dependent on the speed of light, and it's been around a long time (and expanded a lot in that time).</p>
<p>tl;dr: light is slow, space is big.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Light is fast, but it is incredibly slow when compared to the size of the universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is really mind blowing how much of space is just that; nothingness. When you compare yourself to that void, regardless of how colossally huge you are, you're nothing.</p>
<p>For a true sense of scale:</p>
<p>The largest thing confirmed to exist at the moment was discovered recently, in 2013. There's something bigger than that thought to exist but it's currently breaking our understanding of physics with its existence, so we'll just skip that one. </p>
<p>Anyway. This big thing is called the Huge Large Quasar Group (aka: U1.27). Yes. Huge Large. And that's a space term, so you know it's truly huge large. It's a structure made up of about 73 quasars (which are on their own class of huge anyway). Its longest dimension is 1.24 <strong>billion</strong> parsecs. On this terrestrial scale, that's the equivalent of the distance between New York and London. Its shortest dimension is 370 million parsecs, that's only about 100 miles on this scale.</p>
<p>So the absolutely biggest thing that we've found (and... understand) is still just a very thin streak across the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>EDIT - Also, this point is huge: on this scale, light takes <strong>4 billion years</strong> to go from New York to London. Reducing it to miles really hurts the scale here, because we're used to them. These distances are huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was curious, so I did the mathâ€”at that rate (NY to London over 4 billion years), you'd be traveling <strong>half an inch per decade</strong>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting. numbers like quarter of a mile, and 4.6 miles are still &quot;big&quot;, in that I assumed that the distances will be much much smaller. I guess when I think of the observable universe I imagine an uncountable number of galaxies, and somehow looking at these numbers makes it all..... finite.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps because a proton is <em>unimaginably small</em>. Although you are surely able to read that a proton is ~0.85 femtometers which is 0.85 x 10^-15 meters you are certainly incapable of truly grasping something that small. Don't worry, the rest of us are just as incapable. We have no way of comprehending such scales due to how our brains have evolved to understand the world we live in.</p></div>		</li>
