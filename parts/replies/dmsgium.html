			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you resolve that? </p>
<p>I live alone in a relatively small 2/2 1000 sqft house and could easily park 3 cars, 5 if parked creatively. Can't even imagine the opposite. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only sure way in the UK is not to buy a new build. They are generally tiny and in most counties the 1 &amp; 2 bedroom new build homes will only be allocated 1 parking space. 3+ bedroom new build homes will generally be allocated 1.5 spaces.  Some of these bigger new build homes may have driveways, but a lot I've seen just have a designated bay for that house!  </p>
<p>It's compounded even further by the need to cram as many bastard houses on the land which leads to apartments being built and town houses (3 storey houses, but skinny so less wasted frontage and more room for more bastard houses). </p>
<p>The car parking provision is down to local county planning for new builds, but I believe it's all derived from government guidelines. It's supposed to encourage people to not buy more cars than they can park and for them to consider public transport/bikes/walking/etc. In reality it just means that most new build estates look like shit once they're fully occupied with cars piled up on the pavement, jammed onto grass verges, and rammed into any fucking space possible. </p>
<p>The only hope of getting a decent amount of parking space is to buy an older house. After having a house with no parking space outside (it was situated on a pedestrianised area, which was lovely and quiet) one of our big considerations in buying a family home was to have a drive to fit at least two cars on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple. Come home after work around 5:30/6 and cry yourself round the block until you find a spot. Some areas in UK where parking is  a nightmare have parkin permits so you can only park on the street if you have a badge showing. This probably means you get one permit per house I would guess although I'm not entirely sure if that's the case. </p></div>		</li>
