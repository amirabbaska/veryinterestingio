			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just not true positives definitely excite our animal instincts, that's the basis of psychological addiction. You are half right tho. The issue is that negatives are quantified while positives aren't. That's a sociological function I think based in years of over abundance and flashy advertising, but that's just opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Addiction &quot;wears off&quot; too - in that there is a law of diminishing returns. The user requires more of the stimulus to receive the same high. This is true physically (habituation in heroin users, for example) and psychologically (thrill seeking which escalate resulting in more dangerous behaviours).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolutionary speaking it makes sense to highlight negative experiences far more than positive. Any physical interaction that can be interpreted as negative experience can kill you. This must be avoided at all costs, and so it is an evolutionary advantage for brains to hardwire focus on the negative things.</p>
<p>There is a positive equivalent of &quot;getting prematurely killed&quot; that has an an similar highlighted focus within the brain: Your reproduction system. However, reproduction is only partly really enjoyable, and after the enjoyable part it's again all about not getting killed yourself or your children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it would be advantageous evolutionarily to not focus on positive events because it would help drive progression. If cavemen were completely happy just living in a cave it's unlikely anyone would want to build a house or start farming etc </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well some people believe this is what stunted the development of some aboriginal peoples. </p>
<p>Since their islands and warmer countries were plentiful, the people were content. </p>
<p>Europe was cold as fuck, so they were forced to be more efficient. You could also add that you were less likely to thrive in Europe if you were stupid, so that further cleared the way for more innovative people to branch out. </p>
<p>Extrapolate that process over 100,000 years, and you get millions of American Indians getting slaughtered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I rather believe that a lot of the pain comes from that modern society and culture believes that somehow life must accustomize around the individuals for them to be happy all the time. </p>
<p>As if an individuals life would somehow be significant; whereas in perspective it is just one animal in an endless succession of animals in the fight of survival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make a conscious decision to be happy and to look on the bright side of life. Decide that you will be happy with less. It is a good way for an individual to be happy. Whether you believe in the tenets of Buddhism or not, meditation does tend to make people (even the non-religious) happier and more focused on the important things in life.</p>
<p>However, as a society we always need those who are never satisfied and spend their lives striving for bigger, better things. They are the ones who make scientific discoveries, invent new technologies, and find new ways to use old things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. This so much.</p>
<p>People often ask me how I achieve such positivity. My answer is always the same: I choose too.</p>
<p>Things that happened have already happen. The only thing in our power is to adapt to avoid it next time. </p>
<p>To be optimistic, you have to CHOOSE to be optimistic. Look at failures not like obstacles, but simply as what they are : events. If your life or your goals are roads, picture those events like boulders on the road that you need to go around. Sometimes, your road is closed, but life is like this : we keep going toward something, either we see it or not.</p>
<p>Every event (happy or sad) that happened in your life made you what you are now. Accept them, you can't go back. But you CAN chose to do the right thing with what you are and what you have.</p>
<p>Bless you all, be kind, be optimistic, some things will be alright eventually so keep pushing, keep going forward.</p>
<p>Edit: I phrased all this like it was a general rule, my bad. I feel I need to say that <em>it is my own experience</em> and it might work differently for you.</p>
<p>Depression is another subject. It's a disease that need to be treated by professionnals. But like any disease you can try to prevent it and you can try to get better when you catch it. </p>
<p>What I present is maybe overrated but it doesn't hurt to try :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with the first half of your post, but disagree with the second. I don't think that scientists seek to make discoveries because they are &quot;unsatisfied,&quot; at least, not in the sense of general happiness. You can be perfectly content with life while still striving to make improvements to it. Being content doesn't make you unmotivated, and in fact, negative states of mind such as depression are much more associated with lack of motivation or innovation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lying is the key.</p>
<p>The greatest gift evolution or your deity of choice have humanity is the ability for self delusion combined with the ability to accept the reality we are presented</p>
<p>If you lie to yourself every day and say that you're happy and act as if you're happy then you become happy.  It's no more or less real than any other happiness.  Who cares how you get there as long as you do?</p>
<p>It's why we have millions in regretful marriage yet still.stay together.  They can lie their way through to themselves.</p>
<p>Also there's an obsessive need for perfection now and people are so hard on themselves when they don't meet it.  It's perfectly fine to be average, almost everybody is. Good enough is good enough, you don't have to be a genius superstar millionaire to be happy.  Just find something you like and somebody you like to do that with then go from there.</p>
<p>Also, if you can help it try not to have kids until you've developed the patience for them.  This might be at 16 or 60 but taking your emotions out on your kids is how depressed kids are created.</p>
<p>That's pretty much everything I've learnt about being alive in the several decades I've been here.  It's not really a lot now I look at it.</p></div>		</li>
