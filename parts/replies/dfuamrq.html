<p>I don't have an in depth knowledge, but have read about it. And think about it logically. If you have a pot of water at 0° and a pot at 50° and heat them both, eventually the water that was 0° will rise to 50°. So how is that different than using water starting at 50°? </p>

<p>Weirdly, there's some evidence to suggest that this doesn't work going in the opposite direction. It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpemba_effect" target="_blank">Mpemba Effect</a> -- the idea that, in certain situations and depending on your definition of 'freezing', hot water might freeze faster than cold. It's a bit of a contentious topic, and has been for a while now; in 2016, a paper proclaimed that '<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121640/" target="_blank">there is no evidence to support meaningful observations of the Mpemba effect</a>' (Burridge and Linden), but this year another paper (Tao <em>et al.</em>) gave a reason why it might happen <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00735" target="_blank">on a molecular basis</a>, so research is obviously still ongoing. Either way, it's been an attested phenomenon since the time of Aristotle.</p>
<p>Some real counterintuitive stuff, there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest factor behind the Mpemba effect is evaporation, which results in a loss of mass.  The Q= mL heat loss is far greater than the Q = mC deltaT heat loss.  It doesn't matter much if the ice cube starts off boiling if it is releasing steam when you put it in a freezing environment.  </p>
<p>As far as boiling water, it's mostly hokum.  Sure, lots of water tanks are dirty and have solutes which trivially raise the temperature of water.  But, for most recipes you're supposed to add salt anyway.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's amazing how difficult of a problem this is to model.</p>
<p>I think evaporation is the most simple explanation.  The amount of energy required to change the phase of water is quite a lot in this context.  You can make an ice in the desert using nothing more than a bowl of water with some brush over it if you stick it in a shady spot with a strong, steady breeze because the amount of energy absorbed through evaporative cooling is so large.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this! My husband and I once got into a debate as I was trying to throw dinner together in a hurry and used hot water from the tap, hoping to jumpstart the boiling process for pasta. He contended that cold water boils faster and I simply could not see how that would be possible. It seems he misunderstood the faster <em>rate</em> at which cold tap water heats initially versus the overall amount of time to reach boiling, right?</p></div>		</li>
