			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally there's a little sensor grouped incredibly close to the main camera element, and it's basically an IR sensor as the other guy said, and it measures distance. If you open up a camera lens, you'll find a lot of circuit boards and wiring, and the camera &amp; lens communicate back and forth, camera acting as a range finder and the lens itself adjusting its servos accordingly. I think.</p>
<p>I'm on mobile right now and away from my camera, so i might be wrong, and formatting might be terrible, but my source is my dead 18-55 nikon lens that i opened up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That sounds fun... I busted the mount on a 55-200 mm lens, maybe I'll open it up too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That device is a light emitting diode, it's not a range finder. All it does is illuminate what you're pointing the lens at to give it enough light for the camera sensor to focus using contrast. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken, it doesn't do it with the whole sensor. You may have noticed more expensive a dslrs.will advertise varying &quot;points&quot; of focus, like 22 point focus or something. That represents the number of points on the sensor where it can autofocus in their advertised focus time. Cheaper cameras have fewer points of focus. Also, many cameras also give you the ability to adjust the metering point to a desired spot in the frame, so the sensor effectively is only measuring pixel to pixel sharpness on that indicates point. Again, I don't know this for sure, but based on the previous response, I'm guessing that's how it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DSLR cameras actually have two separate AF systems.  One for use when the camera is not in live view mode, and the photographer is using the viewfinder.  And another for when they are using the live view feature (and thus the mirror us up and shutter is open).  </p>
<p>The first one, phase detection, tends to be faster which is probably why it is still the primary way that people use a DSLR.  </p>
<p>The second method, known as contrast detection, likely requires more power and processing because the camera is basically on and processing images/video while it focuses.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern cameras come with face recognition etc. so can actually pick out things they think you're likely to want in focus, and use those as their focus points. </p>
<p>TBH processing power increases and cost reductions in the last decade (as well as the massive push for better mobile phone cameras &amp; screens) means you can do mad amounts of processing in real-time very cheaply.</p>
<p>My cheap point-and-shoot you can wink at it to trigger the timer. That's frickin' sci-fi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It must be something like this.
You can see this when you try to take a picture through a window with raindrops on it. Sometimes it will focus on the thing in the background, sometimes on the raindrops, even when those are only visible in a fraction of the frame. </p>
<p>I imagine an analysis based on the full frame would never focus on the few raindrops. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what OP is really talking about. &quot;Option A&quot; as you put it is the normal mode of autofocus in basically every camera produced since autofocus was invented; distance measurement, even though it can be rather precise, is not on its own good enough to actually focus the system as there is slop in literally everything -- the focus mechanism, the ADCs reading all of the sensor data, etc. To my knowledge there really isnt any autofocus system that works without examining the light coming through the lens to some extent.</p>
<p>On most cameras there will be some separate part of the optical path that will direct some of the light to a special focus sensor. On old cameras this was a very simple arrangement using a comparitor with a couple of photosensitive components to achieve the highest contrast between them. On nice DSLRs the dedicated autofocus sensors are quite capable. On mirrorless cameras and cellphone cameras, the actual image data itself is used to tune the focus. Again the algorithm is usually pretty straightforward and only needs a very small subset of the image to operate-- it is basically to run the focus mechanism from a limit until you achieve the highest contrast between neighboring elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Infrared is not used for determining the distance though. It's not a LIDAR (light radar) instead it is using infrared to help light up what you are pointing the camera at, so it can help it focus in low light. </p>
<p>Think of the infrared like an invisible flash used to help it see enough detail for the contrast autofocus to work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This message shouldn't be at the top. It miss phase change detection which is the better autofocus system and the one used on professional cameras. There are better ELI5s on this thread. </p></div>		</li>
