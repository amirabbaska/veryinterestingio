			<div class="markdown"><p>And before there was wood without bacteria to decompose it, there was algae that lacked oxygen to decompose it.</p>
<p>That algae fossilized and is largely what comprises the chalk in places like the Cliffs of Dover, but essentially most of the Co2 that got trapped was trapped in this process before there was adequate oxygen to do anything else with organic material.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Further, this would imply trees (wood) evolved before decaying bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly true, but wood has been used for some specific applications in space before.</p>
<p>For the extreme heat of re-entry the best solution is often to use ablative materials, which burn away slowly while providing lots of insulation. While the Americans deployed different advanced phenolic materials, the Russians and Chinese realized that heavy oak wood makes a great ablative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nose_cone

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting. I imagine the only reason to use wood in space is that it a) outperforms every other material on the planet, or b) is ridiculously less expensive, without sacrificing too much performance. Space isn't the place to cut corners on materials. Also, the weight to strength ratio of wood is usually much higher than other metals (like metal) -- just look at wood studs versus metal studs. Isn't the most expensive part of space travel in simply getting things into orbit? IIRC, even sending gold into space costs more than the gold itself, so the biggest cost savings would be in shaving weight.</p>

<p>Wood and other metals (like metal)....</p>
<p>Anyway, wood has a much lower strength to weight ratio then aluminum, steel, titanium, and many synthetic fibers.  With studs used in construction, the issues come from steel being made thin enough that it is much lighter than its wood equivalent.  If you want a real comparison of strength to weight ratio compare the sizes of free-standing wood-frame structures to the sizes of free-standing steel-frame structures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to keep in mind that, even if the wood is very cheap, you still have to take into account the fuel it needs to go to space. So maybe it would be better to spend more in a lighter material and save more money with the fuel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for teaching me a new meaning of a word! I learned 'ablative' as a case in Latin, but I had no idea that it has a scientific use through 'ablation' [ab (away) + latum (carried)]. That's really cool. :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm at work now, unless I'd draw up some graphs and tables for you (tried to find some information on this on my dropbox, but i could unfortunately not find it).<br />
So, for now I'll say this without sources; aluminium is great for lower temperatures, and it's tensile strength will actually improve in colder climate, you might see an increase from 300 MPa to 320-330 MPa (6-10 %) in the temperature range 0 to -80 dgr C. (All of this is dependant on the alloy, as aluminium is highly modifiable by a range of alloying elements) The elongation will however slightly decrease, giving a more brittle break in case of failure (not that drastically much within the area between 20 to -50 degrees C, maybe from 16 % to 11 %). This is well and great as temperatures on the moon dips all the way down to ~ -150 dgr C. There's however a big downside.  </p>
<p>With the added strength properties in lower temperatures, there's an even worse counterpart in higher temperatures. Up to ~60 dgr C there's no significant change (small changes, yes) in properties (and the operation temperature in most normal Al-structures are to be held within 75 dgr C, however, I believe certain alloys does deal with operation temperatures ranging to 125 dgr C). Up towards 100 dgr C there's a continuously decreasing set of mechanical properties, I don't want to give any numbers as I don't want to be wrong, but I'll say that it's a bigger decrease in mech.prop. from 0-100 dgr C than the increase from 0-(negative)100 dgr C. The real problem is however showing when the temperature surpasses 100 dgr C, and the decrease in the properties is much steeper by the Celsius than in lower temperatures.   </p>
<p>Temps. in the 100-range pose no immediate threats, but over time, it certainly does. As the temperature on the moon reaches 125 dgr C, I think the decrease in mechanical properties will be just within what's acceptable for a structure. I say this especially as we know that there's no oxidation problem without the oxygen, and a range of alloying elements is suddenly acceptable in greater amounts; leading to greater tolerance for high temperature and higher loads.  </p>
<p>When that is said, I don't see us building larger structures on the moon.</p>
<p>Please feel free to correct any of this, any of you with the knowledge.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://docs.engineeringtoolbox.com/documents/773/metal-modulus-elasticity.png" target="_blank">This graph</a> shows that the modulus (the ratio of force to deformation) decreses about 10% between -200 and 200 degC. The wood lost 60% of its integrity when going from 200degF back to room temperature (thats from 93 deg C down to 21, for you brits).</p>
<p>I'm by no means an expert, but I would definitely assume a non-organic structure would be more tolerant of heat fluctuations than organic. The complex structures of most organic material (cellulose in wood) is more likely to denature than the crystalline structure of metal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heating wood in water makes it very soft, steaming is how bent wood parts have been made for years. With the water vacuum boiled out, the wood would likely become much more rigid, having lost the moisture that softens the cellulose fibres.</p></div>		</li>
