			<div class="markdown"><p>Common in continental European crossings is continuous ticking sound that changes pace when it is safe to cross. If you can here the ticking you know you are at the crossing and  the system is working; faster ticking and the signal is in your favour.</p>
<p>In the UK they sometimes have a beeping sound that accompanies the green man safe to cross visual indicator, however this doesn't work for deaf-blind pedestrians and can confuse people if there are two nearby crossings. So on many crossings there is a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-ouch-22706881" target="_blank">small cone findable under the control box</a> with the buttons to request to cross. This cone rotates when the crossing is indicating it should be safe to cross.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this!  I had actually asked this question up in the thread before scrolling down to your post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are seeing-eye dogs capable of distinguishing and reacting to a &quot;walk&quot; sign versus a &quot;do not walk&quot; sign? (walking stick figure versus hand with countdown to cross-traffic)?</li>
<li>If a blind person and their dog are about to walk into traffic, should I speak up and say something?</li>
<li>If someone's dog led them into an active intersection and they did not realize it, should I mention it to them on the other side of the cross, or is that considered rude?</li>
</ul>
<p>The story that generated these questions:</p>
<p>A blind person with dog and I came to an intersection simultaneously, just as the flashing 'do not walk' sign counted down through 4-3-2-1 seconds (meaning cross traffic was about to start). I paused, but the blind person was led into the intersection by their dog just as traffic started flowing. I couldn't reach out and stop her or say anything useful, as I was on the opposite side of our street from one another (her left, me right, at the cross of two wide one-way streets).</p>
<p>Luckily, the drivers noticed and stopped in the middle of the intersection to let her cross, without even honking at her! My question, then, is &quot;should I have told her her dog almost got her killed?&quot; I ended up not saying anything - too many unknowns and I would have had to dodge across traffic to reach her.</p>
<p>From your post, it sounds like the answer is:</p>
<ul>
<li>no, the dog can't read signs and the two of them together mistook the situation</li>
<li>Yes, I should probably stop them if possible</li>
</ul></div>		</li>
