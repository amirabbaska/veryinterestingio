			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer.  They certainly do use their dive planes (along with forward motion) in order to change their depth.  Once on the surface, they push out the ballast water using the air from the surface, in order to stay buoyant and afloat on the surface.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No previous experience with sub sims here, but Ironwolf is very good from a general gaming perspective. Coming from a flight sim background, I’d say it has just enough complexity to keep you interested without too much of a learning curve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly correct, though it doesn't have to be a major emergency to blow tanks. I was on a decommissioning submarine (SSBN 622 James Monroe) and we were doing a cadet cruise for the Citadel in Charleston SC. We blew the tanks just to show off, I guess. When that happens the submarine pops up out of the water like a dolphin for maybe a third of it's length, and everything in the front tends to want to go to the back. I got soaked in teriyaki sauce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a stupid question.</p>
<p>No, hoisin sauce is stored in the bow because it's denser.  The teriyaki, as it is lighter per equal volume, goes just behind admidships, since that's where the very heavy reactor is.</p>
<p>The submariner here was probably astern of the teriyaki transfer system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Flaps&quot; are a generic term for any moving aerodynamic (or in this case, hydrodynamic) surface.  Elevators, rudders, aelerions, flaperons, tailerons, ruddervators, whatever, at all flaps.  Or if you want a silly one &quot;cowl flaps&quot;.  </p>
<p>The &quot;flaps&quot; control on an airplane starts to get more specific.  Probally becuase nobody came up with a beautiful french name for &quot;variable wing geometry&quot;.  </p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that flaps on conventional planes can decrease wing area, increase wing area, or do neither.  Depending on weather it's a conventional flap, split flap, fowler flap, or one of the even less common ones.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh you have a french word for roll control surfaces : Aileron - small wing. The other types of control surfaces are called &quot;Gouverne&quot;, so you have &quot;Gouverne de profondeur&quot; for pitch control and &quot;Gouverne de direction&quot; for yaw control. Flaps are called &quot;Volets&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
