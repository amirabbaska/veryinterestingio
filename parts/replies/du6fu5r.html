			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes the most sense to me. Because if you're working out one side more, sure, it would be bigger but not off center. I would image anyway. I could see it accounting for a small difference in alignment but not to the point that it's really even noticeable.</p>
<p>For instance, my right arm is more muscular than my left but the left arm's muscle isn't shaped differently, just smaller.</p>
<p>Thank you for you answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in the case of your arms, if you're right handed that's your answer right there. It's also important to note that your abs aren't little individual muscles. They are one giant muscle sectioned off by ligaments. The layout of these ligaments determines the symmetry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I donâ€™t completely agree with the above comment. Source: when I was younger I had quite symmetrical abs, after playing tennis for a while my right side developed more, including the way the abs formed. Not to mention my right arm (biceps) was bigger. </p>
<p>A genetical predisposition is exaggerated through subsequent movement and preference for a side that gets used more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's both genetics and exercise but the side that's worked more is going to look different than the other? Is that basically the idea?</p></div>		</li>
