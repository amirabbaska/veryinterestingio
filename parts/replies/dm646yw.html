			<div class="markdown"><p>At school my class learned to use the mid-height dot as a decimal point and the low dot as a compact multiplication symbol in complex equations. I'm starting to think maybe my teacher just got it the wrong way round. Not many actually wrote it that way because... it looks retarded to an English school child.</p>
<p>Mind you, most people had trouble with the difference between x and <em>x</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in our American school, we started out with x for multiplication. Just for 2nd or 3rd grade work. As soon as we started including variables, we'd upgrade to the mid-height dot to avoid confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think maybe the &quot;x&quot; as a multiplication symbol came from finding the area of things. Like a piece of wood that is 12&quot;x12&quot;. The x resembles &quot;by&quot;, 12 by 12.  So they just kept the x cause it was easy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But do the Europeans also use the comma for 000 separation?</p>
<p>I.e. I'd write 2,500.25</p>
<p>Would they write 2,500,25?</p>
<p>Not a big deal with small numbers, but larger ones (2,525,783.05 cf 2,525,783,05)</p>
<p>What about scientific notation? 1.05x10^23 or 1,05x10^23?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using the comma both as a decimal mark and for digit separation would be ambiguous. In Poland we use spaces, like: 2 525 783,05. I don't see a reason why scientific notation would use a diffrent decimal mark - it doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit archaic, but I meant more how ⋅ and * coincides peacefully with the decimal point these days, without any added confusion. So the initial worry, that the dot and the point together might be confusing.</p>
<p>Today, in our accepting world, dots and points can live in peace together, without being judged and persecuted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I rise to power everyone not writing numbers in Scientific Notation will be put up against the firing squad! And there will be several glorious civil wars regarding the correct number of digits!</p></div>		</li>
