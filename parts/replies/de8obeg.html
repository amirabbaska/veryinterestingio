			<div class="markdown"><p>I typically avoid coffee altogether because it tastes like burnt heartburn everywhere I go. I sampled coffee from a new local shop last week and was really impressed. Their coffee is smooth and every single intended layer of flavor makes itself known in perfect harmony. I had never experienced anything like it and have been craving it ever since.</p>
<p>The Barista explained how and why there are such different experiences based on how you treat the coffee and sometimes really subtle differences make a huge change to the flavor of the coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that coffee is one of those things where the end product is directly proportional to the quality and effort that goes in. </p>
<p>If you are unable or unwilling to invest in the time and effort required you can always resort to a quality bean to cup machine from a manufacturer like Saeco, Krups or Delonghi, they start at around 300 bucks but the incorporated burr grinder and the uniform brew unit inside the machine ensure that while the coffee you get is not as good as it could be it is still quite a decent and consistant cup. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish. My husband would die if I bought anything more than a $20 12 cup coffee maker. He actually prefers the burnt tang of sludge swill. He said the same coffee from the same shop &quot;didn't really taste like anything&quot;. He prefers some really stanky IPA beers too so I'm not surprised. We have very different tastes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got myself the smallest Delonghi espresso machine for less than $200. No burr grinder incorporated but that thing improved my mornings x1000%. I buy relatively small portions (for up to 5 days in advance/keeping it in airtight jar) of freshly ground coffee and bathe in cappucinos every day ever since. Happy days </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget, with nasty water it doesn't matter how good your beans, roast, or equipment is. The difference between well filtered water and unfiltered tap can alone make the difference between an delicious brew or hot brown water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You left out one of the most important factors, starting with good tasting water. If the coffee is brewed with tap water that tastes like ass then naturally the coffee will also taste like ass.</p></div>		</li>
