			<div class="markdown"><p>So much this. My guess is that OP is conflating an URI with &quot;the flu&quot; as it should be relatively impossible to get the flu twice in a single flu season. <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/about/flu/SymptomDifferences.pdf" target="_blank">Here's a reference that might be handy</a> (warning, link to pdf).</p>
<p>And the best answer here to why you can get the flu every year is from u/Cintramontane. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm" target="_blank">Here is a slightly more in depth explanation</a> from the CDC. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The flu isn't sneezing and bitching and still going to work. The flu is fever, joint pain, maybe a cough, and you feel fucked up, like a train smacked you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yuppp. Someone suggested to me today that I might have the flu cuz I have a cough and a scratchy throat. I was like no way, I've had the flu, and you feel like you're going to die. I barely ate for a week when I had the flu. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between having a cold and having the flu? If you had the flu and it started raining Â£50 notes ($61.46 bills), you wouldn't be able to get out of bed and go outside. </p></div>		</li>
