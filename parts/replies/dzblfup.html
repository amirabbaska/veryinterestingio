<p>Gravity has an infinite reach</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you saying that the gravity from every celestial body in every galaxy in existence is, in one way or another, reaching us right now? If so, that's mind boggling.</p>
<p>Edit: I hadn't thought of the fact that gravity travels at c when I originally asked the question, I have since been corrected in that only gravity from objects in the observable universe are reaching us right now. I also hadn't taken into account that since the universe is expanding faster than c, even some of that will never reach us. Still really cool stuff though and I greatly appreciate all the awesome responses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. So many of the higher comments are missing this part. It isn’t everything, it’s everything not in the part of the universe that’s expanding too quickly for its gravity to reach us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: is the effect of gravity immediate, or does it only act at the speed of light? Asked another way, if you removed the sun, would the change in its gravitational force on earth be immediate, or would the effect not occur until the 6-7 minutes it takes light to reach earth? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's about 8 mins 20 secs fyi. What's also cool is that if the Sun just disappeared we'd keep orbiting AND we'd still see it. We wouldn't be able to tell anything had happened until the light reached us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's even cooler is the way causality and time works.  From the point of reference of a human on the Earth, there's no meaningful difference between &quot;the Sun disappeared 8 minutes ago but it only affected us just now&quot; and &quot;the Sun disappeared just now and affected us instantly.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t really get this little bit of trivia. Isn’t it correct to say that this is at best a game of “what if?” in the sense that we would have absolutely no way of detecting the sun’s disappearance ahead of that 8 minute period anyway?</p>
<p>In other words, we would never be in a situation where we “know” the sun has disappeared prior to it actually disappearing from our perspective, right?</p>
<p>So I’m not even sure what it means to say this. I guess it’s kind of like when people say “look up at the stars; many of the stars you see have actually been gone for millions of years.” True that may be, are they really gone to us if it would be literally impossible for us to ever see them as not gone?</p></div>		</li>
