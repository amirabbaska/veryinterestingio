			<div class="markdown"><p>Except we no longer use calories, we use Joules which are 1m * 1N or 1 kg * m^2 * s^2, since that's way more convenient when actually doing any calculations that don't involve the heat capacity of water. A calorie is about 4.2J.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty important to note though that calories only have two uses: as a unit for energy to heat one millilitre/one litre of water (there's a small calorie and a large calorie, or kilocalorie) and for nutrition, which uses the large calorie. Of course, even the former use is pretty much non-existent because the Joule converts far easier into other equations, and because one calorie only approximately heats one millilitre of water over a narrow range of temperatures and pressures.</p>
<p>Which leaves the kilocalorie which we use in food, and even that could go the way of the dodo if people started thinking of food in terms of kilojoules, just as they might think of their height in metres and weight in kilograms.</p></div>		</li>
