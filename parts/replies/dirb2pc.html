			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a problem. But the problem is not the university or the student, it's the system that was set up. In the 70s we used to just fund university and education directly. Now we have shifted that burden straight to the students themselves with loans and removed the funding of the schools directly. </p>
<p>Sure this is cheaper for the government in the short run. But I think we are seeing the disastrous consequences of this now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. If you run a business that sells a product where demand is completely unaffected by price, what is your incentive to control costs and price? None. So schools charge as much as they please and enrollment is 100% year after year. Highschools, government, and parents are complicit in this racket. It has become the prevailing wisdom that higher education is fundamentally good at any cost.  Just take out crippling debt to attend the best school you can get into and you'll come out four years later to a rockstar job earning more than your parents who went to party state. Uncle Sam will still keep issuing absurd loans since no one in Washington can afford to exercise common sense and push for limits on student aid lest they be labeled the anti-education guy. Instead they will try to bail out student debt, which is massive now, rather than address the fundamental problems. We cannot keep giving 18 year olds, who know nothing about money, access to crippling debt so that they may major in basket weaving.  Turn off the tap and suddenly schools have incentive to stop raising tuition at rates that dwarf inflation. </p></div>		</li>
