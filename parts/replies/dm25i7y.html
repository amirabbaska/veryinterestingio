			<div class="markdown"><p>I can understand all that but say I wrote a book of history intended to be an educational book does a publisher ever ask for sources? Do they just leave it to the reading public to question and say &quot;How come this is the only book in existance that says X event happened&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any even slightly competent educational publisher will have fact-checkers and will request sources. If a book <em>is</em> the only book in existence that says something happened, if it's to have any value it's going to explain how the author reached that conclusion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is really important. You can write two totally different books that have totally different vibes on Christopher Columbus based on valid sources depending on who is doing the writing.</p></div>		</li>
