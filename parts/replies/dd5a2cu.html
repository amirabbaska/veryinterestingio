<p>People who live in <del>counties</del> districts where one party typically wins with something like 65% of the vote, calling about an issue with clear party lines as someone in the minority in that area simply won't make much of a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, but I was using the example that the 500 were your voters. If you do answer their call and do what they want, they may vote for you.</p>
<p>Calling does still make a difference anyway if enough people call. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point is that in practicality, it often doesn't.  Just like how people blame non-voters for Trump winning, despite the fact that most states  had large margins in one way or another.</p>
<p>My <del>county</del> district is like the one I described, and if you look at the map (and know the area) it's a pretty blatantly gerrymandered district at that.  Me calling my &quot;Freedom Caucus&quot; Congressman as a 'liberal' would do absolutely nothing to affect his actions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't know how you voted, since votes are private.  They may see you registered as the opposing party (if you are) but that's not certainty of what your vote was.</p></div>		</li>
