			<div class="markdown"><p>Man youbrits are weird... Jk, but is this system still common in Britain? Here in Canada (and most of the developed world as far as I know) we use hot water tanks. So cold water is fed from the city or town supply and brought into a sealed tank. The water in thattank is then heated using elements and kept under pressure. Because the tank is pressurized and sealed, it's just as safe as the supply water, unless you have a faulty tank. </p>
<p>We are also seeing <del>thankless</del> tankless hot water systems more and more. Where water is fed directly from the supply, through a heater and to the tap. This is more efficient t as it does not need to hold hot water for long periods of time, constantly keeping it warm, it instead heats the water as it is needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, those water heaters really are thankless. I will make a point to compliment my boiler on its good work every now and then from today.</p>
<p>The drinking cold water thing is kinda a habit for me now anyway. I don't see the point in breaking it either, because the few times i've tasted my hot water it was disgustingly warm tasting. Also most brits still use boilers, but i'm not really completely sure how they work tbh, I guess most of them work with small tanks for hot water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The coils from the hot water heater get covered in sediment so hot water is usually filled with more minerals making it taste strange possibly. Also colder beverages always taste smoother, even water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The system you describe works well with most common types of water heater, including parkrays, agas, etc. It also means that as long as the hot cylinder is warm more than one hot tap/bath etc can be run at once. The increasing use of combi-boilers cuts immediate costs, but needs more output or more boilers for larger properties. They also need to be of fairly specific design. My roof tank has lost its lid. Thanks for the reminder, I once had dead insects come out of the bathroom taps..  EDIT: autocorrect.</p></div>		</li>
