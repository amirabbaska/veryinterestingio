			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not OP, but I think OP was saying that the existing 16-hour work week made communism seem appealing.  </p>
<p>So it's not that 16 hour days are a communist ideal, but that the <em>backlash</em> against 16 hour days made communism seem like a good idea to the overburdened working class.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is no coincidence the that first 8 hour day was in 1856 Melbourne, Australia. It is the middle of the 1851-1860s gold rush. The rest of the economy suffered a worker shortage. If bosses wanted workers they had to increase pay and give better conditions.</p></div>		</li>
