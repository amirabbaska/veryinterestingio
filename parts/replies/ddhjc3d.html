			<div class="markdown"><p>This reply gets to the heart of the matter, but every time I see the word &quot;protest&quot; in this thread I feel like that particular word is an extremely unfortunate label of what people are doing, and why.</p>
<p>&quot;Protest&quot; is a negative word. It means you're saying you don't like something. That's perfectly rational, but it doesn't convey a sense of hope about the outcome, or even anything positive about people doing the protesting. It's closer to &quot;whining&quot; than &quot;constructively giving feedback&quot; in connotation.</p>
<p>Which is too bad.</p>
<p>You've made the case very clearly about why people protest, which is that, first, the point of protesting is to call attention to an issue that may be working against the interests of a large group of people, such as the average guy on the street.</p>
<p>Second, and this is the big one, it should remind people that, in groups, they are in fact powerful. They elect the people that represent them in congress. Every one of those seemingly untouchable (and out of touch) politicians could be gone at the next opportunity if they don't get reelected (see: Eric Cantor).</p>
<p>But, people need to exercise that right. People need to feel included and realize that, paradoxically, their individual vote probably doesn't matter, but as a group it absolutely does. So, it needs to be ingrained in people that in this particular arena we need to just act automatically and with a sense of obligation, knowing that collectively the voice of the nation will be heard (whether you agree with it or not), and things will progress appropriately.</p>
<p>P.S. I'm not talking about, &quot;if you don't vote, don't talk.&quot; That's an anti-intellectual way to shut down the conversation. I'm talking about, &quot;yeah, I know your vote doesn't really change the outcome, and mine doesn't either, but we're working for something bigger than ourselves, and it only works if we all do it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, there is a certain hypocrisy of not voting in the election, and then being mad that the person who won is doing what they promised they would do. I'm sure that if all the people that didn't vote because they were sure Hillary would win, or the people who voted for &quot;Giant Meteor&quot; or Harambe, decided to vote for Hillary, she would have won. Now, it's not guaranteed, I certainly don't know the exact breakdown of people who didn't vote, and there certainly is the possibility that these people would just add to her popular vote majority, but it makes it a lot more likely that she would have won.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>imo 'protest' while maybe not the best word...its agreed upon meaning changes if most people only use it a certain way.  To me it used to mean just that some people are trying to change the world in a positive way by exercising their rights.  I suppose I wasn't at protests of the past, but I always assigned this meaning.  Only more recent stuff like Occupy (I was excited about this until I visited one and realized it was taken over by opportunists looking for free shit) or the &quot;He is not my president&quot; protests have defined the word so low as &quot;I don't like this waaaaa I really don't like it! <em>whines</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>However, if you look at all the protesting going on, say, rather than watching the (likely crappy whiney) protests national news might show you, check out your local news and if they're covering anything nearby.  I've been amazing just how many small protests seem to be occurring which aren't very whiney and have legitimate concerns, most of which I've heard about through local news stations.</p></div>		</li>
