<p>This would hugely increase the number of planets with potential for live. But as you said, better to look for what we know is possible.</p>

<p>PS: Silicate lifeforms with hydrofluoric acid as a solvent seem cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>do we really know that, though? we used to think water was rare, too, but we've got 5 or 6 bodies just in our solar system that have substantial amounts of it. we don't really know how common things are in other solar systems since we've never been to any.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ones that work well with chemistry being done in them. If your solvent just doesn't allow some elements by reacting with them you don't get that chemistry.  </p>
<p>Also, it has to be an imaginable amount, can't use something so rare it isn't likely to every come together in an amount in one place to work. Hydrogen is great. Some rare fluid? On paper.. OK.. But if the elements that make it up are rare best of luck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note about water is that due to it's chemical properties, it's not hugely reactive itself(it certainly will react with many things, but not to the extent of many other elements/compunds), but if other chemicals are in the presence of water it's good at facilitating and promoting other reactions, somewhat like a catalyst.  That's why in a chemistry class or lab you see so many aqueous solutions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is just amazingly suited for life in so many ways. One of the most crucial properties of water that allows life on Earth to exist is the fact that the solid form of water (ice) floats on the liquid form. This is very unusual, and it is very beneficial to us, because if it were not the case, bodies of water would freeze solid. Instead, they just freeze at the top layer, allowing life to continue underneath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because oxygen in water acts completely differently from free oxygen. Free oxygen is a powerful energy source for life, while water doesn't react very much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense yes, however getting to that oxygen is particularly difficult. We can do so through electrolysis, but it costs at least as much energy as we would get from burning it with Hydrogen. You could win by using other fuels but there is that big loss to deal with.</p></div>		</li>
