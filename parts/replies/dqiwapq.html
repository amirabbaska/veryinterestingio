			<div class="markdown"><p>Can one properly diagnose the need to change the oil by how dirty it is on the dipstick? </p>
<p>Edit- question has been thoroughly answered. No barring spectrum analysis which is cost prohibitive for personal vehicles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Unless you take what's on the dipstick and lab test it. I have an old diesel that you can clean out, put fresh Amber oil in it, start it, and the oil is almost immediately visually indistinguishable from old oil. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you're doing a flush or something any diesel engine will make a new oil change black instantly. An oil change doesn't drain the old oil from the pump, lines, nooks, seals. It's gonna go black right away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this was how some of the first generation oil life sensors worked, it is not an effective measure of when oil needs to change. Your manual will tell you how often to change. Personally I always use high end synthetic with a high capacity filter and change my oil every 10k miles. I have done this for 3 cars of my cars and all have surpassed 150k miles without engine issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No offense, but 150k miles isn't super impressive, right? I've seen many Toyotas and Hondas (including my own) go past 200k no problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you say about time with oil change. Does the synthetics deteriorate over time? I put low Miles on my new F150 V8. Ie. 3500 miles in 9 months. Should i change it yearly? Or wait until 10k miles? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about time between oil changes? My commute to work is less than 5 miles, and I drive less than 80 miles a week. Even assuming I drove a lot more every week and we make it 100 miles, I still wouldn't hit 3000 miles for almost an entire year. My mechanic told me not to worry about it and the mileage is the only thing that matters, but considering most other people seem to get their oil changed like every 3 months I feel like I'm potentially damaging the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you drive it every day and are at least letting the engine get up to normal operating temp, you're probably fine. Personally, I'd change it every 6 months anyways, but that's erring on the side of caution.</p>
<p>If it's never getting up to normal operating temp, change it more often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. As long as it reaches operating temperature, usually between 175F and 210F, you are fine. You won't damage anything. If you are worried about it, you can do every six months, but you really don't have to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt the 5 minute drive is enough to get your car up to full temp. Oil takes a lot longer than coolant to warm up. If you get cold weather, itâ€™s even more unlikely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your commute is less than 5 miles and you drive less than 80 miles a week have you considered buying a bike? About 10 miles a day is very do-able. Or public transit if it exists where you live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is western New York. 6 months out of the year there's 2 feet of snow on the ground with negative temperatures. Even if I wanted to freeze my balls to a bicycle seat I don't think it would be possible to make it through the snow drifts.</p>
<p>Living here you pretty much have to have a car, even if it's just for the occasional trips to Buffalo. If you're gonna own a car and be making the payments, might as well actually use the thing rather than freezing your ass off on a bike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Listen to the mechanic. 20 years ago consumer reports did a <a href="http://www.xs11.com/xs11-info/xs11-info/articles/51-consumer-reportstruth-motor-oils-july-1996.html" target="_blank">test</a> with nyc cabs that drove a total of 4 1/2 million miles. They checked engine parts before the study with a micrometer and changed different oils at different intervals, and then tore the engines down again and rechecked them with a micrometer. They found that it was unnecessary to change oil at intervals less than every 7,500 miles and additives like slick 50 and STP oil treatment were basically a waste of money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds neat, but you ought to take into account that taxis have much different duty cycles than most commuter cars.  They're driving all day long, so even with all the stop and go they stay in a more constant state and cover that distance in a much shorter period of time.</p>
<p>Lots of engine wear occurs when the engine experiences cold starts.  Rapid temperature changes are also tough on engines, as the parts expand and contract at different rates before they reach equilibrium.</p>
<p>So it might not be that much of a surprise that a taxi could go about twice as long between oil changes if they're working 8+ hours once per day rather than 1 hour 2-3 times per day.</p></div>		</li>
