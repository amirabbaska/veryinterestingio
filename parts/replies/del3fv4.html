			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact of the matter is, being friendly with the Russian <em>people</em> would mean being <em>unfriendly</em> to Putin. </p>
<p>People who are naive often conflate the two.  But Putin =/= Russia.  His opposition in Russia is <em>underestimated</em> (because they suppress protests and largely misreport on opposition), and the support he has must be taken with a grain of salt; they do not have &quot;free&quot; elections, they do not have a free press, and they do not have freedom or transparency in any shape or form in their government, and so his supporters may admire him based on misinformation. </p>
<p>In nearly ever instance, someone in America who echoes that sentiment is A) A Donald Trump voter / supporter, and B) not really interested in Russia at all, but mostly seeing defending Russia as a proxy for defending Trump and/or their political views. </p>
<p>These people are shallow; they see things only in self-centered terms.  They likely did not follow or pay any attention to Russia before this election.  They see Putin as a political ally to Trump (and an enemy of Clinton and American liberalism), and therefore, he's their ally. </p>
<p>But just like, it appears, Trump himself, they have no idea what being an ally with Putin really means.  He is ruthlessly self-serving.  He has no sentiment - only ambition (at least on the political and geopolitical stage).  </p>
<p>In nearly every case, if you hear that sentiment in America, there is a strong chance that person knows or understands nothing about Russian politics, about Putin's history as a world leader, his actions domestically or abroad, or any of the very murky, very complex world of diplomacy with Russia in the modern age. </p>
<p>They are ignorant voters trying to justify their beliefs and actions, in an atmosphere that makes doing so increasingly difficult. </p>
<p>When the dam breaks on Trump and Russia, I suspect we'll see even more convoluted acts of mental twister to try and somehow justify the sitting US President ascending to power via the puppet strings of a hostile enemy state.  And most of these people understand, deep down, that that is an inevitability at this point - and they're laying the mental groundwork to protect themselves from that fallout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somehow I doubt the opposition to Putin is very strong. We American's mistakenly believed there were a lot of Soviets who secretly hated their totalitarian communist system. In reality, they lived fairly stable, content lives. So, when that was ripped away from them during the fall of the Soviet Union, they craved a strong leader to bring them order. This, along with young and weak institutions, allowed for Putin's rise. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That line is spoken largely by people from a position of utter lack of knowledge of foreign affairs.</p>
<p>The US can cooperate with Russia on areas like countering Islamic terrorism.</p>
<p>However, on other issues, the US and Russia are archrivals in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Government</li>
<li>Ideology</li>
<li>Geopolitical allies</li>
<li>Conventional and nuclear weaponry</li>
</ul>
<p>The US and Russia share little in terms of culture, interests, and friends on the world stage. Russia is one of the few nations that is an existential threat to the United States. They've shown zero interest in advancing or supporting American interests worldwide except in a few narrow areas that the two sides already cooperate on.</p>
<p>In sum, they are geopolitical rivals, and so cozying up to Russia over fighting terrorism is shortsighted at best, outright dangerous at worst.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What fucking arrogance</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Any why the fuck should they. Why should the world be beholden to the advancement of 'American interests', as those interests generally run contrary to the interests of most nations on the planet.</p>
<p>American esposed free market capitalism has spent the decades since the end of the USSR gutting and plundering Russian industrial infrastructure (facilitated by that drunken lacky Yeltsin), all while the American military complex has tried to ringfence the country in with bases and missile 'defence' systems - and you wonder why the country becomes resistant to your values and 'interests'.</p>
<p>I for one am happy to see a resurgent Russia that can act as the necessary counterbalance that actually makes America stop and think. The years since the fall of the USSR (with illegal war after illegal war) clearly demonstrated the US could not be trusted to treat their position as sole 'super power' responsibly.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with being friendly with Russia, as long as it is a partnership based on mutual respect. Any friendship/partnership that mitigates the risks of a hot war is to be supported.</p>
<p>The opposite line is spoken largely by people from a position of utterly moronic American exceptionalism</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that it looks like they're having <em>secret</em> and <strong>private</strong> meetings with the Russians.  The accusations are that they're doing this for <em>personal gain</em> rather than to secure a better relationship between the countries for the greater good.  There's also suspicions that they were aware of the Russians trying to manipulate our elections process.</p>
<p>These all go well beyond &quot;being friendly with Russia&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further amplify on this good ELI5 answer:</p>
<p>The US has cozied up to countries that have done these things before.  They're distasteful, but we find a way to look the other way when it meets our long-term goals (Saudi Arabia, old Iran, Israel, we're looking at you).</p>
<p>However, (a) Putin wants the &quot;good old days&quot; of &quot;Soviet-style&quot; dominance and sphere-of-influence to come back.  Russia/USSR was our mortal enemy for a bulk of the last century--the US <em>does NOT</em> want Russia to have the range of influence in other countries where WE want to be &quot;the big man&quot; there.</p>
<p>(b) Russia has nukes.  Many of the other countries we blow off/ignore/work with don't, so we can control/&quot;lean on&quot; them with our world-class military, or bribe them with money or aid of some sort.  This won't work with Putin or the Russian Federation, as they have plenty of nukes, and money.  We can't &quot;control&quot; them through the normal means, and that's a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How many innocent countries has the US invaded since WWII ended?
Was it OK to fight Viet Nam and Iraq?</p>
<p>The US Monroe Doctrine told the world that this was OUR Hemisphere, and they should keep out. Russia is merely preserving ITS traditional sphere of influence.</p>
<p>When US States tried to back out of the Union, we had a bloody Civil War to bring them back. How is that different from Russian trying to reclaim parts which have seceded?</p>
<p>Why do we have this double standard?</p>
<p>It's not as though we refuse to be friends with dictators. We set them up and supported them throughout the world. Iran, Saudi Arabia, Viet Nam, Korea, and don't even start me on South America.</p>
<p>If this is all merely a Macchiavelian ploy to bring down our current Liar-In-Chief, fine. I just hope it doesn't stoke a new Cold (or Hot) War.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US has done horrible things.   The condemnation of Trump being friendly with Russia isn't so much a moral one, it's a logical one.   </p>
<p>A man who has pissed on allies for no reason is suddenly friendly with Russia, the country which attempted to undermine our election in Trumps favour, and who a good chunk of Trumps cabinet has business ties to.  It is geo-politically alarming, regardless of how you feel about Putin morally.   </p></div>		</li>
