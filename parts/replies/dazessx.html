<p>To add: also sugar, salt, cotton, paper, etc... most things that are white are essentially made up of millions of little transparent lenses that refract light randomly in all directions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The distinction is &quot;white&quot; vs &quot;clear.&quot; Something is clear if it doesn't scatter light and doesn't absorb in the visible (e.g., molten sugar). Scattering makes it appear white, since it is effectively &quot;reflecting&quot; all parts of the spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>She made it to prove the point when people didn't believe her about water being blue. She was an odd and amazing teacher.</p></div>		</li>

<p>water and ice absorb the red part of the spectrum more strongly</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>That's not completely accurate. The stretching peaks of O-H-O lie much further into the infrared at about 2900nm. However, this transition then has additional overtones. The second of these overtones peaks at about 970cm. The tail of this overtone stretches into the visible, where it quickly falls off as you move from the red to the blue part of the spectrum. This fact explains both why red light is absorbed more strongly, but also why the total absorption is so weak. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once got into a debate with a friend about this. They argued that the blue was an extensive property due to Raleigh scattering and that we couldn't really call water blue, it was clear. I argued that red was being absorbed and blue was reflected to our eyes, the very definition of color. Even at small amounts, more blue light is reflected than red. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most direct answer is molecular structure. Molecular structure determines what wavelengths of light are absorbed and which aren't. Aromatic rings, for example, tend to absorb UV light. When conjugated correctly, the can be vibrant colors, as well as metallic coordinates which are also bright, such as permanganate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The exact reason water absorbs small amounts of red light is that the energy required to excite vibrational states of water match up with the energy in red photons. Fun fact if you swap the protons on water for deuterium, a proton and a neutron, the vibrational absorptions no longer match up with red photons making deuterated water clear instead of slightly blue. It is one of few examples where an isotope effect can be macroscopically observed.</p></div>		</li>
