			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok I can see the sense in that. Is it possible that those &quot;shortcuts&quot; are new pathways the brain creates in order to help solve the problem of not understanding something? Or was the pathway always there and the brain just figured out that was the easiest way to do it? Either way thanks for the explanation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to say. But the area you'd want to look at is dendritic spines. These rather adorable protrusions from the input area of the neuron vary in size and number. How they grow, how their neighboring spines grow, where the input comes from, and even how their &quot;necks&quot; stretch when they're bored for a long time affect how signals propagate through the neuron and ultimately through the brain. </p>
<p>The street analogy is a good one. But it should be seen as a metaphor. The streets are how information travels. And the cool thing with the brain is that more than one piece of info travels at the same time, sorta like lots of cars on the road. </p>
<p>Well imagine two streets run next to each other and some friends are traveling on them, one friend on one road and another friend on the other. They'll park and wave at each other for a moment. There's a big ditch separating them. Well, if other friends show up on both sides, and the waving continues, like magic, a bridge appears over the ditch. Now the friends get to drive to each other. They've made a new connection. </p>
<p>It'll be much easier in the future for friends to travel back and forth over that bridge. How wide the bridge is and how sturdy it is will depend on how often the cars pass over it. Also other roads can connect to the bridge and the bridge can grow onramps connecting to different roads. Together this all forms the network of concepts, memories, and understanding. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: this was also my understanding of the way brains worked with their neural pathways being formed. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you saying there are &quot;streets&quot; in our brain that these little &quot;cars&quot; don't know about until discovering them or are they created during the &quot;a-ha&quot; moment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>often times though, it'll click at that moment, but it may be lost the next day when trying to view the same illusion and have to be discovered again. Did the pathway get lost?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Part of learning is that your brain creates new pathways. So if it went A to B to C before but that doesn't cut it for this one, then it might go A to D to C. Someone posted something a while ago about this but I can't find it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1sDjWfDa4w" target="_blank">This</a> explains it a bit.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is how drugs affect the brain. Some drugs not only alter the neural pathways but can screw them up pretty bad. So drugs are bad, mmkay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except for psychedelics and shrooms. Especially shrooms.</p>
<p>I could tell after I had that heroic dose my brain was rewired into new compartments it didnt notice before. Every day scenes felt more alive, more humor to be found and I have newfound respect for anything that is alive and not alive. Not quite the same level as lsd zen mode profundity but on a much more personal level of spirituality. Think atma/brahman/soul spark and you'll get the idea. </p>
<p>Also there is much greater appreciation for art and music and my depression has literally gone to the clouds. Now it's like there's not much pain to deal with. </p>
<p>But yeah any hard drugs that are not specifically targeting the ht2-a receptors and increase dopamine levels will always create issues. </p>
<p>Non ssri serotoninergics - not so much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just wanted to say really quickly that &quot;drugs&quot; is such a wide term, and saying that all of them is bad is just wrong. Some drugs can help people tremendously. I recommend a quick read on <a href="http://www.maps.org/research" target="_blank">MAPS</a>' research page.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna have to disagree with you here and say Spreading Activation Theory is better suited to explaining why when asked to say the first word to that comes to mind like cat, the person says dog. It suggests that concepts, ideas, and things that are closely related are located in our brain closely together which is why dog comes up immediately.
A different answer I would suggest is under Jean Piaget's Cognitive Theory. Basically, when we cannot understand something its because the concept, idea, or thing is difficult to place into our existing schemas. Thus our brains need time to either create new schema or adjust previous schema to accommodate it. My guess is when our brains create new schema for these new concepts it takes time to create them and during the process we realize they actually resemble a preexisting schema and that moment is that clicking moment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am by no means an expert but took a bunch of LSD while learning about the brain so... Hear me out.</p>
<p>I've found it easier to think about thinking using a jungle filled with unconnected tribes as a starting point. Every tribe represents a type of sensory input. A thought is like a person traveling between tribes on foot. When a person reaches another tribe it is an exciting feeling because a connection has been made. </p>
<p>For instance, the connection between what macaroni and cheese looks like, smells like, and tastes like. When new sensory input enters the smell tribe, people rush out to the connected tribes for the taste and the look and everyone gets very excited. Paths start to form like dirt paths. But if you start eating macaroni and cheese all the time these paths become paved and can handle a lot of traffic. It's no longer as exciting.</p>
<p>That's a very basic &quot;click&quot;. But I don't think that word goes as far as an epiphany to describe a wide ranging &quot;click&quot; that brings together massive networks of &quot;tribes&quot;. Imagine the connections made when Galileo first saw Jupiter through a telescope and realized it had many moons, or when Edwin Hubble realized all of the galaxies were moving away from each other. These set off a chain reaction in the brain which is a very exciting feeling.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's the best I can do. This model makes it easier for me to understand what is happening in the brain. I am curious if you'd find this useful since your comment inspired me to write this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for taking the time to reply, it's obvious you're interested in the workings of the brain. What you're describing with your tribe example is actually long term potentiation(LTP). LTP allows connections between neurons to require less stimulation to activate thus making it easier to use them. LTP occurs when we repeated use those connections and thus forms the &quot;paved&quot; pathways you describe. This is not so much as a &quot;clicking&quot; as it is, for example, getting faster at typing. </p>
<p>Here's an ELI5 Model of my previous explanation that might be more clear.
Lets say you are a clay sculptor and you have three types of categories (animal, building, and plant sculptures). One day you are given a description to make a new sculpture. It's a T-Rex but you don't know that and have never even seen one. As you read the description you use your previous categories to help figure out where to start. Eventually, it &quot;clicks&quot; that the T-Rex is similar to your animal category and then you understand a basis of how to examine the details. This is called accommodation where luckily you had a category that the T-Rex could fit into. Now if you were given the task of sculpting an xbox one, you wouldn't know which category to put it in. Thus you make a new pile, new category and never get that &quot;click&quot;. Again, the &quot;click&quot; is when you are making a new pile in your head but then realize it actually could fit in a preexisting pile. Like figuring out fruits can go into the plants pile.
