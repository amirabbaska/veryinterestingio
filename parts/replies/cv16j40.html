			<div class="markdown"><p>As a fellow Freemason I find that this is the best answer posted that really explains what we do as Mason's. We are not a social club and we do not meet in order to exchange business contacts or for networking, that is quite frowned upon and is considered un-masonic conduct, as you should not be joining a lodge for the purpose of self-interest.</p></div>		</li>
