			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. My family and friends all got food poisoning from eating improperly stored reheated rice in Indian takeout. Everyone got sick in direct proportion to the amount of rice they ate. Our youngest had a spoonful of it and had a bit of the runs. Everyone else had a shit ton. </p>
<p>2 bathrooms, 7 people shitting and barfing their guts out. My wife had to throw up out the front door. I swear we almost fucking died. We still talk about that day. </p>
<p>So anyway... yes. You’re right. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Indian takeout</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brother visited India for business with a friend from there. The village was really excited and installed their first western toilet. They were vegetarians and wanted to cook up a bunch of meat dishes for their special guest. He contracted severe food poisoning several hours from any hospital, air conditioning, or treated water. Several days went by as he laid in a poorly ventilated room, +90 degree heat, friendly people trying to bring food, puking, and crapping his brains out. Finally he called a cab to drive him to a hotel in Delhi. He decided not to invest in that venture. He will not go back to India.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good thing the youngest didn't have much. Food poisoning can most definitely kill you, or at least make you require a hospital visit to survive. As with most things, the very young and very elderly are in the most danger if they get food poisoning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was extremely close to having to go to the ER last week with food poisoning. After 12 hours of diarrhea and vomiting and being unable to hold anything down incl. water I had an extreme headache, fever, and cold sweats. Luckily I was finally able to hold water down somewhat and in hind sight I really should have gone to an emergency clinic or similar for an IV. Took me out for a day and a half and is one of the most miserable experiences I've had. I would rank it over the flu in terms of severity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This confuses me tbh. I've honestly never had a problem with eating rice left out for hours and hours then nuked in a microwave or cooked into fried rice or whatever. And my family's been doing that for basically my entire life.</p>
<p>How does that work out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people are more susceptible. My Asian wife and I ate the same dish in Thailand. I seriously nearly died. Lost 25 lbs in one month and was in the hospital three times in 6 weeks. She had zero symptoms. She leaves rice out all the time overnight, etc. I won't eat it now that I went through that ordeal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Asian family. Mom cooks a huge pot and leaves it out, often times overnight in the rice cooker. Reheat and eat again for lunch tomorrow. She does this with meat stews too. But will bring it back to a boil before leaving it out overnight, especially if we touched it with a ladle or spoon. Not saying this is safe at all, but I haven't had any problems ever. Unless in killing myself in micro doses. I'll let you know when I die.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've also done the overnight thing myself, never gotten sick from it.</p>
