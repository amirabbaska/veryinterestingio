			<div class="markdown"><p>What, really?  So we are talking Data Link here, as in repeaters/amplifiers of some type are doing quality checks?  And why would processing of any type be involved?  </p>
<p>Explain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Layer2 devices, so mostly switches, but there are some other types too.</p>
<p>Routers do the routing but in-between there are a ton of switches which move traffic back and forth which don't show up as hops.</p>
<p>And by processing, I simply mean, moving of the packets. I'm not talking about inspection or quality checks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are sending a packet over any fiber line longer than 40km you are going to go through repeaters, which are Layer 1 devices in the OSI model. You will also likley be on DWDM gear (wave division multiplexing) which is more layer 1 gear, often not passive. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>By definition a router routes.  Routers generally do not allow multiple interfaces to reside on the same subnet.</p>
<p>/pedantry</p>
<p>Also, layer 2 devices that bridge or switch use very little electricity to do so.  The processing will typically happen in a highly optimized ASIC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IPv6 does change the structure of the Internet at least as far as BGP is concerned. Specifically, there should be greater aggregation since larger host networks won't need to be made up of several fragmented IPv4 ranges. This provides a smaller routing table which can result in faster service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a logical perspective yes.</p>
<p>But from  physical perspective routers are still used to get primarily from one place to another, from edge to core to edge and IPv6 isn't going to change how people build out the physical side of networks (at least, not yet). </p></div>		</li>
