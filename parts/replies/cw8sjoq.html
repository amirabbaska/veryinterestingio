			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the type of injury is a factor as well, a paper cut is a shallow injury that occurs at the same level as the sensitive nerve endings that lie within your skin. If you were to instead receive a deep gash from a knife, it would actually not hurt as bad right away, because the injury completely severed a lot of the nerve connections in the skin in the area of the injury, and it goes deep enough to where there are not as many nerves to register the pain. </p>
<p>You can also only register one major pain at a time, and an existing dull pain can be overridden (albeit temporarily) by a new sharp pain. </p>
<p>And then, there is the factor that /u/barbodelli mentioned, that your body releases natural pain killers to suppress the pain from damage to your body, though it can only do so for a short period of time, in a finite capacity. This is an evolutionary survival trait related to fight or flight that allows you to still flee if the fight is no longer in your favor. The pain reducing effects of dopamine and adrenaline tend to exist for a few minutes, to about 10-15 minutes at best, which is just enough time to run from a threat and take cover. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This phenomenon is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_noxious_inhibitory_control" target="_blank">diffuse noxious inhibitory control/DNIC</a>, or more commonly as conditioned pain modulation. This phenomenon relies on the intact functioning of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438899800658" target="_blank">descending pain modulation</a>. In most chronic pain patients, the overall activity of central pain circuits become hyperexcitable, whereby descending pain modulation becomes more pro-nociceptive rather than inhibitory. Studies have shown that in patients that suffer from chronic pain, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304395905004185" target="_blank">DNIC is no longer a phenomenon that can be observed</a>. And as a result of this chronic pain patients can suffer from <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.22026/full" target="_blank">widespread pain</a>, meaning they can experience pain from more than one location of the body.  </p>
<p>So, technically you are right that 'you can only register one pain at a time', which is known as DNIC. However it is also true that in people who suffer from a lot of pain for a long time, they can also experience pain everywhere all at once. It is important to know the difference between the subject groups (i.e. general population vs. pain patients). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't sound right. Even if you rinse the cut out for several minutes it'll still sting pretty good afterwards. I'd imagine that the pain is related to how clean a cut is.  A cut from a sharp blade hurts significantly less than a cut from a dull blade despite the fact that the sharp blade would be more likely to have metal shavings still attached to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Long drawn out sciency answer:</p>
<p>Dopamine is not considered a natural pain killer. During injury, the nerves in the peripheral nervous system (Everything but the brain pretty much), release endogenous opioids (Natural endorphins) which bind the an opioid receptor called the μ-subtype opioid receptors. This causes the pain transmitting neurotransmitter (Tachykinin peptide) to no longer be released/lower the released amount greatly.</p>
<p>The brain might be where you're getting the dopamine from, because it is involved! Instead of inhibiting Tachykinin peptides, the opioids in the brain are released, bind to the same receptor subtypes, and instead inhibit GABA release. This in turn causes an excess in dopamine, which causes pleasure, And in turn, it can cause a pain killing effect, but the pain killing effect is most closely related to the NT activity in the PNS. Most of the increased pain later on is caused by swelling and other various factors, not so much that the supply is limited (It is, but not necessarily to that extent). The brain and nervous system are constantly breaking down opioids to recycle them again.</p>
<p>Also, heroin is an opiate, and is not dopamine based nor is it found in heroin. The ingested heroin acts almost identically to the way our endogenous opioids act when we are injured like I explained above but it happens on a much larger scale. Same cascade of Opioid binds to receptors --&gt; inhibits GABA release --&gt; excess in dopamine levels causes pleasure. </p>
<p>Actual ELI5 answer:</p>
<p>Dopamine (The pleasure chemical)  is only released in the brain as a result of a chain reaction and has nothing to do with the actual injury site. Heroin also contains natural pain killers (Not the pleasure chemical) and causes a release of the pleasure chemical similar to the way an injury would but on a larger scale.</p>
