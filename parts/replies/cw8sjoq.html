			<p>What determines if the dopamine is released or how much? For example, if I get a paper cut I notice it immediately and it hurts. But yesterday I scraped my finger off something and didn't notice until much later on when it began to hurt.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, the type of injury is a factor as well, a paper cut is a shallow injury that occurs at the same level as the sensitive nerve endings that lie within your skin. If you were to instead receive a deep gash from a knife, it would actually not hurt as bad right away, because the injury completely severed a lot of the nerve connections in the skin in the area of the injury, and it goes deep enough to where there are not as many nerves to register the pain. <br><br>You can also only register one major pain at a time, and an existing dull pain can be overridden (albeit temporarily) by a new sharp pain. <br><br>And then, there is the factor that /u/barbodelli mentioned, that your body releases natural pain killers to suppress the pain from damage to your body, though it can only do so for a short period of time, in a finite capacity. This is an evolutionary survival trait related to fight or flight that allows you to still flee if the fight is no longer in your favor. The pain reducing effects of dopamine and adrenaline tend to exist for a few minutes, to about 10-15 minutes at best, which is just enough time to run from a threat and take cover. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, If I get a pin prick or a paper cut, Ill pull my hand back and flinch, but when I accidentally sliced my hand open with a shitty pocket knife trying to pop a zip tie, I didnt even feel any pain, just pressure and warmth, looked down, saw that I could make my hand talk like a puppet by moving it, and was like &quot;Oh well...damn this kinda sucks, guess I need to go to the hospital now...&quot;<br><br>wasnt until a day or two after than the dull throbbing set in. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;You can also only register one major pain at a time, and an existing dull pain can be overridden (albeit temporarily) by a new sharp pain.<br><br>This phenomenon is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_noxious_inhibitory_control" target="_blank">diffuse noxious inhibitory control/DNIC</a>, or more commonly as conditioned pain modulation. This phenomenon relies on the intact functioning of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438899800658" target="_blank">descending pain modulation</a>. In most chronic pain patients, the overall activity of central pain circuits become hyperexcitable, whereby descending pain modulation becomes more pro-nociceptive rather than inhibitory. Studies have shown that in patients that suffer from chronic pain, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304395905004185" target="_blank">DNIC is no longer a phenomenon that can be observed</a>. And as a result of this chronic pain patients can suffer from <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.22026/full" target="_blank">widespread pain</a>, meaning they can experience pain from more than one location of the body.  <br><br>So, technically you are right that 'you can only register one pain at a time', which is known as DNIC. However it is also true that in people who suffer from a lot of pain for a long time, they can also experience pain everywhere all at once. It is important to know the difference between the subject groups (i.e. general population vs. pain patients). </p>		</li>

			<p>As someone with a lot of pain for a long time, I find this extremely interesting, and horrifying. Perhaps this will get worse with time, but now at least I find that while I am aware of pain in several areas, it's not all that clear.<br><br>I only noticed this when I started seeing a PT who did a lot to help problem areas in my body. Problem was, on Tuesday he'd fix my knee, and I'd come in Thursday screaming about how all of a sudden I can feel how bad my hip hurts and make it stop. <br><br>And really, I think that is a blessing. If my worst pain didn't eclipse my moderate-yet-still-very-painful-pain, I don't think I would be as functional as I am, which is not very. <br><br>But then again, perhaps the constant supply of opiates seeping into my skin helps with that too.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for sharing your story. <br><br>One theory that underlie persistent and widespread pain is that 'central sensitisation' of pain circuits occur after the original injury/inflammation, and this sensitisation can further prime the neurons in the brain to fire more readily in response to a second injury. This is an emerging field of research and scientists are trying to come up with targets that can stop central sensitisation from occuring. Maybe one day you won't have to rely on opiate patches anymore, and I hope this day comes soon!</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes. In fact,  most drugs we have currently only target the immune system in the periphery, because these drugs are typically too big to cross the blood brain barrier. Therefore, pain can be maintained without any inflammation in the periphery, and it is all down to inflammation in the central nervous system which the drug can't target. <br><br>I am on mobile at the moment but u am happy to cite examples once I am home on a computer :)</p>		</li>

			<p>This is true, but also when skin is opened, blood vessels are opened too and this causes the infiltration of immune cells into the site of injury. Immune cells can secrete various pro-inflammatory chemicals, these chemicals can activate nociceptors (a specialised neurones responsible for pain transmission), which causes pain. </p>		</li>

			<p>That doesn't sound right. Even if you rinse the cut out for several minutes it'll still sting pretty good afterwards. I'd imagine that the pain is related to how clean a cut is.  A cut from a sharp blade hurts significantly less than a cut from a dull blade despite the fact that the sharp blade would be more likely to have metal shavings still attached to it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Long drawn out sciency answer:<br><br>Dopamine is not considered a natural pain killer. During injury, the nerves in the peripheral nervous system (Everything but the brain pretty much), release endogenous opioids (Natural endorphins) which bind the an opioid receptor called the μ-subtype opioid receptors. This causes the pain transmitting neurotransmitter (Tachykinin peptide) to no longer be released/lower the released amount greatly.<br><br>The brain might be where you're getting the dopamine from, because it is involved! Instead of inhibiting Tachykinin peptides, the opioids in the brain are released, bind to the same receptor subtypes, and instead inhibit GABA release. This in turn causes an excess in dopamine, which causes pleasure, And in turn, it can cause a pain killing effect, but the pain killing effect is most closely related to the NT activity in the PNS. Most of the increased pain later on is caused by swelling and other various factors, not so much that the supply is limited (It is, but not necessarily to that extent). The brain and nervous system are constantly breaking down opioids to recycle them again.<br><br>Also, heroin is an opiate, and is not dopamine based nor is it found in heroin. The ingested heroin acts almost identically to the way our endogenous opioids act when we are injured like I explained above but it happens on a much larger scale. Same cascade of Opioid binds to receptors --&gt; inhibits GABA release --&gt; excess in dopamine levels causes pleasure. <br><br>Actual ELI5 answer:<br><br> Dopamine (The pleasure chemical)  is only released in the brain as a result of a chain reaction and has nothing to do with the actual injury site. Heroin also contains natural pain killers (Not the pleasure chemical) and causes a release of the pleasure chemical similar to the way an injury would but on a larger scale.<br><br>Source: <br><br><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3104618/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3104618/</a> and Neuroscience undergraduate student!<br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Pain as a result of nerve damage is called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is a significant clinical issue because the only drug we currently have that specifically alleviates this is gabapentin, which is a very nasty drug.<br><br>As to why neuropathic pain occurs, firstly it is important to understand the sequence of events that occur after a nerve is damage. As a nerve is 'cut', <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304395997000195" target="_blank">Wallerian degeneration</a> occurs. This forms a glial scar (glial cells make up 90% of cells in the central nervous system, they are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system that repsond to injuries). <br><br>Specifically, microglia and astrocytes (major subtypes of glial cells) can produce release inflammatory mediators (cytokines or chemokines) that can cause pain by 1) directly sensitise nerve endings, causing the neurons to fire more; 2) recruit and attract more glial cells to the site of injury and amplify the release of inflammatory mediators and 3) activate oher signalling molecules such as glutamate and substance P, which have a role in the sensitisation of pain <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n11/abs/nn1992.html" target="_blank">source</a>. <br><br>&gt;in the peripheral nervous system they can regenerate and reestablish a connection, whereupon you'd perceive pain<br><br>Whether the neurons, in both peripheral and central nervous system regenerate or not, it is not known the 'success rate' of restablishing the original connection. In fact, most likely these neurons are redirected to form new synapses, and the outcome of this on pain is far more complex, and is one of the current focus in pain research. </p>		</li>
