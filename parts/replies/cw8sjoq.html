			<p>What determines if the dopamine is released or how much? For example, if I get a paper cut I notice it immediately and it hurts. But yesterday I scraped my finger off something and didn't notice until much later on when it began to hurt.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, the type of injury is a factor as well, a paper cut is a shallow injury that occurs at the same level as the sensitive nerve endings that lie within your skin. If you were to instead receive a deep gash from a knife, it would actually not hurt as bad right away, because the injury completely severed a lot of the nerve connections in the skin in the area of the injury, and it goes deep enough to where there are not as many nerves to register the pain. <br><br>You can also only register one major pain at a time, and an existing dull pain can be overridden (albeit temporarily) by a new sharp pain. <br><br>And then, there is the factor that /u/barbodelli mentioned, that your body releases natural pain killers to suppress the pain from damage to your body, though it can only do so for a short period of time, in a finite capacity. This is an evolutionary survival trait related to fight or flight that allows you to still flee if the fight is no longer in your favor. The pain reducing effects of dopamine and adrenaline tend to exist for a few minutes, to about 10-15 minutes at best, which is just enough time to run from a threat and take cover. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Can confirm about deep gashes. I cut hair and somehow cut a massive chunk into my knuckle. Didn't feel it or notice until blood started gushing all over my hand. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, If I get a pin prick or a paper cut, Ill pull my hand back and flinch, but when I accidentally sliced my hand open with a shitty pocket knife trying to pop a zip tie, I didnt even feel any pain, just pressure and warmth, looked down, saw that I could make my hand talk like a puppet by moving it, and was like &quot;Oh well...damn this kinda sucks, guess I need to go to the hospital now...&quot;<br><br>wasnt until a day or two after than the dull throbbing set in. </p>		</li>

			<p>This. I sliced myself playing with a switchblade on vacation with the lady friend, didn't realise how badly I was cut until I had purchased a pound and a half of fudge and walked outside. Somebody pointed out a blood trail and I went back in to ask for medical assistance. If they didn't have the gauze and antibiotic cream I wouldv had to go to the hospital and get stitches </p>		</li>

			<p>I still have the scar on my hand from where I shoved a razor blade into it trying to <em>catch it after dropping it</em> while trying to remove the registration sticker from my car.<br><br>Didn't even feel it until <em>zomg so much blood</em>. It throbbed for days.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yea I have cut myself by accident with box cutters a few times and it hurt like a bitch but the one time I was sledding and ripped an inch wide and 15 inch long gash on my leg. I thought it was a scratch and it didn't hurt really at all. Then I looked and holy shit but I was able to run up the hill just fine.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;You can also only register one major pain at a time, and an existing dull pain can be overridden (albeit temporarily) by a new sharp pain.<br><br>This phenomenon is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_noxious_inhibitory_control" target="_blank">diffuse noxious inhibitory control/DNIC</a>, or more commonly as conditioned pain modulation. This phenomenon relies on the intact functioning of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438899800658" target="_blank">descending pain modulation</a>. In most chronic pain patients, the overall activity of central pain circuits become hyperexcitable, whereby descending pain modulation becomes more pro-nociceptive rather than inhibitory. Studies have shown that in patients that suffer from chronic pain, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304395905004185" target="_blank">DNIC is no longer a phenomenon that can be observed</a>. And as a result of this chronic pain patients can suffer from <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.22026/full" target="_blank">widespread pain</a>, meaning they can experience pain from more than one location of the body.  <br><br>So, technically you are right that 'you can only register one pain at a time', which is known as DNIC. However it is also true that in people who suffer from a lot of pain for a long time, they can also experience pain everywhere all at once. It is important to know the difference between the subject groups (i.e. general population vs. pain patients). </p>		</li>

			<p>As someone with a lot of pain for a long time, I find this extremely interesting, and horrifying. Perhaps this will get worse with time, but now at least I find that while I am aware of pain in several areas, it's not all that clear.<br><br>I only noticed this when I started seeing a PT who did a lot to help problem areas in my body. Problem was, on Tuesday he'd fix my knee, and I'd come in Thursday screaming about how all of a sudden I can feel how bad my hip hurts and make it stop. <br><br>And really, I think that is a blessing. If my worst pain didn't eclipse my moderate-yet-still-very-painful-pain, I don't think I would be as functional as I am, which is not very. <br><br>But then again, perhaps the constant supply of opiates seeping into my skin helps with that too.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for sharing your story. <br><br>One theory that underlie persistent and widespread pain is that 'central sensitisation' of pain circuits occur after the original injury/inflammation, and this sensitisation can further prime the neurons in the brain to fire more readily in response to a second injury. This is an emerging field of research and scientists are trying to come up with targets that can stop central sensitisation from occuring. Maybe one day you won't have to rely on opiate patches anymore, and I hope this day comes soon!</p>		</li>

			<p>So you're saying the more my immune system attacks my body, the more inflammation in my spine, directly leads to more pain in that part of my spine?<br><br>Well fuck you too, pain circuits. </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/slittyeyes" target="_blank">slittyeyes</a>
			<p>Yes. In fact,  most drugs we have currently only target the immune system in the periphery, because these drugs are typically too big to cross the blood brain barrier. Therefore, pain can be maintained without any inflammation in the periphery, and it is all down to inflammation in the central nervous system which the drug can't target. <br><br>I am on mobile at the moment but u am happy to cite examples once I am home on a computer :)</p>		</li>

			<p>Paper cuts sting due to fingers being dense in nocireceptors and the depth of the injury.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/slittyeyes" target="_blank">slittyeyes</a>
			<p>This is true, but also when skin is opened, blood vessels are opened too and this causes the infiltration of immune cells into the site of injury. Immune cells can secrete various pro-inflammatory chemicals, these chemicals can activate nociceptors (a specialised neurones responsible for pain transmission), which causes pain. </p>		</li>

			<p>That doesn't sound right. Even if you rinse the cut out for several minutes it'll still sting pretty good afterwards. I'd imagine that the pain is related to how clean a cut is.  A cut from a sharp blade hurts significantly less than a cut from a dull blade despite the fact that the sharp blade would be more likely to have metal shavings still attached to it.</p>		</li>

			<p>The dopamine isn't released &quot;at the site&quot;, it is in the brain.  Also dopamine isn't in heroine, heroine triggers the release of dopamine.<br><br></p>		</li>
