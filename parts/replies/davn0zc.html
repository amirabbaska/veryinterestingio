			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, thank you, of course, the system also produces a proton that drains some of the momentum(?)? I had completely forgotten about the proton. I'm guessing that the neutrino always gets its share and then the rest is split between the other two and the available energy for the decay depends on.. what.. the size of the nucleus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. I had somehow gotten the idea that all neutrinos have the same energy. Thank you for taking your time answering.</p></div>		</li>
