			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more of a relative temperature differences, though that's not what actually causes the thunderstorm, it's just more likely to create the conditions that do. The lightning comes from static electricity building up from the friction between different air currents moving past each other. </p>
<p>In the summer, you can often have a lot of warm surface air and a lot of cold air higher up, which results in a lot of air moving around. In the winter, the air temperatures are more uniform. You can get thundersnow, but all that static has to come from somewhere else, which isn't as common.</p></div>		</li>
