			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay okay. Weed gets U Hi. THC is the main funny stuff. It makes you see things, hear things, and feel things, but mainly feel things unless you take a lot of it or eat it. If you eat way too much weed, THC can give you bad anxiety and maybe even mess with your mind on a physical level.</p>
<p><strong>CBD</strong> can help stop that. It’s usually hanging around with THC. But is best found in whole-plant uses of weed. So basically leaving the plant as it’s original parts when making stuff from it without concentrating it down. </p>
<p>Terpenes are these smelly chemicals that make weed smell like “grass” ie the name. Or oil or gasoline or lemons or oranges. Or wood or dirt. Those smells all come from different chemicals. About 9 to 11 of them are really common. The cool thing about them is that they actually make CBD and THC work better in certain concentrations. So this is where the old connotations of Indica making people sleepy and Sativa giving people the giggles. </p>
<p>A good semi phonetic is: <strong><em>Indica In Da Couch and Sativa Standing Up</em></strong></p>
<p>People play with breeds (aka Genetics)  and mate them with different styles (strains or sub-strains) until the desired result gives them mixes(hybrids) of these two strains (Sativa and Indica), mostly, we know this is more of a <em>old-hat</em> approach (meaning it’s not really based in current understanding and doesn’t really mean much apart from stereotypes) and so many strains are crossed and developed, that sometimes a Sativa is the sleepy guy where an Indica keeps you in your head. So it’s really more about what chemicals we have in what levels that may help you. </p>
<p>The molecules CBN and CBG are two other big ones that may help with pain. Way better than even aspirin or maybe even Vicodin. We have a lot of work to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the excellent comment :) first person to see say anything about how terpenes, CBDs, and thc all interact with one another to create the effects of our lovely herb. These by themselves have a much less potent and medicinal effect then if combined all together </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God I hate when people talk about indica v.s. sativa like there is any of either actually available on the market.  They are all almost exclusively hybrids. This is because pure Sativas take nearly double the time to flower and pure Indicas tend to be small, are more prone to mold, and  don't produce as much.  If dispensaries were honest literally ever single jar would be labeled &quot;hybrid&quot;.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didnt see it in your post, but thought it was worth mentioning (why are we explaining this to five year olds). The human body has what's called an endocannabinoid system, which means that throughout your mind and body, you have these built-in receptors for making use of the various cannabinoids from the plant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Yeah. My post was actually supposed to be to the gilded comment but something happened. He deleted it or a blip caused it to not accept mine. Maybe just my phone. But anyway. Yes these are the medical and physical effects of non-psychoactive components of Cannabis in response to a top level comment that was at the top about half an hour to an hour ago. My bad. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didnt know you were trying to respond to another comment, No worries though. I can understand how someone with a strong breadth of knowledge can overlook such a simple thing, as it would be naturally assumed knowledge. However, I thought a casual reader might miss this connection when they are trying to make sense of cbds and what they do.</p></div>		</li>
