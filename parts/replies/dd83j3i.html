			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this for the most part, but even in the details I think they sound similar. Christian rock guitarists even sound like The Edge. There has to be more to it, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does &quot;sounds like the edge&quot; mean? A lot of effects, single melody counter-riffs? The kind of thing a guitarist does when they're bored but need to fit behind the singer? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer, a few years back when I was still going to church I played in a few bands at a few different churches and yes, while there are a lot of Christian bands out there that don't sound like U2, those were not the bands whose songs got played in the services and on the Christian radio station in my town. The idea being that if we play songs that are popular on the Christian Radio station, more people in the congregation will be able to sing along and overall have a better experience. The songs that we played that got the most interaction from the pews were the songs that had the simplest and most catchey tunes as well as the most straightforward beat. (See Hillsong United and the likes) Thus, since U2 has become the standard for positive, likable, non-offensive, alternative rock, they've become an obvious choice for inspection for bands looking to make it in the Christian music scene. </p></div>		</li>
