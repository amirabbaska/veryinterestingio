In this case, the partial pressure of CO2 is a little lower at higher altitude, but since its such a small percentage ~0.04% of standard air, the small reduction of atmospheric pressure will have a minor impact on its solubility. </p>

<p>Now thats an appreciably different pressure compared to just air pressure differential(1.5 atmospheres different), but the CO2 in the can is the same, at lower pressures it will outgas more readily at the same temperature than at a higher pressure. At high enough pressure it wont outgas at all.  </p></div>		</li>
