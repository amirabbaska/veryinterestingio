			<div class="markdown"><p>Exchange rates are determined by, inflation, income, interest rates, govt control, and consumers sentiment. What op explained was controlling valuation via inflation. Print more money increases supply and lowers the demand. In reality, these factors work simultaneously. They do not create change in a vacuum individually with all else constant. The Chinese lower the value of their currency, relative to US dollar, in order to entice the US buyer. There is more purchasing power in China using US$ when the yuan is depreciated. This creates a somewhat bubble. The Chinese are artificially keeping their currency low and creating monetary policy pressures. They have to keep injecting yuan into their economy so their govt is building ghost town cities and highways to nowhere. The problem this creates is lack of consumer surplus and lack of multiplicity effects. How many people does an empty city in the middle of nowhere help? Does the cost out weight the benefit, is there additional value above the price paid? No there is not. This is one reason why their economy is slowing down. They are lucky they still have fields of rural China with cheap labor. To put in perspective, the Chinese economy has something like tripled over the past 3 decades, compounding in 10 yr increments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So China prints more money and you say they now have a surplus of money they don't know what to do with, so they build ghost towns and useless highways. </p>
<p>Why does China spend the surplus on that useless stuff. Why not do something like raise salaries.</p></div>		</li>
