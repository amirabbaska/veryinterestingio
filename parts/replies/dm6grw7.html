Inner monologue is basically the brain planning to speak, starting from the language comprehension and working backwards, so no need to produce the speech at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brain has two signals when sending out orders: the actual signal and the rehearsal signal. One goes to your physical, outside, muscles that make you talk and say stuff, the other goes to an internal, inside, rehearsal system that &quot;simulates&quot; the physical system. </p>
<p>The inside system simulates and processes the signals just slightly faster in real-time with your physical system, making adjustments to the physical signal so it matches the simulation. When you &quot;hear&quot; your inside voice, that's just the brain reading the signals processed through the rehearsal system, and no actual signal is sent to the physical outside system.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about things like being able to think about how a texture or action feels?</p>
<p>IE: I can think about how rustling my hand through my hair feels, typing on the keyboard, moving my feet across the carpet, etc.</p>
<p>On a related note... we can't imagine smells though, we have to actually smell them. Hmm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>how, if at all, would disrupting this combination of functions affect reflexive acts? say, putting your hands out as you're falling, or shielding your face from an incoming object?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you close your eyes and move your hand were a water bottle is and pick it up.</p>
<p>What happen inside your brain is that it first &quot;imagine&quot; moving your hand to the bottle and expect that your hand will report touching sensation (when coming in contact with the bottle). After that the brain actually give the orders for the hand to move. If the hand didn't report back the touch sensation expected, the brain adjust hand position.</p>
<p>When you speak same thing happen, your brain first run simulation of your mouth movements and make expectations one of which is the sound coming out of your mouth.</p>
<p>OP is saying that the part of the brain responsible for this kind of simulation can do it without actually sending any commands to the mouth/tongue.
It would still make prediction of the sound that should come out of this simulation and you end up hearing yourself talking internally </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain is such a crazy thing. I have a nerve injury in one of my legs so I do this thing which is to look at my good leg in a mirror. And when I touch or move my good leg, I'm watching the mirror. My brain is telling me that what I am touching and moving is my right leg. But my right leg which is behind the mirror also does the movements from the mirror image because my brain is telling it that the mirror image is the leg itself. When I touch my leg I can feel it being touched sometimes, even though I'm actually touching my good leg.</p>
<p>Awfully described there but tl;dr is that the brain is amazing </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always found it fascinating that we cannot &quot;think&quot; to move our muscles. The act feels like it originates in the muscle, with no indication that the brain is involved.</p>
<p>And yet there is this complex interaction and feedback loop between muscle and brain, as well as different regions of the brain.</p>
<p>Another thing that I find extraordinary is that while &quot;I&quot; am the brain and the brain is in control of the body, the conscious brain itself has no perception of its existence. For example, before we had anatomy studies and imaging technology, there was no indication that there is something of such importance inside our skull, let alone out &quot;self&quot; itself.</p>
<p>Edit to last paragraph: Maybe that's what makes us separate mind/soul/self from brain (or at least not intrinsically connect them to it). We don't feel an particular connection to the brain, anymore than any other of our organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't sound plausible to me. For something as complex as consciousness arising from an external stimulus it would mean that it's not genetically inherited, which also would mean that all humans would need to be exposed to mushrooms at birth.</p>
<p>For something like this to happen you would have an ongoing mutualistic/commensal symbiotic relationship between the two organisms. The evidence both in everyday, as well as in the genome are just not there to support the hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We protect and care for our heads because it makes sense in terms of survival and evolution to protect the brain and the proximate sensory organs. But it's not a learned behaviour, it's a reflex.</p>
<p>I think most people would identify &quot;self&quot; as their entire body, not the center of self which is the brain.</p>
<p>Intrinsically, my head doesn't feel any more &quot;me&quot; than my hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found I tend to have a good idea of what day it is and what time it is (to within around ten minutes) when I wake up as long as I've had an undisturbed sleep and knew what day it was and what general time it was when I went to bed. I think the body is just fairly good at keeping track of time while you're unconscious. </p></div>		</li>
