<p>Cookies are the bits of data they're able to place and recover later, and they have to ask your permission to do so. Your browser is probably defaulting to saying yes, but if you cork it Google (and other advertisers) have a much harder time following you around the web.</p>
<p>ISP level tracking would be impossible for you to disable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty easy for advertisers to build up an accurate picture of who you are, even if you operate from different computers. Many behavioural traits are trackable, even from within fairly short periods of <a href="https://clickclickclick.click/" target="_blank">time spent on websites</a>. </p></div>		</li>
