			<div class="markdown"><p>Lactic acid has been more or less debunked.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.si.com/edge/2016/07/21/debunking-myths-lactic-acid-truth-fatigue-recovery-muscle-soreness" target="_blank">https://www.si.com/edge/2016/07/21/debunking-myths-lactic-acid-truth-fatigue-recovery-muscle-soreness</a></p>
<p>It's essential in providing energy. Exhaustion/ soreness of muscle is instead due to microtears.</p>
<p>If the shoulders are up too high then there is a muscular imbalance causing it. Forcefully pulling down one's shoulders will never help. The shoulders ache because muscles are working futiley to correct the posture but can't properly turn on due to communication being sent from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Restrictions in the range of motion will need to be addressed (fixations or places where range abruptly stops with no stretch are first culprits).</p>
<p>Overly strong muscles will need to be softened. (Many anterior muscles, pecks, anterior scalene, iliopsoas, will not turn off with the way they are used in western lifestyle. This means their antagonists, basically muscles that do the opposite motion, are prevented from doing their job.)</p>
<p>Weak muscles need to be activated and allowed to return to neutral length.</p>
<p>Then, once close to normal, soft range of motion is restored, exercises to reinforce balance in the muscle tissue will need to be done. </p>
<p>The key is to make structure and muscle healthy then retrain it to be more efficient. A lot of people only do half of this and as a result only experience short term results or become worse off. </p>
<p>Such as after getting that massage that didn't address the tight pecks which were restricting the muscles between the scap and spine so they spasm worse the next day.  </p>
<p>Or getting PT where they tried to strengthen the weak and inhibited muscles without sorting through the chain of function that is causing the opposing muscle to be turned on. I've seen this far too many times, the PT tears the weak muscle trying to force it, especially in the over 50 population. I have two clients right now who have to get PRP injections to regrow glute muscle torn due to incompetent PT efforts. </p>
<p>Taking a breath could be the whole issue if part of their diaphragm is being inhibited by a structural issue. Everything we do coordinates with our breathing. I work very closely with a PT who specializes in coordination of breath as it is associated with proper muscle balance and healthy structure. </p>
<p>I don't know if you are a practitioner or if you heard what you said from your massage therapist, personal trainer, physical therapist or whoever, but it is something I've heard said by many people who didn't want to take the time to understand the deeper problem. I'm sorry for my peers who don't care enough about their work to investigate and understand this stuff. It's readily available but it takes significant effort to understand and put into practice. Please, please don't spread this kind of disinformation. It places the fault on the client so when taking this advice doesn't produce magic results they give up on themselves a little more with every passing day of pain and suffering.</p>
<p>If you are a practitioner, or are curious, please look into the work of James Waslaski and also the Postural Restoration Institute. They will completely change the way you think about what is happening in the pained body. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some good stuff in here but here's another PT opinion (based on evidence):</p>
<p>Tight muscles are generally weak muscles. Neck muscles contain more stretch receptors for proprioceptive and vestibular purposes, so stretching often makes things worse, as you said. </p>
<p>The muscle control and isolation theory that you discuss has no evidence for it. Research shows we activate (for example) the deep neck flexors in conjunction with SCM, and that 'order' of activation doesn't matter, only that you strengthen the former. Isolation works for a lot of patients, but I find a lot of patients have leftover issues as they retain strength deficits. </p>
<p>I also dislike the part of the theory that suggests strengthening somehow damages their muscle patterns. Yes you can overdo it and flare them up, but to suggest it somehow takes longer to 'correct' their pattern is absurd and again has no evidence for it. In my opinion it's fear mongering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damages muscle patterns? I said they tried to forcefully strengthen a muscle that wouldn't properly activate and it tore instead. That's overuse of a weak and inhibited muscle. That has nothing to do with making the pattern worse. They didn't address the pattern at all. I think you are talking general theory here and not implying I said that, but perhaps you can clarify.</p>
<p>Isolating is not the whole picture, too be sure, but there's a lot to be said regarding recent findings on neural plasticity being systemic and how we can repeat compensations long after the trauma has more or less resolved. In some clients, isolating muscles will be the only way to ensure plasticity is not involved. (Especially if results are not being achieved.)</p>
<p>The PTs who are tearing their client's muscles are repeating protocol without properly evaluating the response. I see two or three every year who went into therapy for low back pain and came out with a new glute tear. PRP is not cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, structural integration is the key.  But this is ELI5. Water as a culprit was also debunked. </p>
<p>Source: trained at Utah College of Massage Therapy, which was premier at the time (the 90s haha). Living in Utah Valley could probably be it's own thread. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you know this, why would you spread that like it was helpful?</p>
<p>ELI5 doesn't mean lie so that they stop asking questions. It means try to use language that can be understood at all levels of education. Explain the terminology if need be.</p>
<p>If the concept can't be explained at an ELI5 level, then please kindly direct them to ELI25 and offer it there. Whatever concepts they don't understand they can bring back down to lower levels. (Example: ELI5 how the agonist antagonist relationship of muscles works)</p>
<p>The answers to OP's question cannot be understood in one day -- true -- so, if you really think it's worthless to try then say, &quot;this is too complicated for this subreddit&quot; instead of spreading debunked info.</p></div>		</li>
