			<div class="markdown"><p>Since this has actually happened to me on two occasions I think I can explain the reason a faster car can lose control.</p>
<p>Your rear tires are spinning fast already. If you get bumped directly from behind as I have on one occasion, it's no big deal, you feel a light tap on your rear and lose no control. However, if you get bumped at the rear side, like a PIT maneuver, your rear end moves offline and now your rear tires lose all traction quickly as they are spinning across the pavement as your car moves forward. This pushes the rear further out, off center, at a really fast rate. This happened to me on another occasion, I was bumped lightly on the rear right side at about 60mph.</p>
<p>I went sideways, did opposite lock which put me into a pendulum skid, sideways the other way, turned the wheel opposite, sideways back again. I was able to get it under control after skidding back and forth a few times. I also knew not to hit the brakes as that would lose even more traction and I had room on the highway to maneuver.</p>
<p>And I had to call 911 while chasing that driver to get his license. He tried to drive off, but I chased him and shouted that I was on the phone to the cops and he finally pulled over. </p>
<p>Asshole didn't get arrested though because there was no damage and the cops didn't have more than my word against his.</p>
<p>So there you have both an explanation and a nice story to go with it :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factor to consider with the stationary car, or maybe I am off: for example when I push a car by hand I find it hard to get any initial momentum from the car but once it starts rolling increasing the cars speed is easy. In short I suspect it takes less energy to get a car to move from 1 to 2 mph than to get it to move from 0 to 1 mph, feels that way. I suspect friction is a bigger factor when first moving a car. I think the bump would be harder when hitting the stationary car, unless of course the bump hitting the moving car causes an accident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, as the coefficients of static and kinetic friction would be different.  It's harder to get a static object to start moving than it is to keep it moving.</p>
<p>That's also why your braking distance increases when your tires lock up, the kinetic friction coefficient is lower than the maximum static friction coefficient and energy transfer is less effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus a stationary car is likely to be in park rather than a drive gear. So it has even more resistance to an initial force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In slightly simpler terms, the initial bump would be the same, but the potential for it to cause a really bad accident afterward is <strong>much</strong> higher for faster moving cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>why is the change in traction different if the energy transfer is the same?</p>
<p>EDIT: thanks for the informative responses, and less thanks for the responses just retelling <em>what's</em> happening rather than <em>why</em> it's happening from a physical or mathematical standpoint. man that's annoying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the friction situation changes from static to dynamic, where the tire momentarily slips over the road surface due to a bump and produces much worse traction at that shorr period of time. Coupled with the change in the direction of the car's momentum from the bump, which produces a large difference from original intended movement, even with a small direction change, due to the high speed, and.. recipe for disaster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the something called the &quot;understeer gradient&quot;, a vehicle can become unstable above certain speeds. It's why some cars spin (like one would spin around if bumped) where others would just slide sideways a bit (&quot;push&quot; or &quot;understeer&quot;) and then return to a zero yaw rate.</p>
<p>Edit: the math and modeling taken to get to this conclusion is mid-level vehicle dynamics. If you're interested, google &quot;bicycle model&quot;, or &quot;understeer gradient&quot; or &quot;critical speed&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is easily seen in police &quot;pit&quot; maneuvers. The police car will sidle up next to a fleeing vehicle at high speed and turn into the rear fourth of the fleeing vehicle. This causes the fleeing vehicle to lose control and spin out (or something along those lines). It kind of LOOKS like an extremely rough maneuver but when you're actually training to do it, you find out it's actually a very gentle move. The high speed and potential for problems at high speed (as mentioned by my colleagues above) takes care of the rest. </p>
<p>Also, it's super fun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you mentioned one important keyword there. Potential. The potential energy of a car at rest on a flat surface is nil. The potential energy of a car moving at 60 mph is great. It is potential energy that could cause harm in this situation as potential energy can turn into actual energy if the car were to hit something and that something were to hit the car back, thus transferring energy to the (literal) bodies in the system (you). But yeah, the bump would feel the same as long as you didn't loose control of the car and hit a tree.</p></div>		</li>
