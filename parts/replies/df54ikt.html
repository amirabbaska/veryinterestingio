<p>It makes sense. We do not know who is out there. We might as well be giving some really advanced Space Nazis our location for conquering. The chance is slim, however, it is still there. It is like inviting the devil to preach in your home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMHO, the most likely destiny for Voyager is that it gets retrieved by Humans after we discover FTL travel. It would be an incredible historic artifact. Of course, if there's no FTL travel, it's unlikely it will ever get picked up by anybody. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an important point here. Even if we do build a ship that's traveling fast enough to catch up in a reasonable timeframe, that only means the ship will be traveling <em>much</em> faster than Voyager. So to pick it up, it would have to slow down then get back up to speed. Hardly seems like a reasonable expectation for anything approximating the near to medium to even far term future when we're still trying to figure out how to get things up to this kind of speed in the first place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not completely sure, and to be honest so should have said large rock, as it is very likely that Voyager had been hit with some space rocks, but nothing larger that maybe a few millimeters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have like the same question, but I always think that those who put them into space have to know things better than me, so I imagine the probability of collision may be very small. We can't imagine how big the space is so maybe there are like millions of thousands km between small rocks.</p></div>		</li>
