			<div class="markdown"><p>I now believe that your line of thought is correct.</p>
<p>From the recent edit of my post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This thread of inquiry is likely false. You will all note that even one finger, held up to light causes a blurry, layer effect around it - Almost like an aura. Hold it in front of text and it is most apparent. I now believe that this is most certainly a physiological effect, likely in relation to the layers of the cornea or lens of the eye. The pattern becomes apparent when two of these &quot;blurs&quot; overlap. What we're seeing is some sort of diffraction effect, but is vastly different in principle.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it just an out of focus image? The fingers are too close to the eye to resolve it properly, so it remains out of focus, kinda like how if you close one eye and try to focus on your nose, the edges are blurry and indistinct, kinda like I'm seeing <em>through</em> my nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add in my own simple experiments - first I used smooth pens instead of my fingers to rule out the geometry of my fingers as a cause - the effect still appears for pens.</p>
<p>Then I thought - is the effect the same for BOTH eyes?</p>
<p>It was NOT identical.</p>
<p>Looking through the pens from the same angle and distance with each eye showed noticeably different line patterns. Sometimes there was a very strong difference. To me this highly suggests the physiology of the eye is the source of the effect.</p>
<p>EDIT: One more huge tidbit of information - the lines can change <strong>when I blink</strong>! Suggesting they are also somehow affected by the surface layer of the eye. Perhaps particulate matter and/or thickness of tears etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My eyes are slightly out of focus when I stare at the gap between my fingers, which creates lines. If you stare at the gap while in focus, there are no lines at all. Other lines appear because the penumbral shadows of my fingertips overlap and create a darker zone in the center with a lighter zone on either side, which is another few lines differentiating lighter shadow and darker shadow. At least that's what I perceive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. Between the shadows and the bokeh the overlap will make a darker area where they intersect. To prove that this is not your brain this can be reproduced with a camera with a very wide apreatue lens inside it's minimal focal distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this.</p>
<p>The bands appear only when the fingers are close to my eyes so that the focus is not on the fingers but to whatever is behind it.</p>
<p>When I forced the focus on my fingers, the bands disappeared.</p>
<p>I relaxed my eyes again, so it focused on the objects behind, and the bands reappeared.</p>
<p>When my fingers were far from my eyes, so the focus was on those, the bands did not appear.</p>
<p>I brought another object close to my eye and forced focus on it. The bands reappeared, although this time hardly distinguishable since my fingers were a bit farther.</p>
<p>/u/BrandGSX says it can be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4yolbi/when_i_hold_two_fingers_together_and_look_through/d6ph8nx" target="_blank">reproduced with a camera</a> so it may be some physics phenomenon instead of a biological one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright. Optics researcher here. This is 100% a diffractive effect, and I have an optical model to prove it. First, the incoherent point spread function of an optical system is predicted by the Fourier Transform of the autocorrelation of the pupil function. When we hold our slightly separated fingers close to our eye, they are out of focus. In this case, the pupil function is a circle (from your eye's iris) with a quadratic phase term (for defocus). The resulting Point Spread Function (PSF)--due to diffraction--looks like [this] (<a href="http://imgur.com/a/BNDm7" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/BNDm7</a>)</p>
<p>The theory of optical systems as Linear Shift Invariant systems states that the image of an object through an optical system is the convolution of the PSF with the geometrically ideal image. In this case, I'll use two slightly separated dark circles to approximate our separated fingers. Looks like [this] (<a href="http://imgur.com/a/HYN7k" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/HYN7k</a>). Convolving this with the PSF shown above results in <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ia2vd" target="_blank">this</a>. I don't know about the rest of you, but this matches very closely with what I see, and is predicted entirely by incoherent diffraction effects. </p>
<p>Edit: I made some animations: first, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/DWnrT" target="_blank">a visualization of what happens as you change your finger separation</a>. Notice that as the GIF progresses, your fingers are getting closer together, which increases the fringe contrast. Second, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/RsMDf" target="_blank">a simulation of what happens as the fingers move farther from your eye</a>, thereby decreasing the amount of defocus. Notice here that the fringes are high frequency and very visible up close, but as the fingers come into focus, the fringes become more course and eventually disappear.  </p>
<p>Edit 2: Many others have mentioned this, but I'll just add it to this comment: While it is true that interference effects (e.g. fringes) are only visible when light is coherent, the definition of coherence is more subtle than just &quot;whatever we get from a laser&quot; (note: Young did the double slit experiment in 1801, long before lasers). For interference to be strongly visible, one or both of two types of coherence is required. First is temporal coherence, wherein the light consists of a narrow range of wavelengths and a stable frequency. Second is spatial coherence, which means the light originated from a well defined point source (this can mean either a spherical wave, or a collimated beam). What comes from lasers is typically both temporally and spatially coherent, which is why they are great for such experiments. However, one can observe interference effects from sunlight if the light is passed through a very small pinhole or slit. [Here's an example] (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunlight-speckle" target="_blank">https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunlight-speckle</a>) (not mine).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. At defocus (or, depending on spherical aberration, even at focus), the contrast transfer function (i. e. the envelope applied to the Fourier transform of the image) will start oscillating. Not only does this lead to rings in the point spread function, it will even reverse the contrast in several frequency bands (white becomes black and vice versa). The frequency of the oscillation does, indeed, depend on the wavelength of the light source among many other parameters of the optical system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so, is it interference? It <em>feels</em> like you're describing interference... It's just interference from two sources (one source on each edge due to diffraction)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's absolutely an interference effect. It's a little hard to intuitively reason in this situation since coherence comes into play. If I can think of a clear intuitive explanation I'll write back, but nothing's coming to mind at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get the exact same effect simply by drawing two lines very close to each other on a piece of paper and moving the paper closer to your eye. In fact, if you just draw a single line and move it closer to your eye, you are going to start to see it blur out; this has nothing to do with light bending around your finger like people have been talking about below! That's just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defocus_aberration" target="_blank">blur</a>! Your image is out of focus. (You can also create the effect by cutting a small slit in a piece of paper or flashcard; that's easier than holding two cards; the effect is stronger if you take a sharpie and color the area around the slit black for a stronger contrast.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kshitij-iitjee.com/Study/Physics/Part7/Chapter36/85.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is an illustration of what's going on with a myopic eye that might be helpful. Instead of &quot;object&quot;, think of it just as a point in space. Light rays reflect off of that point, enter our eye, and are focused by the lens onto the back of the retina. Your lens has limits for much it can be stretched and relaxed, so points in space very close to your eye cannot be brought into focus. Instead, light is smeared across a region of your retina. This is blur. The same thing happens in myopia and hyperopia -- light from a point in space is focused either in front of or behind your retina (usually because the eyeball is squished or stretched), and as a result many parts of your retina are getting information about the same point in space. This is why you see the object smeared across space. </p>
<p>I suspect that the same thing is happening here. You've got two edges very close to each other and both are out of focus. Light from around both edges is being smeared on your retina, but, because they are close together, they are overlapping. So, on the retina, you have one region that is getting light from the bottom of the slit which smears upward into the slit and you have another region that is getting light from the top of the slit and is smeared downward into the slit. In the middle region of the retina that is getting light from (i.e. through) the slit (or just from the white part of your piece of paper), which is smeared all around. But in this central region, there is going to be a region of overlap of rays from the bottom edge and the top edge. This is going to look darker than the surrounding area, creating that line.</p>
<p>Here is the best evidence for this: Take an index card and a red pen (or any non-black color). Draw two parallel lines about an inch long and 0.5 mm apart. Close one of your eyes and move the index card closer to your open eye. You should see a purple line between the two and maybe some orange lines around the red. That's because when blurred, the different colored regions are interacting on the retina. (You can do the same experiment by taking an index card, cutting a small slit, and coloring the area around the slit in any color you like; the line seen through the slit will match the color you used).</p>
<p>There might also be some sort of strange color/contrast interactions that contribute to the effect. Remember that your eyes (and brains) are especially good at picking up <em>differences</em> in the environment, for example, contrasting regions of dark and light or color (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptive_field#Retinal_ganglion_cells" target="_blank">center-surround receptive fields of ganglion cells</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_cell" target="_blank">receptive fields of simple cells</a>). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not 100% sure I'm referring to the same bands as what everyone else is referring to, but if we are:</p>
<p>I think bands arise because the defocus blur &quot;kernel&quot; is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>in theory, more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_confusion" target="_blank">like a flat circle</a>, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Christmas_Tree_Lights_Bokeh.jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a> - not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur" target="_blank">a soft gaussian blur</a>.  The shape and 'brightness' of the circle should reflect the way light is entering the eye (roughly equal intensity over the circular opening that is the pupil).  The edges might seem to have slight banding because of the perception effects mentioned before - i.e. something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_bands" target="_blank">Mach bands</a> illusion.</p>
</li>
<li>in practice, not a precisely equal-intensity circle, because of imperfections in the cornea and tear film.  This explains why the bands in the middle might <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4yolbi/when_i_hold_two_fingers_together_and_look_through/d6pfn5v" target="_blank">change every blink</a>.  Some cameras also don't have a defocus that's a neutral circle, so you see bands based on what the blur kernel looks like.  [edit] Apparently there is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4yolbi/when_i_hold_two_fingers_together_and_look_through/d6pp2ft" target="_blank">an optical (diffraction) phenomenon</a> as well, which causes the blur kernel to have <a href="http://imgur.com/a/BNDm7" target="_blank">a &quot;ringing&quot; pattern</a> even in the ideal case.</li>
