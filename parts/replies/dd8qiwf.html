			<div class="markdown"><p>This hypothetical passenger has the technology to travel so close to the speed of light that he covers one light-year's distance in an hour. He probably has the technology for the accompanying radiation shields. </p>
<p>Otherwise yes, this fries the passenger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that all of the radiation stars put out is all floating in space. It's like a big sea. From the earth's perspective, the ship is flying through this sea of radiation, crashing into it on its way to earth the way a submarine moves through water. From the ship's perspective, all of this radiation flies past them at a similar speed to how fast they fly toward earth. They get hit by radiation for only an hour, but the radiation is coming toward them faster and therefore is higher energy. </p>
<p>To answer your question, the stars not space emit radiation, but they're doing so all the time so all of that radiation is out and about in space. </p></div>		</li>
