			<div class="markdown"><p>The winds blow towards the mountains. When they hit the mountains, theyâ€™re forced upslope. The air cools as it rises and it usually dumps its load of moisture on the windward side of the mountain.  Once the now cold, dry air passes the peak, it starts down the other side and warms up as it descends.  At the foot of the mountain, you now have a warm, dry wind blowing from the mountainside. </p></div>		</li>
