			<div class="markdown"><p>Really reddit? Downvoting to hell the guy who asked the question and just wanted some clarification? And what you said is perfectly correct, objects stop accelerating after the force has finished being applied (the final speed depending on their mass) and remain at that speed until another force is applied. I'm guessing from the other comments that people are just misunderstanding what you said but that still isn't a reason to be downvoted. Asking for clarification is the only way you can know for sure if you're understanding a concept and doing this shouldn't be discouraged, especially in an educational sub.</p>
<p>Edit: From -17 to -2, that's pretty impressive. Faith in humanity restored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It shows -17 points next to your username. I upvoted because I thought it was unfair to get downvoted when people misunderstood what you said but you'll need 18 other people to upvote you to get back in the positives (which is probably unlikely at this stage). Usually what happens is when you get downvoted a bit, other people jump on the bandwagon and downvote without fully understanding why or because they become biased after seeing the negative score (this happens in real life too where its called mob mentality). The reddit admins tried to fix this by giving the subs a choice to hide comment scores for a certain time after being posted but sometimes it just comes down to luck and those initial 1 or 2 downvotes can really kill your comment once the score is revealed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So I then assume they will hit a certain speed dependant on their mass and will remain at this speed until acted on by another force. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a bit misleading. Things don't just accelerate for no reason. All acceleration is caused by <em>some</em> force. In space, things only really accelerate due to gravity, but that only speeds them up if they are moving <em>towards</em> the source of gravity, and eventually they will either hit it or fly past, at which point gravity will start slowing them down.</p>
<p>Most things in space are travelling at (roughly) constant speeds, not based on their mass, just based on whatever initial force pushed them. Asteroids, for example, are moving at whatever speed they were when they first launched away from a larger rock (with minor changes, both up and down, due to all the gravity sources everywhere)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you roll a bowling ball along your hallway, what happens? It keeps rolling at the same speed, because nothing is acting on it. If you hit it with a water hose, it's going to accelerate and move faster because you're giving it a push (or if the ball shoots water out of a nozzle to accelerate itself, analogous to a rocket rocket almost).</p>
<p>But if you don't give it a push, its speed doesn't change. Objects don't just pick up speed for no reason, nor lose speed for no reason. There has to be an acting force.</p>
<p>What do you mean when you say that they will &quot;hit a certain speed dependent on their mass&quot;? What would cause them to just reach some given speed in the absence of everything else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure he was just saying that after a force has finished being applied to an object, the object remains at a constant speed which depends on its mass (i.e. a = F/m so the lower the mass, the higher the final speed). He understands that objects don't accelerate unless an external force is applied, he literally says it in the comment. Shame he's getting downvoted to hell for it.</p></div>		</li>
