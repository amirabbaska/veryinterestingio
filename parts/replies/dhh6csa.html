			<div class="markdown"><p>Define &quot;insignificant&quot;? In some states, solar &amp; wind are well under 1% of total power generated, so of course RECs are insignificant. But here in California, solar + wind + small hydro have hit 50% on some days, and that's not even counting big hydro power, which is another 12% in spring &amp; summer. <a href="caiso.com/Pages/TodaysOutlook.aspx" target="_blank">Today, we're over 40% wind+solar+hydro.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is about the impact of individual consumers purchasing RECs compared to all others who purchase them. Not renewables vs non-renewables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's the other way around.</p>
<p>Energy in the grid is fungible -- if 30% of your generation is renewable, and 5% of the consumers demand renewable, it's trivial to &quot;allocate&quot; them to the rewnewable pool and say they're getting it (by &quot;allocating&quot; the dirty producers to other people).</p>
<p>If only 1% of the total generation is renewable, and 5% of the demand is for renewable, the only way to meet that demand is to build out renewables (or maybe import it?  not sure if that's a thing that counts).  You can't just say &quot;yeah, sure&quot; and reallocate resources, if those resources don't exist.</p></div>		</li>
