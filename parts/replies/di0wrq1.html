<p>That's why 120 years ago we had between 5 and 8 children per family. Then we put chlorine in the water and 7.5 out of 8 kids survived. So we stopped having so many kids. </p></div>		</li>

<p>616 people died because they were getting their water from a public water pump that was built around an old leaking cesspit.. Luckily that John Snow apparently knew something, figured out all the dead people were getting their water from there one way or another, so the problem was the water (germs) and not the air (miasma particles), and that's how he fathered modern epidemiology! </p></div>		</li>
