<p>A computer would just see a particular pattern of pixels, and then a different pattern of pixels (bear in mind we might not teach it directly about rotation or anything because those are hard concepts to quantify mathematically when talking about pixels).</p>

<p>Actually this is exactly what we do try to teach modern computer vision algorithms, one example being Capsule Networks. It's a challenge, but it's a field that's progressing quickly. Most importantly, there is nothing (as far as we can tell) that fundamentally prevents a computer from doing these things that a brain can do. We just haven't discovered the right learning algorithm yet. </p></div>		</li>
