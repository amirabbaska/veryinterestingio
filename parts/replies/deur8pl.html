			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen other posters mention languages that lack certain types of future tense and such. How does a language even develop like that? I mean, with nearly no future tense at all, isn't it pretty difficult to organize even basic things?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's the beautiful thing. Why did our culture evolve to have a future tense?
Let's think simple. Let's think in the minds of the Hopi (Native Americans based the western? United States) before colonization. There really isn't the need to talk about the future, &quot;we are going out for a hunt.&quot; While they hunt it's a constant present. There's no need to bring up later we are, it's just we are hunting so that we can eat. It's also they were nomadic right? So they aren't set in a single place for too long. They follow their food, they don't plan for their food to travel on Tuesday, they just travel whenever their food does. &quot;Oh look, they're moving now, let's go&quot;.
But with scheduling we need forms of a future. It's planning. When civilizations arise we need to plan for the future. Surplus isn't a thing for the present, it's for the future.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's great. I'm American but more and more say the four directions as I find it so much simpler though most people get confused so I point. I live on the coast which makes it much easier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, I've been attempting to go cardinal as it is easier then all hell once you know it. And your like on the coast? I bet that makes it extremely easy. Are you able to determine when away from the ocean?</p></div>		</li>
