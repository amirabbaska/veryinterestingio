			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that's really fascinating! As a side question then, why do you think Warfarin IS so widely prescribed? My initial thought would be predominantly to do with cost, whether due to ease or quantity of production, but I have no idea. And what blood thinners do you think are preferable to Warfarin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Warfarin was discovered in the 1930s (with a great story behind it) with medical uses being established in the 1950s. For the first 60 years or so, it was the only true oral anticoagulant. All the rest had to be either injections or infusions.</p>
<p>The new, target-specific, oral anticoagulants are direct thrombin inhibitors (Dabigatran) and Factor Xa inhibitors (Rivaroxaban, Apixiban, and 2-3 others). That have numerous advantages over warfarin (consistency being the biggest, as well as significantly fewer interactions, ease of dosing and decreased bleeding risk) but also a few disadvantages: Namely cost (they're new) and lack of reversibility if bleeding does start (there's a reversal agent for Dabigatran on the market, and the Xa reversal agent will be out within the year). </p>
<p>Additionally, there's a few indications where the new ones can't be used and warfarin is your only option: patients who are on anticoagulation for synthetic heart valves or who have &quot;valvular&quot; a fib being the biggest group. Finally, there's any number of indications where the new drugs haven't been studied yet, mostly because they're not that common. Rare coagulopathies and whatnot.</p>
<p>Basically, warfarin is so widely prescribed because its the cheapest, the best studied, and is reversible in the event of a major bleed. That said, if I had a PE or afib, I'd take one of the new ones in a heartbeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the day after the FDA approved Praxbind (brand name for the Pradaxa reversal agent), a doctor called us in pharmacy asking if we carried it or how soon could we get it in. I facepalmed pretty hard over that one. No, we can't get it in that fast, it was literally less than 18 hours ago they even approved it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of the NoACs have been studied in morbidly obese patients (I forget the exact weight limit). The recommendation is to draw an appropriate level for the clotting factor that is being inhibited but those are expensive labs and can't be applied properly.</p>
<p>A very large percentage of US citizens have a weight that exceeds the studies. Warfarin is the best choice for them. INR is cheap to drawn and easy to interpret.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take warfarin for a prothrombin 2 mutation with a history of 2 adverse clotting events (CVST and TIA - so, a thrombus and an embolus respectively). The reason I personally stick with warfarin is lack of reversal agents for the newer drugs. Managing my PT/INR has gotten easier over the past few years, and I can pretty well guess when I'm too anticoagulated and I should cut back vs when I'm probably not therapeutic and should probably take an extra half tablet.
Side note: dietary vitamin K isn't explicitly contraindicated in patients taking warfarin; you just have to be consistent or you really will be chasing your levels.</p>
<p>While we are in the topic of drug interactions, can someone please explain why MAOIs sound like the absolute worst thing ever? They literally interact with everything (not to mention the 14 day drug clearance).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MAOIs are a class of drugs which inhibit an enzyme called monoamine oxidase, which is an enzyme which breaks down neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.</p>
<p>The biggest issue with MAOIs is the risk of hypertensive crisis/serotonin syndrome. With the food interactions, the issue is with foods containing tyramine, which is a potent releaser of norepinephrine, which causes blood pressure to rise.</p>
<p>Monoamine oxidase enzymes are present in the digestive tract and in the nervous system so when tyramine is ingested, the influx of norepinephrine is broken down before it can do anything. In patients with MAOIs, the enzyme is inhibited and can't break down norepinephrine, and the patient is at risk for a tyramine reaction, which is a sudden and dramatic rise in blood pressure.</p>
<p>MAOIs have a lot of interactions with other psychotropic drugs for the same reason: antidepressants work by increasing levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, and if you increase levels while simultaneously blocking the enzyme which breaks them down (MAO), you run the risk of hypertensive crisis, serotonin syndrome and so on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, do you mean you can feel it when your blood is not at the correct INR level? I've been on Warfarin since I was 18 years old (almost ten years now) and while my INR is fairly stable nowadays, I haven't been able to feel anything different when it hasn't been. I didn't even know that was possible - could you elaborate? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding (and this really is from my experience within my medical school institution, I can't speak for everyone) is that warfarin was sort of the pioneer drug of anti-thrombotics that gained momentum and now is widely known. Doctors prescribe what they know and what they were taught to prescribe when they were in school/residency. Warfarin has been the go to for awhile, so I think it's more complicated to change the culture of prescribing a certain drug than one would hope. And don't get me wrong, warfarin does it's job of being anti-thrombotic (preventing blood clots) when it is within it's therapeutic range. </p>
<p>I would argue for dabigatran or riveroxaban (I hope I spelled those right) as some of the blood thinning drugs of the future. They haven't been around as long as Warfarin, but at least so far do not have such ridiculous side effects. </p>
<p>I can't speak to cost, I'm in my med school bubble at the moment that we don't have to consider that yet. But since warfarin has been around for awhile and is widespread, I bet it's cheaper. It would be interesting to look at the cost of people coming in for all the side effects though. In the end, it could be cheaper for the health system for a more expensive up front drug that had less side effects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Warfarin is very inexpensive. Rivaroxaban is way way costlier. As a comparison, I have pretty decent insurance. A warfarin script would've cost me around $5-$8 for a 30-day supply. The Rivaroxaban I was prescribed instead cost me $60. </p>
<p>Worth it. Great drug. I had no noticeable side effects, and I didn't have to worry about Vitamin K or Grapefruit or any of the other pain-in-the-ass things that come along with Warfarin. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised Xarelto/Eliquis/Pradaxa/Savaysa aren't more commonly prescribed now but it could be to do with the lack of reversals for a lot of the newer ones. Or at least the snails pace it's taking to have them approved for use in the US anyway. </p>
<p>I'm on Xarelto FWIW. Warfarin just doesn't work with my life LOL</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the cost issue that the NOACs have, which was already mentioned they also have  the disadvantage of being new, which means they haven't been tested in as many conditions. It shouldn't be assumed that the NOACs will already be superior or at least non-inferior. As an example dabigatran was tested in mechanical heart valves in the Re-Align trial. It had to be stopped early because people in the dabigatran arm had more bleeding and more clotting. It was such a disaster that none of the Xa manufacturers are willing to test their drugs (despite having a different mechanism of action than  dabigatran).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Look up the list of things warfarin interacts with, and you'll be surprised that it's the most commonly prescribed drug thinner in the U.S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warfarin isn't that great in with respect to the things you mentioned, such as a narrow therapeutic index, interactions and the need for monitoring but it's also widely used for several reasons. We're most familiar with warfarin since it's very old and we usually know pretty well how to deal with it. Also, warfarin is pretty easy to reverse in most cases. Without going into detail about how reversal with Vitamin K will affect the INR when the patient resumes warfarin therapy, we have an agent that will reverse the anticoagulant effect in case of an overdose.</p>
<p>The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are gaining popularity now that they've been around for several years, but a lot of them still don't have good widespread reversal strategies other than transfusions. Pradaxa was on the market for five before a reversal agent (Praxabind) was approved last year. You can't remove it via dialysis, and you pretty much just have to give blood products/volume expanders/hemostatic agents until the drug gets cleared from the body. I've seen the strangest things being thrown at bleeding patients with NOAC overdoses, including Vitamin K and protamine, of all things, which won't reverse these agents. </p>
<p>The other advantage with warfarin is that we know what to monitor (INR) and what the range is. With NOACs, it's like, okay, we're giving the drug and we don't really have a way to check it other than, is the patient having clots? No? Great! Is the patient bleeding? No? Great! NOACs are marketed with the idea that they're easier to use because they have a predictable therapeutic profile and you don't need to do dose adjustments or monitor them, but we also don't really have a good way to actually do that.</p>
<p>And, of course, warfarin is the anticoagulant of choice in patients with renal impairment. Most NOACs are cleared through the kidneys to some extent, and require dose adjustments for decline in renal function. Apixaban is the only one that even has a recommended dosing for a dialysis patient, based on one clinical study. Dabigatran, riveroxaban and edoxaban are clearly labeled to not be used in patients with severe renal impairment and dialysis patients.
These patients are a high-risk group for both bleeding and clotting, and it's generally safer to use warfarin in that patient population because we can closely monitor the INR and quickly reverse it if necessary. </p>
<p>In summary, NOACs and warfarin both have their advantages and disadvantages in use, and even though NOACs are quickly gaining popularity, I doubt warfarin is going away any time soon.</p></div>		</li>
