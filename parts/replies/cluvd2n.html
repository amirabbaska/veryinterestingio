			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right in saying that we have all that extra time, but how do we get a sample? With such low libido it's difficult to get them to give you a sample like using an artificial vagina. Sometimes you can sedate them and I guess you'd jack them off, but sedation in pandas is risky at the best of times, lord knows people don't want the fucker to die.</p>
<p>Often times sperm is still viable for a few hours post mortem, so that's a definite way to get a sample, but the panda is dead sooooo not so good for the rest of the time.</p>
<p>If they were like macaques we could just teach them to jack-off and provide samples in return for treats and presents, but pandas don't masturbate. This is also probably why macaques aren't going extinct, they have an amazing libido. Chimps solve problems with fighting, macaques do it with sex. If your macaque lady has wronged you, just shag her sister in front of her, that'll show her who's boss.</p>
<p>Note: it is preferable that the macaques masturbate in a non-exibit area of the zoo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of me has trouble accepting that explanation. That we just can't get any samples.</p>
<p>Us humans have become pretty proficient at breeding animals. And pandas are the poster-child for cute animal going extinct despite our best efforts. If some guy had to dress up in a panda costume covering a bear proof suit to go jerk-off all the male pandas every so often, I'd expect for that to be done in every zoo in the world, by happy volunteers that want to save the species. Or, if normal sedation techniques are so risky, how have we not yet developed milder ones?</p>
<p>And, a quick wiki search kind of confirmed that. AI with frozen sperm has been successful, 5 years ago was the first, and there have been other instances since then. And the sperm can last frozen for decades. The article them optimistically states that this should help solve the panda reproduction problem.</p>
<p>So, I don't know enough to make any educated guesses, but it seems like the availability of panda sperm is no longer the primary bottleneck. The female half of things seems like the bigger problem by far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, when they had higher populations, their low reproductive rate was not as much of a problem. Pandas are at the point of functional extinction, which is when there are still individuals left alive, but not enough to keep the species going. Population problems like this happen at very low population densities for all animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, that's not at all true.  Pandas have a lot more genetic diversity than other animals with similar populations.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www3.scienceblog.com/community/older/2001/D/200114200.html" target="_blank">Link</a>  </p>
<p>&quot;Even though there are only about 1,000 giant pandas left, there is hope for this beloved endangered species. A comprehensive genetic analysis of three wild giant panda populations shows that they still have enough genetic diversity to recover.  </p>
<p>The researchers found that the giant panda has moderate genetic diversity compared other carnivores. &quot;The giant panda is comparable to the genetically healthy Serengeti lion population in its endemic diversity and far greater than the genetically compromised Asiatic lion from India's Gir forest or the Florida panther,&quot; says O'Brien.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
