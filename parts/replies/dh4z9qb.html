			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say though that multiple people confirming that the same colors look good together is probably not a valid indicator of mutual perception. Like chords in music, colors &quot;working&quot; together is probably more of an indicator of their frequencies harmonizing in some way. And we know everyone receives the same frequencies. So they'd feel the same frequencies of color looking nice together unilaterally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes. Anytime you ask someone what color something is, you're really asking them to call a name that's assigned to that frequency of light or &quot;color.&quot; Since we know everyone is observing the same frequencies when you show them the same reference image or color or whatever, they'll never disagree on what name to give it. They were all taught the same name for what they're looking at. The question is, does the feeling that comes along with that color or in other words, the thing that manifests in their consciousness appear the same to all people.</p></div>		</li>
