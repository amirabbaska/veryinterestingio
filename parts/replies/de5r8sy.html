<p>Cartilage is the only one I can't figure anything else for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cartilage is what allows the larynx to work, and most medical textbooks teach the larynx and its musculature as part of the pulmonary system rather than the musculoskeletal one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the larynx is its own structure functioning as extension of the respiratory system, that doesn't really count.</p>
<p>However, the 'bones' of the larynx are indeed cartilage and thus not an 'accessory' to bones like elsewhere. Not sure if this counts towards cartilage being classed differently, but it's a start. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bone can also impact hormonal regulation. Osteocalcin is released from bone, activates Leydig cells in the testicles and results in an increase in testosterone production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The word &quot;Musculoskeletal&quot; kind of shows that it's not monogamous.</p>
<p>Structural bone is really dynamic. It is actually a living tissue, not just calcium sticks. The calcium that is present in bone is released under hormonal control and interacts with PTH, kidney, and immune system.</p>
<p>Cartilage may be the only one I can think of. Although, it wouldn't surprise me at all if cartilage did something more than just kinda chill.</p></div>		</li>
