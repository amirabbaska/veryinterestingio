			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there was plenty of obvious and prosecutable fraud.  Even Bernanke said they should have jailed more bankers. They even had emails showing execs talking about how shotty their financial products were!  They were selling garbage and then betting it would collapse.  I think Bernanke would know what he's talking about.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>ahh,but that's the trick. The legal definition of fraud is much narrower than the way we usually use it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>then secretly bet against their own customers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your customers ask you &quot;are you betting against us?&quot; ,and you lie and say &quot;no&quot;, that is fraud. <em>However</em>, if they forget to ask, you don't have to tell them, and it's not fraud.</p>
<p>(depending on what you're selling, there might be other laws that say you <em>have</em> to tell a customer x,y,z, but it depends on the product. in GS's case, there wasn't, and it wasn't generic fraud because of the above loophole)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sold off their toxic assets as sound investments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>also only fraud if you know they're toxic. That can be pretty hard to prove, unless GS is dumb enough to put it in writing/emails.</p>
<p>And maybe they should've looked closer, but hey, the people they bought them from , and the ratings agency, said it was safe, so obviously they're not being intentionally blind, right? So not GS problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They bribed the rating agencies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn't bribe them directly, though. If you go to a ratings agency and say &quot;hey, give us an AAA rating or we go somewhere else&quot;, that's illegal. If you say &quot;hey, company x is nice to me, i'd rather go there, than company y, who is meaner&quot;, not illegal. You're not forced to go to a worse company. But if company y notices you leave, maybe they make the connection nicer=more business. And rating stuff is pretty subjective, so who's to say if that thing is AA, or AAA? (Except, if everyone starts rounding up, then we realize that everyone else is bullshitting, panic happens).</p>
<p>It's pretty bullshitty, but all the exceptions are there for a reason, because you don't want to throw people in jail unless you're pretty sure they did something illegal. Finance has a lot of subjectiveness to it, and it can be hard to tell if someone is being intentionally risky, or just dumb.</p>
<p>And it &quot;kind of&quot; makes sense:</p>
<p>It's not illegal to take your business to the guy that will give you the best deal, right? You didn't <em>ask</em> him to bump things up.</p>
<p>Those toxic assets..well, how were we supposed to no? (Plus they can point at losses they took to prove it. because odds are they had some spillover. people knew they were inflated, but no one knew how totally bad it was) </p>
<p>If you had to be totally honest to a customer about everything, you'd never be able to sell anything- that car you're selling for $45k you would've sold for $35k, for example.</p>
<p>Being dumb isn't a crime, so basically Goldman just needs to make sure that they a) don't leave proof that they did it on purpose around, and b) so stupid it's not believable.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>“This resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,” said Acting Associate Attorney General Stuart F. Delery in a statement.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, New York-based Goldman agreed to a list of facts put together by the DoJ that stated Goldman had misled investors about the mortgage-backed securities while knowing that the repackaged loans were indeed riskier than what they had told investors.</p>
<p>Goldman agreed to pay $2.39 billion in civil penalties, and another $1.8 billion in relief in the form of loan forgiveness and financing for affordable housing. An additional $875 million will be paid in cash to resolve claims from other federal and state entities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They admitted to fraud but no one went to jail. Not even this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-12/ex-goldman-vp-tourre-ordered-to-pay-825-000-in-sec-case" target="_blank">asshole</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not necessary a fraud. A bank buys different assets and sells it to clients. They also can hold assets themselves, sometimes those thing conflicted. </p>
<p>They told the customers the securities is rated AAA, not a lie.</p>
<p>The customer didnt ask if the securities are risky, is it a lie not to tell?</p>
<p>I agree it's a scumbag move, but hey... </p></div>		</li>

<p>But they knew the securities were not worthy of a AAA rating. They knew they were toxic and were trying to get them off of their books before everything collapsed. They were pushing these products on their clients. It was a breach of fiduciary duty and fraudulent. Then they doubled-down by betting against their own clients. </p></div>		</li>
