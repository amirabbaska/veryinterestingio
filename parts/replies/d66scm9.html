			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the scratch has never felt like it's been in an exact location, so one time I kinda moved around trying to find it and it ended up being far from where I thought the itch was, and after that time I've kind of just always tried to feel around for where it can be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangentially related: Your image also illustrates where spinal cord injury sufferers lose sensation.  I'm a T12 paraplegic - meaning my injury was at the 12th thoracic vertebrae level.  It's located about mid back, a few inches above the belly button.  However, I have sensation down to the top of my hips.  Shit's fascinating.</p>
<p>Totally related: Since I have bad nerve damage, at the location of my injury, I get the unscratchable itchies something fierce. Super frustrating</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I scratch that by closing my mouth and forcefully dragging air across the itchy spot thereby making a pig noise.</p>
<p>Also if it's really deep in there, I stick my fingers in my ears and give 'em a wiggle as I make the pig sound. Everyone's gonna look at you like an insane person if you get caught doing it, but like 1 in 200 people will completely understand what's going on because they do it too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my god, yes I've never met someone else who knows this and I came to this thread specifically looking for this.
Anytime people say &quot;it sound like pacman If you wiggle your finger inside your ear - I bet you all just tried it! &quot; I would get confused...like, yeah, duh, everyone knows that from when they itch their inner ear. Then I realized hardly anyone actually does this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that too. Have to do a weird back-of-the-throat growl to fix it. You can sort of aim the sound to scratch the itch.</p></div>		</li>
