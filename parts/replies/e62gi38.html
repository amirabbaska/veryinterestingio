			<div class="markdown"><p>In a manner of speaking. Closing in on the endgame, on older systems like the PS3 and Xbox 360, there simply was not enough RAM to hold a significant variety of vehicles in memory.  It would get to the point that if you grab a white SUV, all the cars will turn into white SUVs in severe circumstances. This limitation is not nearly as frequent on PS4/Xbone &amp; PC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although some cars are just more popular than others. I once noticed a ton of Toyota highlanders on the road, even though I don’t drive one. It started cuz at one intersection the three cars in front of me were the same year Toyota Highlander in the same color. So the rest of the day was probably this phenomena but there’s also just a shit ton of some cars.</p></div>		</li>
