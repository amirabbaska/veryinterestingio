			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with everything above. The most important thing when responding to someone who is experiencing cardiac arrest is high quality compressions. Giving ventilations is great if you know how and have the equipment( mask or BVM), and if an AED is available definitely have somebody use it, but until people with better training and equipment show up, focus on those compressions to keep the blood moving throughout the body, particularly the brain to prevent possible damage.</p>
<p>Also, it takes about 30 compressions to actually get the blood finally moving, so it is important to do compressions with as few interruptions as possible. Have another responder/bystander use the AED so you can continue compressions while they're setting it up, and only stop when you hear &quot;analyzing heart rhythm&quot; and continue compressions if it says to do so. AED's are great because they're designed to have untrained people use them, and most can even talk you through the entire CPR process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also agree with your comment. This might be the first time i actually have a little something worthy to try and add. </p>
<p>So where I work we have taken part in a study called &quot;ART&quot; CPR (advanced resesutative training). It was originally started in a hospital in San Diego CA and my agency eventually was asked to partake in the study. Essentially the rule of thumb is that you literally never stop compressions unless,</p>
<ol>
<li>You are shocking a Pt. </li>
<li>Pulse check rhythm check</li>
<li>Switching in and out of compressions with your partners</li>
<li>You have pulses</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously not in any order.
Yes you can intubate with compressions. Not ideal but you can. And yes you can ventilate while compressions are being done at the same time. </p>
<p>While being trained on ART CPR our educators showed us studies on how at 30 compressions the heart is barely getting to its peaked point at which the best CPR is being performed but then you have to suddenly stop to ventilate. As for conventional CPR as soon as you hit 30 you would lose that prime in the heart(pump) because of ventilations. Then you would have to work on priming that heart(pump) again. Well with ART you are never really stopping cpr. It is continuous and thus keeping your heart primed at its best it can be while good cpr is being performed. It's important to remember anytime you are switching or performing a task that involves stopping cpr that you take no longer than 10 seconds to do it then get back on the chest. </p>
<p>We also have what we call &quot;see through CPR technology&quot; in which the defib pads can show the underlying rhythm while you are thumpin on the chest and not pick up any artifact(interference) on the monitor. This allows us to interpret the rhythm while still continuing CPR. Which will let us know if your heart is beating again or if we should shock you or push medications. </p>
<p>Also on our pads we have what we call a &quot;puc&quot; that goes where correct hand placement is for cpr and we do our compressions on that. The puc is pretty much an accelerometer that picks up rate and depth of compression that we can see on our monitor. And we aim to stay at 100-120 bpm and a depth at about 2-2.5 inches. This is represented not only as numbers on the monitor but as a couple boxes that we aim to keep filled and as long as we are within the limits our boxes will be filled. Which leads to great CPR.</p>
<p>Im up reading this post in the middle of the night so im just gonna throw out the numbers that i can remember off the top of my head. If anyone is interested i can get the real numbers at some point.</p>
<p>I wanna say our numbers went froma 3-5% annual rosc recovery to i believe 50% rosc recovery with the pt eventually being able to leave the hospital with little to no deficits. There is a saying from our Continuing Education educators is that if you are gonna have a &quot;heart attack&quot; do it in our city.</p>
<p>Im happy to answer any questions to the best of my abilities. I am also in no way advocating for people to change things to the way &quot;we&quot; do things. For people that wanna help others in that very serious situation, I suggest a CPR class. </p>
<p>I believe our type of CPR is still being analyzed and studied. From what im told our numbers for our saves show that this type of CPR is really promising and we wear that proudly where I work.</p></div>		</li>
