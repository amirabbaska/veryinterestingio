			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the planet can't be tidally locked to the star or rotate so slow that there are masive temperature swings.</p>
<p>But at the same time almost none of that applies to subterranean life. And also, there are ideal star properties.</p>
<p>I got to meet the lead astro-biologist for Mars last year who presented all kinds of life on Earth that was unusual. One cave isolated from the surface for thousands of years has eyeless fish living in acid with a ph of 0. Another sample of &quot;living rocks&quot; was irradiated, encapsulated in glass and stored in a drawer. When it was pulled out to examine years later it had survived and eaten(?) through the glass.</p>
<p>Edit: A lot of people have asked about details in my second paragraph. After looking through 1000's of emails I found the astro-biologist's name! <strong>Penny Boston</strong>. I hope that is enough to search the rest. I am at a trampoline park annoying the crap out of my kids with the phone but now am genuinely curious myself and will add more later.</p>
<p>EDIT 4: Here is basically the speach she gave at my school with all the information I'm referencing: <a href="https://youtu.be/yioXvqux7_A" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/yioXvqux7_A</a></p>
<p>At about 40 mins she talks about the stuff that wouldn't die, a fungus unrelated to any known fungus or &quot;somekind of lifeform, we just don't know&quot;.  I didn't rewatch the whole presentation but it's very interesting.</p>
<p>And spelling</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> link with the cave of acid fish, spiders and more: <a href="http://www.caveslime.org/VillaLuz/" target="_blank">http://www.caveslime.org/VillaLuz/</a></p>
<p>She's an astro biologist, not a web designer. Also I got my information from her at a presentation, I can not link to my source, I was there IRL but this page has a lot of crossover. There may be a better page out there, I just googled her name and fish, then cave, then ph0 etc until I came across this. If I find mention of the stuff that ate through glass I'll add that also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Naw. Well, sorta. If you're too close to the sun, then ANY daylight might be doom. (close planets are tidally locked faster).  If you're too far, then you might cluster right at the always-noon point just to maximize heat and power. </p>
<p>But it's rough on the climate of the whole planet to have one side constantly boiling while the other side is always frozen.     Maybe there'd be constant glaciers building up and sliding sunward, turning into rivers which pour down into the blasted zone only to evaporate.  </p>
<p>If it happened to earth, the sun-side would collect all the salt in the oceans. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's quite a claim. Let me re-clarify the claim so that I can try to prove/dis-prove with maths, there's an altitude inside Jupiter's atmosphere where g = 1.0.</p>
<p>Per Google, mass of Jupiter is 1.898 × 10^27 kg and the radi is 6.9911 x 10^7 m, or 69,911 km.</p>
<p>g of 1.0 is defined as 9.81 m/s^2.</p>
<p>So to continue we need to use this formula, g = GM/r^2, where G = Gravitational Constant of 6.67408 × 10-11 m3 kg^-1 s^-2, M is Jupiter's mass at 1.898 × 10^27 kg, g = 9.81 m/s^2. More specifically, we're going to use r = sqrt(G*M/g).</p>
<p>Solving for r, we get r = 1.1 x 10^8 m, radius of Jupiter is 6.9911 x 10^7 m. At an altitude of 1.1 x 10^8 m you will experience 1.0g. But, because 1.1 x 10^8 &gt; 6.9911 x 10^7, that means that there is no altitude inside of Jupiter's atmosphere where g = 1.0</p>

<hr />
<p>Obligatory I got it wrong edit. Here's why:</p>
<p>I modeled Jupiter as a point-like mass, which, yeah could work at a distance but since we're measuring in the immediate vicinity around Jupiter means that we can't. </p>
<p>I forgot that at Jupiter's CoM, g = 0, and if g &gt; 1 at Jupiter's surface, all values in between are realized at some altitude above CoM. This means inside of the Jovian atmosphere, there <em>IS</em> a range where g = 1.0, also a range where g = 1.00000001, and g = 0.999999999999. So on and so forth. </p>
<p>And finally (kind of ties in with previous) I forgot that you have to model mass above and mass below as well as determining density of the atmosphere to get true and accurate values, but none of that matters anyway since I started out with point-like mass calculations. </p>
<p>All in all, I suck Reddit, I'm sorry!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One point of clarification: when I say &quot;thick&quot; I'm referring to size, not density. That said, it's a lot easier to estimate the size of a planet's gaseous envelope by measuring the planet's size directly. We think that planet cores can only get so large before they begin to accrete a thick envelope during formation. We can actually see this in the bimodel distribution of small planet sizes (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10375.pdf" target="_blank">see figure 7</a>). Our current guess for the maximum size a planet can be without accreting such an envelope is about 1.6 Earth radii. </p>
<p>While we could follow a similar procedure using mass, it'd be harder. A (mostly hydrogen) envelope would only account for a small part of the overall mass of the body, so it'd be difficult to make inferences about the envelope based on mass measurements alone. For example, let's say we measure the mass of a planet to be about twice that of Earth. Such a planet could have a thick envelope that makes it considerably larger than the Earth. But since such an envelope would only make up up a few percent of the planet's total mass, we can't make any reasonable inferences about how thick it is. We'd need to make follow up observations to measure the planet's size directly.</p>
<p>Also, note that these are only in reference to small planets, with sizes comparable to that of Earth. If we measured the mass of a planet to be 300 times that of Earth (like Jupiter), we can conclude that the planet definitely has a gaseous envelope.</p></div>		</li>

Just because we haven't seen it doesn't mean that under conpletelt different circumstances non-carbon based life isn't a possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The book Weird Life has a good discussion about this. A major reason that life on earth is carbon based is the chemistry of carbon - there really isn’t any other element that acts the same way. Silicon has some similarities but silicon bonds aren’t as stable.</p></div>		</li>
