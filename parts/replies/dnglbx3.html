			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the type of beer and sometimes region.
German sour beers are way better at room temperature.
In Belgium most everything is served at cellar temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What part of Europe?
I'm not arguing with you at all. Just asking for clarification.
When I was in France we drink champagne at room temperature. When I was in Belgium and the Netherlands beer was served cellar temperature depending on the style.
And here in the states it is common to drink quality bourbon and tequila at room temperature.
Like I said, last thing I'm trying to do is get into a Internet site. Just clarifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Champagne is to be drunk at 10C, not room temp. The refrigeration systems at the houses are all set to that temp, although for other events I was at it may have been cooler considering it would be warming up or they didn't have the equipment. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Domestic lagers ( bud, Miller, colors, etc) are meant to be drank as cold as possible because the cold masks the flaws or poor quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought it was because they're meant to be drunk (not &quot;drank&quot;) at the temperature at which they're fermented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, thanks for the grammar correction.</p>
<p>Beer, depending on if it's an ale or lager, is usually fermented approximately between 55 to 75° depending on the yeast.
Domestics are usually served about 30°.</p></div>		</li>
