			<div class="markdown"><p>To get anti-stokes scattering you start out in an excited state before the scattering (I would think fluorescence would work too).  The higher the temperature the more likely molecules are to be in an excited state (because of statistical mechanics/thermodyamics) so the more likely you are to get an anti-stokes transition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really that esoteric. I spent today at work trawling through papers describing the thousands of examples of people doing exactly this, but specifically in fibre optics. Uses range from national parks using it to measure fire intensity to the oil industry using it for reasons that were so dull I think I may have blacked out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Particles smaller than the wavelength of the light can scatter incoming photons, if the molecule absorbs energy then the scattered photons are lower energy than incoming ones, that is stokes scattering. If the molecules lose energy, then it is anti stokes.  It's called Rayleigh scattering if there is no energy change, and this is what causes the sky to appear blue as the other wavelengths are scattered more in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not completely correct. Rayleigh scattering refers to one type of elastic scattering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a very similar method used in experimental plasma physics called Thomson scattering.  You can work out the temperature and density of the electrons at a chosen point in a high temperature plasma by scattering a laser off of it.  Big fusion experiments often have a ridiculous array of sometimes 30+ Thomson scattering lasers so you can get a high resolution profile at one time, or fire them in sequence to measure time evolution.  </p>
<p>Plasma diagnosticians are crafty motherfuckers, able to back out so much incredible data from plasmas hotter than the core of the sun basically just by collecting photons flying out of there.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha yeah, I've worked with many for years.  I'm a theorist though so while I may know in great detail the physical process behind how many of the diagnostics work, I know almost nothing about the challenges of building them and getting them to work (and then figuring out how to process the data properly) which is the very hard part.  </p></div>		</li>
