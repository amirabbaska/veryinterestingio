			<div class="markdown"><p>In WW2, the French actually invaded Nazi Germany <em>first</em> but did very little to defend against the Belgian front - which is where the Germans invaded from (the French didn't think it possible for the Germans to move trough the Ardennes forest). After the Germans broke through Belgium and encircled the French who were waiting on the maginot line (German border) it became damn impossible to hold out against the Germans. </p>
<p>Result: France surrendered in a matter of weeks and the Vichy government was established as a puppet to Hitler. This was seen as dishonorable because the French didn't really take the full force of the Nazis like say Poland did (Poland was ripped apart, whereas the Nazis didn't even bomb Paris). </p>
<p>In WW1, France was overly aggressive because it wanted to avenge the humiliating defeats it suffered in the 19th century (just 40 years before Germany crowned a kaiser in Versailles). </p>
<p>The French aren't really the best in military history, contrary to what the Reddit community would suggest. Sure, Napoleon was brilliant and lead France to a short lived zenith, and yes, the French did help defeat Great Britain in our war of independence - but hardly known as a naval power like Britain or military machine like Germany. The French were very capable Europeans with a respectable military culture, but the tremendous losses in WW1 and shock defeat in WW2 have defined France as a weak military at best. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They took tremendous losses in ww1 but they were also the ones stopping the Germans from reaching Paris. Also you are forgetting their wars previously to napoleon. No one gets has big as France in the heart of Europe not knowing what war is and being good at it. All who failed simply disappeared, look at Burgundy for example, or Aragon, etc. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Tremendous losses on both sides, I think holding up the boundary to germany make us on par with them, or better if we take into account that they had better aircraft and tanks. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>It was a huge tactical mistake, i would not extend it to general &quot;force&quot;. </p>
<p>I think Hollywood played the most important role in image after WW2, both on the &quot;weakness&quot; of France and the greatness of our &quot;saviour&quot; USA. I don't remember the source but I remember that after the war, french people were mostly thankfull to russia for their lives and tactical choice, then to uk for their intelligence and constant harassing of germany, then USA for their fresh weapons. It was very clear back then that it took a lot of time to USA to decide to intervene with the idea to get some chunk of both France and Germany. Nowadays almost everyone think USA played the greater role, which is not the case. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Germany was only &quot;the military machine&quot; in the two world wars, which are recent, and both of which it lost. Before that, for a thousand years, France was the country which dominated land warfare.</p>
<p>Also, Napoleonic France absolutely was a &quot;military machine&quot;, it literally invented total war.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Compared to who ? The British and the Germans also suffered tremendous losses in WW1.</p>
<p>Also, the French army was the main actor on the allied side in WW1, presenting it as weak in any way is heavily inaccurate, it was literally the most powerful army in the world at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The order to shoot anyone retreating not withstanding? Russia didn't pull their armies back to draw Germany in. Germany destroyed entire Russian armies, and Russia just created new ones behind the front. Russia had a 21 million soldier reserve pool, vs 6 for the Germans. The Soviet Japanese nonaggression treaty of 41 was also very fortuitous for Russia, as it allowed them to bring their fresh Siberian elite troops to defend Moscow against the exhausted Germans.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is complete disrespect to the bravery of the Russian soldiers who often fought tenaciously until the very end. No other nation killed as many Nazis as the Soviets.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the other aspect is that WW1 was won by america in about five minutes.  Had america joined WW1 at its start they would have been beaten like a catholic school boy who told a nun to go fuck herself.  But because they put off joining the war until all sides were totally exhausted, and did an insane job of building up their economy and military power during the war years, when they joined the war it was the final straw that broke Germany.</p>
<p>So from an american perspective they got involved in WW1, and immediately, easily, won it in a way that france had been unable to in 4 years.  And then in WW2 france immediately lost a war that they had been planning for, and expecting, for 20 years.  And again the americans basically swept in and saved the day with just enough grand heroic battles to make it a great story, but without having say every military aged male of the generation killed or maimed by the conflict and leaving the country without any adult men, or having every major city razed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  This goes back to my point about historical ignorance.  Americans only see their own involvement in WW1 and completely ignore the immense sacrifices the French made defending their country. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am trying to put my finger on exactly what it is, and its not easy.  Certainly when WW1 started everyone kind of went &quot;Holly fuck, this is what machine guns do to cavalry charges?  What the fuck is this?&quot;  And then artillery and poison gas, and it was just this slaughter on an unbelivable scale brought about by virtue of being caught of guard by how immensely leathal new technologies were.</p>
<p>And had america been in it from day 1 they would have had the same issue.</p>
<p>But as the years dragged on it is hard to look at the conduct of the war as anything other than idiotic.  They spent millions of lives trying the same things again and again and again that were not working but just on larger and larger scales.  There were incremental improvements but there was also a criminal degree of stupidity infusing the conduct of the war.  And for America it is harder to say &quot;oh yeah we would have done all that criminally stupid stuff as well so we shouldn't give them a hard time about it.&quot;</p>
<p>WW1 really made every major power except america look criminally stupid and incompetent at war.  Despite the fact that at first it wasn't their fault.  Someone should have been saying &quot;No more offensives until we figure this shit out.  I don't care if it takes five years, we are not attacking them if the effect is to simply feed men into a wood chipper hoping to wear down its teeth.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree that the US actually built up its military capabilities while the war was going on.  The US was almost entirely unprepared for a major war on entry.  It was only because it could produce so much and had so much excess money that they aided the Allies to a substantial degree in the time before Germany surrendered.  </p>
<p>A small expeditionary force did fight in France, and reinforcements were arriving by the end of the war, but actual US military power was fairly small compared to the mass armies in Europe.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Citation needed; the amount of manpower that America would have been able to bring to bear meant that the western front would have been much more fiercely fought then it actually was. </p>
<p>The real battles of Verdun and Somme bled both sides white and brought both sides to its breaking point, but if America was around, the battle could have continued well beyond the breaking point of the German army.</p></div>		</li>
