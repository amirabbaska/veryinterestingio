<p>Additionally, for the longest time, simple, unsweetened and unaged alcohol was used as a disinfectant or as a base for medication in medical settings and many distilleries would produce batches and sell them as medicinal products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A new bourbon distillery opened near me a few years ago. After producing a bunch of bourbon and putting it in barrels, they made a bunch of gin, which doesn't need to be aged.</p>
<p>They also built nicely finished rentable space in the distillery building for events. Want to get married in a distillery? <a href="https://newriff-events.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">This one's pretty cool!</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of distilleries also do tours and have gift shops where they sell merch.</p>
<p>Apparently, there’s an after market for used whiskey casks as well. Apparently certain wines, beers, and other spirits are sometimes aged in previously used whiskey casks.</p></div>		</li>
