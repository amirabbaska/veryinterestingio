			<div class="markdown"><p>I think &quot;vinyl sound&quot; is also related to the tube amps used at the time, while most amplifiers today are solid-state. Tube amps have a different response curve than solid state amplifiers do, and are usually perceived to have a &quot;warmer&quot; sound. But as /u/spaghettilee2112 said, this is not hard science and is very much open to perception and interpretation.</p></div>		</li>
