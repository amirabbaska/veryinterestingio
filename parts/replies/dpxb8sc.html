			<div class="markdown"><p>I passed my first kidney stone over the course of a month and afterwards I lost the ability to hold it. I urinate small amounts at least once a waking hour and twice during the night, but it can be as bad as needing to go 4 separate times during the half hour after I wake. A cystoscopy returned nothing, nor did a blood test or multiple prostate exams. It’s definitely lowered my quality of life. I can’t imagine living with worse!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People have committed suicide due to suffering with constant tinnitus (ringing in the ear)</p>
<p>Funny how something so seemingly trivial can reduce or even destroy your quality of life.</p>
<p>Edit: numerous people have commented that I said &quot;ringing in the year.&quot; I did not. If you or a loved one read &quot;ringing in the year&quot;, I am saddened to have to tell you that you just didn't hear me right the first time, and probably have tinnitus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And I have health insurance now too! This is very exciting information, thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Myrbetriq is great for an overactive bladder, which can really wreck your life. And mine was combined with being unable to pee when anyone was around. It's not that I didn't want to--I couldn't. My husband can't go on an airplane, ever. </p>
<p>My co-pay for Myrbetriq is $70/month with insurance. Another, cheaper option is Detrol, which works well but is an anticholingeric and thus can cause a dry mouth, and has been linked to dementia. So I spring for the Myrbetriq.</p>
<p>Bladder activity has gone from 40x a day to about 8x a day. Magic.</p></div>		</li>
