			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually don't see that character very often; I knew it exists, but I had to draw it out on my iPad so I could google it and get its meaning! The more commonly used word for snake nowadays is 蛇 (she2).</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure, but I think the primary meaning is 'snake'. In the past, the Chinese would use the zodiacs, which are based on 12 animals, the snake being one of them, to demarcate time. 巳 would be coupled with the word 时 'time, hour' to form 巳时, which then referred to '9am to (not or) 11am'.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That actually makes a lot of sense, I wonder why I never thought of that before. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, these are very old characters in Chinese. The characters related to the zodiac are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthly_Branches" target="_blank">the 12 Earthly Branches</a>. However, these were only used for determining certain times of day. Nowadays, you wouldn't use them to refer to the actual zodiac, and it would be rare to use them as time period demarcations, unless you were trying to evoke a more classical feeling in your writing.</p>
<p>There is a group of partially related old characters called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_stem" target="_blank">the 10 Heavenly Stems</a>. These characters are used as ordinals, that is, they correspond to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and so on in English. These are used more frequently today than the Earthly Branches. For example, 甲 is 1st, and you might see it if you received a high grade in school. However, you will probably see arabic numbers used as ordinals more often.</p>
<p>How do the Earthly Branches relate to the Heavenly Stems? They are often used together as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar#Codes" target="_blank">Chinese Lunar Calendar</a>. You combine the stems and branches to form years. Essentially, each stem is combined with each branch, the 1st stem the 1st branch, 2nd stem with 2nd branch, and so on, followed by rolling over to 1st again, so after the 10th stem is combined with the 10th branch, you have the 1st stem combined with the 11th branch. Eventually, the pattern repeats, and you have 60 unique combinations, giving you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_sexagenary_cycle" target="_blank">the Lunar Calendar's Sexagenary Cycle</a>, a cycle 60 years long.</p>
<p>Recall that branches are associated with zodiac. Since each year in the cycle is made up of a stem and branch, the branch decides the Chinese zodiac for that year. For example, this year is 丁酉, where 酉 is the Earthly Branch associated with the rooster zodiac. So this year is the year of the rooster. In addition, the Heavenly Stems are associated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing" target="_blank">5 classical Chinese elements</a>: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, with two stems representing each element. For example, 甲 and 乙 both represent wood. </p>
<p>Why are there two stems for each element? They represent either the yang (light, 陽) or yin (dark, 陰) side of that element. In the previous example, 甲 represents the light part of wood element, and 乙 represents the yin part of the wood element.</p>
<p>Thus, if you wanted to be very specific about which year it is in the Sexagenary Cycle, you would use the yin-yang, element, and zodiac. For example, this year is specifically the year of the Yin Fire Rooster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to elaborate, the ancient Chinese time system consists of 12 &quot;hours&quot; i.e., the day is split into twelve 2-hour blocks. The Chinese day starts at 11pm, and the one hour lasts from 11pm to 1am. If you go around the clock, you would eventually end up with your 9am to 11am slot. </p>
<p>Also, the naming system for the &quot;hours&quot; is not numerical like the English system. Each hour has their own name, or a word/character. Imagine this as calling it Apple o'clock and orange o'clock instead of one o'clock and two o'clock. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the subject is &quot;apples&quot;, because &quot;were eaten&quot; is passive (which is why it's &quot;were eaten&quot; not &quot;was eaten&quot;).  OVS would be &quot;Him saw I&quot;, which could work in a very poetic context.</p></div>		</li>
