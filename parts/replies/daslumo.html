			<div class="markdown"><p>Tattoo ink is, as far as I know, chemically neutral and won't react with anything in the dermis. It would only become excessive if you went completely nuts and started injecting quantities that obstruct blood flow - but this is way beyond anything anyone would have good reason to do. Several people have tattooed their entire bodies without suffering any for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To push this to the logical extreme, what if I got a jet black tattoo over every inch of open skin? Would that obstruct blood flow?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are people like that, and they don't seem to have any problems. I'm talking like 90%+ coverage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tattoo ink cannot be eaten or broken down by the body's cells, so it will sit in the dermis forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tattoo ink is taken up by macrophages (immune cells for the ELI5) very slowly over time, which is why you see tattoos fade</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would that be a similar principle as to why scars last for years? What about ones that are just scratches on the surface, not deep, don't bleed and yet still last for years?  Does the part of the body also influence how long scars last, given the different types of skin around the body?</p></div>		</li>
