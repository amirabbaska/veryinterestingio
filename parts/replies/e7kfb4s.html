			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, that’s so interesting! I was in Hawaii when the fake missile scare happened in January, and I remember seeing the “missile incoming, not a drill” alert and feeling so much immediate adrenaline I almost passed out...</p>
<p>But then after that, time seemed to come to a stop. The next 30 minutes felt like 90... but I had never put together it was the adrenaline that produced that feeling!</p>
<p>Has there been any research completed about adrenaline affecting memory? Because I feel like I can replay “heart drop” days minute-by-minute in my mind even years later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body will also increase other chemicals in what the body thinks of as &quot;Ultimate Survivor&quot; mode.  Those chemicals, like adrenaline, epinephrine, dopamine, etc all play a role in giving you a sharp sense of focus, drive, and to some degree, &quot;invincibility&quot;.  Your pain threshold will rise, time will feel slower because you're able to make many more decisions in the same amount of time that you could only make a few before.</p>
<p>Epinephrine and dopamine play levels in encoding memories.  People also have a tendency of remembering tramatic events, specifically those where your body has dumped those chemicals into your body. </p>
<p>I still remember the phone call I had with my parents on 9/11, they were in New York the morning of the attacks.  I had tried to call them several times and was pacing the floor.  I can recall the conversation and sounds like it was 10 mins ago.  They were driving through the whole mess when I got the call from my mother that they were ok, while I heard my father in the background yelling at firefighters/cops asking if there was anything he could do to help or if anyone needed anything.</p>
<p>There are some memories you will carry with you forever when those situations occur.  A contributing factor is your bodies chemistry.</p></div>		</li>
