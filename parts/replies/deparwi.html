			<div class="markdown"><p>To me it looks like stars twinkling. If you keep your eye on one, a lot of the time multiple flashes come from the same place in quick succession.</p>
<p>Camera sensors certainly can detect cosmic rays, but another thing is that your camera is mostly pointed at the horizon. You are most likely to observe cosmic rays by pointing the camera directly up, since there is less atmosphere for them to go through. With the frequency of the flashes that I saw there's no way they're all cosmic rays, that's just too frequent especially for the horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cosmic rays don't have to go through the optics, they can go through the camera case. And with the given orientation they are more likely to hit several pixels at once.</p>
<p>Stars shouldn't twinkle notably at that height. Edit: Camera effects are possible, but the atmosphere doesn't lead to that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the camera does any kind of auto exposure correction then the faintest stars will disappear and reappear.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The twinkling, if that's what it is, would result from aliasing on the sensor or when the video was downsampled to 1080p.  That's one effect I saw for sure in the video.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you're seeing compression artifacts in the video, for sure.<br />
I'd have to see the original source video, but given the very wide-angle lens most of these cameras use, I'm guessing that lens fidelity is part of the problem.  You'll notice stars seem to disappear when the center of the lens moves over them.   That point of light at infinity is getting blurred out of existence. </p>
<p>Hard to really tell from this video, but it doesn't look like they're twinkling, but that the movement of the camera/pixel response is causing the effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Multiple flashes from the same place could suggest cosmic ray showers. If a high-energy ray hits the upper atmosphere it can cause other particles to be generated from that spot.  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_shower_(physics" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_shower_(physics</a>)</p></div>		</li>
