			<div class="markdown"><p>When I lived in Japan 20 years ago gambling was illegal, so you couldn't technically get your money invested back from playing Pachinko.  However, you could get your Pachinko winnings and trade them for a &quot;prize&quot;, which you take out the back to the Yakuza run prize exchange who would buy it back for money, they would then sell it back to the Pachinko parlour.  Not only did the Police turn a blind eye, you would often see them playing.</p>
<p>I think the Yakuza has been forced out of this now though as the practice got too rampant and too obvious.  The Japanese allow the Yakuza to operate, as long as they do it discretely.  They essentially run the ports, but if they started importing massive quantities of weapons or drugs, the Police would stop them.  So, they tread a fine line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This used to be done in America, too! &quot;Prize Fighters&quot; were called such because when they won, they were given a gold/silver/bronze watch depending on where they placed. They'd then &quot;sell&quot; the watch back and get the prize money!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>theres a louie theroux documentary in philadelphia where he sees the head of a drug dealing organisation while hes cruising around with the police. hr asks why they dont just get out and arrest him and they said (paraphrasing) 'if we arrest him or take him down, there'll be a new boss by tomorrow and we wont know who he is or what hes up'. basically the yakuza is probably so big that its easier for the police to manage it with relationships built with current bosses than to just arrest leaders and run around trying to find the new bosses repeatedly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that that is true, but how true? If the police took all the records and contact info, then how could a new boss pop up? I think that a new boss would have to start from almost scratch. I don't know how much of an advantage it would be, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Power vacuums always get filled and it is usually messy for some period of time until the new order is established. Could be weeks, months, or years. Look how messy Iraq is. We knew that would happen when we took out the leader. Taking out a local drug lord is the same thing at a smaller level.</p></div>		</li>

<p>crime is inevitable, so it might as well be organized so that it doesn't get out of hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Literally from <em>Guards! Guards!</em> by Terry Pratchett:</p>
<p><em>One of the Patrician's greatest contributions to the reliable operation of Ankh-Morpork had been, very early in his administration, the legalizing of the ancient Guild of Thieves. Crime was always with us, he reasoned, and therefore, if you were going to have crime, it at least should be organized crime.</em></p></div>		</li>
