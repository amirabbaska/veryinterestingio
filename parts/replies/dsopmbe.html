			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to say. I personally love general relativity by hobson, efstathiou and lasenby but it's pretty technical. I don't know as much about books designed for the layman I would just look at books on special relativity,and  general relativity, and look for information on 4 vectors. If you have any questions about that sort of stuff or about a specific book feel free to ask, relativity is one of my favorite subjects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mind technical. Thanks, will definitely look into that. I didn't realise this 4D model was the canonical way of doing general relativity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you please explain how photons interact with different matter during refraction, in terms of particles?</p>
<p>People here keep saying photons always travel at c, but I was always taught that to remember Snell's law, you can think of the more optically dense material as impeding the light, therefore subject it to greater angle of refraction. So does light slow down here?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean that the photon itself isn't affected by time or that if you were in its place with the same properties you wouldn't perceive time passing? Because photons are affected by gravity and gravity effects our perception of time </p></div>		</li>
