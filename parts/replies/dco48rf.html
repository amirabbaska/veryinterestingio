			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense to me. When I had to swear on a bible I thought &quot;I don't  believe in any religon and therefore have no issue lying after swearing on a bible&quot; It's a 100% meaningless  to me and feel it is then rendered completely ineffective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to make this an anti-Trump rant but I do agree that we seem to have an unofficial requirement for our POTUS's religion.  </p>
<p>It bothered me that Trump had to pretend to be a Christian (and was not very convincing, IMHO), in order to be the GOP nominee.    </p>
<p>The guy has never been religious, never pretended to be. It was always pretty clear he either worshipped himself and/or money.     </p>
<p>But one second after he's the official nominee &amp; we have guys bending themselves into pretzels to convince themselves he's a &quot;godly man&quot;?    </p>
<p>I find that weird. Both the pretense &amp; the hypocrisy can be a little much.   </p>
<p>A POTUS candidate who leaves their religion out of the public would be refreshing. But to some, that wouldn't be possible to get their support unless the person at least attempted to <em>appear Christian</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be an issue that's hashed out prior to inauguration. It's not unprecedented, and it's been theorized that other presidents have had agnostic leanings. It's really just a matter of time at this point. But, at the point we have an openly non Christian choose not to swear on the bible is at the point where the political paradigms have shifted to a point where the matter will probably be irrelevant.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, we're still living within the paradigm of the Reagan era, and his coalition with the fundamentalist Christian right movement. I think this era is just a particularly devout era that will stick out in hindsight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The media&quot; wouldn't be the issue here, just some people the media informs.</p>
<p>Swearing on the Bible has become a tradition. There are more recent traditions every president must now take for granted and follow: wearing a flag pin, or ending a speech with &quot;God Bless America&quot;. Those are fairly recent traditions. But it's hard to imagine a president who wouldn't follow them anymore.</p></div>		</li>
