			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens is your muscles need fuel to function - called ATP, made by a combination of glucose and respiration.  Seeing as one of those two ingredients kinda stopped when a person dies (the respiration, also known as breathing) ATP stops being made.</p>
<p>But the neat thing is, ATP is what helps make muscles relaxed, not stiff.  So for about 2 hours after you kick the bucket, you're still very much limp and flexible.  After that 2 hours the ATP runs out and your muscles get locked in place. Starting at the smallest muscles as they don't have as big of a store house of ATP as the bigger ones do.</p>
<p>It stops agian in about 8 to 12 hours after death, depending on the environment, as that's when the muscles start to decay and break down.  With the muscles becoming easier to tear and break, everything becomes starts to become floppy agian.  Starting agian from smallest to largest, with the largest of leg muscles taking up to 2 days to become flexible agian (under ideal preservation).  </p>
<p>It's important to note that this is a process, as in the body will slowly stiffen, then slowly relax agian.  It's hardly like the body will just instantly lock up at 2 hours then loosen up at 18 hours.  But it being a process allows for detectives and coroners to determine time of death.  Kinda useful if you're investigating a potential murder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of muscle tightening chemicals (calcium) leading out of dying cells and no more muscle releasing chemicals (ATP) being produced. The relaxation of rigor mortis occurs after about two to three days as enzymes break down the muscle binding points. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost nothing the guy before you said was factually correct. Most people don’t eat meat until weeks after rigor has set in. Under normal conditions exsanguinated meat will not become rancid while refrigerated for about 6 weeks. Rigor sets in within 2-4 hours of slaughter. Overtime the breakdown of tissues like collagen will resolve the rigor. Meat eaten before or after rigor is tender. Meat cooked during rigor is tough as fuck. As it’s almost impossible for a meat supplier to get meat on your table in 2-4 hours it’s very unlikely that you’ve ever eaten packaged meat that isn’t weeks past the onset of rigor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So follow up on that then, does it take weeks to get meat from an animal to a store? Because most meat you buy is only good for a few days to a week refrigerated at home under 4 degree C refrigeration.</p></div>		</li>

I made the mistake once of not cleaning them right away when getting back and it was a terrible mistake. They get cold and the feathers do NOT pluck easier than doing it right away. Do it while still warm, the pluck like a dream. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that kinda makes a different sense- the fluids expand into the tissue (causing edema) and the swelling makes the feathers not pull out as easily/quickly? </p>
<p>it's like an alternate affect of causing a swelling on the quill base and therefore retention of the quill/feather (which is hollow where it meets the skin)... whereas soon after post mortem (that is, &quot;still warm&quot;) the feather is at a better equilibrium / hydration at the follicle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I think happens is when the bird gets cold, the skin shrink and gets more tense/tough, allowing it to grip the base of the feather more firmly. When it’s still warm or semi warm, the skin is looser making it easier to pluck the bird. There probably is more of a biological explanation to that example, but that’s what ive taken from my experiences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be clarified that properly aging meat is very different from buying meat at the store and letting it sit in your fridge for extra days. Don’t do the latter it will go bad, and don’t think the former is dangerous just because you’ve gotten sick from chicken that went bad, there are precautions taken and it’s a very different process.</p></div>		</li>
