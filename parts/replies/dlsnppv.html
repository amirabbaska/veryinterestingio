			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. This is me to a T! I always got great report cards from school but the one thing teachers all agreed on was I was always off in my own imagination. There was times (I still do it to this day) that I just zone out completely and my head goes to imaginary situations and worlds. I've used this to write stuff instead :) I have a whole story in my head the last few weeks that I'm turning into a fantasy novel. </p></div>		</li>
