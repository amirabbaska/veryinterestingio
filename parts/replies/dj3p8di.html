			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is a measurement of the speed at which the atoms in a material are moving: when they are moving fast, it's hot; when they are moving just a little, it's cold.</p>
<p>An increase in speed comes from energy being added to the system, a decrease from energy being removed.</p>
<p>So, to address your question, if you wish to redefine energy based physics and make everything run on less lack of energy, sure, why not.</p></div>		</li>
