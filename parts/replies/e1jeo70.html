			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a solid explanation. You aren't removing starch though (like OP thought). The bitter compound in the juice is called cucurbitacin and it's designed to prevent animals from eating cucumbers. Wild cucumbers are unpleasantly bitter but we've bred them to be sweeter and more palatable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't just taste unpleasant, it's <em>toxic</em>. There are occasionally cases of people getting very ill or even dying from eating squashes or cucumbers that have unusually high concentrations of cucurbatins.</p>
<p>If a cucumber or squash tastes unusually bitter, you probably shouldn't eat it (and why would you want to?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard about this on a podcast or something a while ago, and the thing that stuck with me is that most severe cases of this are found in women... They'll make some squash dish and the whole family will refuse to eat it because it tastes awful, but the person who cooked it insists it's fine and eats a ton to prove it. Which is sad but kind of hilarious. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Mind you he's 75 and never believed most of what we said because of his &quot;It may be modern, but old stuff have always worked so why bother&quot; attitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Great explanation, it makes sense and I can imagine it making a difference in taste. I used to think it was just something my mother used to do because she saw others do it; thinking it's just a placebo that people experienced a better taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can go either way.
If I’m making a veggie tray for a party I will peel 4 strips off and slice into rounds.
Alternatively, I drag the times of a fork down the skin and then slice. It makes a nice presentation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I peel them when I eat them any time, but sometimes when I get a salad somewhere, they peel off four strips and leave the rest of the skin, then slice them and add to my salad. I've had it both ways, too, but have never tasted a difference. Maybe I'm weird.</p></div>		</li>
