<p>To recreate the feel of a 1g environment?  Possibly.  No doubt NASA has given the idea thought with plans for long-term habitats on the Moon and Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth is spinning, so you do it every evening.</p>
<p>However, in the scenario I was considering, the centrifuge would resemble those used to test pilots at high G loads.</p>
<p>I spent 5 years in the Navy.  Ships pitch and roll all over the place.  If people can sleep in those conditions, being spun in a centrifuge wouldn't be a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Below about 6 rpm most humans don't notice that they're spinning or get nauseous due to it. Centripetal acceleration is determined by v^2  /r. Assuming we want .75g, we're looking at a radius of 20m. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: this is late night math, so it might be wrong.</p></div>		</li>
