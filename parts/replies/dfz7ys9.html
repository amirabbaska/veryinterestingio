			<div class="markdown"><p>Trees are carbon sinks. They can release their carbon back into the atmosphere if they are burned or die and are completely decomposed (a process that takes a long time), but until that happens they store carbon and &quot;sequester&quot; it outside of the atmosphere. Using trees as carbon sinks is a &quot;temporary&quot; fix only in so far as everything is temporary.</p></div>		</li>
