<p>&quot;...you feel as though you're being pushed into the ground not because of a force called 'gravity', but because time is moving faster for your head than for your feet.&quot;</p>

<p>I like Vsauce, but I don't think that is an accurate way to describe it. I mean...I still get pushed into the ground if I stand on my head, sit, or lie down</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a submission for peer review on this several years back. Dark matter doesn't exist, gravity is mass over time, and the space we see out there is a ghost field. The distortions can tell us more about present day locations of stellar objects than about dark matter.</p></div>		</li>
