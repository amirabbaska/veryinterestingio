			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats part of it. Many conservatives would be for something like universal healthcare if they knew it could work. A lot of people automatically believe that what they have in Canada or Western Europe is some kind of utopian reality and there are no draw backs to those systems, conservatives are much more scrutinizing if it really actually is better in terms of cost over all in the society and in the long run. Many believe that government bureaucracy imposes such a large amount of waste and inefficiency that it would become unsustainable, and then there are many ethical issues that go along with the idea of a government official doling out who gets care and how much they can get.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US also has roughly 10x the population of Canada, which means the system would need to support 10x as many people...Unfortunately, this does NOT mean such a system would only be 10x more expensive in the US, which could be easily made up for by the fact that the US can generate 10x as much tax revenue...</p>
<p>In reality, a system 10x larger requires MUCH higher costs because administration costs rise exponentially as things get larger...</p>
<p>ELIF-ish version:</p>
<p>It is like having a small business that is run by one person with 5 employees working under them vs a large corporation that employs 1000. In the case of the small business, the owner can directly manage all his workers, so everyone is actively involved in producing income for the business. With a business employing 1000, you need managers, supervisors, HR representatives, janitorial staff, security, IT and a host of other administrative positions which cost even more money than your average worker, which don't directly increase the income of the business but DO increase complexity, cost, and bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Basically, the amount of tax revenue needed to support a program like this in the US will cost MUCH more per person than it would per person in a smaller country because the cost of maintaining that system becomes much higher the larger the system becomes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is this true? Do you have references?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very very false. Were it the case, large corporations wouldn't be able to compete against small businesses, and so wouldn't exist. </p>
<p>Yes, as you scale up, you need more admin and begin to have specialized division of labor, but this is a benefit of scaling up as opposed to a drawback of it. You have janitors and such so that you can have your other employees focus directly on specific tasks and functions, which can create huge advantages. You need more managers because there is more room for fraud, waste, and abuse, as it is much easier for those things to go unnoticed when work gets so spread out.</p>
<p>Admin costs get so out of hand in corporations and government not because it's necessary, but because there is so much efficiency found in scaling up that there's room for it. People get in the habit of expanding their departments for the sake of self promotion and satisfaction and begin eating into the efficiencies. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I really don't think this is true. Though there may be some industry that works as described, I've not seen it, and generally speaking the exact opposite is true.</p>
<p>In economics, the term is &quot;economy of scale,&quot; meaning that as you grow, overhead costs decrease per unit as the number of produced units increases. This is for exactly the opposite reason you state here. Your 5 person staff still pays for IT, janitors, and security. The difference is that they pay someone else to do it, or they accept the risk/costs of not paying for it (i.e. get Ted to do it, he knows computers!). And when this 5 person business pays for a &quot;unit&quot; of IT, it is at greater cost than a huge organization that has a 20 person IT team on staff.</p>
<p>If, as you say, cost per unit tends to increase as more units are produced, large companies like walmart wouldn't have lower prices, they would have higher.  In fact, what would be the reason to grow any business or organization if every additional unit was less effecient?</p>
<p>There are plenty of caveats and theoretical limits, but in the real world I've seen no such behavior.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have those people used our current health care system? It's incredibly inefficient. I spent at least 2 hours on the phone with my doctors office and a lab trying to figure out where my test results went. Turns out they were on the secretary's desk, she just didn't see them for 2 days. This is the efficient, well oiled machine the free market creates?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't fall victim to recency bias.  No one said that that the current system is perfect.  A perfectly efficient system is not possible.  What opponents of a governmental health system are afraid of is that it would be <em>less</em> efficient than it is currently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also about access. I have the money. I want to be able to get the best doctor because they'll be available for me, whereas with universal healthcare I may have to wait behind someone with less money than me, and that's not fair in a capitalist society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO I think it's more than that. Personal responsibility is a big part of the conservative point of view. If the government pays they can control what healthcare you can have access to. If the individual pays the individual is in control. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Being paid by (the government) is a means to an end. To paint broad strokes, liberals believe that there should be a social safety net - a minimum quality of life that is still decent. Below that we help our fellow citizens out so they don't fall between the cracks. Handled by the government is the most effective solution demonstrated in other countries, so it seems worthwhile trying.</p>
<p>Conservatives (at least those with whom I've conversed) believe that people should be self supporting, and there are always backups like community outreach, church, etc. Many also feel like welfare and social programs are &quot;stealing&quot; from their paychecks so people can be lazy.</p></div>		</li>
