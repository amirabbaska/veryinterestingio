			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, this is an issue of selection bias. There are no records of the trees/insects that didn't encounter big globs of resins, so when we look back there appears to be a disproportionate amount of amber records. </p>
<p>Finally the entire amber record covers a period of millions of years. Even a very low rate of fossilisation will produce a large number of viable fossils over that timespan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Also, it's important to remember the scales involved here. Geographically: the entire area of all forests on Earth. Chronologically: tens to hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p>Let's say the right conditions for a tree to produce a huge glob of resin are so rare that in only happens maybe a few times per year globally. That still translates to millions of events per million years. And thus tens or hundreds of millions of opportunities to create big amber fossils for every time span of 10 million years.</p>
<p>So even though these events are reasonably rare (much more so than, say, insects being trapped in amber) the huge scales of geological time and geographic area mean that the overall chance of any one event happening is more reasonable (though still rare compared to normal fossilization processes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. In other words, there were great many things that were much more abundant than amber; they just didn't survive long</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried googling it but: does amber have any antibiotic properties?  What causes it to preserve objects that would already have a wealth of bacteria on them?  Is there anything we can make nowadays that would work as well?  Epoxy?  </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it is similar in secondary function to Honey that bees make.</p>
<p>Honey is antibiotic to protect the hive from fungal and bacterial infection. The treesap is the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, its purpose is to be a physical and chemical barrier. Nothing can survive/grow in something containing so little water. </p>
<p>Epoxy is another kind of resin, so it's practically identical in that regard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A creature being embedded in amber or epoxy would have lots of its own moisture within its blood and various juices.  I'm surprised the creature doesn't completely deteriorate before the amber had time to preserve it.  </p>
<p>I mean, obviously it works.   These things are preserved.   I just can't figure out the &quot;how&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As was mentioned on the radio today, during Quirks and Quarks (great CBC show), the resins extruded contain significant quantities of Terpenes (one of the sources for Turpentine). This had the effect of desiccating what got stuck in it. It is also quite acidic, which makes it naturally anti-microbial, which also has a significant role in preserving the inclusions.</p></div>		</li>
