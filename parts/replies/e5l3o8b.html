			<div class="markdown"><p>So the short answer is it depends. The long answer is that unconsciousness isn't just one single state. We have metrics to differentiate out exactly how nonresponsive someone is. The most common of which is the Glasgow Coma Scale. But yeah, someone who is GCS 3 by definition will not be woken up or respond to external stimuli, including smelling salts, noise, or pain. So yeah it all depends on the affected areas of the brain and the severity of injury occurring.</p></div>		</li>
