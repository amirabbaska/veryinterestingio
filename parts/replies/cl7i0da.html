<p>The main issue with using any of these devices is the fact they're foreign surfaces. Your blood coagulation mechanisms activate pretty readily in these situations resulting in strokes and MI, so they have to be put on strict anti-coag regimens which increases risk of bleeding. Also increased risk of infection is common in most of these procedures. </p>
<p>The other issue is just engineering. Human heart when it works last for the span of a human lifetime which is pretty amazing. These machines are expected to fail and if it happens unexpectedly, well that's not good. Plus they're large and for the most part not very mobile. </p>
<p><em>edit</em> there was a good point mentioned in a comment that was deleted. There is also a serious degradation in quality of life using these machines. They prevent you from doing things you enjoy as well as being inefficient and resulting in lack of energy. </p></div>		</li>
