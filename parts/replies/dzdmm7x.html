			<div class="markdown"><p>Another system that works out just fine is what comes out of <a href="https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/" target="_blank">Graphical Linear Algebra</a>. There, if you try to divide by zero, you end up with another object, which is labeled ∞. But then as it turns out there are two other “infinities” that show up if you play around with 0 and ∞, which show a bunch of curious rules. Among other things it turns out that 0*∞ ≠ ∞*0, which is kinda weird. Since that is true for all other numbers, you lose some important structure. There’s also no natural way to order these new numbers, so 1&lt;∞ isn’t true or false but just senseless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to know the details, I encourage you to read on the linked blog. The first few lessons are extremely accessible, then it gets a bit more complex as he goes on to prove all the claims he made actually hold, and then it gets more accessible again. The relevant lesson is <a href="https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/12/14/26-keep-calm-and-divide-by-zero/" target="_blank">26. Keep Calm and Divide by Zero</a>, to understand it you’ll definitely need to read the first bunch, maybe up to number 9, which are all pretty light and introduce the whole notation of GLA (after that the proofs start). You’ll need to figure out some other things from the later lessons, too, but it should be pretty intuitive then, just don’t let the fancy words scare you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe people sometimes confuse infinity with a number so in their heads 0*∞ is just a normal operation that should equal 0. However, it's a set of numbers and lends itself to some interesting set theory. I remember having an argument with someone who didn't believe me not all infinities are equal. It's possible to have one infinity be larger than another in the sense that there is no mapping between the two.</p></div>		</li>

<p>well, in one branch of mathematics. Not in Graphical Linear Algebra. There it is actually a label for the relation x~y ­⇔ x=0 (compare <code>0</code>, which is the label for the relation x~y ⇔ y=0 or <code>3</code>, which labels x~y ⇔ x=3y)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this a reference to a commutative issue, or is 0*∞ ≠ 0*∞ for &quot;various infinities&quot;. I'm thinking convergent vs divergent series, and whether dividing divergent series A by a &quot;less divergent&quot; series B would sometimes yield an answer and other times would still be divergent; its evidence that not all divergences are equal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in the context I was talking about, series and limits are basically irrelevant. Graphical Linear Algebra builds up from a bunch of (rather curious) axioms and just sees what happens. And what happens is that, very clearly, 0 and ∞ don’t commute under multiplication. Note that in this system, “0” and “∞” are merely labels for two certain objects (i.e. not abstract limits or anything like that, but concrete elements), and that they are not commutative is <em>very</em> obvious in this system. </p>
<p>So basically, while an important observation, the two concepts don’t have much to do with each other except similar labels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a structure called a wheel that I <em>very</em> briefly studied, which also defines 0/0 (but then you lose even more of the rules you're used to):
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_theory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_theory</a></p>
<p>I remember talking about the wheel of fractions in particular, where things like this happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 * 1/0 = 0/0, so you can't always say 0x = 0 or x/x = 1</li>
<li>1/0 - 1/0 = 0/0, so you can't always say x - x = 0</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, to parse the above, you need to treat <code>0/0</code> as a single symbol that is distinct in meaning from <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. With that in mind:</p>
<p><code>1/0</code> is just another number that, as in the parent comment, connects the negative and positive numbers “at the top” as if the number line was a number circle with the zero “at the bottom”. Now, in everyday math, if you multiply any number by 0, you should get 0. That’s a law (an axiom) that we impose on numbers¹, but you’ll get inconsistent results if you allow <code>0 * 1/0 = 0</code>, instead it must yield the new element <code>0/0</code>. But now we’ve lost an important bit of structure (namely the expectation that 0*x = 0).</p>
<hr />
<p>¹ specifically it is an axiom of <em>Fields</em>, which are basically collections of numbers where arithmetic does exactly what you’d expect it to. No division by 0 allowed in fields, however. <em>Wheels</em>, described above, are basically an extension of <em>Fields</em> that allow for division by 0 but lose some other structure to compensate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's consider the wheel of fractions of integers. Every element x of this wheel is a couple of two integers, x = (x1, x2). Basically x is a fraction, its numerator is x1, its denominator is x2, and you'd want to write it as x = x1/x2, but let's not do that for now. </p>
<p>Integers are fractions with 1 as their denominator, so instead of writing the integer 2 as (2, 1), we'll just write 2. Just like we usually do with fractions.</p>
<p>Take two elements x = (x1, x2) and y = (y1, y2) from this wheel. You can perform 3 operations on them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>addition</strong>: x + y = (x1, x2) + (y1, y2) = (x1·y2 + x2·y1, x2·y2), which is the usual way you'd add two fractions</li>
<li><strong>multiplication</strong>: x·y = (x1, x2)·(y1, y2) = (x1·y1, x2·y2), which is the usual way to multiply two fractions.</li>
<li>&quot;<strong>division</strong>&quot;: /x = /(x1, x2) = (x2, x1), basically the operation &quot;/&quot; reverses numerator and denominator as you'd expect</li>
</ul>
<p>This division allows you to write en element from the wheel as a fraction: for example, take the element (1, 2). You want to write it 1/2.</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 = 1·(/2) = (1, 1) · /(2, 1) = (1, 1)·(1, 2) = (1, 2) per the multiplication rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, writing 1/2 or (1, 2) is the same thing.</p>
<p>Now just apply the addition rule to 1/0 and -1/0. You get:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/0 - 1/0 = (1, 0) + (-1, 0) = (1·0 + 0·(-1), 0·0) = (0, 0) = 0/0</li>
</ul>
<p>And apply the multiplication rule to 0 and 1/0:</p>
<ul>
<li>0·1/0 = (0, 1)·(1, 0) = (0·1, 1·0) = (0, 0) = 0/0</li>
</ul>
<p>Now apply these rules to fractions that don't have 0 as their denominator, and you'll get the expected results.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tell me if I've been clear enough, but that's how operations work on the wheel of fractions :)</p>
<p>You'll get much more details, with much more complicated words, on how to build a wheel of fractions from a commutative ring in this paper: <a href="https://www2.math.su.se/reports/2001/11/2001-11.pdf" target="_blank">https://www2.math.su.se/reports/2001/11/2001-11.pdf</a></p></div>		</li>
