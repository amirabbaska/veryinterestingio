			<div class="markdown"><p>The recent Pleistocene glacial cycle is better described as an overall 100,000 year cycle in which the Earth transitions from stadial (glacial advance) to interstadial (glacial retreat, especially in the northern hemisphere) over a period of about 10,000 years and then remains in the interglacial period for a time before slowly beginning to sink back into the next stadial glaciation over a period of 30 to 50 thousand years. The stadial period continues for something like 30 thousand years with variations in intensity that include a maximum glaciation shortly before quickly rising back out to the next interstadial. So the pattern is rapid warming and gradual cooling on a 100,000 year cycle. Based purely on Milankovich orbital cycles, we would have expected approximately the same pattern to repeat again, meaning that glaciation would not really return for about another 50,000 years.</p>
<p>Of course you're right that anthropogenic CO2 emissions may change that expectation, but I'd hesitate to call our influence &quot;unnatural&quot; and the rest &quot;natural&quot; since biotic feedbacks have always been a part of the Earth's climate system. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be trying to do anything about it, but &quot;natural vs. unnatural&quot; is a bad framing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do I understand correctly: 1. Stadial (30K) 2. Transition (10K) 3. Interstadial (30-50K) 4. Repeat?  We're still missing 10-30K somewhere for a 100K cycle. Also, where are we currently in this cycle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The numbers are pretty rough, so it's hard to make them add up and still describe every glacial cycle we have a record of.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iceandclimate.nbi.ku.dk/images/images_research_sep_09/EPICA_without_current.PNG" target="_blank">Here's a figure</a> that shows three different proxies for temperature (delta-D in the middle is the most direct EDIT: and I should add that that line is shaded with red and blue to indicate glacial and interglacial periods) over the last 800 kya. You can see how the &quot;100,000 year cycle&quot; is hardly a perfect thing.</p>
<p>There's probably two reasons for how variable the cycle is. First, there's several Milankovich cycles, each with a different period, so their harmonic combination doesn't really create a single regular cycle. At least not on this time scale. Second, there's also plenty of internal regulation of the Earth's climate that's independent of the Milankovich cycles. In fact, this 100,000 year cycle doesn't even extend much further back than what's shown in this figure. Earlier in the Pleistocene, the cycle seems to have been 40,000 years, which would still indicate control by Milankovich cycles, but with different internal feedbacks.</p>
<p>In any case, as far as we understand, minus the effects of anthropogenic warming, we would right now be somewhere in the first half of an interstadial.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We have evidence that the 1700s were quite a bit colder than the current day. Perhaps greenhouse gasses are masking the ice age we should he headed towards in the next 1k years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the 1700s to now is way too short of a scale to notice natural long term climate change on. Ice age's are in the range of 10,000 years plus. So often people talk about how the increase in temperate over the last  100 years isn't unusual and in absolute temperature it isn't but what is unusual is the time-scale. If it takes about 100,000 years to come out a of an ice age, say 8 degree increase. Now if you realise the temperature has increased 2 degrees in 100 years people get scared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly, cold and warm periods are most likely caused by eccentricities in earths orbit around the sun which we can't influence at all. Once the ice age really ends, it will be much hotter than it should be. </p>
<p>Another way to view this: If you put on a heater during winter, you haven't ended winter, and if your heater is still on when summer eventually comes, it's going to be much hotter than normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the orbital phenomena you're describing (Milankovich cycles) have existed for as long as there's been life on Earth, but they have not always been associated with glacial cycles like those seen during the Pleistocene. There is apparently a feedback in the Earth's climate system that caused Milankovich cycles to begin initiating glacial cycles sometime about 2.5mya when they didn't during the Paleogene and earlier Neogene.</p>
<p>Two possible explanations are commonly suggested for this change in how the Milankovich cycles influence glaciation. First, changes in the global circulation of energy through the ocean and atmosphere, especially caused by the opening of the southern ocean and the closing the Panama Isthmus, exaggerates the effects of Milankovich driven changes to seasonal solar radiation reception. Second, a long-term trend of decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentration beginning in the Eocene may enable Milankovich cycles to begin driving glaciation when greenhouse gas concentrations get below a certain level, particularly in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>These two explanations interact with reach other (global energy balance is probably involved in the decreasing CO2 concentration and atmospheric CO2 concentration itself is part of what regulates the Earth energy flow) just as they both interact with Milankovich cycles, so the whole thing is complex and not well understood. If the atmospheric CO2 part of the equation is a significant part of it, though, then it's totally reasonable to expect that anthropogenic CO2 emissions will &quot;artificially&quot; end the period of glacial cycles. The Milankovich variations may simply not have the effects at the Earth surface that they've had for the last 3 million years if atmospheric CO2 increases beyond a certain level.</p>
<p>It also definitely doesn't make much sense to talk about the era of Pleistocene glacial cycles &quot;really ending&quot; in some way separate from what's currently happening with anthropogenic CO2 emissions in a way that will exacerabte overall temperature. Changes to the continental configuration could be responsible for such an ending, but not for many many millions of years. The other potential cause would be an internally driven feedback that causes an increase in atmospheric CO2, which is exactly what we're seeing, so in that picture anthropogenic CO2 increase essentially <strong>is</strong> the &quot;natural&quot; end to Pleistocene glaciation cycles. Assuming they really are at an end, that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Not a great analogy though because while winter is defined by the time of year, ice ages are defined by the long-term temperature, so you can in fact end or prevent ice-ages by modifying temperature. Also, when you dramatically change the global temperatures you'll cause long-term weather patterns to shift that have—for the purposes of human lifetimes—permanent effects.</p></div>		</li>
