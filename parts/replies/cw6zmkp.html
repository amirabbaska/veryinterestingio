			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, maybe you can answer a question I've wanted to ask for a few days now!</p>
<p>I was working a weird schedule.  2nd and 3rd shift mostly.  I worked a lot of nights.  I recently landed a job working 8-5 Mon-Fri and I'm finding that I wake up around 2AM no matter how tired I am.  My new job is somewhat physically demanding, so I am pretty beat by the time I go to bed around 10.  </p>
<p>No matter though, I wake up around 2-3AM.  I am able to go back to sleep but it is frustrating not sleeping through the night.</p>
<p>Could this tie into that &quot;sleep clock&quot; you mentioned?  I assume I'll adjust to my new schedule fairly quickly but it is weird waking up after 3-5 hours when I'm extremely sleepy as I bed down.</p>
<p>I do sleep in pitch blackness and there is no sound (aside from the damn ringing in my ears, which is kinda calming actually) so I dunno.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You probably want to do this on the weekend so you don't mess yourself up too much for the new job. Stay up THE ENTIRE NIGHT Friday night, then go to sleep at 10pm or whatever on Saturday night. I bet you won't wake up at 2am... go to sleep at 10pm again on Sunday night, and you should be good to go.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I agree, I learned this as a teenager and it works at treat. </p>
<p>Doing it this way, You can go to bed earlier on the second night and wake up at your 'normal time' feeling great plus it only takes the one night to 'reset' yourself</p></div>		</li>

<p>it could be one of two things:  either your body clock is still set to your old schedule or you're having sleeping issues (i.e. something is waking you up, like you stop breathing).  </p>
<p>The way to figure out is, is the waking becoming progressively later?  So the first night it was at 2am, then 2:10am, then 2:30am etc.  Or did you wake up after a few hours sleep before also, but before you were able to fall back asleep quickly?  </p>
<p>What you need to look for is that progressively later arousal (if this is happening, then that's good news. It means your clock is slowly shifting over to your new schedule. But it will take days before it will fully adjust.  If not, do you snore? If you snore, it may be that the new schedule is making you more awake of your arousal (because you could be waking up due to breathing issues).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to know this. I'm one of those people who sleeps like a rock and often does things (like turning alarms off) while still unconscious. This has led to trouble in my professional life, as you can imagine. I figured one of the problems I was having was waking up abruptly in the middle of deep sleep. </p>
<p>I started using Sleep Cycle about a week and a half ago. You give it a 30 minute wake-up window and it plays a delightful tune at ever increasing volume when your sleep is at it's lightest. I always appreciated those mornings where I'd wake up and be ready to go, but they were few and far between. Now it's every morning! (So long as I get at least 7 hours.) </p></div>		</li>

<p>Too many times have there been things that I sincerely, fully, totally regret having slept through. -.-</p>
<p>Sleep Cycle only works if your phone stays on the bed, though :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor, but yes. They are based on the same sleep cycle he is talking about. The secret is how does your phone know when you're sleeping and when you're awake? Well, the app uses the accelerometer and gyroscope built into your phone to measure your movement in bed. Humans go through multiple sleep cycles within a 7 hour night, somewhat predictably. The app measures when you move slightly in your sleep so it can decide what part of the cycle you are currently in. If you wake during the middle of a REM cycle, you will feel sleepy. So, the app used your body movement to make sure you wake up during an appropriate part of the cycle. This changes slightly every night, so most apps have a 30 minute window that they try to wake you up in. </p>
<p>The apps I've used for iPhone are extremely accurate, I've found. I logged my bathroom breaks and such, and it always knew when I was waking up or moving around. It only works for single bed users though. Couples mess up the measurements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those worried about sleep partners, pets or spitting while you sleep, I found my FitBit to be very accurate. I tap on it to indicate I'm going to bed and it starts recording my movement, then I tap on it when I wake up. Since it reads your movement always, you can use the mobile app to input your sleep time of you forget to tap the wristband. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been using the &quot;Sleep Cycle&quot; app on and off for a couple weeks now. It's actually been working pretty great, I would highly suggest getting it.</p>
<p>You set your alarm for a certain time you'd like to be waking up for. The app then monitors your deep sleep and light sleep cycles throughout the night. It determines this based on the amount of movement your body is making while you sleep. Once it's getting close to that morning hour you're trying to be up for, you're likely to come to some sort of half-consciousness for a moment to readjust your position or roll over. But before you're able to fall back into a deep sleep, the app has recognized your body movement, a subtle and relaxing alarm is triggered, and you find yourself well awake and more easily able to get out of bed.</p>
<p>So rather than a typical alarm going off at a very specific time and potentially pulling you out of a deep and comfortable sleep, it has now been introduced to you at a convenient moment of consciousness.</p>
<p>Anyone who finds their self having trouble getting up in the morning, I'd highly suggest getting this app. It also keeps records of your sleep cycles each night, and develops flowcharts to monitor your sleep quality and time in bed. Eventually, it will greatly improve your ability to maintain a solid sleep schedule.</p></div>		</li>
