			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's not the wood melting per se. When trees are alive, their roots draw water from the ground. However, they are also sucking up minerals and metal oxides from the ground, namely silica, sodium, and others. These oxides comprise some of the main ingredients in glass/glaze, and they stay in the wood after we chop the tree down. When we burn the wood, the carbon burns off, leaving wood ash, which is all the stuff that doesn't burn, i.e. the aforementioned metal oxides. At high enough temperatures (cone 10-12 or so/approximately 2300 degrees F) those metal oxides melt. During this stage of firing, the atmosphere inside the kiln is very volatile, and the melted wood ash is drawn around and through the kiln, and ultimately settles onto the pots, sometimes quite thickly. You'll see when you fire that the placement of the pots will determine how much ash they get. Wood kilns are a great way to learn about the technical aspects of firing, and it's super cool to be able to participate in a kind of firing that people have been doing for thousands of years. I hope your firing goes well!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your professors are conflating &quot;wood&quot; and &quot;wood ash.&quot; The wood ash is composed of the ~1% of the mass of the wood that does not burn. This portion of the wood is composed of inorganic compounds such as calcium carbonate, phosphates, and metals.</p>

<p>Wood itself is primarily composed of complex organic polymers such as lignin and cellulose and likely does not have a phase transition you could convincingly label as &quot;melting.&quot; Polymers and complex systems in general have phase transitions that don't map perfectly onto the classical &quot;melting/freezing, &quot;boiling/condensing,&quot; &quot;sublimation/deposition&quot; scheme. Those terms mostly only have relevance to simple monomers (molecules that aren't linked together into polymer chains).</p></div>		</li>
