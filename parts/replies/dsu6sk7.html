			<div class="markdown"><p>That's getting past what I remember but it's a quantum thing, probably some conservation of momentum or energy or something in there too. </p>
<p>Basically, that's just how it works. Things that aren't shiny reflective like mirrors scatter light because their surfaces aren't smooth but each photon is still reflected at the same angle from each part it hits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAPhysicist so I can't really argue with this, but it doesn't seem right to me.  Are you suggesting that a photon is absorbed by a material - presumably putting an electron at a higher energy level - then re-emitted at the exact correct angle, and that's how reflection works?</p>
<p>Again, not saying that's wrong, it just seems a bit wonky to me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, thatâ€™s actually a good description of it. Some materials emit a photon at the reflected angle at the same wavelength. Other materials re-emit photons at specific wavelengths which is what gives the material colour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes it reflect the photon at the reflected angle? I mean, how does it &quot;know&quot; which direction to emit the photon in relative to the direction in which the other one came in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer, how can we really know if it's the same photon or just another with the same properties? (except reversed orthogonal direction) AFAIK we have never managed to tag a photon with a label :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were describing reflection and refraction also.  Fluorescence is also similar.  Simply, though, light isn't like a ball that bounces off things.  For a photon to exist, an electron was excited to a higher energy and then fell to a lower state giving off an electromagnetic wave.  Reflection, refraction and fluorescence are all different principles on how light can hit an object like a wall, or a mirror, how that light hits electrons in the atoms on that surface and how those electrons then emit a new photon at a specific angle and energy (or wavelength).</p></div>		</li>
