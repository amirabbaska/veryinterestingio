			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point. Every time lab grown meat comes up everyone repeatedly brings up steak, but we eat <em>way</em> more burgers, tacos, meat-sauced-pastas, and other things with ground beef than we do steaks. They're the holy grail of beef I guess, so I understand why people are worried about their flavor and such, but we should probably be more worried about the types of food we eat way more often instead.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>well, all that ground beef subsidizes steaks... hence if/when lab grown beef is viable, it'll cut into the profit of raising a cow, and something will have to give.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it not also worth noting that we often eat things like ground beef rather than steak because of the cost? I imagine we'd all generally eat steak a lot more if it were as cheap as ground beef.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With this being a cleaner meat I wonder how this will play a role in allergies. I read a study that stated our food is being over sanatized and is cleaner than the past. This prevents immunity being built up and we are less likely to be exposed to foreign substances. The study claimed this is why allergies are on the rise than they were in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it would have much effect on allergies. Most allergies are to proteins (or portions of proteins) and cultured meat would likely have just about identical proteins (excluding small and minor one involved in functions like blood delivery or being connective tissue).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Allergies don't work how you just described. You don't build up immunities to allergies. Actually, it's the exact opposite. The more you are exposed to an allergen the worse it is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>.... new studies are finding that giving say people with peanut allergies small doses of peanuts and increasing the dosage helps the body of someone with allergies to build up tolerance rather than completely avoiding the food. Allergies and people being born with allergies have been on the rise than recorded and some studies have reported our increase in sanitation in food and life could be a cause. I didn't imply that if you throw a person allergic to x substance into a bat of it they would become immunity but people being born would have a natural reaction to the substance than a violent one.</p></div>		</li>
