<p>I live in NJ, so let me talk to you about Super Storm &quot;fuck your infrastructure&quot; Sandy.</p>
<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtb-OK4bEs4" target="_blank">cool</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCSJdKe1LWM" target="_blank">videos</a>.</p>
<p>So the water breached the island of Manhattan and got into the tunnels. The system that made these pumps work were vastly unprotected. The salt water flooded the system, destroyed the pipes, the wires, circuitry etc.. that brought water out and brought power to some of the pumps broke. Because we kept power generators in areas where the water could get to them. This wasn't an issue specific to the subway system, some hospitals and buildings kept their generators underground and suffered prolonged power loss because of this decision.</p>
<p>But generally when it rains in NYC the water gets pumped out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now York's not alone in doing that - the exact same thing happened in Japan after the 2011 earthquake (or rather, the monster tsunami it spawned).</p>
<p>Unfortunately said generators were for coolant pumps, not drainage pumps.</p></div>		</li>
