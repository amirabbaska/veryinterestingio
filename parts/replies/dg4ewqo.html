<p>By the way, I noticed that members of some religions explicitly do <em>not</em> call their mythology a mythology. That may be because in many modern languages, the word ‘myth’ has developed a connotation of ‘untrue’ – and to a member of a religion, that religion's mythology becomes the truth. </p>
<p>Also, some major modern religions have codified their mythologies into canonical books (or definite collections thereof), effectively naming the mythology as a whole. So they will typically say ‘according to the bible’ rather than ‘according to Christian mythology’, simply because it's shorter. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I agree about 'myth' being used for stories that aren't true. That's a difference between technical use and normal use. So I usually wouldn't talk about 'Christian mythology' outside of some very specific contexts.</p>
<p>The collection case is a little more complicated. There's plenty of Christian mythology that isn't actually in the Bible. For example, the idea that people become angels when they die is pretty popular... and absolutely unbiblical. But, then, the Bible has its own place in Christian mythology. We have the stories that are <em>in</em> the Bible and the stories that are <em>about</em> the Bible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great addition to a great explanation - the connotation of &quot;myth&quot; is difficult for many Christians in America, given the increased pressure from highly-visible groups to demand Christians believe in literal/scientific interpretations.</p>
<p>As a more progressive (theologically) clergy member, I often try to remind people that our standards of what &quot;truth&quot; means have shifted over time. It's ok to say that the two (different) creation stories in Genesis are mythology, and that doesn't make them less true or important. But thanks to the concept that myth means &quot;made up fable that attempts to explain something via narrative as opposed to the scientific method,&quot; many more conservative Christians feel like they are negating their faith commitments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your post! Hey, I have a question: isn't it notably immodest or not humble to insist &quot;the stories we use as our foundation are factually true&quot;? I mean, I think if I were humble in my own confidence of my understanding of the world, I would probably say &quot;I think this is how things work, and I think such and such principles are good. Even if the stories turn out not to be strictly historically accurate or scientifically true, I think their point still stands, and the morals they teach are pretty good.&quot; I mean, I think the point made by the story, and what it makes you reflect on, is more important than the story, itself. I think we can admit to being​ wrong on facts (which I think is an incredibly respectable display of humility), and still have conviction in our values. No?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The cry for a distinction between myths and religious &quot;realities&quot; arises most deafeningly with monotheistic religions, which all purport to be the only valid story among a host of impostors. Other religions don't commonly treat belief as competition.</p>
<p>To some readers, mythology is more like a way of reading than a particular genre of book. Jung used a therapeutic technique that involved treating patients' own dreams as myth, revealing the architecture of their life's story, and his results were incredible. (And incredibly hard to replicate -- algorithmic thinking and one-size-fits-all doctoring couldn't really make use of his highly interpersonal style).</p>
<p>Right now I'm reading a book about the myths that served as blueprints for Shakespeare's plays, and it seems his skill with myth-making (or remaking) is what made him so culturally relevant. The author suggests that myths follow a natural internal logic, which Shakespeare studied and built upon, however intentionally or unintentionally, to unlock the hearts of his audience, or maybe his own.</p>
<p>It all seems to point back to this definition of myths as the dreams of a culture. I think they're more complex and ordered than that, but it's a good place to start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, can I ask you a question as a clergy person?</p>
<p>I grew up without being part of any religion. My dad is pretty atheist, and while my mom is Hindu, it is a deeply personal thing for her, not something she pushes onto others.</p>
<p>I'm almost thirty now. I'm quite spiritually satisfied on my own, with...I guess nihilism and the pursuit of science. But, I do admire all the good social and charitable work and volunteerism that many religious organizations do. I don't think I could ever sincerely accept the more mystical elements of religion, but I certainly would be keen to join a religion for the cool social club aspect of it. Do you think it would be a good idea for me?</p>
<p>It's interesting to hear you talk about the distinction between mythology​ and religion. I always thought that the point of the stories was to give value and context and examples on how and why someone should act responsibly, with kindness and fairness, and/or productively. If someone debates over &quot;god wants you to do this or god wants you to do that&quot;, then I feel like the debaters missed the point. But, if religion gets someone to wonder, &quot;what is my role in society and how do I affect it? What do I want out of my life? What do I value?&quot;, then I think the religion is doing a good job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so, a couple of things.</p>
<p>It's great to get into good social networks, charitable work, and volunteerism, and thank you for wanting to do that. But I'd be careful about treating a religious congregation, regardless of the religion, as 'just' a social club. And I'd be careful for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, it's disingenuous. When I go to events with people of other faiths - like to a Jewish seder or a Muslim prayer service - I do that as a Christian (and we all understand that). I have to find a way to navigate those religious practices as an outsider to that religion who is being supportive of people inside that religion. I think it would be insulting to my friends if I 'played at' being Jewish or Muslim (or, for that matter, atheist). I don't know that you would think of pretending to be religious in order to fit in with a group, but it's not a very nice thing to do.</p>
<p>Second, practices change who we are. Pascal once wrote that if someone wants to believe in Christianity but is having trouble doing so, they should go to mass, give to charity, pray, and so on. This is really the core of Pascal's wager, not that a person was making an intellectual bet, but that if someone <em>lived</em> as a Christian, the worst that would happen is that she would be honest, humble, grateful, a sincere friends, and so on. My point is just that joining a religious community, even if you don't intend on becoming religious, might affect you in a way you can't predict: you might come to <em>believe</em> these things. </p>
<p>So, if you can do it honestly (maybe you have some friends who are involved in religious communities) and are willing to take the risk, then by all means join up with a religious community. Depending on the community, you might be able to speak to a person there about what this might mean. If you're not as open to that, though, there are plenty of secular opportunities to form communities, give to charity, and volunteer. </p>
<p>Now, the other thing...</p>
<p>I think your view of religion gets close to how religion really works. I mean, I'm religious, I think that there is a God, and so on; I also believe that God wants us to live in a certain way and that the world is most amicable to that way of living. But I also think that it's difficult if not impossible to break that way of living into a list of rules. The big questions are, &quot;what is my role in society (or the whole cosmic order)?&quot; and &quot;What do I want out of life (or what does God call me to)?&quot; and so on. Part of what religion does, from the stories to the rituals to the songs to the holidays to, yes, the rules, is help us live our way into those questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply! Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I've been to a mass before, and I quite enjoyed it. I could tell, everyone was shifted to a very compassionate mindset, and it was pleasant shaking hands with those around me. But, I definitely didn't take communion, while most others did. I think I knew that that was the line where I would have crossed into 'playing at' being Christian. </p>
<p>I think you have a good point about navigating their practices as an outsider while being supportive. I guess my attitude is live and let live, and when in Rome, do as the Romans do. So, I'm happy to adapt if I think their morals are just (which I think is usually true between most people). But, I don't want to shove myself into something that's sacred, nor do I want to make a mockery of anyone.</p>
<p>Oh man, you're so right about Pascal's wager! I know what you're talking about, but I didn't even think of that. Now that you mention it, I think Pascal's wager is exactly what I feel nowadays, and what made me ask in the first place. I think living an honest and humble life, with sincere friends is a <em>deeply</em> respectable and admirable thing to do. I feel like it's an attitude that's often lost in modern society of consumerism and showoffing. It's that lifestyle that really attracts me. I was watching a <a href="https://youtu.be/byUNsTxUN64" target="_blank">video on Saint Anna of Kashin</a>, and it got me to tears. She was the community's (not even the Orthodox Church's, as they de-glorfied her once for a long while) way of glorifying and giving value to a quiet and peaceful married life. That's just so cool to me. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is actually an area of discussion among some historians and sociologists. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_religion" target="_blank">American Civil Religion</a> is actually a pretty interesting theory and kind helps contribute to the idea of &quot;American Exceptionalism&quot; that is pretty prevalent in our politics.</p></div>		</li>
