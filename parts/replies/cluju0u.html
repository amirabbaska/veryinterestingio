<p>There could be a affliction that makes people excessively happy without reason, but as you said, these people wouldn't seek help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Although I think there are a few cases where the happiness is not very much appreciated. There was an old guy who's wife was very unhappy when he came out of the operating room unable to stop laughing. He can't not see the funny side to anything. Those cases must be fairly rare though, I'd quite like to be constantly happy - would make a change from wanting to punch the people I work with all the time anyway. :)</p>
<p>EDIT: figured I'd post the link to the old guy as it's kind of amusing... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOCJT2T8Rr4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOCJT2T8Rr4</a> </p></div>		</li>

<p>You could honestly see they were both miserable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, yes. But that person still would not consult a doctor if they were satisfied with their place in the world. It's all a matter of perspective, and in that person's case, even if their perspective were wrong they would not view it as a personal detriment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eckhart Tolle reports something like this -
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tolle has said that he was depressed for much of his life until he underwent, at age 29, an &quot;inner transformation&quot;. He then spent several years wandering and unemployed &quot;in a state of deep bliss&quot; before becoming a spiritual teacher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't pathologize this, we call it spiritual enlightenment. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People with Down's syndrome do experience the full gambit of emotions, and a lot of time they can be uncontrolled. I will say that they do seem happy more often than you would expect though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Down Syndrome is a bit of an odd one as it tends to lend itself to other mental health difficulties appearing as described here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ndss.org/Resources/Health-Care/Associated-Conditions/Mental-Health-Issues--Down-Syndrome/" target="_blank">http://www.ndss.org/Resources/Health-Care/Associated-Conditions/Mental-Health-Issues--Down-Syndrome/</a></p>
<p>Sadly it tends to be that as sufferers age they can become prone to depression, social withdrawal &amp; eventually dementia which without proper care &amp; treatment can prove to be very difficult to deal with. Unfortunately those who suffer from DS tend not to want to go outside very often, which is why the general public tend to gain a biased view of DS sufferers unless they have personal experience with the disease. It's similar to other types of depression where we, the general public, only see sufferers out &amp; about on the upswing so we rarely experience the down swing in mood or see the effect it has on people.</p></div>		</li>
