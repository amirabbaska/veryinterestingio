I farm in southern Saskatchewan and while we don't grow corn we do grow gmo canola and tried gmo soybeans. Soybeans are just not the right crop but the canola works well. </p>
<p>Our variety in particular allows us to spray with a chemical that is different from round-up. </p>
<ul>
<li>This is good because it breaks up the tolerance weeds might develop.</li>
<li>Second advantage is that is makes it easy to clean our field in one pass, meaning we use less chemicals, less fuel, and we can time everything better. </li>
<li>Canola in particular is virtually impossible to keep clean without chemicals so organic Canola is as far as impossible to grow on a larger scale. </li>
</ul>
<p>While I am a conventual grower, I do not hate on the organic farmers. I just disagree but each to their own.
What you should not forget is that organic farming needs a lot more tillage which burns a lot of fuel.
There are a lot of chemicals that are allowed on an organic farm, but they are less precise than the engineered chemicals.
The yield is lower, meaning you need to work more land to feed the same amount of people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a botany/agronomy student right now and I'm curious if you have looked into the use of companion crops to lower your pesticide/herbicide use. Recently we have been focusing on creating a better integrated pest control system that uses GMO crops as well as other methods such as companion crops. I'm also curious what sort of crop rotations/soil care you follow on your farm?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to bring that up, but felt I was already being long winded, that's why I am more for permaculture than simply switching to organics</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a heads up, things like BT corn which is a corn hybrid requires less pesticides due to its innate ability to kill off pests.</p>
<p>Organic corn avoids this yield loss by using sprayed on pesticides. By innately reducing the need for applied chemicals your already reducing the carbon footprint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked into the Buycott app and it's anti-GMO when GMO's have shown to have less of a carbon footprint than &quot;organic&quot; farming. GMO plants are designed to use less water and yield more crop = take up less space. I do like the Palm Oil app though so I can try and make sure the products I use either don't contain PO or if it does it comes from a sustainable source (though regulation on sustainable palm oil isn't as strict as it should be.)</p></div>		</li>
