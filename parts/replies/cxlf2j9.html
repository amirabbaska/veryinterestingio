			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes, the <em>Sturgis.</em> The army was trying all sorts of interesting uses of nuclear back then. I had hoped to visit it in Virginia before it's totally dismantled. </p>
<p>There was also the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS_Savannah" target="_blank">NS Savannah</a>,</em> which was a nuclear-powered merchant ship. With the incredible amount of heavy fuel oil and carbon emissions related to ocean shipping, I think commercial nuclear-<em>propelled</em> applications are just as interesting as floating nuclear generating plants. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really, in your opinion, just public opinion holding all these amazing applications of nuclear technology back?  I'm a huge proponent of nuclear technology, it's by far one of the most misunderstood and therefore feared technologies; <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/" target="_blank">if you look at deaths per trillion KWh it's the safest means of energy production, even beating out solar and wind.</a>  I see policy makers and career politicians scrambling for a way to reduce CO2 emissions all the while completely overlooking or, worse, condemning nuclear power as radically unsafe and risky.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you think piracy would be a problem with these ships?
If one is captured, the radioactive material could be a valuable item on the black market?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Underwater cables. They could be regular old HVAC underwater transmission lines not unlike what powers offshore facilities, only bigger. This technology exists. The on-shore power grid would have to be able to handle the plant, of course. The floaters are generally expected to stay put for pretty long periods of time, though there could also be smaller emergency relief ones that provide electricity, fresh water, heat, and cooling in one nice carbon-free package. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Underground/water HVAC cables have a large capacitance associated with them.  This makes it extremely difficult to transmit AC power over large distances under water.  You would need an HVDC line.  That's really expensive.  Converter stations for HVDC are in the $100,000,000 price range.  Major DC transmission line projects are a large investment for utilities from a capital and OM perspective.  Unless the power plant is within 3-5 miles off shore transmitting the power they produce is not cheap.  </p>
<p>All offshore generation in Europe is connected to their grid via HVDC lines.  As an engineer I would love to see this type of technology embraced in the US.  The price is really the killer on it.  </p>
<p>There is currently a project to connect Lake Erie to Canada.  Refer to PJM GIP Y3-092.  <a href="http://www.lakeeriepower.com/" target="_blank">http://www.lakeeriepower.com/</a></p>
<p>The developer cost to just connect to the 345 kV power grid is ~$5,000,000.  That does not include converter stations, the underwater line itself or the cost to connect to the Canadian grid.</p>
<p>To my point.  Yes the technology does exist.  However its not cheap or economical at this point in time.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the difficulty in providing maintenance services to an underwater facility? What about the corrosive properties of salt water? I don't think the biggest issue is PR, there are numerous practical issues also.</p>
<p>In regards to earthquakes and tsunamis, it is not particularly difficult to build an earthquake-proof or tsunami-proof building, just expensive. The Fukushima plant would have survived if higher and stronger tsunami barriers were built. It's purely a question of economics, and I feel that building an underwater facility would be an order of magnitude more expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Underwater would definitely be expensive. I think the plant-on-a-ship configuration is much more likely and practical. There are many major facilities at sea (mostly in the oil and gas industry) and floating nukes could use similar materials and maintenance activities. </p>
<p>As for earthquake-proofing, you're right that it's all about cost. It is  actually nearly impossible to build anything totally earthquake proof. The problem is that very large earthquakes (way out on the tail) fail the soil, causing it to liquefy. Maybe you could build it like a missile silo but yeah, it'd be way beyond a reasonable price. </p>
<p>For Fukushima though you're absolutely right. They could have built their systems to handle that size of a wave. And they should have, given the expected wave probabilities that they knew about. That was a real shame. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh so you're talking about something like an offshore oil platform? I would think if they're rigidly connected to the sea floor, they are still subjected to seismic forces.</p>
<p>If it's on a floating ship and moving up and down with the ocean, is that practical for a nuclear power plant? I can't say.</p></div>		</li>
