			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to what you said, this is also why they don't use pure water in IVs but rather a saline solution (water and salt mostly). Because pure water would dilute your bodies salt levels and ultimately cause you problems if not countered with something else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Umm... no.</p>
<p>This isn't true.</p>
<p>Water moves towards salt.   Salt in a sports drink will do nothing but inhibit the flow of water from the stomach to the blood... assuming osmosis only.</p>
<p>You burn energy to add salt to your blood because your blood is salty even when you are low on salt...</p>
<p>So, no.  Salt in water doesn't make you absorb it faster.</p>
<p>... unless it does via a different mechanism I am unaware of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cell walls don't work exactly like a purely osmotic membrane, so the cells work differently. It's still called osmosis, but it isn't a pure system. Which is another reason physics and biology are different fields. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cells with low salt concentration won't draw in enough water. Electrolytes are very important for rehydration, especially in cases of severe dehydration (see oral rehydration therapy). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salts and sugar. As you sweat you tend to burn both. So if you're working hard and only drinking water it will no longer be as effective after period of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sugar is irrelevant. You need insulin to allow it to be used. Sugar content does not help with hydration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much what /u/traggedjc said. I was just trying to keep it simple. Notice how I didn't say the sugar alone will hydrate you? (Give you a hint it has to do with your small intestine). As a side note, if you're working out hard enough to warrant Gatorade the calories/sugars in the drink will be very beneficial.  </p></div>		</li>
