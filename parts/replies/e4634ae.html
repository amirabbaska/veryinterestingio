			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the CVV is not strictly required to process a credit card transaction. It's an added security that most retailers opt to use. Amazon uses their own method of payment processing and doesn't require it (Although I believe they at least ask for it when you use a card/save it for the first time. It's been a long time since I've had to update my payment info on Amazon)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CVV is needed on the first transaction.  Once the retailer has validated the card number and CVV with Visa or Mastercard they can continue billing to the same card.  After a period of time the validation will expire and the CVV is required again.  A change in customer details (eg shipping to a different address) may also trigger a validation request.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using the CV2 is (often) an optional choice by the retailer.</p>
<p>If the retailer opts to not ask for it every time then they run the risk of being liable for any chargebacks, as it was their decision to use weaker security so it's their fault.</p>
<p>Amazon have likely made the decision that the improved checkout speed/experience is worth more to them than the repeated CV2 request. Plus they do ask for it the first time you use the card. And they force a complete card reentry any time you try to deliver to a new address.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Also the code is on the back. If someone sees or takes a picture of your card, they only have the info on the front. Not a foolproof system, but it helps.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>CVV Protects You against Fraud</p>
<p>Debit and credit cards are mainly used for online transactions or for other virtual payment gateways. These portals are not allowed to save any information about the CVV number of the cardholder since it is against the Per Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. Hence, even if the vendor has all the other details of your card, they cannot access the CVV. This makes it impossible for anyone to misuse your card information. So if there is a breach in the data security of the credit card issuing company, the CVV is not stored in the databases. This makes it impossible to use your credit card for transactions without the CVV.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a constraint  related to card payment processing (pci dss).</p>
<p>Problem is that some vendors (usually big ones) have so much influence that they can say 'f*ck your constraints, it's more practical to save that for our business'</p></div>		</li>
