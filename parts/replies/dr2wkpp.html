			<div class="markdown"><p>Say you are in a ship, 1800s. A cannon shot rips through the hull and you end up with a broken arm full of splinters. The surgeon comes over, gives you a swig of wiskey and cuts the arm off. You might survive, even without antibiotics. If the wound can't be cleaned chopping off the arm results in higher survival rate.</p>
<p>Compared to a horse which is doomes after breaking a leg we have proved to be pretty resilient. It is all due to a mix of having a good immune system and relying more on skill than raw strength. A one-armed human can still hunt with a spear but an amputee bear would find it almost impossible. In more recent times the social structure of humans has led to quadraplegics to still being somewhat functional. Humans have some individual resilience but we are mostly invincible when we work in a group and can use our brains to invent things to enhance our innate capabiities.   </p>
<p>There is also a niche of the internet that looks at humans objectively and we end up being pretty scary to outsiders:

<p>Edit: I have changed the wording to reflect actual naval-amputation survival rate. Just in case someone is ever fighting the French at sea and needs to know what to do about a mangled arm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In which areas specifically? I alway thought we had similair healing capabilities as most other mammals (just increased survivability because we actually have additional healthcare on top of it) but it's not like i've done any serious comparison. What are the main differences between us and other animals in that regard? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mental resilience is a big factor. A lot of animals die very easily of shock, whereas humans seem to be able to hang on through even highly traumatic injuries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well most other mammals would die just from the stress of a broken limb/bone.(I have a video of a antilop getting it's hand bitten off and dying) Humans can overcome amputation without medical care.</p>
<p>We are pretty much trauma resistant compared to other animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to shock &quot;resilience&quot; as others have explained we also generally have the sense not to exacerbate our wounds because we understand them. We don't scratch itchy scabs or force walk on broken limbs which makes it easier and quicker to heal. Animals even injured &quot;need&quot; at least some function out of their wounds and so their bodies compensate for it and most of the time, poorly. Humans kick into full gear repair mode from the jump.</p></div>		</li>
