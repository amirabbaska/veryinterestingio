<p>Unless the DCT incorporates a sequential selector, which it doesn't have to, then they are not sequential. </p>
<p>Nothing about the physical design of dual clutch transmissions makes them sequential. Gears can be skipped on a DCT just like a regular transmission, just not with a seamless transfer of power (also, like a regular transmission). DCTs are &quot;basically&quot; two manual transmissions in one. </p>
<p>What makes a sequential gearbox is the selector (which forces sequential shifts) and typically as a necessity due to the way the gears are selectively coupled to the shafts (wide spaced dog teeth over conical synchros). Because a gearbox built this way will be damaged by skipping gears, they are given a sequential selector. </p>
<p>DCTs typically have none of this, and calling them &quot;basically this&quot; can't be further from the truth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Some DCTs, such as VW, even have a kickdown switch at the very bottom of the throttle which automatically puts it in the lowest gear possible.  Sure, the transmission is generally shifted in a sequential manner (due to paddle shifters or the +/- selector being the main ways to shift), but like you said, there is nothing physically stopping you from shifting into whatever gear you want</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m sorry by what I meant sequential. I was implying that by design it is meant to be shifted sequentially in order to minimise shift time, which is somewhat like a sequential as in how you are supposed to use it. Skipping gears are not optimal in both cases, although there is some clever engineering (eg VW) to minimize the impact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My Subaru's CVT has a &quot;manual&quot; mode and there are gear ratio selection paddles behind the steering wheel. There's no clutch pedal though.</p>
<p>In the normal automatic mode, when accelerating, this CVT adjusts the revs up and down to give the feel of changing gears. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I find that really annoying in traffic. Any way to turn the off?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That was the main reason why I didn't buy car with CVT. That was annoying and unnecessary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DCTs are only sequential because of their programming. Mechanically, you could go from 1st to 3rd, but the gear selection method (paddle or push/pull) only allows for sequential shifts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least with VW’s dual clutches, if you kind of spam an up or down shift it will skip the gear in-between but it will just be a lot slower since it has to change the gear instead of just using the one that was lined up on the other clutch.</p></div>		</li>
