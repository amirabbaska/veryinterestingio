			<div class="markdown"><p>Two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm not convinced that an index of refraction of 2 corresponds to 180ยบ refraction (or rather, refraction-reflection-refraction).  Do you have the derivation to back it up?  (<strong>Edit 2:</strong> I just spent 30 minutes graphing the angle as a function of refractive index and I'll be damned, an index of refraction of 2 <em>does</em> correspond to light bouncing back 180 degrees!  What an interesting result!)</li>
<li>Even if an index of refraction of 2 is needed, I found <a href="http://www.anton-paar.com/fileadmin/Themenseite/Expertise/OptoTec/dispersion_curve_of_water.jpg" target="_blank">this image</a> of the dispersion curve for water (dispersion in red, absorption in blue).  The dispersion relation follows an overall downward trend within the visible spectrum, with a conspicuous spike around orange or yellow.  It is never as large as 2.0, however, even outside the visible spectrum.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, this predicts the existence of additional &quot;invisible rainbows&quot; that double back over the same spot.  Draw a horizontal line through the red curve and any place it intersects is a wavelength that we expect to see at the same spot in the sky.  For example (if I'm reading this correctly), we would expect a rainbow in the infrared spectrum from about 1600 nm to 1800 nm in the exact same spot as the usual visible rainbow, but doubled back in the opposite direction.  Rainbows have violet (high frequency) on the inside and red (low frequency) on the outside, but this invisible rainbow would have its low frequency on the inside and its high frequency on the outside.</p>
<p>By the way, that graphic I found came from <a href="http://www.anton-paar.com/ca-en/products/group/refractometer/" target="_blank">this website</a>.  I think it may be mislabeled, since visible light is about 350 to 700 nanometers, not 3.5 to 7 micrometers.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The numbers in my second paragraph are wrong, thanks to the faulty graph.  The graph <em>was</em> mislabeled, as I thought.  I should have guessed it was, since we don't see a weird overlap between orange and yellow light in a rainbow.</p>
<p>You can find the correct dispersion relation for water <a href="http://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&amp;book=H2O&amp;page=Hale" target="_blank">here</a>.  You'll see that the refractive index of water is about 1.343 for deep violet light while it's about 1.33 for red light.  Based on that graph, it seems that <em>five</em> invisible rainbows overlap our visible one.  Also, you do attain an index of refraction of 2, but it's all the way out at 120 micrometers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, technically there are no colors out there anywhere. Colors aren't physical properties (wavelength/frequency are). Colors are perceptual, created by our brains based on the nerve signals produced by light-sensitive cells.</p>
