			<div class="markdown"><p>One HERV is responsible for producing the protein that locally inactivates the immune system in the vicinity of the uterus during pregnancy. Retroviruses could very well be responsible or have played a role in the creation of mammals. Another caveat is that we find sequences from non-retroviruses in animal genomes all the time, just not to the extent of the RVs.</p>
<p>Viruses have FAR more unique genes than all organisms on the planet combined. When one of the genes in a genome matches a highly conserved gene in a virus(quite a few databases for this) it can be inferred to have originated from an ancient infection. When that gene is in the same locus as other organisms of that species, we know it isn’t from an infection in that organism’s life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any trusty information on this that's easily accessed? There's just so much crazy in the world right now. I'm not doubting you - just all these things I find on Google.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation above regarding histone markers seems primarily focused on viral DNA that has been silenced and doesn't participate in human cellular metabolsims. What about viral DNA which has taken up function in the human metabolism (such as the example cited in this thread where the immune system is suppressed to prevent the pregnant woman's body from attacking the fetus? Can't we just identify viral dna the same way we identify other genes conserved across our evolutionary ancestors? Is viral DNA in a HERV somehow different from a conserved sequence? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes my explaination above is focused primarily on silenced viral DNA because the majority of that DNA is silenced. I’m not entirely certain how, but yes we can indentify viral DNA by comparing the human genome to evolutionary ancestors and by looking at databases of previously logged virus genomes, something I hinted at when I talked about the study ran on the minipigs. Viral DNA sequences are inherently different from typical human sequences from what I know, so that is another way of distinguishing between what has been inserted and what is original. </p>
<p>I hope this has answered your question! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you expand on that? Is there some sequence of base pairs that says &quot;I was originally part of a virus&quot;? If so, what are those sequences and what do they encode? Are they start and stop seqences for some transcription factor that is different from that normally used in mammalian cells? This is the essence of OP's question? What specifically makes viral dna sequences different from all the original mammalian or eukareote cell DNA that allows it be identified?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they just found out most everything is swapping out dna with other things.. the first mammal stole DNA from a virus to allow the baby to grow in the body and not get attacked by the mothers white blood cells</p></div>		</li>
