			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this is why I just sleep for 24 hours straight when I'm really ill. Then I get up, scarf some food, and usually go back to sleep and wake at a &quot;normal&quot; time. Total sleep can end up being 36 hours or more depending when I wake up the first time.</p>
<p>And I definitely get that sleep drunkenness. My husband sometimes tries to let me sleep in and then I don't get up til noon. I end up feeling worse than if he just woke me at the normal time. My body feels like gravity has doubled so it's hard to move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get it from naps too if they last right around 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Often if I wake up at that length it'll be in the middle of a dream and I wake up with a headache, always on the left side of my head, and definitely feel as though I'm drunk or at least similar enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I've slept for a long time usually after I've had no sleep the night before or I've just been plain lazy it literally feels like I'm dying when I wake up from a long sleep or nap, like I'm a zombie and all the energy has been sucked out of me.</p></div>		</li>
