<p>How does this fuel rating compare to American octane ratings, and are we Americans suffering the same negative effects as Australia?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not that guy, but US octane rating is different. The number is lower for the same quality. </p>
<p>EU = RON</p>
<p>US = Average of RON and MON </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI octane rating is not a quality rating. Higher octane doesn’t mean the fuel is better. It just means it’s harder to combust and can be used in higher compression engines. </p></div>		</li>

were a hot mess! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are. European and Japanese cars for US market often have different settings and sometimes lower compression ratio/boost in order to be able to run on fuel with lower octane index. It results in slightly lower powet output and higher fuel consumption, but allowes for a fuel itself to be cheaper. Although main reason fuel is significantly cheaper in US is not the regulation in question, but simply taxation. EU deliberatly keeps fuel quite expensive by imposing exise duty for policy reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true, but there are also other considerations.</p>
<p>For example, cold start performance is better with slightly higher octane rating and with less ethanol (for example, here in Sweden, we have different ethanol content in the summer and the winter). Cold starts aren't really a big issue in Australia...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Minus 10 C (14 F for our American friends) is about the coldest cold-start that you need to worry about for most of Australia. Some very isolated pockets up in the mountains might have to worry about -15 every now and again. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Australia was -23 C.</p>
<p>Sweden though I imagine needs to worry about -20s or lower on a regular basis, which is definitely a different ball game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>-20 C is common, -25 happens just about every winter, -30 happens every five winters or so. This is 3 hours northwest of Stockholm. If you go far north, you can lower those numbers but 10 degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is that the population in Australia is a fraction of Europe over a far bigger space, meaning that the negative impact of pollution is not really felt as strongly. Half the population of Australia lives in the Paris metro area. That means without regulations European cities would pretty much be worse than China. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see this argument a lot. Yes Australia is huge, however the population is heavily centralised in the cities. Both Sydney and Melbourne have nearly 5 million people living in them, each, making them bigger cities than just about every US and many EU cities. Density is lower though, as urban sprawl is a major issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, however Australia's population is largely concentrated in costal cities, which, due to their climate, rarely see as bad pollution as landlocked cities because pollutants are constantly being cycled out by air currents.  So for Europe, where most major cities (and certainly capitol cities) are landlocked, pollution is allowed to collect for longer periods of time, so regulation is more important (though who knows whether this actually has any effect on the actual laws)</p></div>		</li>
