			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; is not equivalent to any of the major interpretations; it's more like a <em>lack</em> of interpretation. It's just &quot;I don't care about the philosophy of it, I want to calculate a matrix element&quot;. It's agnostic to collapse, and many-worlds, and whatever else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interpretations of a theory are about what the numbers and math &quot;mean&quot; for our understanding of things, rather than just what the math predicts you will observe in practice. For the various interpretations of quantum mechanics, the math is all the same.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; is essentially the position that interpreting the theory isn't worth doing right now. Just do the math, get the right answers, and go home without worrying too much at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you &quot;shut up and calculate&quot;, and you get some result, and then for this to have any value you have to find some connection between the result and empirical reality. How do you interpret your result without using some interpretation of quantum theory?</p>
<p>The Copenhagen interpretation makes the numbers easy to interpret, so I can imagine people doing that. You get probability amplitudes out, you convert them to probabilities, and then you regard these as probabilities of the system collapsing into different possible eigenstates. So I suppose I disagree with what I said earlier. Now I think &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; probably does imply believing that things collapse.</p>
<p>Am I wrong here? If so, how is it possible to do the math and make use of the results without having an interpretation of quantum mechanics at the time you use the results?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No it is not. &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; avoids all the questions the interpretations try to answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If all interpretations would have started at the same time, and with today's knowledge about decoherence, I would expect Many-Worlds to be much more popular.</p>

<p>Is the Many-Worlds interpretation even closer to &quot;shut-up and calculate&quot; than Copenhagen? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how meaningful such a comparison is. Copenhagen can be described as &quot;let's take many worlds and then add an ill-defined, non-local, non-unitary, and generally weird and arbitrary collapse process to kill all worlds but one&quot;. Many worlds is closer to the calculations: the many worlds are a direct result of the equations of quantum mechanics. But does it make that closer to &quot;shut up and calculate&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conversely,  MWI can be described as let's take the nice, unitary part of QM and pretend nothing weird happens upon measurement. But when it comes to making experiments you quickly pull Born's rule out of your ass to calculate the probabilities, and afterwards still act like the world is deterministic.</p></div>		</li>
