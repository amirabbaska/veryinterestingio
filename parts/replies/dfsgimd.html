			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct but not quite encompassing the whole idea. Much like your other senses, taste doesn't just sense taste, it senses changes in taste. So if your saliva always tastes the same you wont really notice it or &quot;taste&quot; it. This is why if your gums are bleeding you can taste it quickly even if it is minimal blood loss. If you ever kiss your SO youll notice that they may taste like food that they ate (gross to think about I know) but to them they might not taste it anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, it's an evolutionary trait that we become desensitised to these things and stop smelling, tasting (and hearing!) things because these things that we can taste, smell and hear are not harmful to us. This means that if our environment does change then we will notice that change better than if we could still sense everything. </p>
<p>For example, say there was a small fire in the kitchen and you were upstairs in your bedroom,  if you could still smell your dog, your dirty clothes, your clean wardrobe, trainers, deodorant and air freshener, you wouldn't smell that fire for a very long time.</p></div>		</li>

Pretty sure that's not a real word, but I like it, so I'm keeping it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha only because of the kissing part. Everything else is very sensible for a 5 year old. I am assuming you know things about other senses but I also explain that. If you'd like to tell me why you think that I would be happy to edit to accommodate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it fascinating when I cook something in my crockpot and walk in the door at the end of the day how noticeable the smell is. It hits me as I walk in the door and overwhelms my nose with delicious goodness. 15 minutes later as I'm stirring the food I barely notice the smell at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL dental hygiene isn't that big of a priority for more people than I thought.
If most of the time you lick your arm and it smells then you need to take better care of your mouth.
FLOSS EVERY DAY
Brush ALL of your teeth and gently get your tongue and gums too.
Use mouthwash.
See your dentist regularly to get all that nasty plaque and tartar that's hard to remove even with floss. </p>
<p>Oh, and keep your mouth hydrated. Drink lots of water. Dry mouth leads to bad breath pretty quickly. </p></div>		</li>
