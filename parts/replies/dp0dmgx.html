			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me wonder...  could there be entire planets made of substances like steel or water or whatever? We know of rocky and gaseous planets but what if a very sophisticated civilization could create an Earth-sized planet made of steel? Could it exist or would it immediately collapse and melt? Similarly: what if a giant Earth-sized droplet of water were put into space? Could there ever be a planet of water or would it immediately freeze/boil? </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It'd essentially be a giant comet like Hale-Bopp or Haley...</p>
<p>If in the shadow of another body, it would get cold enough to freeze.  From there it would slowly sublimate to nothing.  If in the light of our sun, it would boil on the sun facing side. (Maybe freeze on shadow side)</p>
<p>The interior would probably stay at a fairly constant temperature for a good bit of time, maybe long enough for a random nuclear submarine to run out of food before it boiled/froze in place.  Not that it would matter, the lack of an earth gravity would really mess with a lot of the mechanical systems and they'd all be dead within a few chaotic sleepless shifts.</p>
<p>If it had a planetary orbit like ours, it would eventually boil to nothing.  If it had an orbit like a comet, it would probably be a fairly stable comet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're very much underestimating the masses involved and forgetting about the phase diagram for ice and the really weird stuff that water and the forms it takes on at high temperatures and pressures.  It wouldn't be at all like a comet other than that both have water ice.  The mass involved would mean that it would be more like a planet than like a loosely held together comet.</p>
<p>In the core there might be enough pressure to lead to things like metallic ice, and there would definitely be enough pressure for all sorts of other strange phases of ice.</p>
<p>It would greatly on how far from the sun the water planet was located.  Inside the orbit of the asteroid belt the surface would probably stay liquid, but it would have a solid core of some phase of ice that's both solid and hot.  You'd have an atmosphere and that might protect it a bit from solar radiation and even generate an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus#Induced_magnetosphere" target="_blank">induced magnetic field the same way that the atmosphere of Venus does</a>, but it likely experience a have a runaway greenhouse effect that would eventually boil the entire planet into space.  This would take a long time, although that would vary depending on distance from the sun.  Likely the boiling off into space would be a result of the hydrogen/oxygen bonds being broken by solar radiation and the hydrogen escaping, but there are a variety of methods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape" target="_blank">atmospheric escape</a> and some of those other ones would probably come into play.</p>
<p>Further out in the solar system, where the gas giants are, is where water that's been pushed out of the inner solar system by the solar wind settles out, which is part of why we have the gas giants out there.  A that point a big ball of water would essentially be like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)" target="_blank">Europa</a>, but with weird phases of ice for the core instead of a rocky core.</p>
<p>If it was in its own orbit it would have a thick shell of normal ice, and an inner core of phased ice.  Between those two there would be a liquid layer that might be continuous or, more likely in immense liquid filled pockets inside the ice.  It would take a <em>very</em> long time to reach that state, probably millions or tens of millions of years if it was a planet sized body of water.  If it was orbiting a gas giant the structure would be similar, but more of it would be liquid due to tidal heating.</p>
<p>In a case like this there would be some material loss via sublimation, but it would likely survive for billions of years.</p>
<p>u/llIllIIlllIIlIIlllII, here is a longer answer you might want to take a look at.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The droplet is Earth-sized, so it would have almost the same gravity. The submarine would need to be really close to the edge to not exceed its crush depth, so it would experience an almost normal gravitational force.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most of the palnet Earth is iron, and largest part of it is in the metallic core. So Earth is far from being made of iron entirely, but a as much as 1/3 of it is!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iron planets aren't particularly special; iron being the 'end fusion product' of many stars, plenty of planets probably consist almost entirely of iron. Assuming the planet is spontaneously created by the arbitrarily advanced civilization, it would shrink slightly under its own mass, which heats up the core immensely, melting it, but besides that nothing of particular interest would happen with an Earth-mass ball of iron. If it was left alone, it would cool down eventually and be just that: an giant, inert ball of iron. Not the most interesting place to visit I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to point out that it's highly unlikely that a planet of iron is created anywhere in the universe - fusion stops long before the concentration of iron is that significant. You'll still have a star made mostly of hydrogen</p></div>		</li>

<p>You would be slightly heavier on the outer edge of the donut, slightly lighter on the inside</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily. Depending on the size of the hole and rotational speed of the donut centrifugal force could impact weight more strongly than the other side of the object (inverse of the distance squared).</p>
<p>In addition you would actually have more mass near you when on the inside which while pulling sideways would also pull towards the annulus, like standing in a valley on Earth, whereas being on the outside would reduce the mass nearby, like standing on the peak of a mountain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, to-answer-the-question, may we deduce that 'in the middle' you'd be 'weightless', but you'd have had to climb 'up' through the hole to get there, and you'd be vastly unstable because the slightst imbalance would have you fall back to the sugar coating somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, same principle as the instable Lagrange points really. Very hard to hold position, unlike L4 and L5. Worse than the Lagrange points really I believe. </p></div>		</li>
