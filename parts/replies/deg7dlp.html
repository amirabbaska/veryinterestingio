			<div class="markdown"><p>Mortality stats you linked show 20 fatalities at per 100,000 procedures. There was a Netherlands study of a random selection of 3.2M surgeries that had 67k deaths, or about 1.85% mortality (this includes far more complicated surgeries like heart bypass and transplants, and I believe recorded all deaths for two months following?).</p>
<p>Liposuction is on par with, or safer than, the average surgical procedure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not my area of medicine, just what I heard at an obesity / heart disease conference, when someone asked the question why doesn't everyone as risk of co-morbidities and mortality related obesity get lipo.</p>
<p>They loose about 1/5200 people who elect to under this procedure, but comparing to general medicine is not simple, the mortality rate cardiac surgeries is high because these people are on deaths door to begin with, the just under 2% rate you quoted doesn't surprise me. But unlike cardiac surgeries (and other life saving procedures) many people who get lipo are apparently healthy, or at least asymptomatic, effectively they are loosing 1/5200 healthy people, an unacceptable number. Once they take into account peoples health / survival chance at the surgery, lipo fairs very poorly.</p>
<p>Edit&quot;: Just had a close read, when compared to other abdominal surgerys, they lose 3 / 100,100, lipos lose 19.1 / 100,00, x6 the death rate for comparable surgeries.</p>
