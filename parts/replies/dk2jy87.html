			<div class="markdown"><p>This video is what actually inspired the question. I started thinking, of these cans are well engineered, why do we still use plastic bottles? Then I thought maybe people used them because they can be resealed for later use. Then I started thinking why aren't there aluminum equivalents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aluminium cans' strength rely on the pressure inside it. Once it's opened it's quite fragile, also if resealed since you can't re-pressurize it. </p>
<p>So a resealable aluminium can would require a completely different design, and you'll need to use a lot more aluminium for that. At that point plastic is probably better (I assume, since that's what's used in reusable bottles).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mainly because you couldn't have the same type of can made resealable. Remember the strength comes from the pressure of the liquid within it. So a standard can has to have a fizzy liquid in it to provide pressure.</p>
<p>Making this resealable hits two major problems, first once opened the gas vents, the fizziness decreases, you'll reseal and the can will have lost all it's strength.</p>
<p>Secondly you wouldn't be able to open it with a resealable tab as you need to first vent the pressure, then open the can.</p>
<p>So to make a standard can resealable is impossible, you instead have to create a different can (although it may look the same with a different tab the manufacturing process will be very different) which will require thicker walls and more materials etc. Doing this negates many of the benefits a standard can provides and so you may as well at this point use what's already designed for the job, a plastic bottle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you really need to worry about wall strength after the can was opened? I was under the impression that the strength generated from internal pressure was mainly s benefit for shipping the cans. Once it's been opened, it won't need to be shipped anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's energy drinks that have resealable caps, but I'm sure it's again cost to manufacture. There's a standard that's hard to break, plus cans are smaller than bottles so I'd imagine you'd sit down to have a can, or take a bottle to go. </p></div>		</li>
