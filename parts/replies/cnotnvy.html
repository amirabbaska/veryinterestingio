			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there instances where we've found actual dinosaur bones? I thought that most fossils were at least partially (if not completely) composed of minerals that have occupied empty, broken down space within the specimen. This means that they're basically just casts/replicas composed on various minerals, and not technically &quot;preserved&quot; bones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most dinosaur bones broke down in exactly the way described above. Only the ones that were quickly buried in a substance that excluded these bacteria allowed the fossilized remains that we find to be saved. Often, the fossils we find were quickly buried in a tar pit, mudslide or other such event/place which served to preserve the bones from the usual decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From [Wikipedia] (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde#Tissue_fixative_and_embalming_agent" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde#Tissue_fixative_and_embalming_agent</a>):</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Formaldehyde-based solutions are also used in embalming to disinfect and temporarily preserve human and animal remains.</strong> It is the ability of formaldehyde to fix the tissue that produces the tell-tale firmness of flesh in an embalmed body. In post mortem examinations a procedure known as the &quot;sink test&quot; involves placing the lungs of an animal in an aqueous solution of formaldehyde; if the lungs float it suggests the animal was probably breathing or able to breathe at the time of death.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
