<p>This can't be overstated!</p>
<p>Your brain has to <em>work</em> to <em>actively ignore</em> virtually everything you experience for precisely this reason. </p>
<p>Imagine if we felt, smelled, heard, and experienced every single thing around us all the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On a related note, a similar phenomenon happens at an even lower level. Your eyes' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis" target="_blank">fovea</a> is really the only part that feeds high-resolution imagery to the brain. Anything outside this central point is at a much lower resolution.</p>
<p>It is computationally expensive for the brain to process vision, even at the very first stage in the primary visual cortex. Vision evolved so that the brain doesn't even have to actively ignore anything because the filtering happens at the lowest level, the eyes.</p></div>		</li>
