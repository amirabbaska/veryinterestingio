			<p>Yep the simple way is to call advertisement.js - every adblocker will block it. advertisement.js can just write an invisible div then your page checks for the existence of that div id and if it's not there shows a message.<br><br>I never used this technique properly but I did test sending a &quot;Damaged sector 00FFA11 Failure Imminent&quot; message just to gauge how many people used blockers. It was a lot.<br><br>The other way is just to set a background image on your ad placement divs.</p>		</li>

			<p>They'd rather let people use the site without ads than lose a huge chunk of traffic by turning away people who have adblock (the vast majority of which will immediately turn away from a site rather than turn off adblock).<br><br>It's a &quot;pick your poison&quot; kind of situation basically</p>		</li>
