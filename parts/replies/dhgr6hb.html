			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly the correct answer.  Particularly the part about the centre differential.</p>
<p>For this reason and to add to the confusion, AWD is sometimes called as &quot;Full-Time 4WD&quot; and the above-mentioned 4WD with no centre diff is sometimes called &quot;Part-Time 4WD&quot;</p>
<p>Technically, both AWD and 4WD systems can have a transfer case - having one does not mean you can't also have a centre differential (this is the case on my 100-series LC).</p>
<p>Often times the transfer case is used to select between two ranges of gearing - usually a &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;Lo&quot; range where the Lo range gives you more available power/torque at a lower vehicle speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also true, I was trying to keep it short rather than cover every possible scenario.  Transfer cases can have a center differential integrated and various marketers will have any number of terms to describe that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't quite make sense to me. As a kid i went on tons of off-roading Jeep trips with my dad. He did a pretty serious type of off-roading, and you pretty much had to have &quot;lockers&quot; to get anywhere at all. My understanding was that in 4WD the front two tires were able to rotate at different speeds and power would generally go to whichever tire was easier to turn (same goes for back two tires).</p>
<p>So you could get into situations where your front left is on a rock, front right is off the ground, rear left is off the ground or barely touching, and rear right is on a rock. Hit the gas and the two tires off the ground would spin and you would remain stuck. However, if you engage your lockers, power gets distributed evenly between left and right at all times, so you could get unstuck generally.</p>
<p>And with lockers engaged on dry pavement, turning becomes very difficult. You can hear and feel the wheels slipping, and the steering wheel sort of jerks toward a neutral position.</p>
<p>The way you've described 4WD, it sounds like it lies somewhere on a continuum between AWD and locked 4WD. Is that correct? </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yep, 4WD is almost exactly right between the two, and there are different types of differential lockers as well.  Lockers or Limited Slip Differentials both limit or prevent the differential action in one or both axle differentials.</p>
<p>It sounds like you had selectable lockers like the ones that came on the Jeep Rubicon-edition Wranglers (TJs) or he had installed aftermarket air-activated like the ARB systems or others.  In those cases with the lockers turned off you can spin one tire per axle at will while the other one (with the traction) just sits, exactly as you describe.  With the lockers turned on they are essentially &quot;spools&quot;, meaning both wheels are tied directly to the driveshaft and must spin at the exact same speed as each other and at the exact ratio that the driveshaft spins.  (similar to many ATVs) It's great because you only need one out of four wheels to have traction and you won't get stuck, but it causes all kinds of handling issues and wear and tear if you go on dry pavement and do any kind of turning.</p>
<p>A Limited-Slip Differential is a compromise design that will transfer some minimum amount of rotation to the non-spinning wheel from the traction-free wheel.  Sometimes this is a clutch-pack that allows some movement but also provides some friction, other times it's gear-driven.  The point is that if one wheel is spinning freely, the other will rotate at some ratio, say 10%, hopefully enough to get the vehicle moving.  The higher the ratio, the more it behaves like a full locker.</p>
<p>I used a &quot;lunchbox&quot; locker in mine, it was a sort of ratcheting device that replaced the spider gears and allowed either wheel to turn faster than the driveshaft, but neither wheel to turn slower.  It was a compromise design, not quite as good on pavement as no locker and not quite as good offroad as a full locker, but only cost $250 and installed in about an hour or less with practice.</p>
<p>If your dad had put the Jeep in 4wd on dry pavement with the lockers off it would have behaved as I described in my original post - you'd feel some serious drivetrain binding while making sharp turns and your U-joints and driveshafts (or worse) would be in danger.  If he'd done it with the lockers turned on, you'd have had a real adventure!</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, kind of like a free-wheel hub on a bicycle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a 4wd, either full time or selectable, you have the option to lock the center differential (with full time 4wd) or activate 4wd (that has no center differential) and the front and rear wheels get equal power sent to their differentials. You'll also get the option of a &quot;low range&quot; that AWD doesn't offer. Low range gives you about a 2:1 gear reduction, giving you a shit ton of torque with excellent engine braking (cause your manually shifting your automatic too at this point) and precision throttle control. </p>
<p>At that point, you'll often have some kind of limited slip diff in the rear and an open diff up front, with aftermarket options to lock things up automatically or manually, giving you true 4wd instead of 1, 2, or, 3 wheel drive you get with open differentials or a combo of open/locking differentials. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Differentials are inherently UNhelpful in situations where one or more wheels will have no traction.  That's why serious offroad vehicles will either have an option to turn them off (aka Lock them) or will simply not have them.  </p></div>		</li>
