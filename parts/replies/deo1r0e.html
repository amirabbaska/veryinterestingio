			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi Gardenhippy - it's true that I didn't start out wanting to work with penguins. I actually started out wanting to work with dolphins! But I didn't pursue that dream until I was 30 years old, because it just didn't seem realistic. After doing an Earthwatch expedition with dolphins in 1994, I decided I had to at least TRY to see if I could pursue it as a career, so I went back to school for a 2nd degree in Animal Science and Veterinary Nursing. I did work with dolphins for a short time before having an internship with penguins at the New England Aquarium in Boston. And that was what set me on the path I'm still on today. After leaving the aquarium 12 years ago, I started my company, The Penguin Lady, with the goal of raising awareness and funding to protect penguins. I travel locally and internationally teaching kids and adults about penguin biology, behavior, and conservation - and donate 20% of the proceeds from my lectures and my book (The Great Penguin Rescue) to penguin conservation groups. There were so many decisions and opportunities along the way that I could write a book! But the main things were; finally believing in myself; having a few wonderful mentors; and once I was on my own - lots of networking to promote my business. And always saying YES when opportunities arose. Even when I was afraid, and even when I wasn't sure of what steps to take.</p></div>		</li>
