<p>It's important to point out, though, that molten iron is <em>not</em> magnetic, as it's above the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_temperature" target="_blank">Curie temperature</a>.</p>
<p>The reason it's able to generate our magnetic field is because molten iron conducts electricity. Since it's constantly convecting from Earth's internal heat and also spinning due to Earth's rotation, this generates a current...and a current generates a magnetic field, thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law" target="_blank">Ampere's Law</a>.</p></div>		</li>
