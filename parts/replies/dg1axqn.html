<p>it's easier to understand and remember that 101 is 1st and 102 is 2nd that it would be to remember that 100 is 1st and 101 is 2nd.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of modern languages use 0-indexing, not just C. Everything from C++ to Javascript to Bash to Haskell uses 0-indexing. Looking at the top 25 languages on GitHub, I think the only ones that use 1-indexed arrays are R and Lua (edit: and Matlab).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while, but I believe when I was in college the 100 designated courses were stand-alone intro classes, while 101 and 102 were a year long curriculum broken into 2 semesters' courses. 101's were offered in fall, 102's in spring. But one wasn't necessarily a pre-requisite for the other, though, like I remember Art History 101 was ancient time through Dark Ages, and 102 was Renaissance through modern times. Something like a language or Calculus really needed to be taken together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of places don't even actually have a &quot;101&quot; course in most subjects anymore but the <strong>idea</strong> of something being &quot;Foo 101&quot; has stuck. Just checked a few departments at my local state school, 3 had a &quot;100&quot; for the intro class, two started at &quot;104&quot;, some didn't have any classes below the 200 level and only Anthropology actually started with &quot;101&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
