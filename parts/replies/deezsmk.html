<ol>
<li>Rehabilitation. A lot of animals are found in horrible physical conditions. No-kill shelters often have the funding to get them back up to shape, assuming they have a good behavioral assessment. </li>
</ol>
<p>I've joked a lot that I am a &quot;rescue&quot; myself, since I got abused physically and emotionally as a child. I spent weeks looking through a no-kill shelter for my first dog, and I ended up bonding with the one that almost died because someone thought it was a good idea to lock them out in a kennel and THEN MOVE. I think animal rehabilitation is good therapy for us as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you own your own animals or does everyone eventually find a home? What are the emotions like for you when you transfer the animal from your home to another?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have two cats and one dog of our own.  One of the cats and the dog were &quot;planned&quot; and the other cat was a kitten we fostered that took so long to get adopted that we just decided to keep her.  They're great because it makes it easy for us to adopt to people with other animals, because we have an idea of how they'll act (obviously, every animal is different).  It is also great because we can teach foster puppies how to act with cats.  There was one dog that we did refuse to foster because it was so completely unsafe for the cats; a cat-less fosterer and us swapped dogs.   </p>
<p>I'm always thrilled when one of our fosters gets adopted.  Emotionally we'd love to keep every single one.  But every single time I get an animal adopted means that a space opens up in our home to take in another animal who won't get euthanized.  There is a tinge of sadness, especially when we've had the foster animal for a long time; we had a dog with mange that we had for months before he was cleared to be adopted out, and the house felt very quiet after he left.  But it soon passes because we know that we picked the very best home for that animal to go to, and he/she is going to be loved and cared for.  Most of the adoptive families keep in touch for a while (moreso dog adopters than cat adopters), and some have kept in touch for years.  </p></div>		</li>
