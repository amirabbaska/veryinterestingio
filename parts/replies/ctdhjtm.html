			<div class="markdown"><p>So out of curiosity and this is totally theoretical so please don't go crazy over the plausibility of this</p>
<p>if I stole a car at five and they dusted for prints and then got printed at thirty for whatever reason and there had been no cuts or disfigurement on my fingertips can they connect the two sets or do the tiny changes make it unworkable</p>
<p>Better way to phrase it how close are people's finger prints in relation to one another and there past self</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you put the prints of 5 year old you and 30 year old you in front of a latent fingerprint expert, they would most likely be able to match the prints together (assuming the latents were of good quality). </p>
<p>However, if using an automated fingerprint identification system (computer program for matching fingerprints) the correlation between 5 year old you and 30 year old you's prints would likely be very low due to the changed distance between minutiae points from growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But they aren't looking for the distance between points, they are looking for the relative positioning. That would only change with a significant change in shape (shape change due to growth can be accounted for, especially if you know race). If they just checked distance that could easily change with quality and resolution of the imager and the quality of the print, which depends on a huge number of factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The things you are denoting would qualify as &quot;disfiguring&quot; your fingerprints and the damage you do to your prints would be permanent.</p>
<p>As an aside, please don't try doing so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say I get a blister or something like that on my finger (I've never gotten one there, so I don't know how likely that is) and I pop it and peel it off, would the raw skin underneath reform the same fingerprint, or would it be different?</p></div>		</li>
