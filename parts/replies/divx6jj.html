			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont get why you'd think someone is weird for not liking music the way you do. For better or worse, we're all just simply different. We're all surrounded by unique stimuli when were young which affects what we like as we grow. Some people like music, some don't. I personally love music, but think most movies are so damned boring that I'd rather go whittle a stick.</p></div>		</li>
