			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be mistaken to think liking fried chicken or watermelon would cause a racist - northern or southern - to hesitate even for a moment to laugh at a stereotype involving black people and those foods.  That's not how racism works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could eat an entire bucket of fried chicken and wash it down with an entire watermelon.  I live in the south and come July I eat a watermelon a week. Sometimes I go buy one and sit out on the back deck (cause I tear into those things with reckless abandon) until I've eaten the whole thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm. You know, I'm gunna go ahead and say places that didn't codify racial segregation until the 1950s-60s and had anti-miscegenation laws on the books until the late 20th century are probably less racist in aggregate then places that did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Segregation happened I the north too, just look at fair housing laws. </p>
<p>The HBO TV series <a href="http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt2492296/" target="_blank">Show Me a Hero</a> does a good job of showing this off. </p>
<p>Sure, southern racism is more violent and brutal, but the North doesn't get a pass either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Explain to me how New York City has the most racially segregated schools in the country whereas all of the south has the most racially integrated schools? My girlfriend is from upstate new York and I hear so many causal uses of the word nigger when Im up there it blows my mind. I have lived in the south my whole life and never hear anything like that. </p></div>		</li>

The major cities have kinda moved past it but more than 20 miles out from bham and you start seeing all kinds of crazy shit lawn jockeys, confederate flags everywhere. When you're white down here you're also invisible to cops but all my black friends get pulled over frequently (had a friend get pulled over in the middle of a convoy at the start of our road trip because the cop was &quot;just checking&quot; on him and his new car.
