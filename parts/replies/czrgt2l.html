			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering if this simple explanation tends to overlook intellect's contribution. If prey sprints out of your sensory horizon, you will need to rely on other subtle information clues to continue tracking it. I.e. traditional tracking methods, observing and memorizing common prey behaviors, etc.</p></div>		</li>
