			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. In Australia, bread is about ₽111, Microwave is about ₽6700 and iphone7 is ₽44000. I suppose the iphone is a fixed price and the other stuff is made locally. I was just curious if I'd be able to buy more or less stuff if I was on holiday over there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At what age did you learn English? I ask out of curiosity- I want to learn how to speak Russian but even just mastering the Cyrillic alphabet is extremely challenging. I'm mildly envious of bilingual people whose languages are so different.  </p></div>		</li>
