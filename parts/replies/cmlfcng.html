			<div class="markdown"><p>When I visited France for a couple weeks I hosted dinner one night and a French acquaintance was confused when I put the extra camembert back into the fridge.  He said put it on top of the fridge to grow the flavor.  Two days later, had the most intense cheese experience of my life 0.o</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man if you like cheese and you like mashed potatoes, try the aligot next time. It look like <a href="http://hotel-lion-or.com/photos/3_1_183306.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.  Extra point if you go taste the real one in Aveyron. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a red blooded, gunslinging, tree-chopping, war fighting, whiskey drinking American but smack some of that shit down in front me, pour me wine and call me Pierre..</p>
<p>TL; DR: I'd come all over France for some of dat chee</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't get (real) Roquefort in the US right now. FDA banned it, ostensibly for high bacteria levels (<em>cough</em> bullshit). My distributor tried to sell me some pasteurized version that had came down the pipeline once word started getting around that this was going to happen. Tasted like bad Stilton. I just refuse to carry &quot;Roquefort&quot; until I can actually get the real stuff. If it ends up permabanned like Reblochon and some of the others, I'm going to be very upset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note also that guidelines like these err strongly on the side of caution. You can be a lot more cavalier about most things and be fine most of the time.</p>
<p>Specifically, mould on hard cheeses. For guests, I'll cut an inch around it. For myself, I'll just cut off the visibly mouldy part. I've known cheese makers and sellers who've confirmed that this is fine and completely traditional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanded the thread for this comment. For guests, I'd tell them I'm out of cheese. For myself, the minimum possible to remove mold on hard cheese. Who the hell lets soft cheese sit around long enough to mold? :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... 1 inch around <em>and</em> below? That is very often the whole cheese. I'm pretty sure you can get away with a much more shallow cut, such as 1 millimeter below. Source: I'm not dead.</p></div>		</li>
