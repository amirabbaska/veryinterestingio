			<p>I don't understand how this answers OP's question? all the math checks out, but that just seems like another fact that brings me deeper into this rabbit hole</p>		</li>

			<p>If (10x + y) - (10y + x) can be simplified to 9 times (x - y) then that means that (10x + y) - (10y + x) must always be divisible by 9.<br><br>That is to say, 9 times Z is divisible by 9, no matter what number Z is. <br><br>does that help?</p>		</li>

			<p>Ahh, yep I see it now. As another redditor said in this thread, I believe it's got something to do with how the base 10 system works, and as you pointed out how (10x+y) - (10y+x) can be simplified down to 9(x-y). Sorry if my response sounded negative, I didn't intend for it to be so, was just trying to understand what you made clear. Thanks!</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not a weird gimmick of base 10. Look at the first line of the equality again:<br><br>    (10x+y) - (10y+x) = 10x+y - 10y-x<br><br>If we were in anything that wasn't base 10, (i.e. base B):<br><br>    (Bx+y) - (By+x) = Bx+y - By-x<br>    = Bx - x + y - By<br>    = (B - 1)x - (B - 1)y<br>    = (B - 1)(x-y)<br><br>so the difference of any two-digit number and its transpose (reverse) in any base B is always a multiple of (B - 1).</p>		</li>

			<p>Alright so in our case of base 10, like you said it can be simplified with (10x+y) - (10y+x) say x=5 and y=2 which would make it (10×5+2) - (10×2+5) which can be simplified to 9(x-y) to make some product of 9. This part I thought I got when I read your response, because I understand that any interger put in 9(x-y) is divisable by 9. I didn't think it would be too difficult once I understood why it made sense. I apologize for taking up your time, and i'm probably just overlooking something, but as the way I see it is that any 2 digit number can be put into this equation and be simplified to a profuct of 9. I understand the process, just not why it works so flawlessly I suppose? I'm only a freshman in HS and the numeral system is something I haven't fully learned yet, so it's a hard to grasp for me.</p>		</li>

			<p>Any two digit number can in base 10. It's that the number structure changes with different bases and so the flippedal form of a number would change. For any given base B, this division trick works for b-1. If you rewrote numbers in binary and tried this trick it wouldn't work with 9.</p>		</li>
