			<div class="markdown"><p>If (10x + y) - (10y + x) can be simplified to 9 times (x - y) then that means that (10x + y) - (10y + x) must always be divisible by 9.</p>
<p>That is to say, 9 times Z is divisible by 9, no matter what number Z is. </p>
<p>does that help?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, yep I see it now. As another redditor said in this thread, I believe it's got something to do with how the base 10 system works, and as you pointed out how (10x+y) - (10y+x) can be simplified down to 9(x-y). Sorry if my response sounded negative, I didn't intend for it to be so, was just trying to understand what you made clear. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
