			<div class="markdown"><p>A house at the end of our block poured their foundation about six months before we started demo on our major addition... in 2015.  We've been living in our addition for more than two years now.  </p>
<p>They just got windows in, interior is still frame, missing balconies, there's an exterior wall not bricked or paneled yet.  It wouldn't bother me as much if it wasn't so godawful ugly.  Poor color and material choices, boxy construction, no/mismash architectural style.  Guy is a contractor and apparently using his own teams for the work when they are otherwise idle.  Apparently also thinks he's an architect.  </p>
<p>Honestly I think anyone who can afford a lot in our neighborhood would tear this place down and start over.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most of my construction experience is in Florida where the foundation is higher than the surrounding land. Your story painted a strange picture in my head until I realized...basements.</p></div>		</li>
