			<div class="markdown"><p>I know. It's an intentional misspelling from way back in the Xanga days, but pretty easy to figure out. Hahaha. I should get rid of it, but I've had this account for quite some time and don't really want to part with it. I used to choose this as my username for everything, so I didn't think twice about it when I finally made a reddit account.</p>
<p>Plus, I like my three year token, and I'm preparing to try my hand at stand-up comedy. In the event that it's a successful endeavor, I won't mind this being able to be traced back to me. I'm pretty honest about who I am with people.</p>
<p>Edit: Rid, not red.</p></div>		</li>
