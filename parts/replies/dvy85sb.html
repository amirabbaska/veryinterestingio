			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good mental model, but to prevent the furtherance of misleading info, an engine running on 3 out of 4 cylinders won't use much less gas. Going 60 MPH down the highway takes a specific amount of energy, so other cylinders have to make up for it. Don't you think cars would just turn off cylinders if it really used far less fuel? (And yes, some do, but use other tricks as well, and they get about a 7% increase in fuel economy)</p>
<p>The real model here is a car idling vs going 60 MPH. In the summer, it's going hard, trying to get somewhere (grow for the plant), using lots of gas. In the winter, it's just idling, enough to keep the cabin warm, not trying to go anywhere, using a lot less gas. The same tank of gas will last a couple days at idle in a car, but only a few hours on the highway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cars do shut down cylinders. It's called variable displacement technology. Some like GM drops a whole bank  (4 out of 8 cylinders) and infinity actually shortens the piston stroke. </p>
<p>The technology has been around for about 20 years now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I believe the idea was &quot;idling&quot;, period, it being 1 of 4 in winter and 4 of 4 in summer, with a limited identical amount of gas in both cases.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a car operating with <strong>3 of its 4 cylinders disabled.</strong> It will still run, although at a low performance, and will consume FAR less gas. </p>

<p>He meant a car running on one cylinder.</p></div>		</li>
