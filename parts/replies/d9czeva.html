			<div class="markdown"><p>We'd like to make our units based on things that don't change over time and can be measured anywhere. The earths rotation accomplishes neither of these. Some atoms vibrate very predictably so we took one and measured how many times it vibrates in a second and made it the standard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably wasn't used much, but it's still a thing.</p>
<p>It originates in latin where minutes are &quot;minuta prima&quot; and seconds &quot;minuta secunda&quot; (diminished once, diminished twice) and these are obviously followed by diminished thrice, fourfold, etc.</p></div>		</li>
