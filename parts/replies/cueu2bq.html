			<p>Another addition to this:<br>OP has a shitty juicer.<br>My wife is a lot more into juicing than I, but I still break it out every now and again. As she needs something that can handle beets, we own a fairly high-end Breville.<br>The pulp left over from anything put through this is damn near bone dry, and even an orange that seems fairly dry (I'll eat a section or two while juicing, b/c... oranges) will net 3+ ounces minimum. </p>		</li>

			<p>Adding to this.<br><br>Oranges found in most supermarkets are &quot;table&quot;/&quot;out-of-hand&quot; grade. Attractive, evenly colored, round, and consistently sized. Oranges destined for the juicer(think in whole crops/orchards leftovers), can be any size, shape, and color so long as they meet a minimum brix(sugar content), density, acid/sugar ration, moisture, etc. <br><br>Basically, the oranges you buy in stores are not meant to juice. They are meant to eat. Some stores will sell cases of juicing oranges. They are cheap compared to their navel counterparts. Add to this that the equipment they use has a sole purpose of extracting every last drop of juice from the oranges. What you may or may not be using is a multi purpose juicer.</p>		</li>

			<p>The reason for this is they are not ripe. They take green Tomatoes, and put them in a room with a chemical that turns them red, so they can make them ready for sale faster. i am not sure , but a lot of fruit is not as sweet as it used to be either. If you buy vine ripened ones they taste way better, or from the Farmers market</p>		</li>

			<p>The best possible source is a local farmers market at peak season. Hnngh. You know what sucks, though? If you don't live in a region/area where certain things flourish, you probably aren't going to get the best possible &lt;whatever item&gt;. Next best thing is to at least try and focus on seasonal items. In the US you can get almost any kind of basic fruit or veg at any time of year, but since they're still seasonal that means they're being shipped in from all over the globe, or maybe being grown in less than ideal circumstances. You may notice a sort of ramp-up in the grocery store towards a particular season, where suddenly there are &lt;whatever items&gt; in abundance in a special section. They might not be quite ripe, and they might not look quite as luscious as those that will follow in the coming weeks, but it's your clue that &lt;whatever item&gt;'s season is coming. Peak season usually coincides with sales. Try to time your purchases of &lt;whatever item&gt; with the peak season <em>in the country/region/hemisphere they're originating from</em>. You'll definitely notice a flavor difference. Great US oranges, for example, are going to come in December-ish time frame.<br><br><br>Anecdotally, I spent some time abroad in the Peace Corps in Azerbaijan, and I had some of the best fruits and vegetables <em>of my entire life</em> while I was there. The climate there was so fucking awful, a &quot;continental climate&quot; which I guess just means the worst of every season? Cold and wet winters, hot and humid summers, etc. However that also meant that a ton of fruits and veggies absolutely flourished there. Pomegranates, mandarins, cucumbers, tomatoes, peaches, figs, persimmons, quince, pears, ohmyfuckinggod I could go on and on. Believe it or not, everything was technically free-range and organic. Not because they tried to do so, but more because it was a post-Soviet state where everything had kinda gone to shit and nobody had time or money to waste on pesticides or cages. This was <strong>only</strong> when things were in season, however. You could only find pomegranate (<em>nar</em> in Azerbaijani, I think we should switch to that word for that whole brevity thing) during the November-December months. You only found most fruits in summer, etc. The months of Jan-May were just this never-ending winter and the everything-but-potato-famine (much cabbage, such grease, very pickled things, wow). If you ever travel, sample some local fruit. Best peach I ever had was in Antalya, Turkey from a dude walking around with a hand cart of amazing fruit. I'd -NEVER- had a peach that juicy before, where I couldn't take a bite without all the juice running down my neck and throat... ookay time to stop.</p>		</li>

			<p>Aye. I love our local farmer's market. I wish the farmers would realize that the day starts at 11am when I roll out of bed, not 6 o'clock in the middle of who-the-frack-wakes-up-this early.<br><br>We still get most of our produce from the grocery store, but for seasonal things, the farmers market is always better. One thing that's nice about the market is the ability to get cheap, unattractive fruit. We make jam (which we then sell at the market), so we don't care if the peach is unsightly, it will taste just as good in a Peach Jalapeño Jam.<a href="/ajhappy" target="_blank"></a></p>		</li>

			<p>I want to add a note on here so there's a complete answer. In addition to being made of not-as-pretty Florida oranges, there is less waste when making juice. In the store, oranges that inevitably go off before they are purchased are factored into the price of all the oranges. When they are juiced, they can be stored indefinitely. All the major juice brands use months-old juice:<br><a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/taste_tests/1496-orange-juice" target="_blank">https://www.cooksillustrated.com/taste_tests/1496-orange-juice</a></p>		</li>

			<p>adding to the addition.<br><br>oranges, and other produce, is package by variety and by size (48, 88, 120, 163, etc (how many fit into a crate/bag)). the machine sort the size but people along the conveyer belt pick out the &quot;really bad&quot; ones. In the U.S. specifically there are regulations for presentation AND quality. a farmers market may have better quality  (taste/juice) but less in the presentation scale, while a chain store typically will have the opposite because the FDA and USDA designated those consumer health codes. <br><br>Out in the groves I can find oranges covered with aphids, thrips, whatever, have them cleaned and be completely edible and delicious (properly more so than cosmetically good oranges because the insects select the produce with most sugar, nutrients etc), but people won't choose that in the grocery store because it will look &quot;gross&quot;. people think gross looking=terrible taste=unsellable=reason for regulation in shipping and selling. So oranges for juicing have less management of pesticide because cosmetics are not important. Hence why florida oranges are juice oranges. California has strict crop mgmt.  Especially now with citrus ever since the asian citrus psyllid was introduced in Florida that vectors huanglongbing disease which destroyed something like 60% of orange crops in the state</p>		</li>

			<p>Since the OP question also asks about economics, also consider all costs. The transportation costs of a round eating orange includes the shipping weight of the solids of the orange which may well be the majority of the weight of that orange. For volume, you are also packing round oranges as tightly as possible without damaging them. There may also be buffers and padding to keep them from damage.<br><br>A juicing orange not only has a higher juice content, but if you extract the juice as close to where they are grown as possible then you don't have to ship the weight of the solids. You can also fill a volume completely. In principle, you could fill a tanker truck full of orange juice with no air space at all and the weight is entirely the product. Even if you box them first and then ship to groceries, the boxes are square and fit tightly without the need for much packing. The amount of juice delivered per unit of energy to deliver is much, much lower for pre-juiced oranges shipped as juice than as solid oranges that you then put in your juicer at home.<br></p>		</li>
