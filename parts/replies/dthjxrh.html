			<div class="markdown"><p>The autonomic nervous system (PNS and SNS) contributes to pulmonary ventilation by controlling breathing rate and depth in response to factors such as partial pressures of oxygen and CO2 (CO2 has a minor role and is only associated with the peripheral chemoreptors) and blood pH (caused by the hydration of dissolved CO2 to carbonic acid). This is a highly regulated process as hypoventilation can cause respiratory induced acidosis, while hyperventilation can cause respiratory induced alkalosis.</p>
<p>The Bainbridge effect (or reflex) is the process by which an increase in venous return causes increased pressures in the atria and venoatrial junctions of the heart. Stretch receptors detect this change and increase nervous output to the efferent pathway to the cardioaccelorator centre in the brain. This, in turn, increases nervous output via cardioaccelorator nerves to the SA node to increase heart rate. </p></div>		</li>
