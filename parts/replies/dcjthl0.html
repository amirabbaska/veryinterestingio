			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many, many ingredients in soaps and shampoos and a lot of them could easily cause irritation to thinner skin.  Even just the soap itself can cause irritation if it strips too much of the natural oils from your skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Menthol is the only ingredient that should actively stimulate nerve fibers in your skin. There are irritants, this is more of a function of dryness and allergy than actual cutaneous nerve activity. For example, harsher soaps can dry your skin out causing you to itch, but this is a normal physiological itch, not soap ingredients acting on your nerves. </p></div>		</li>
