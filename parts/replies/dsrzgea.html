			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that argument is that when there are no relative advantages among different alleles, one will usually come to predominate by genetic drift and fixation. I'm guessing there's some sort of unknown balancing selection at work that keeps A, B, and O all at relatively high frequency in the gene pools of various human subgroups.<br />
EDIT: as /u/callkennyloggins pointed out, large populations tend to be resistant to genetic drift and can maintain a diverse gene pool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t quite right. Even in the absence of balancing selection, in relatively large populations variation can be maintained for an extremely long time. Any other form of selection is likely to result in fixation quickly so if there were selection, it would need to be balancing. But balancing selection is not at all necessary to maintain variation. All that is necessary is a large population size. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It seems to me that before the 1600s, blood types didn't have much of an effect on humans. We didn't transfuse blood so why would different blood types make much of a difference. Are there any benefits from specific blood types that would help one survive? If no then there wouldn't be natural selection that would eventually narrow down to one blood type.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Or, hypothetically, there used to be more blood types and there was a strong disadvantage that killed the others off, but either the disadvantage wasn't as severe for ABO or there was no disadvantage or perhaps there was an isolated population of the above that wasn't affected by the disadvantage and later able to reintegrate.  Really we just don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or more accurately, it’s less of “if the mutation is beneficial” it’s often far more of “if the mutation is beneficial or is not detrimental (enough) to prevent having/raising offspring.”</p>
<p>There are plenty of mutations that are essentially useless/harmless until environmental pressure selects for or against it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, I meant more of that it doesn’t have to beneficial to be passed on, it just has to not kill you before you can have offspring that survive to have offspring to pass on. </p></div>		</li>
