			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL this stereotype has been around for over a century! I only learnt of this stereotype in the past 12 months, and it was from American comedians I listen to on the radio, so I thought this was a fairly recent one. Come to think of it, from mostly white comedians too.... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American here too, and while I am familiar with the existence of the stereotype, I didn't know the basis for it.  Other stereotypes associated with African Americans are fried chicken and collard greens, though personally I think that is more just southern food than specifically 'black' food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always heard that a lot of &quot;southern food&quot; has roots in West African flavors because that's where many of the slaves came from and they were doing the cooking in the fancy houses. Then everyone mimicked their &quot;betters&quot; I guess and fixed the same kind of foods even if they didn't have a slave to cook it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for fried chicken, there's a story behind that too.</p>
<p>In the Jim Crow south, black people were not served in restaurants. Their food was either handed out of the back door, or not at all. So for black people travelling through the south, they needed something to eat that would keep for a long time on the road. Fried Chicken was what filled the void. I'm guessing that the heat killed the germs, and the oil kept the surviving germs from spreading..?</p>
<p>Anyway, while on the road through the south, they would keep the fried chicken in whatever container was available to them. Most often it was an old shoebox or bucket, lined with tissue paper.</p>
<p>Source: Black parents from Texas &amp; Louisiana.</p>
<p>Now, next time you go to KFC, take a closer look at what they put their chicken in, and die a little inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Born in Deep South Alabama, I've been around a lot of racist people, particularly those two generations older. What I've found is that these kinds of stereotypes (fried chicken, watermelon, etc.) are prominent today because they're less serious and impactful than those of our elders. These are easy to joke about, but my own grandparents were always scared for my belongings when I played soccer (my team had a lot of African refugees). So, these stereotypes might seem newer because they are less serious and more easily joked about than earlier ones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/12/how-watermelons-became-a-racist-trope/383529/" target="_blank">this</a> Atlantic article, the trope is older than the civil war.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the early modern European imagination, the typical watermelon-eater was an Italian or Arab peasant. The watermelon, noted a British officer stationed in Egypt in 1801, was “a poor Arab’s feast,” a meager substitute for a proper meal. In the port city of Rosetta he saw the locals eating watermelons “ravenously ... as if afraid the passer-by was going to snatch them away,” and watermelon rinds littered the streets. There, the fruit symbolized many of the same qualities as it would in post-emancipation America: uncleanliness, because eating watermelon is so messy. Laziness, because growing watermelons is so easy, and it’s hard to eat watermelon and keep working—it’s a fruit you have to sit down and eat. Childishness, because watermelons are sweet, colorful, and devoid of much nutritional value. And unwanted public presence, because it’s hard to eat a watermelon by yourself. </p>
