			<div class="markdown"><p>If we think about what sunscreen does in terms of energy conservation, there's a really simple idea for keeping your skin from absorbing UV radiation:</p>
<p>As the person above me wrote, one way of blocking UV radiation from skin is to coat your skin in a highly UV-reflective material. Many of these &quot;sun-blocking&quot; compounds are hydrophobic, which is why sunscreen often comes as an oil blend or oil/water emulsion &quot;cream&quot; (and that emulsion potentially settling out, just like your vinaigrette, is why they suggest shaking sunscreen well before use!). Compounds like Zinc Oxide absorb energy broadly across the UV-spectrum, and are frequently employed in sunscreens in the form of nanoparticles. The diameter of the nanometer-scale zinc oxide spheres can determine how effective they are at blocking the sun, and also how opaque/transparent they appear to us in the visible spectrum (this is a tradeoff!).</p>
<p>But this idea of &quot;UV-reflective&quot; isn't exactly accurate. These molecules are actually doing a really great job of absorbing UV radiation. But hold the phone -- I thought we were trying to block the sun, not absorb its energy! These molecules (like Titanium Dioxide or Oxybenzone, common active ingredients in sunscreens) sit on the surface of your skin and <em>convert the energy from sunlight into heat</em> by vibrating their molecular bonds until they fall apart (which is part of why you need to reapply!). More recently, these sunscreens also contain compounds that limit the degradation of these sun-blockers, which limit their photocatalytic activity due to fear of exposure to the free radicals they may form upon decomposition. But they can still do a good job of protecting skin from the sun's UV rays before they fall apart. </p>
<p>minor edits for clarity</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: before penetrating your skin, UV energy from sunlight can be turned into heat after being absorbed by active ingredients in sunscreen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sunscreen won't block all of the UV radiation, but it certainly lowers the amount of vitamin synthesis from sun exposure. Keep in mind that dietary vitamin D typically will cover for reduced time outside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does.</p>
<p>I live up north and have paper white skin.  When my skin sees the sun it burns so I wear f50 if the sun is out.</p>
<p>I also take vit D supplements </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But physical sunscreen ingredients (e.g. zinc oxide) <em>do</em> block and scatter UV rays, while chemical sunscreen compounds (e.g. oxybenzone) are the ones that that transform UV into heat. Most suncreen products have both, but there are some that stick to physical blockers.</p></div>		</li>
