<p>So, the nervous system is divided into parts. The first division is between the central and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous system is your brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system is basically everything else. The peripheral nervous system is then divided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system is basically in charge of voluntary musculoskeletal operations and movements and the autonomic system is in charge of the unconscious, involuntary stuff, like heart rate and digestion. </p>
<p>The autonomic system is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. They work in opposition to one another. The sympathetic system is what energizes the body into the fight or flight state, readying us for survival. The parasympathetic system is what calms us back down to preserve resources and get back to baseline so we can ready ourselves for survival again later. To help remember what it does, the parasympathetic system is sometimes termed &quot;rest and digest,&quot; &quot;feed and breed,&quot; or &quot;fuck and feed.&quot;</p>
<p>The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems of the autonomic nervous system cause their changes in your body by releasing hormones like adrenaline. These chemicals stimulate or suppress various functions in your body, from increasing your heart rate to run away from danger to reducing the activity of your intestines when you are in fight or flight states. </p>
<p>These hormone levels change not only depending on the presence or absence of stressors, but also depending on regular activity and stimuli, like the time of day. When you are getting ready for bed, your body is operating based on a timed rhythm, your behavior, and the stimuli around you and reduces certain hormones and increases others to help you sleep. A consequence of this is that the hormones that keep you alert and active during the day are also the ones that help you stay healthy and ward off the symptoms of infections and illnesses. When these hormones go down to help you sleep, you start feeling your symptoms more, which ironically makes it harder to sleep in many cases. </p>
<p>Conversely, when you get up in the morning, just because you are conscious doesn't mean your body suddenly begins working at the same level it is during the middle of the day. It takes time for your body to respond to waking up, so you feel shitty until those other systems are activated. </p>
<p>It gets more complicated than that, involving even things like posture (e.g. Standing vs lying down), but this is a good, though rough, introduction to the explanation.</p></div>		</li>
