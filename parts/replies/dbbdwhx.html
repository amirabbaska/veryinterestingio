			<div class="markdown"><p>yes and no. 10 years from now we'll probably have standardized higher resolutions (examples being 4k and 8k already being available today even though 1080p is the standard). </p>
<p>Even though the resolution will probably increase, the size of TV screens, monitors etc. probably won't grow much further because beyong a certain point it just becomes impractical to use.</p>
<p>So, they will probably look a bit 'old' but not so much as the videos from 2006 do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will probably be less. Audio is a good example, AM, telephone, cassette tapes, etc. sound relatively low quality. But then we settled on CDs, and the standard is basically high enough for human perception. Better quality audio exists, but it's used for things like mastering, or multichannel audio, but most is mixed down to CD level for mass consumption.  </p>
<p>We may be getting near that level for video. 8k is enough to project on a movie screen. Once that's what we're streaming and consuming online, on our phones, etc. we may be near a final video resolution. Maybe we'll go one or two generations further, but we'll probably reach a point like CDs where the quality is good enough for most purposes.  </p>
<p>But what this doesn't include is the desire for things like 360 video, streaming VR experiences, or multiperspective videos. We'll likely be looking for better quality in those areas for years to come, and the ones from today will look old ten years from now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What we're all familiar with is 3840x2160 which is UHD, but everybody calls it 4k. UHD is exactly double the height and double the width of 1920x1080, so 1080p would upscale a lot better to higher resolutions than standard def does to HD. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10 years from now probably lots of people will have screens the size of walls. So the problem will be similar.</p>
<p>I wonder if this applies to VR displays though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effect will probably slow down but will still be there. Every year new screens with better specs show up. It seems that the resolution war is ending with 4k adoption being very slow, however now things like HDR video show up. If it gets adopted most movies etc will be HDR by then and things from '2016' will look worse.</p>
<p>On the other side of the cameras are getting better with better noise reduction etc. While the leap might not be as big as between 2006 and now you will see a difference.</p>
<p>Good example is the adoption of 'retina' type screens on phones. Since the iPhone 4-ish era phone resolutions have gone through the roof and phone screens are very crisp. Just for fun pick up a phone from 2008-2009 with a similar size screen as a 2016 phone (good luck with that by the way, phones now are huge!) And the phone that seemed quite nice in 09 will look like a piece of junk now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the pixels on the video are still the same physical size, excepting small scaling factors between the common 19&quot; size monitors then and 24&quot; monitors today.</p>
<p>Videos back then just looked worse and we were OK with it, because all sources of video were worse.  Broadcast TV, VHS, realplayer videos, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't explain why, even if you watch a lower quality video on a smaller device like like a tablet, it looks worse than what you think it should look like.</p></div>		</li>
