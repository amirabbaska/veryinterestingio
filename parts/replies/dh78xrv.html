			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm reading <em>The Black Hole War</em> now and was going to post a related question on Ask Anything Wednesday. </p>
<p>Susskind's ability (or maybe it's his willingness) to tackle incredibly far-out concepts in layperson's language is astounding. Absolutely astounding. I appreciate Michio Kaku and Brian Greene, but Susskind's very down-to-earth style makes even those guys seem like incomprehensible wizards.</p></div>		</li>
