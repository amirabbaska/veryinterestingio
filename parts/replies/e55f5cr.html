			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, anyone that thinks there's a &quot;culture war&quot; on university campuses now really needs to look back at what was happening 50 years ago. What's happening today is quaint and small by comparison.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'd also add that it's pretty ironic that boomers have heavy nostalgia towards this particular period, but now roll their eyes at young kids protesting or demanding a more equitable society. Do they sometimes go too far? Yeah, but the 1960s counterculture definitely went too far in some ways too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One could argue that people had much more to fight for back in the 1960's. </p>
<p>A lot of the turmoil we see today is the result of the echo chamber effects of social media.</p>
<p>People continually compare Trump to Hitler.... When Hitler and his (EDIT) National Socialist German Workers' Party took control of Germany, people actually left the country and shit got very real very quickly. When Trump took control people really just talked shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When Hitler became Chancellor, things did not turn very bad very quickly.  They turned very bad slowly and gradually.  To quote Milton Mayer’s “They Thought they were Free: Germans 1933-1945”</p>
<p>&quot;But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One nitpick, Hitler's party was the National Socialists.  The Nazis were not socialists, they were a far right, nationalist party. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was actually overt racism happening in earlier decades. Now it's rare. Or else it's percieved and blown out of proportion for headlines or political reasons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, just because people aren't having police dogs or firehoses turned on them in the streets doesn't mean racism still isn't very present.</p>
<p>A lot of racists have just become more covert in how they operate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. To claim the 60s weren’t more in a turmoil is just plain recency bias. At least we don’t have a draft now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think the lasting image of the sixties was the summer of love but you had the threat of nuclear war, the tail end of Jim Crow and McCarthyism, the assassination of JFK and MLK, kids being sent off to die in their 10's of thousands in a war nobody really understood, students being gunned down by the national guard, intelligence agencies infiltrating and harassing civil rights and anti war organisations.</p>
<p>You also had a genuine counter culture which wasn't fractured into niches as it is today.</p></div>		</li>
