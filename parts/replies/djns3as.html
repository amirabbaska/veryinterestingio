			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems that the major eliminating factor of the K-T extinction was size. Everything that was big died out while smaller animals survived. Considering that the impact threw up dust into the sky that blocked out the sun, the food chain was wipped out from the bottom. Animals that were small and needed less food did better than large the herbivores and then the large carnivores that preyed on them.</p></div>		</li>
