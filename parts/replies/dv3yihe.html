			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, this makes a lot of sense. I took kratom a few years back and it wreaked havoc on my adrenals, giving me adrenal fatigue. My hair fell out, I couldn't sleep, when I COULD sleep it was only as the sun was coming up and it felt eternal. And the hair loss wasn't minor, I had bald patches, which for a female of 22 isn't normal. I thought it was anemia so I went to a doctor but they couldn't find anything in my bloodwork. I stopped the kratom and I started feeling better but I wonder if I've permanently screwed up my adrenals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This stuff is very extreme from what I read. Plus, it will affect your hormones in a major way. You need to take  care of yourself  - go to bed early, eat fresh food, remove stress from your life. Also try adrenal cocktail first thing in the am every day. 1/4 tsp pink salt, 200 mg potassium (open caps) and 1/4 tsp of vitamin C powder in a glass of water. This will help your adrenals stabilize. Take caution if you have high blood pressure. Also look into progesterone cream. Itâ€™s otc and can help with your physical symptoms and thyroid. Hope you feel better. As a female you need to be ultra careful what you put in your body. Good luck to you. </p></div>		</li>
