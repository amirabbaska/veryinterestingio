<p>Why would you use GPS, gyroscope and all that shit when all you need is slight movement down followed by sudden stop? Accelerometer is more than enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6621289/?reload=true" target="_blank">quite a bit of research</a> done around this problem, including <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493449" target="_blank">research as to how well various devices/algorithms work</a>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having observed my phone's step counter it seems that it doesn't start counting until you've taken a few steps. Same with a sustained walk/run. It doesn't start counting until 10 minutes of walking in, then it passes the threshold and counts as a walk. So a single drop could be a step, could be a shuffle and it just doesn't count it. Several drops in a rhythm counts as steps, rightly or wrongly.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>They use the altimeter too!  If they know how far you ran, uphill or down, PLUS time taken and the step count - then they can all that to make a much more accurate estimate of calories burned.  As opposed to a simple pedometer, which would have a hard time distinguishing jogging and running, or uphill vs down, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Finally, as you use it more, it learns a little better what it should count and what it shouldn't as steps</p>

<p>How does this work? How can it become better at determining whether a slight movement is a step?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolutionary algorithms (they may be called other way). I'm no programer but I'll try to explain. Basically, no one knows how they solve particular problems. Programers just build the program that will build the solution. In a simple way is just about trial and error and repeat a lot of times. Then you add more importance to some parameters (called weight) so it reaches the solution faster and better. </p>
<p>Have you ever seen Google's captcha where you have to select the image with the car? You are training a program to correctly identify images with cars.</p>
<p>Sorry if my english is rough or if I got some knowledge wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, but for an algorithm to evolve, you must have some idea about how good it is. Otherwise is will randomly evolve to become better or (more likely) worse. So you must some idea about its accuracy, otherwise you can't tell whether or how it should change.</p>
<p>For example, if it's too sensitive, it may pick up 50% too many steps during a day. The problem is that if you don't tell it how many steps you actually took, it will never know that it was wrong and therefore can't become better.</p>
<p>So I'm a bit skeptical of the &quot;learning&quot; part of it until I know how it determines that it needs to evolve.</p></div>		</li>
