			<div class="markdown"><p>Time doesnt really &quot;move&quot; forwards, rather it exists as space does, all given points at once, just takes however long(relative to the speed of light) it takes for us to get to the next point. </p>
<p>So if you consider living here on earth: 1second of time = 1meter of motion through space. </p>
<p>When you get closer to a black hole that motion is decreased drastically and exponentially because of density, its becoming so dense that you can barely move, think of a planet with high gravity you couldnt walk very easily, now think of a planet smaller than an atom that weighs more than 1000 suns and you RLLY couldn't move(not even light can move fast near a black hole!).... So as you move closer to the center spacetime condenses, like a .zip file on your computer, and time &quot;slows&quot; down: 1second = .001meter, .000001meter, .000000001meter of motion through space ect., and smaller and smaller until you reach the event horizon where time, for you, will &quot;slow down&quot; to almost a grinding halt while the rest of the universe experiences space/time normally. </p>
<p>So you can spend millions of normal earth seconds in a black hole and only experience entropy or &quot;age&quot; as if you spent one normal earth second outside of the hole. When you left the hole You'd be still younger as we inevitably grew older. </p>
<p>The implications are slightly terrifying. It shows that space only feels relative because time is absolute. It means that all time, past present and future, exist at once, and that we are merely experiencing one second/meter at a time, instead of all at once, and that &quot;free will&quot; is an illusion created from this experience. The fact is we are all born and will all die at a certain point (second/meter) in space, that is certain and predetermined. It's already happened, We are just enjoying the ride as it goes until it stops and then...lights out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can infer that the concept of 'free-will' is an illusion even without evidence from space-time theory. </p>
<p>Having 'free-will' implies that you are able to make a choice about what to choose before you chose it, which is a paradox. I can ask you to think of a specific country and you may think that you have the free-will to think of any country you like, but you don't since you have no way to choose what country to think of before you though of it. </p>
<p>Even the decision to change the country to another one once you thought of it is not a free choice but simply something that popped up in your head (before it popped up in your head you had no way of knowing that this was what you were going to choose to think about, hence the choice was not a free one).</p>
<p>Do note that while the notion of free-will is basically impossible that does not make choices or the act of making choices unimportant from the perspective of a human existence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You arrive at a fork in the road, you feel like you have a choice to go left or right, but on the scale of time the choice has already been made, you were always going to go in one particular direction, even both in a multiverse theory, where one universe you go left, and another you go right. </p>
<p>That's because time is a dimension(the 4th), the future has happened just as much as the past and present. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a perfect example. One other thing to mention is that since space itself is curved, the car that rolls close to the bowling ball will come out at an angle (which is the basis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens" target="_blank">gravitational lensing</a>).</p></div>		</li>
