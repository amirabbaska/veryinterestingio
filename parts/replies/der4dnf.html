			<div class="markdown"><p>I am currently leading the efforts for my client to transform the systems engineering discipline from the traditional paper-based approach to a model-based approach.   This is referred to as model-based systems engineering, model-based engineering, or digital engineering. While models are at the heart of all engineering disciplines, they are not integrated and used as a continuum across the lifecycle to support activities such as requirements, design, analysis, verification, validation, etc.<br />
The single biggest challenge in the future is that our systems are becoming more complex, and the human intensive paper-based process will not be to deliver and operate systems that adapt to the changing needs in a timely manner.  Not only is a model-based approach needed, but advancements in technology to integrate humans and machines into the process is critical (e.g., human-machine interaction, machine learning, robotics, additive manufacturing, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say model based, are you pushing to move away from traditional requirements management methods such as DOORS databases? Or does the model based approach utilize new tools in conjunction with traditional requirements management processes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously I'm not OP but i am a systems engineer for a DoD contractor working with a model-based software for all the things she mentioned. We are currently using a tool called Vitech Genesys and it is very good. it can do everything DOORS can (it can even export a DOORS file) but it is set up in a way that requires less maintenance activities to manage the database as new data comes in. You can think of it as the difference between going from a functuon-based programming language to an object-oriented language. The shift we're seeing in The SE field is pretty much on that magnitude. </p>
<p>The main way Genesys enables this is by creating entities as one specific class and then linking entities to each other using relationships, and nearly every class is hierarchical. One of the main benefits is that it diagrams can also be done directly in the tool, some of it even auto-generated, so you reduce the total number of tools you need since you don't also need licenses for Visio or MagicDraw. Since relationships are also bidirectional, you get both forward and backward traceability. Genesys also has predefined scripts to generate DoDAF views, which are documents required by the government for all projects doled out to contractors. these documents have to be continually updated and resubmitted as your data changes in order to secure funding. in the past, this was done with lots of typing up Word docs or required a software engineer to create custom scripts to export data from DOORS and reformat, but with Genesys, it's just a click of a button. In our case, we actually run a cron script that generates them each night and pushes the files out to a collaborative web portal to share with all subcontractors on the contract. </p>
<p>A similar tool we researched was Innoslate. However, this is browser based and storage is in a cloud so it's not suitable for designing systems that involve classified information. They're a relatively new company, so this is probably on their list of future features.</p></div>		</li>
