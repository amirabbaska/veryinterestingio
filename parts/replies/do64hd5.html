			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of science fiction depicts spacefaring vessels with rotating modules, under the idea that the centrifugal force would mimic the effects of gravity.  Is there any basis for that or is this?  If so, could it work for plants too, to overcome issues of growing them in microgravity?   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants know where 'down' is because they have heavy starch grains in their cells which fall to the bottom (geotropism), so I imagine centripetal force would mimic this nicely. There's also phototropism where leafy bits grow towards the light and roots grow where it's dark, which might help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've almost got to the bottom of this thread and someone else finally mentioned what I've been thinking the whole time; O'Neill cylinders. I'm certainly no expert but I'd think that one disadvantage here would be the scale that they'd need to be built so that the rotation can be low enough so as not to make the inhabitants ill. ie. they have to be really, really big and spin really really slow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the moon lacks an atmosphere to burn up space debris</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is off topic, but I never considered this...were the lunar missions at a constant risk of small, unpredictable pieces of debris taking out equipment? The whole time they were walking on the moon, were they playing russian roulette just hoping that nothing would strike anything critical?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number I saw was that each square meter on the moon is struck by some piece of space debris once a year on average. Small chance if you're out taking a moon walk. High chance if you are leaving your Greenhouse out indefinitely. I don't have a source for that, it's just what I remember being told as part of our problem statement </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Yes, it was a small risk.
Long answer: There always is the possibilty in space to be hit by small space debris, but the chance for that to happen is much lower than you would expect and gets even lower, the bigger the debris is, we are talking about. The ISS has been exposed to that danger for years and is still up there. Same goes for satellites.</p></div>		</li>
