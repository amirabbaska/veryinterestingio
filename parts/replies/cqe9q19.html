			<div class="markdown"><p>At most it would produce a little extra heat, but since the reaction would be so far underground - and the ore no where near weapons grade - it would be self limiting and go largely unnoticed by observers on the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a question of weapons grade, which was never present naturally. It's a question of reactor grade. When the earth was young, natural uranium was reactor grade. Now it has decayed (not fissioned) and is no longer reactor grade. The reaction simply can't happen any more.</p>
<p>(Pedantic caveat: if some sort of natural process caused isotopic refining, it would be theoretically possible. I'm pretty sure that can't happen for uranium, though. However, it does happen to a small degree for lithium, and slightly for some other light elements, and the isotope ratios depend on where you get them.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on the idea of the natural reactor being &quot;self limiting&quot;: The sustaining chain reaction only occurred when water was present.  Water has hydrogen, which is a neutron moderator, meaning it slows down neutrons via elastic collisions.  Low energy neutrons have a much higher probability to induce fission in uranium-235, so the fission chain reaction initiated when water was present.  The heat generated from the reaction vaporized the water, reducing the amount of hydrogen in the vicinity.  This stopped the chain reaction until more water was introduced.  This reactor was cyclical and self-limiting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It cannot really happen today because too much of the fissile U-235 has decayed away, leaving too small a proportion of easily fissionable nuclei to maintain a chain reaction. That is why modern nuclear reactors need to either use uranium that has been enriched in U-235 content, or be built from fairly exotic materials such as ultra pure graphite, or heavy water. In nature it is more or less guaranteed that any significant uranium deposit would contain too little U-235, and too many neutron-absorbing impurities to sustain such a reaction. </p>
<p>Also, strictly speaking a &quot;nuclear reaction&quot; is not just the very rapid reactions that happen in nuclear power plants. Almost every object you can think of, including your own body, contains some weakly radioactive isotopes, and emit radiation because of it. A small proportion of cancers are believed to be due to this naturally occurring radiation.</p>
<p>There is also a very powerful nuclear-power source on earth that most people don't know is nuclear in origin. Geothermal energy is generated from the radioactive decay of Uranium in the earth's interior. This is not a chain-reaction driven by fission, but simply the energy released due to Uranium's slow alpha-decay. It is able to build up and generate high temperatures because the earth is very big. This happens with any radioactive material if you have it in large quantity, and it's why spent nuclear fuel has to be stored in cooling ponds. Even after the fission chain reaction has ceased, the radioactivity in the waste is still high enough that the fuel rods could melt and catch fire without adequate cooling. Note that this is so because the fission products are much more radioactive than the original uranium ore. Natural uranium can safely be stored in large quantities with very little cooling. It is only because the earth is so fantastically big that it is able to reach very high temperatures in its interior. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>enriched in U-235 content</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always wonder if we're confusing people when scientists and engineers use that terminology.  Most people think of &quot;enrichment&quot; as adding something extra.</p>
<p>The enrichment process removes other elements.  I think a lot of confusion might be avoided if we used more familiar terms like &quot;purified U-235&quot; instead of enriched.</p>
<p>It's enriched by adding more of the same element with nothing else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can't happen today; the natural uranium available has decayed too much to undergo fission. That's why we have to refine it for use in nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>If it did, it probably wouldn't matter all that much, assuming the reactor was similar to the Gabon one. The products from that reactor are still remarkably close to where they were produced. (Distances of a few meters or less.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it can and does (spontaneously) fission, albeit at a very low rate.  What it can't do is sustain a chain reactor when moderated with light water (i.e. normal water).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the one we recall from years ago. Apparently enough U238 &amp; U235 got concentrated by natural processes. Then a nuclear fission reaction went on there until the concentrations of U-235 got low enough to block most of it. Possibly moderated by water, which can slow down the neutrons enough to allow them to hit the U nuclei and create fission. Which then creates more fission, etc., a nuclear chain reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why must the reactor have been cyclically supercritical and subcritical?  Could subcritical multiplication have been responsible for the fission product buildup instead?  100ky  is a <em>long</em> time for reactor operation.</p></div>		</li>
