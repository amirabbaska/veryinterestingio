			<div class="markdown"><p>So according to this if I want to get up at 6.30 I should stay awake until 12.30? I'll try it. But if I don't feel refreshed I'm coming for you.</p>
<p>Edit: I screwed up and went back to bed so I cant tell you whether it worked. I'll be stricter tomorrow. Round 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>11:00 is probably the preferred time, just because it means more sleep.  The purpose is to have you wake up during a non-REM period of sleep, so 12:30 is better than 12:00 or 1:00, but still is under 6 hours total of sleep (if you get in bed at 12:30, it'll take you 5-15 minutes to fall asleep probably).  11:00 means you'll get over 7 hours of sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have it on my phone and used it for a period of a little over a year, and it definitely helped. Really, once you have tried it a few times, all you need to do is assume 15 minutes to fall asleep, then add multiples of 1hr30min to get your wake up time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that only gives you 6 hours of sleep.  I think you want to go one notch further (the second-to-last value).  it ultimately works out to roughly 7 and a half hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm about the same. The only consistency I've found with my sleeping is that I always sleep for sure at around 3-5AM, regardless of whether I go to bed at 11PM or 3AM.</p>
<p>The stupid thing is that if I ever get on my bed during the day for anything, I'll fall asleep in 10mins. Its only when I actually need to sleep that it takes me hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't use this. It's based on speculation that isn't proven, and people vary far too wildly on an individual basis for it to be useful/helpful/healthy to most people anyway. People have different sleeping schedules, different &quot;internal clocks&quot;, different natural waking and sleeping times. Some people need more sleep while others need less. Some people fall asleep faster, others take longer to do so. Some people's sleeping patterns allow them to get the most rest out of every night. For some people, their rest is, well, restless.</p>
<p>These things are nearly pseudoscience. It might work for a few people, but that doesn't mean it really <em>works</em>. I'd advise against people doing this. Just try on your own to have a decent sleeping schedule, and see what helps your rest the best on your own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But, this makes no sense. We are all guarantee only one thing in life, death. I think water consumption has little baring on this, in fact the more pure water you drink actually postpones the inevitable end, as your body has to do less work to use pure water, than it does to break down things you consume that contain water into its usable form. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay,  you need to stop drinking energy drinks. The human body is capable of waking itself up,  you are in a bad cycle if that's your morning routine. Also,  no energy drinks or coffee after 3pm and no cellphone, TV or computer after dark.  If you must use cell phone, turn brightness down and install an app which removes the blue light from your screen. Your brain is in day mode when  it sees that blue light. </p></div>		</li>
