<p>The FCC controls airwaves. In order to use any of the spectrum, that's not general public (there would be interference from everyone else with a two-way or ham radio), they need approval.</p>
<p>In order to broadcast in other countries, they would need approval from those countries FCC equivalents.</p>
<p>eg: The CRTC in canada. The crtc would fine spacex everyday they broadcast without purchasing some spectrum. (unless they use the general public range)</p></div>		</li>

<p>its the internet, so lets be specific.</p>
<p>Hes a verizon puppet, recommended by a republican minority leader, appointed to the FCC by a democratic president, confirmed unanimously by a democratic majority senate, appointed FCC chairman by a republican president hated by the republican establishment, and confirmed as chairman by a majority republican senate.</p>
<p>Ajit Pai is the fault of both democrats and republicans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's be more accurate. The FCC MUST maintain an even ratio of Dem and Rep with room for only 1 member or the chairperson being of the &quot;majority party&quot;. The intention of that rule was to <del>provide a sense of pride and accomplishment</del> keep the FCC from becoming too partisan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The FCC must have Democrats and Republicans on it.  He didn't have much power as a member.  He got his power from the Republicans when they made him chairman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If SpaceX wants to do business inside a country, they'll need regulatory approval from that country's relevant agencies.</p>
<p>Even if they weren't providing service to Americans, they need to get approval before launching a satellite from the US because a misplaced satellite could easily crash into another satellite and the resulting debris would cause untold havok on all the satellites in that orbit.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>they need to get approval before launching a satellite from the US because...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would that approval be from the fcc or some other governmental body like NASA? Or would they have to get approval from fcc <em>and</em> nasa because it's communications and civvy space stuff?</p>
<p>Lastly, with so many satellites from many different nations who decides what goes where?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not so much “countries make a deal” as “if spaceX wants to operate in XYZ country they have to apply for approval just like they would if it were non-satellite internet”. They only had to get US approval ahead of time because they’re a US company and/or plan to launch from the US, and that’s how the rules of launching satellites work, you get approval from your country. This is no different than A satellite TV company wanting to put up a satellite in that regard. </p>
<p>For other countries, SpaceX could apply to operate within their country, or other companies from those countries could also ask their country for permission to put up their own satellites for this purpose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple of added details I haven't seen here: he intends Starlink to be a peer to peer service rather than using IPv6 and the encryption would be end to end which could be much harder to hack.<br />
But to your question his approval is for the first 4k plus units which would be for the U.S. but he intends it to be global with over 12k satellites total.  Starlink is negotiating participation in most major countries but currently focused on China as it's been the more complicated country to deal with.<br />
<a href="http://fortune.com/2018/02/22/spacex-starlink-satellite-broadband/" target="_blank">Fortune</a> has a recent piece with some of this information including a video presentation and links to more comprehensive sources.</p></div>		</li>
