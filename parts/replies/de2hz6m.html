			<div class="markdown"><p>The Dark Ages is a myth and a misnomer from the so-called Enlightenment. There was no loss of scientific or scholarly advancement. In fact, philosophical developments were quite deepened by scholars and clerics like Saxo Grammaticus, Duns Scotus, Leodegarius, etc. Literally hundreds of figures people hardly know of. People just love to feel like they live in the best possible time so far and overcame a perceived obstacle.</p></div>		</li>
