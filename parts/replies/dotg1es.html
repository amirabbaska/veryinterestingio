			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin D is more complicated than you think.  We only get vitamin D from the sun if the UV index is above three.</p>
<p>We also don't absorb vitamin d from pills the same way.  To absorb it at the cellular level it needs to be from sunlight.  You can take Vitamin D pills your entire life and still suffer from deficiency.</p></div>		</li>
