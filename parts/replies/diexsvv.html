			<div class="markdown"><p>For me with something like Italian or Spanish, I speak French so many worlds are similar enough I can figure out their meaning, and effectively understand what's being said - but I barely know any Italian/Spanish words</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am just thinking here, but maybe it's partially because you can piece together an understanding of the whole sentence/paragraph if you just understand a decent portion of the words, along with the tone. To speak the language (effectively) you can't just piece together a bunch of words. You actually have to have all of the connecting words and conjugation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is correct. I speak both English and Spanish but I can understand a lot of French, italian and Portuguese, I think a lot has to do with the similarities between languages, and a lot of what you said. Our brains start piecing it together and we figure it out.</p>
<p>While I was learning Spanish, that's how I felt. I could always understand but I couldn't always speak it. To this day I still understand slightly better than I speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It's a bit like people that can read just fine but can't spell worth a damn. One skill is interpreting provided information while the other is recalling it on your own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand far more Spanish than I speak. This is because you are able to figure out much more than your vocabulary holds through context and cognates. </p></div>		</li>
