<p>Is there really a significant metabolic difference between say, a bat's immune system and a mouse's? I thought it was just a matter of any mutations breaking the mice's anticancer adaptations would be silent, since it hardly ever gets to be used anyway, so not selected against.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bats have one of the best immune systems of all animals. The reason why is not clearly known. But my hypothesis is that one they are small and take flight therefore they have a very high metabolic rate. Which helps fight off disease. Secondly, bats have altruistic behavior which means when one is starving they will regurgitate food and blood to species of their own kind. Blood transfer as we know it is one of the best ways of transferring diseases. So within a relatively small population most of the bats will be exposed to several different types of diseases. This will slowly build immunity within the population over time and those that survive the different diseases will proliferate. This is probably why bats can carry a shit ton of diseases and not die but can transfer all that shit to other animals. They are disease hosts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey guys, bat biologist here! You are missing something pretty important. While mice and bats can be of similar size, many bats hibernate or use torpor (lowering their metabolic rate and body temperature to save energy). This allows them to suppress the functioning of their organs as well as the need for constant intake of energy. When bats are sick (such as when they are infected with White-nose Syndrome) they tend to maintain a high, constant body temperature for longer to try to fight off the disease, or when they have offspring. Because bats have a very low metabolic rate when torpid and a low reproductive output (1-2 pups p/y) they may actually live longer than many r-selected animals.</p>
<p>There is a lot of research right now exploring how torpor actually lends itself to longevity and survival, such as after disasters or in relation to reproduction - it's been predicted that the use of torpor actually allowed bats and other heterotherms (animals that use torpor) to survive the K-Pg extinction (see Lovegrove et al. 2014)! Other work has shown that it's possible that telomere (the end-caps of chromosomes) length may also have something to with it (see Turbill et al. 2013 - not a paper on bats, but a paper on another heterotherm).</p>
<p>Also pretty important to mention that only a few species of bats share blood - the vampire bats! There are about 1300 species of bats in the world, of which only 3 are vampire bats. Most bats will eat insects, but some, such as Leptonycteris spp. (the agave bats that help bring Tequila to the table!) will also eat pollen/nectar</p>
<p>There are many reasons why an animal might live longer than another, although it is in the same class (i.e. Aves). 1) Body size 2) Metabolic rate 3) Related to #2 - Use of torpor or other energy-saving mechanisms 4) Reproductive output (animals that have many litters and many offspring in said litter use more energy doing so, and may have shorter life spans). These all contribute to the TOTAL energy expenditure over their lifetime. For example, finches are small and may lay a half dozen eggs, twice per year living around 10 years at a maximum. On the other hand, macaws are large and have only two to three eggs per year, and end up living a bit longer - about 50 years! Additionally, diet is pretty important - hummingbirds are small and use torpor, feed on nectar and insects and end up expending huge amounts of energy and have a seriously high heart rate. They only live about 5 years.</p>

<p>This is not a viable hypothesis. When transmission of a pathogen is easy and frequent, virulence is often higher, not lower (see cholera, influenza). One reason I know this is not the case, is some diseases spread socially annihilate entire bat populations quickly, e.g. white-nose syndrome. </p>
<p>Flight is probably key, but not just because of the boost in metabolism.. flight also raises their body temperatures enormously. Bats essentially get a high fever every day at zero metabolic cost (above what is already needed just to fly at all). O'Shea et al wrote about this in the journal of the Centers for Disease Control (I did collegiate review of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012789/" target="_blank">their paper</a>; and I published my own which suggests fever works partly by creating a second micro-ecology (a fever-temp body) different to the micro-ecology the pathogen had to be good at infiltrating when it showed up on you.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That all depends on the specific mutation, really. Since they're random, they can be all-good, all-bad, or some-good some-bad. Generally speaking there's no such thing as a free lunch, though, and while I'm not versed in the specific mechanisms that affect the energy consumption of an immune system, immune system activity does consume energy just like any other process. It's theoretically possible for a mutation to make the immune system more efficient instead of just larger and more powerful but 'hungrier,' but in a longer-lived species we'd expect to see both types of mutation selected for strongly. In shorter-lived species the more-efficient mutations would be selected for weakly but the bigger-hungrier mutations would actually be selected against because the increased metabolic load isn't worth the limited payoff.</p>
<p>Incidentally, doctors often recommend that patients eat more when they're trying to fight off an infection or prevent getting one during a period of increased risk (provided the infection doesn't have a specific negative interaction with the digestive tract) because the increased immune system activity costs more metabolically. Infections can be a huge problem for groups of people without access to enough food (the homeless and others who live in extreme poverty, many refugee groups, people who live/lived in areas struck by natural disasters, etc) because, in their hunger-weakened state, their immune system isn't getting enough energy to operate properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might follow the same idea as how things like homosexuality can be so prevalent (relatively), yet seemingly of little reproductive value: Old people help with life. Taking care of the kids, teaching skills, etc. Which makes the lives of people who have them around more successful than the lives of people who had their elderly die early, and thus the group of people who have old people is more likely to survive and reproduce than the group of people who don't, even though the old people aren't themselves reproducing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is the animal social or not?  </p>
<p>With humans (and social creatures in general), having somebody around who cannot breed can have many advantages that don't exist for solitary creatures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For wolves predation isn't much of a problem, but parasites are, and injuries sustained while hunting <em>definitely</em> are. While dogs don't necessarily face those same challenges, my guess is that their genetic makeup probably hasn't changed much in terms of ageing, since they aren't separated from wolves that far in evolutionary terms. </p></div>		</li>
