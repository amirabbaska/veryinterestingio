<p>To put this point home robots now have &quot;Teach by Demonstration&quot;. No more having to program g-code or define paths and test. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik6FjIXn8RI" target="_blank">Example with welding.</a> The user moves the arm just like they would make a weld recording points and the system will handle everything. This is available for a wide range of robots where instead of telling a person to do something you show the robot to pick up the item and hold it while another robot welds or spot welds and this can be set up rapidly for a production line.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know what your robotics background is, but this is nothing new. I've used Fanuc robots that are 10+ years old and are capable of &quot;point to point&quot; programming. Even if it isn't guiding it with your hand (which is probably no faster), you can tap two locations and it will automatically find the fastest route without collision. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it’s only storing the paths and following them. Give it a different piece of metal and it would fail.</p>
<p>It’s not building a machine learning model (it’s not “training” in the machine learning sense of the word). </p>
<p>Machine learning would be programming (or “showing”) the machine lots of different welding joints and then having the robot “know” where welding joints should be placed and how strong they should be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>background: i enjoy writing bots to play games. i use screen grabbing + computer vision &amp; key/mouse sends to do this. i have a degree in english &amp; i'm pretty old. all the programming &amp; machine learning stuff has been self-taught.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It basically takes an engineering degree, sorry to say. I started as a controls engineer about 6 months ago after graduating in chemical engineering. Everybody in my office has degrees in either chemical engineering, electrical engineering, or computer science. Except one guy, but he worked for the company that develops the software we use for decades before coming over. I work for one of the big companies that does this stuff. We're working on the control system for a large chemical plant being built</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't listen to this guy. Programming is fairly easy - being self taught is more valuable than going to school. And Machine Learning/AI really isn't as hard as it sounds either.</p>
<p>This is coming from a guy who did exactly what you did - I programmed bots for video games at 14. Although I now have a CIS degree, it doesn't help me. Dive in, You don't need a degree.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without a degree, you would have to know someone on the inside or do something clever. We have people on our team without engineering degrees but they &quot;grew up&quot; in the industry.</p>
<p>The best candidate I ever interviewed had professional reports of all of the systems he's built. If you're going to do a bunch of projects, I would recommend you take them all the way to deployment and then do a write-up. Once you have a few under your belt, hit up indeed.com and see what pops. If you want to start doing stuff in the phsycial world, test and measurement might be a good fit for you.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same profession. Yes, and it's in many ways already happening. A lot of my job is to try and create automated ways of doing my own job.</p>
<p>There's just a <em>lot</em> of problems to solve. If you automated all the things spent last week doing so it happened instantly, I'd still have easily been able to fill a week of other work.</p>
<p>Data science is a tempting thing to automate because the people working are in short supply so it's expensive, and it's done on a computer with data so that side is all automatable.</p>
<p>The other side of the field is probably the harder part, it's acting as an interface between the machines and the humans. <em>What</em> to optimise is something that requires domain expertise, for example. Understanding the tradeoffs, choosing the right process and working with people to ensure the right things go into the algo (or that they even have those things available).</p>
<p>Building layers on top of what I do to remove the cruft makes that easier though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the one you asked but I'm an EE turned Data Scientist. I actually hate the term Data Scientist but that's another post. Anyhoo my EE career involved a lot of software development doing signal processing and signal processing algorithm development. Basically software to solve hard math problems. At some point I realized my statistics and math background wasn't good enough to do more creative signal work (turns out the FFT response kinda sucks) so I went to school at night for an Applied Math Masters degree.  Then all of a sudden I became a beautiful unicorn. Well not really, but I did quit my old job to do non EE code with big data and stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have unbridled passion. Every single night take your laptop, and your best friend, and go to the bar. Program until your heart is sore. Write algorithms that automate your daily tasks. Explore mathematical edifices. Then when you feel strong in Python, go to a Data Science Training camp. Then you will baaaarely be able to get a DS job, but you will get it. Keep studying statistics. Be willing to work for startups for no pay. Move into a big coastal city. Network.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really what OP is reading about. I sell data analytics software and the key here is really to automate parts or all of a process. Self service ordering kiosks are a great example. Walking up to a food market and not needing a person to work a register is saving companies significant amounts of money. Robots that great you at Home Depot is another great example. Sure the robot is hardware, but it's the software that made it possible. </p></div>		</li>
