So we are all drinking acid (not quite because it breaks down as soon as you pop that bottle, but still)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember back in the '80s, Mr. Wizard did a demonstration where he had cylinders of water and universal indicator, and he added dry ice. Over time, the color of the cylinders drifted from blue or green, to yellow or orange, indicating that carbon dioxide dissolved in water will in fact create carbonic acid enough to change the pH a detectable amount.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding Nitrogen, this will not &quot;carbonate&quot; (i know its not carbonating, but rather making it bubbly with nitrogen) drinks. When used in nitro beer/coffee/whatever, there is also CO2 in the nitro mixture. The reason they use nitro is because it allows the beverage tank to be at a higher pressure but still have the same amount of carbonation (vols of co2).</p>
<p>When utilizing Nitro taps, there is a metal disc in the tap that has tiny holes in it to break up the CO2 bubbles, and the beverage tank needs a lot more pressure to push it through those tiny holes. :)</p>
<p>source: i am a homebrewer. </p>
<p>for Nitro not &quot;carbonating&quot; beverages, i have only tested this at home manageable pressures. I am not sure if it will make the drink bubbly at something ridiculous like 5000 PSI</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some of the CO2 in the drink forms carbonic acid.</p>

<p>Does that mean drinking sparkling water is bad for my teeth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the sparkling water in question and how carbonate it is, but yes, it is acidic and is as bad for your teeth as carbonated pop. Well, sugar aside. </p></div>		</li>
