			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's a thing that can happen by accident. The actual gland is something you can feel behind your jaw bone, right where it has that angle.  You have several pairs in different places. </p>
<p>They can get blocked by infection which is rather uncomfortable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 main salivary glands to be exact, parotid ( front of ear), sublingual and submandibular. The sublingual is the most common culprit in regards to making a fountain, sometimes the submandibular too. The parotid opens on the upper jaw, so no squirting from there.</p></div>		</li>
