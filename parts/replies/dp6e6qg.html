			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's basing it off materials and things we already know to exist, what if there's something we haven't discovered yet that just mimics the same result of another material that we <em>do</em> know about?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Science is about telling the most accurate, most predictive stories we can about the world. We advance science when we find better and better stories, or develop new tools to tell better stories. But it is not finding &quot;the truth&quot;. We just want to approximate the truth as well as we can, and so we're bound to be wrong in all sorts of ways.</p>
<p>There isn't a better system for understanding the world than science though, so we have to take the faults as they come.</p>
<p>Which is to say: Maybe you're right and that is the case, but unless we can come up with some way to test for that we just have to accept the possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how we discover lots of new things, actually!</p>
<p>The Neutrino was discovered kind of like this. Scientists measured the energy that comes out of certain radioactive processes (when atoms break into pieces) and decided that there was too little energy coming out.</p>
<p>And then someone said &quot;what if there's a tiny amount of energy coming out in the form of a particle travelling almost the speed of light and which behaves like this and like this and like this? That would be undetectable to us, but then the math works out entirely&quot;.</p>
<p>Then scientists sat down and figured out how to detect this probably almost undetectable particle travelling at almost the speed of light. And they found it! It's there! And now the math works out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a question we could ask about everything. What if this thing only <em>looks</em> and <em>behaves</em> as if it were a thing but it is secretly a different thing?! Eventually you just have to apply Occam's Razor: if all the evidence suggests X, then it's probably X, rather than something that isn't X but has all the qualities of X.</p></div>		</li>
