			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: Reuters doesn't make its money from its news reporting. It makes its money selling near-instant stock (and other) market data to large banks and investors.</p>
<p>Source: Worked for Reuters' Client Site Services, installing big iron, usually redundant high speed data systems at banks and investment firms. And sometimes also their remote Disaster Recovery Centers where they had an extra one of everything. At each one.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow. Inboxsplosion. Let me address some common themes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I didn't mean to say that Reuters makes <em>no</em> money off news or that they don't charge for it. I was given the impression though that the market data side at least partially subsidized or buffered the news effort. I don't know the pricing details, since I worked on the data side. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like Bloomberg, Reuters' news offerings are considered a value add to their market data offerings. IIRC certain market data plans include news or some set of news (flash only, for example). Even from the beginning, as some have pointed out, Mr. Reuter did send news about war and what not over the stock market ticker feed. But that's partly (if not wholly) because that sort of news does have an impact on markets, and the faster you can get such news to your customers, the sooner they can make strategic decisions about their investments. For example, if you are able to get news to your customers about Napoleon being defeated and the Napoleonic wars coming to an end sooner than anyone else, your customers can decide whether to start / stop trading in French stocks, etc., and do it sooner than anyone else, thus benefit from the margin. For example, if everyone's going to start buying up Vivendi stock after they hear about Napoleon's defeat, you can buy it earlier, before the rush drives the price up, which means you make more money. The amount of benefit you can get from earlier knowledge is so significant that it's illegal in the US (and probably most developed countries) to make market trades based on knowledge that isn't yet public (&quot;insider trading&quot;). And also to some extent why certain investment companies are ever on the hunt for millisecond or even nanosecond faster connections to the stock market. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;afaik it hasn't penetrated the U.S. market that deeply. At least in NY and Boston Bloomberg is the gold standard.&quot; Since I worked in Reuters CSS in Boston, I'm going to disagree. Most Boston firms buy two of everything in my experience. Hell, I even did an install at Bryant College. I recall doing an evening install at a small investment firm in the JH where they had brought in me, a Bloomberg install (their techs were basically floppy jockeys), and a Bridge tech (this is when Bridge was the successor to DJ's Telerate). FWIW, back then, Bloomberg was still terminal based. If you wanted your trader to have access to Bloomberg, you had to set up a separate computer on their desk -- the Bloomberg Terminal. Whereas Reuters was all backend and you could run from a variety of frontends including Kobra, Effix, and a few other things. Even a web interface with Reuters Bladerunner (don't look at me, I didn't name it). Eventually Bloomberg caught on and started (AFAIK) building and offering a client-neutral service.</p>
</li>
<li>It wasn't always Big Iron, but that's the direction they were going with their most advanced product. We would install two IBM RS6000s (you only really needed one, but the other was for redundancy, because big banks don't fuck around) on site. I would carry them on a hand cart from State St to e.g. International Place through the downtown streets -- it wasn't until years later I found out just how much money I was basically yanking over the potholes. The other major install I did was Triarch, which was a messy, crazy, but apparently carefully crafted stack of extremely heterogenous servers. There was the AMS, which was basically no HDD and full of memory, running some weird OS (ActiveUnix?), serving as a data cache; there was a PC running QNX that served as a router into the Reuters data network, for supplementary services, there was the licensing server which ran on SunOS iirc, and then there was the big monster that actually served the data that ran on I don't remember what. We also usually had to install a TxPort CSU where we would define the number of channels on the T1 that were for data -- so out of 24 T1 channels, there'd be 20 inbound-only for the data, and one or two others for the backchannel and interactive stuff. And yes, usually we installed two. Usually they had two T1s, coming from different companies (I don't even know if you can do that anymore what with the telecom mess of the past ten years), so they'd have a NYNEX T1 and an MCI T1. You know, just in case. Also most of these machines had dual power supplies -- just in case -- and it was recommended to plug each one into a separate building power circuit -- just in case.</li>

<p>With remote DRC-s you just need to have program installed, but you still use one licence both in normal workstation and that remote one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Associated Press and Reuters do not necessarily have reporters all around the world, like the above comment suggests.</p>
<p>Both organizations are wire services. So, local news organizations subscribe to the Associated Press wire service and can run AP copy in their newspapers. In exchange, the AP can pull stories from those local newspapers and run it on the wire, allowing other newspapers in the world to print those stories in their newspaper. It's kind of like a massive story exchange. </p>
<p>So, for instance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch writes a story about the riot in Ferguson, Mo. Since the St. Louis newspaper is part of the AP wire service, the AP can strip the St. Louis Post-Dispatch story's byline, slap an AP wire service byline on it, and put it up on the wire, where it can be republished by newspapers around the world for free. </p>
<p>That being said, an actual AP reporter will probably be in Ferguson in a day or two and will begin writing daily copy for the wire service, but for breaking news, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch will be supplying the first few stories. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know if Reuters has that many full-time reporters or if they just have a giant contact network of local reporters who also file stories to Reuters when something noteworthy happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's a subscription model. You coudl fill up your whole paper with reuters stories if all your local reporters were sick.</p>
<p>I worked for a newspaper in Australia where we have something called Australian Associated Press (AAP) which is like a local version of AP. They cover everything. Everything. If you go to a shitty press conference, there's always the AAP guy there. It's not seen as very prestigious as they pay is a bit low and they don't get bylines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The AP has member news organizations who pay dues/fees, negotiated based on what content the news organization needs, its size location media, etc. It is a two way street where a member is getting and supplying stories/video to and from AP. Which how AP has a story pretty much anywhere anything happens in the world/U.S. </p>
<p>If an event happens somewhere AP has no corespondent AP picks up the 'copy' from a local source and moves to the web/wire. Sometimes they move the copy unedited directly with no edits citing the source news org as author. Usually it is rewritten and the original source is cited at the bottom of the article/end of the video clip. </p>
<p>Other wires including Reuters operate similarly to AP with some difference in business model.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a very important point: they do not always take the stories <em>verbatim</em> from reuters or AP. They are often edited if the original text does not suit the angle that the agency wants. </p>
