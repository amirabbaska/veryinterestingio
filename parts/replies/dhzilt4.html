<li>The lunch program is a rough proxy for poverty, but the explosion in the number of needy children in the nationâ€™s public classrooms is a recent phenomenon.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a couple people that only have children for tax purposes. This woman I know mother-in-law claims her kids every year. Tax season is the only time the mom in law has juvenile kids :P The woman doesn't work and her husband is a dead beat dad to some other kids and will never get another tax return in his life. That's why they have other people claim the children. I didn't tell the the IRS is scrutinizing the EIC extra this year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's not exactly &quot;having children for tax purposes.&quot; That's tax fraud.  Also the Child Tax Credit isn't the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p>
<p>I don't think you'd find that the people involved in this scenario chose to get pregnant so that they could commit tax fraud.  Frankly, you don't need real children to fabricate tax forms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LOL. I know. I'm hoping they get caught. And yeah, whenever I hear about how some people just have kids for any kind of govt benefit I usually roll my eyes and quit listening to whoever's making that claim.</p></div>		</li>
