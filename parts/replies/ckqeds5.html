			<div class="markdown"><p>Lawyer here. While he may be overdoing it by saying &quot;if the government tries to stop the merger from happening, they will fail&quot;, throwing man hours at a case can definitely make it better. 99.99% of what a lawyer does is not standing in front of a judge and having an argument with him, which is done by 1 lawyer. The overwhelming majority of it is fact finding and trying to put together the best case possible on paper. 100 lawyers looking for facts and creating the best possible legal arguments on paper is far better than 2 lawyers. </p>
<p>About 5 years ago I was one of a 100 or so attorneys working for an airline on one of the biggest proposed mergers in the world that was being challenged by the government. My job was to manage about 30 other attorneys who were simply reviewing truckloads documents trying to find good facts. Or they are reviewing truckloads of documents that we are ordered to hand over to the government looking for (a) bad facts, and (b) valid legal reasons why we shouldn't have to hand it over after all (like it's privileged, or work product, or outside the scope of the request/order for documents, or whatever). If they didn't have 100 attorneys, they'd just have to hand over all the documents without really reviewing them since 1 or 2 attorneys can't possibly do that kind of work. And then documents with &quot;bad facts&quot; get through, helping the government's case.</p>
<p>Does that make more sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes... because it's not because the government can't out-lawyer them, it's that they don't care/want to. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup, the government only has near-infinite resources when it comes to killing people in the middle east or listening to everyone's phone conversations... </p>
<p>Can we stop pretending that it's that way because of anything but choice? </p></div>		</li>
