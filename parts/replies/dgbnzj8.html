<p>Honestly, I did this for a living for 15 years and you usually have to look it up each time.  Chemical naming can be quirky and if you don't have it memorized it is best to look it up.  There are rules of thumb like Arcaeca says but the list with look slightly different for each central atom.  (Cl, Br, I, S, Se, N, P, etc).</p>
<p>Like he said.... </p>
<p>-ide is the anion.  No extra O's</p>
<p>-ate is the usually the most common complex containing extra O's.  The most stable.  The number of O's may be different for each atom in the middle.  -NO3, -SO4, etc.</p>
<p>-ite is one less -O than -ate.  Less common, less stable</p>
<p>If you need more then you can add hypo- and per- prefixes in the order as above but you're getting more quirky and less stable.  A few of these are not super rare (perchlorate) but definitely in the area where you shouldn't feel bad for looking things up.</p></div>		</li>
