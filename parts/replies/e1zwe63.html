			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good answer.  One thing though: center of mass in air isn't always equal to the center of buoyancy.  Submarine for example...</p>
<p>Doesn't have much of a bearing on the question OP is asking about, but figured I'd clarify where the buoyancy force acts.</p>
<p>Your description is correct in that it says the center of the displaced fluid.  That is the definition of center of buoyancy.  </p></div>		</li>
