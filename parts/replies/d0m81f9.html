			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the experiment, but many times a condition on receiving [public] funding is that there is some timescale on which the data must be released to the public. Taking the example of Planck, specifically, the Planck Legacy Archive is where you'd go to find many of their data product. (i.e. maps <a href="http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#maps" target="_blank"><a href="http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#maps" target="_blank">http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#maps</a></a>).</p>
<p>In the case of the BICEP/Keck collaboration, they provide various data products via their website (<a href="http://bicepkeck.org/" target="_blank"><a href="http://bicepkeck.org/" target="_blank">http://bicepkeck.org/</a></a>) and have had some data (namely that of the BK/Planck cross-collaborative work) included with the widely used tool CosmoMC (<a href="https://github.com/cmbant/CosmoMC/tree/master/data/BKPlanck" target="_blank"><a href="https://github.com/cmbant/CosmoMC/tree/master/data/BKPlanck" target="_blank">https://github.com/cmbant/CosmoMC/tree/master/data/BKPlanck</a></a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to the specifics of this particular research, however, this general concept - release of data and method to the public - is an ongoing and important debate in science today. While most major publications require the release of all data and methodology for publication, not all journals require that; furthermore, only a few publications require publications of computer code (which has become an increasingly important part of scientific research).</p>
<p>There are several efforts to require that publications in scientific journals require publication of not just data and methodology, but also code. I strongly support these efforts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can certainly make that moral argument, but withholding data is quite common. In my field it's standard practice not to publish raw data, and in fact some (most?) major experimental collaborations won't even provide the data if you ask for it.</p>
<p>People have a wide variety of opinions on sharing &quot;raw materials&quot; like data. Some scientists are worried about the competitive advantage they're giving other groups by releasing raw data. Some want to be able to track who has the data so they know how much of an impact their research is making and who the other major players in the field are. A lot of scientists are justifiably worried about what someone who doesn't understand the true meaning of the data will do with it. (I don't really think any of these are valid reasons for withholding data.) In other cases it's a scale problem; there's simply too much raw data to transfer anywhere else.</p></div>		</li>
