			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't this depend on the end use of the carbon though? Grasses may fix it well, but are then grazed where it is quickly returned as methane and Co2. While trees might be less efficient but store it for longer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the case. The great plains are an example of former grasslands that have extensive carbon stored in their soils. The great plains were grazed by buffalo for millenia and they were still able to create great stores of carbon. </p>
<p>Check out the carbon content on soils in Iowa and parts of Minnesota. Those high carbon soils make it one of the best places in the world to grow corn, which is a grass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that may be true, can you compare it to the carbon stored in peat bogs, or forest floors for example?</p>
<p>I don't know the answer, just asking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I doubt those trees can store it for 35 million years. The overall turnover (grow, sequester, store, die, return) of the carbon is equivalent when you look at it long term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the efficiency of conversion makes no difference, only the eventual storage. The coal we are burning today was formed in an unusual cycle of sequestration. Most carbon just gets recycled as you say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, most indoor air quality issues are not related to CO2. There was a NASA study on which plants improve indoor air quality, if you google you can find infographics of the results.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The NASA Clean Air Study[1] was led by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in association with the Associated Landscape Contractors of America (ALCA). Its results suggest that certain common indoor plants may provide a natural way of removing toxic agents such as benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene from the air, helping neutralize the effects of sick building syndrome.[...]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My question would be does it work to store the carbon?  Grasses decompose much faster than trees which would seem to be a better carbon sink. Another interesting option is Azola, which caused an extinction event due to its ability as a carbon sink.</p></div>		</li>
