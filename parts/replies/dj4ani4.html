			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally agree with the association with filth part. And I would also speculate that, nowadays western cultures are probably more used to eating “meat”, while try to forget that it is actually an animal. So you may feel disgusted with this<a href="https://www.google.com.hk/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fassets.simplyrecipes.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2008%2F02%2Fchicken-feet-stock-640-horiz.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplyrecipes.com%2Frecipes%2Fhow_to_make_stock_from_chicken_feet%2F&amp;docid=G5oyYXVIozT-hM&amp;tbnid=KPCn7oXtKCwj3M%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwiq5I2snMzUAhXDoZQKHZDnAR0QMwiGASgCMAI..i&amp;w=640&amp;h=427&amp;hl=en-gb&amp;client=safari&amp;bih=626&amp;biw=375&amp;q=chicken%20feet&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq5I2snMzUAhXDoZQKHZDnAR0QMwiGASgCMAI&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8" target="_blank">chicken feet, for example,</a> but feel totally ok with a piece of chicken breast. </p>
<p>In the case of insects, most likely they will be presented to the table with shells, etc. This clearly reminds us of its original animal form (which our ancestors also teach us to avoid them because of its association with disease, rotten food, etc. )</p>
<p>And that will probably explain while in some areas, insects are less rejected for consumption, for example, Certain Asian countries. The culture there usually accepts more “animal-like” food on the dining table, which can be seen in their cuisines </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, it is a large combination of factors. In the modern world I think a cultural disgust plays a big role in why it hasn't gained a footing. However I think overall the lack of farming and that in most of the &quot;western&quot; regions they just were never even opportunistic foods. I think mostly because there just weren't that many bugs worth eating in those regions (not to mention none in the winter). They just weren't plentiful enough, tasty enough or nutritious enough for us to bother with. after enough years of that those cultures just don't see them as a food source to begin with. The disgust comes later and kinda keeps it that way.</p>
<p>I think if it was more an issue of disgust and not of abundance and value we would likely see prohibitions in the Bible/Quran about not consuming bugs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but many cultures around the world do... even in large global societies. grub as food is common in africa, asia and south america as well as the popular french escargot and the nearly ubiquitous sea bugs prawn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but Europe doesn't have many insects, relatively. It's further north, so a lot of insects and arachnids aren't able to survive there. As a result, people in those regions 2000 years ago would have only seen large amount of insects when something was rotting, which as the original commenter said, is naturally disgusting to humans. North America by default is the same, since the settlers brought that culture and habits with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's not though? insects were and still are common in some native american cuisines as well as in mexican (chapulinee for example).</p>
<p>i get the sentiment, but it's a myopic perspective. the question is why don't humans normally consume bugs when in fact, most of us do. and if we go more in depth and purist, bugs are a pervasive though implicit part of american cuisine. we just choose to ignore just how much of them we consume daily.</p></div>		</li>
