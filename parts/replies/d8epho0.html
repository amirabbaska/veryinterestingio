			<div class="markdown"><p>And even if the distance is long enough for the center of gravity to be outside of the bowling ball (larger than ~1 km), the radius of the circle the bowling ball would make is always about 4850 times smaller than the radius of the marble (assuming a 1.5 gram marble) - which makes it negligible regardless of whether the center of gravity is inside the bowling ball or outside of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little confused by this, I sketched it out bc I'm crap at explaining, but why does image 3 not happen? Because surely the centre of gravity of both bodies changes with the movement of the secondary object, thus meaning the point of rotation is for all intents and purposes, the centre of the primary body? I know something more like image 4 happens, but I'm not sure why? thanks. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zkFVW6y.png" target="_blank">this is the sketch, red is Centre of Gravity of both objects, and the black/blue dots are respective centres of gravity</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting... what if you had two marbles orbiting the same bowling ball.  One on each side but not at the same altitude (as to not put the centre of gravity in the middle of the bowling ball) and at different speeds.    Would all three objects orbits the centre of gravity of the whole system?</p>
<p>What if you had a forth ball orbiting twice the distant as the rest of the balls? The centre of gravity would keep switching as the balls lined up.</p>
<p>Could you or I put these orbits into an equation? </p>
<p>I'm ready to go down the rabbit hole!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on if the orbits are sufficiently large. If the marbles are too close to each other, they star screwing each other up.</p>
<p>This is a classical n-body problem. For 2 bodies, there's always an exact solution for the orbit so that the bodies either hit each other, find a stable orbit, or fling each other to infinity. This just depends on their initial kinetic energy. There's a finite amount of potential energy between two bodies holding them together, exceed that with KE and they will just fly till infinity. Counterintuitive (you'd intuitively expect the gravitational force to <em>eventually</em> turn it around) but that's really the case. If you leave faster than the escape velocity, the gravity never manages to bring you back.</p>
<p>For 3 or more bodies, things get complicated. There are only exact and stable solutions in some specific cases, such as 2 bodies of identical mass orbiting a 3rd at the same radius opposite to each other. Otherwise you can't get a simple equation, and have to simulate the orbits step by step.</p>
<p>Orbits of different radii might be approximately stable if they are far away from each other and don't affect each other in a significant way (like the Solar System). Then you can solve the equations as you would for two body problems - just approximate (pretend) that the third marble doesn't exist. If two bodies are too close to each other, one can even fling the other out of the system entirely. This is known as a <em>pole swing.</em></p>
<p>Usually multiple body systems are not stable at the beginning, but they stabilize over time as more bodies are flung out and the remaining ones find stable orbits where they aren't affected by others. The early Solar System had a lot of chaos like that. </p>
<p>Clusters of newborn stars are another good example. They are more like a big group of bowling balls, as there's no clear &quot;big central ball + smaller balls&quot; hierarchy. The systems start off chaotic - many of the stars simply get hurled away. But most end up in twin star systems so close that their gravity resembles that of a single body.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I'm wrong (as I said I definitely could have been); see the post below mine.</p>
<p>Because the mass of the bowling ball is much, much larger (~7.26kg) than that of the marble (~0.0015kg) we can assume that for all intents and purposes the marble will move toward the bowling ball and the bowling ball will be stationary. </p>
<p>The acceleration due to gravity for the marble would be G<em>7.26kg/r^2, with a minimum distance between their centers of mass of about 1 bowling ball radius, or ~10.8cm=0.108m. We would want the average acceleration over the duration of the motion (because it's changing as r decreases), so let's assume an initial distance between their centers of mass of 5 bowling ball radii (or 0.54m), and integrate from r=0.54m to r=0.108m. We then want to divide this by the total distance, 0.432m. We get an average acceleration of -8.308</em>10^-9 m/s/s.</p>
<p>From the projectile motion for displacement, ∆x=vt-0.5at^2, where v=0 and a=-8.308*10^-9 and ∆x=0.432m. Solve for t, and we get t≈10200 seconds, or about 2.83 hours.</p>
<p>(Somebody feel free to correct me, I just woke up so I wouldn't be surprised if I made a massive error somewhere)</p>
<p>tl;dr ~2.83 hours (from a distance of 5 bowling ball radii, anyway)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how it works, you cannot calculate the average acceleration along the path, and then use the equation for motion at constant acceleration. </p>
<p>This problem is solved by writing down the equation of motion, r'' = -GM/r^2, where the prime (') indicates a derivative with respect to time. This is a second order nonlinear differential equation, not so straightforward to solve. The solution that we are looking for (with initial conditions of zero velocity) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_fall#Inverse-square_law_gravitational_field" target="_blank">the t(y) equation here</a>. For this particular case we want to substitute y0=0.54 m (distance between the marble and ball), y=0.108 m (radius of ball), μ = G (7.26 kg).</p>
<p>Edit: Calculating, it would be about 5h, 20min, 12s</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bowling ball weighs 16 pounds (~7.26 Kg), assuming marble weighs 1.5 grams.</p>
<p>For all practical purposes, the bowling ball can be regarded as stationary - for r = 5R the circle the bowling ball would make is of radius ~(0.0015/7.26)*5R which is approximately 0.1mm, which is negligible compared to the approx 0.5 meter radius of the marble.</p>
<p>So the equation of motion is v = sqrt(GM/r), plug in r = 0.55 meters, M = 7.26 Kg, G = 6.67*10^-11 and you'd get 29 micrometers per second, so it'd take it about 33 hours to complete one revolution.</p>
<p>EDIT: changed radius of bowling ball from 22cm to 11cm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty simple: For a circular orbit, the following relation between velocity and orbital radius holds:</p>
<p>v = sqrt( M G / r )</p>
<p>where v is the velocity, M is the mass of the central object, G is the Newtonian constant of gravity and r is the radius of the orbit (measured from the center of the central object to the center of the orbiting object).</p>
<p>Substitute the mass of the bowling ball and the desired orbital radius and you'll find the required velocity.</p></div>		</li>
