			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I'm wrong (as I said I definitely could have been); see the post below mine.</p>
<p>Because the mass of the bowling ball is much, much larger (~7.26kg) than that of the marble (~0.0015kg) we can assume that for all intents and purposes the marble will move toward the bowling ball and the bowling ball will be stationary. </p>
<p>The acceleration due to gravity for the marble would be G<em>7.26kg/r^2, with a minimum distance between their centers of mass of about 1 bowling ball radius, or ~10.8cm=0.108m. We would want the average acceleration over the duration of the motion (because it's changing as r decreases), so let's assume an initial distance between their centers of mass of 5 bowling ball radii (or 0.54m), and integrate from r=0.54m to r=0.108m. We then want to divide this by the total distance, 0.432m. We get an average acceleration of -8.308</em>10^-9 m/s/s.</p>
<p>From the projectile motion for displacement, ∆x=vt-0.5at^2, where v=0 and a=-8.308*10^-9 and ∆x=0.432m. Solve for t, and we get t≈10200 seconds, or about 2.83 hours.</p>
<p>(Somebody feel free to correct me, I just woke up so I wouldn't be surprised if I made a massive error somewhere)</p>
<p>tl;dr ~2.83 hours (from a distance of 5 bowling ball radii, anyway)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how it works, you cannot calculate the average acceleration along the path, and then use the equation for motion at constant acceleration. </p>
<p>This problem is solved by writing down the equation of motion, r'' = -GM/r^2, where the prime (') indicates a derivative with respect to time. This is a second order nonlinear differential equation, not so straightforward to solve. The solution that we are looking for (with initial conditions of zero velocity) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_fall#Inverse-square_law_gravitational_field" target="_blank">the t(y) equation here</a>. For this particular case we want to substitute y0=0.54 m (distance between the marble and ball), y=0.108 m (radius of ball), μ = G (7.26 kg).</p>
<p>Edit: Calculating, it would be about 5h, 20min, 12s</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bowling ball weighs 16 pounds (~7.26 Kg), assuming marble weighs 1.5 grams.</p>
<p>For all practical purposes, the bowling ball can be regarded as stationary - for r = 5R the circle the bowling ball would make is of radius ~(0.0015/7.26)*5R which is approximately 0.1mm, which is negligible compared to the approx 0.5 meter radius of the marble.</p>
<p>So the equation of motion is v = sqrt(GM/r), plug in r = 0.55 meters, M = 7.26 Kg, G = 6.67*10^-11 and you'd get 29 micrometers per second, so it'd take it about 33 hours to complete one revolution.</p>
<p>EDIT: changed radius of bowling ball from 22cm to 11cm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty simple: For a circular orbit, the following relation between velocity and orbital radius holds:</p>
<p>v = sqrt( M G / r )</p>
<p>where v is the velocity, M is the mass of the central object, G is the Newtonian constant of gravity and r is the radius of the orbit (measured from the center of the central object to the center of the orbiting object).</p>
<p>Substitute the mass of the bowling ball and the desired orbital radius and you'll find the required velocity.</p></div>		</li>
