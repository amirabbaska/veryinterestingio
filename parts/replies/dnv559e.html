			<div class="markdown"><p>More than 88% correct but type of bacteria plays a huge role. The second a drop of water hits a surface, that impact instantly vaporizes whatever was on that surface, and sends it away from that surface.
Rain hits soil, soil bacteria is present.
Stagnant water has anaerobic types of bacteria harmful to humans. There's no splashing, and no injection of oxygen(antiseptic) when a barrel of water is just sitting there and you drink it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is slightly within the same vein. A housing development in my metro sits on top of former Kennecott copper mining land... You aren't allowed to grow your own food outside of regulated planters because it poses a risk to the public's health to consume them. The soil contains heavy metals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air can have NO2, SO2, other gases, or suspended particles; it's more common to have those near big cities and factories. When it rains, those chemicals react with water or the particles are trapped and carried down.
