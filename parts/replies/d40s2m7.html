<p>To put this in context an object like this would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sphere with a diameter of 3325.6 miles or 5352 km or about the distance between London and New York</li>

<li>79% of Mars</li>
<li>154% of the Moon</li>
<li>171.5% of Jupiter's moon Europa</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that his calculation is actually 2.676×10^6 meters (checkout his link), or 2676 kilometers. This means that all of your comparisons are a good bit off. For instance it would actually have a larger diameter than the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just some added context, but you need around 0.12 Earth masses to retain liquid water at the surface over the long term. So this substantially less than the mass required to keep a 25C ball of water from gradually evaporating into space over a few tens of millions of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the scale were looking at (a blob of water comparable to the size of the world), I'd be very surprised if a constant density assumption would be valid. Similarly I'd think that at the pressures that would be reached, temperature variation would start to play an effect. And finally I think it would be very questionable to Navier Stokes when you're outside of the fluid regime and at the pressures in question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the level of water we see, that's not unreasonable for sure. The difference between the density on the surface of the sea and Marianas trench (11km) is about 5%. But at several orders of magnitude more depth (3 by OPs calculationsl), and thus many orders of magnitude more mass (9), this becomes far less valid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For most situations you're doing hand calcs on, it makes sense to consider water as incompressible as it makes it a lot easier, but for a sphere of water with a 10^6 m radius, it's a whole new scale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compressibility is the fractional change in volume per unit increase in pressure. For each atmosphere increase in pressure, the volume of water would decrease 46.4 parts per million.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's where I'm a little iffy:</p>
<p>1GPa = 9869 atm</p>
<p>So the water should compress  46.4 * 9869 / 1E6 , 45%?  That's assuming its compression rate is linear (bad assumption)</p>
<p>That doesn't make much sense someone please correct me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incompressible for practical purposes and situations we find on the surface of the earth.  For each atmosphere increase in pressure, a given volume of water will decrease by 46.4 parts per million.  At a pressure of 1GPa as discussed above (about 10,000atm), you're looking at a compression of 464,000 parts per million or about 46% which is pretty significant (if we have a linear scale, which I think we still would at this pressure, since the bulk modulus of water is about 2.2GPa).  At the bottom of the ocean, there is about a 2% decrease in water volume due to pressure (about 40MPa).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anything, that solution assumes an unrealistically cold core. All the water in that recently discovered space-cloud is currently spread out. Were it to coalesce under gravitational attraction, all that gravitational potential energy would convert into heat (~4000-10000 °C). It's the same reason most planets start off molten; you don't go from a bunch of small objects to one big objects without a lot of high-energy collisions. And the water wouldn't necessarily boil off either, as gravity would keep any vapor around as an &quot;atmosphere&quot; (though this would keep the surface of the planet pretty cool).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd say an unrealistically <strong>hot</strong> core. All that heat would be radiated away very quickly, in planetary time scales.</p>
<p>Since OP didn't mention a time scale in his question, one would assume time enough to reach a stable equilibrium, which means the background temperature of the universe, which is a bit under 3 K.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I did a rather rough calculation of the gravitational binding energy of the whole thing (which is a fairly huge overestimation of what a &quot;space-cloud&quot; would give off), and its only enough to heat the water by ~300K (or C).</p>
<p>It'll be hot, but not super hot.</p></div>		</li>
