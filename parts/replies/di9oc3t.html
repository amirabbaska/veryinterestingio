			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah, this is really simple, and even helps explain negative exponents.  to get from n^0 to n^-1 you divide be n, and since n^0 = 1, n^-1 = 1/n, and 1^-2 = 1/n/n = 1/n^2.  </p>
<p>Thanks for clearing that up as well!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Formatting tip for the future - put a double space on a line to have the next line come out on a new line.  </p>
<p>That way your post will look like:  </p>
<p>It follows from: n^a <em> n^b = n^(a+b)<br />
n^a </em> n^0 = n^(a+0) = n^a<br />
So n^0 = 1    </p>
<p>Another way to look at it is to follow the pattern:<br />
To get from n^5 to n^4 we divide by n<br />
To get from n^4 to n^3 we divide by n<br />
To get from n^3 to n^2 we divide by n<br />
To get from n^2 to n^1 we divide by n<br />
And finally to get from n^1 to n^0 we divide by n.<br />
But n^1 = n, and n/n = 1. So n^0 = 1  </p>

<p>Hope that helped for anyone that had issues reading the answer.</p></div>		</li>
