			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you're absolutely right.  Chances are we will see more interstellar objects as solar system surveys get more sensitive: not only will we see them as they pass through the inner solar system, but hopefully we'll see them on approach so we have more time to prepare observations and potential encounters. The fact that we saw this one object means that as our surveys become more sensitive, as they cover more of the sky, and as computerized detection techniques become better able to discriminate small signals, we'll see more visiting objects from elsewhere in the galaxy. </p></div>		</li>
