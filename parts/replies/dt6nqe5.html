			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok this is interesting. For burning prograde / retrograde I indeed assumed either the orbit was perfectly circular or I was burning at apoapis or periapsis. The same goes for normal/anti-normal.</p>
<p>But I did not register that for radial in/out, thanks for the reminder.
Still have some questions then: if I understand correct what you said, burning normal/antinormal at anti-nodes won't incline the orbit plane much, but it change the position of the ascending and descending nodes. Is it used in practice? For instance to position the ascending and descending nodes at apoapsis and periapsis to make the burn more efficient?<br />
Hoes does it compare in efficiency?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In practice small mid-course correction burns may occur near anti-nodes, and in order to satisfy the rendezvous constraints it may utilize an out of plane component, yes.</p>
<p>You are correct in that nodes are generally placed near major burns to be more efficient in eliminating the out-of-plane velocity through root-sum-squaring it to an already large in-plane deltaV. However, particularly for problems with constrained arrival times, some burns are not lined up with apogee or perigee. You burn when you need to burn to get there when you need to get there.</p></div>		</li>
