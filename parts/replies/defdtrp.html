			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - it's always easier to lose weight initially because the calories that you cut/burn are a bigger proportion of your &quot;bonus energy&quot; for the day, after you spend your &quot;just staying alive&quot; energy.  Eventually, it gets harder and harder to diet off or burn away more calories, because your base &quot;just staying alive&quot; needs go down and it becomes easier for energy in to equal energy out.</p></div>		</li>
