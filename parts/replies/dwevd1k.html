			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of my favorites. David Simberloff killed off entire islands in the Florida Keys to determine natural rates of colonization and extinction of islands. I seem to remember that he also destroyed entire islands, but I cannot see it mentioned in this article.

<p>Depending on population size, they probably have a fairly diffrent allele freaquency now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more of a descriptive study, so it doesn't have a hypothesis it is testing like most of the papers in modern scientific journals (although I wish there were more). </p>
<p>Anyways, it comes up with a model of how species colonize new islands. They show that the number of species on an island over time follows a sigmoid (s-shaped) curve related to the individual invasion rates (frequency of colonization during a single time unit) and extinction rates (frequency of loss of all individuals for a species during a single time unit) summed over the entire species pool (e.g. all species in the area that could possibly colonize and island). It also discusses how these invasion and extinction rates are related to the ecology of different species, e.g. flighted species tend to invade more variably than non-flighted and also tend to more easily go extinct, as well as a brief discussion on disperal mechanisms (e.g. air transport, hitching a ride on floatsum).
It doesn't go into much detail on how these rates are related to distance between source populations and the islands they colonize, but does state that distance influences colonization rates. </p>
<p>I hope that makes it a bit more clear, but the paper is not confined to one topic so it is hard to summarize. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note, when I was young, we had to stay inside after 10 because military choppers would douse our neighborhoods with malathion to kill the med fly (los angeles, about 1988) </p>
<p>We got caught out in it, frying on acid.... so my band at the time, had a song called &quot;I get high on malathion&quot; but yeah, they used to coat LA with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out that the vast majority of species on the planet are bacteria.  In any given soil sample we know only something like 10% of the species in it (according to my grad course soil ecology professor a few yeas back), and have enormous difficulty even isolating and identifying the other species because we don't known exactly what living conditions they need to reproduce and get to a large enough Petri dish population to study.</p>
<p>That's just for the surface soil you can grab with your hands and doesn't even get into all the weird extremophiles deep in rocks and on the bottom of the oceans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The estimate of currently 8.7 million non-aquatic species according to my ecology textbook doesn't take bacteria or archaea into account (fungi is included though, but shaky estimates) because of the reasons you posted. Most of those 8.7 million are invertebrates though, with the vast majority being arthropods.</p></div>		</li>
