			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurons generally do not undergo mitosis, there can be some repair in the peripheral nervous system, but not much in the central nervous system.  If you cut the corpus callosum it will be severed forever, but as another poster said, it is not the only commissure in the brain.  So there will be some minor connections between the hemispheres and the cerebellum would be completely unaffected.  While the brain has more plasticity in youth, there are plenty of examples of people with brain damage who have regions of the brain &quot;respecialize&quot; to assist with lost function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't undergo mitosis but can the neurons grow to fill the gap and make connections through the cut? I imagine there would be no real incentive for it but I don't know nearly enough about how connections between neurons are created.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note is that the entire brain is not lateralized.  Many lower brain structures are not.  Hence, chopping the entire brain in two would lead to complete dysfunction in parts of the brain responsible for basic bodily processes, and hence death.</p>
<p>Could the two hemispheres of the cerebrum be completely separated and result in a living being that retains something like an adult human's personality?  I really do not know.  What I do know is that we would be very, very afraid to try it as a therapeutic measure.  Note that by performing a typical commisurotomy, we're only severing the largest of the 3 connections between cerebral hemispheres.  We are not separating the halves of the brain so much as we are cutting off the major highway between them - two back roads still exist - and that's one reason why the &quot;two consciousnesses&quot; observations are usually only evident in experimental settings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes its called a commissurotomy IIRC. There could still be some crossover around the cerebellum/top of brain stem though...</p>
<p>Then you should also consider if you would consider the hemispheres seperated if they can share information based on visual feedback. People without a corpus callosum are heavily reliant on visual feedback for spatial coupling of the hands during a bimanual movement. E.g. if you ask them to mime peeling an orange woth their eyes closed they often cant.</p></div>		</li>
