			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that it's not like the mosquito has some residual blood on its proboscis (&quot;mouth&quot;) that transmit the virus between people. Mosquitoes have to actually get infected by the virus in order for them to able to transmit it. Infection usually happens when viral particles are present in the mosquitoes salivary glands, and mosquitoes inject saliva (which in mosquitoes have anticoagulant properties) in the host during feeding to allow blood flow. So if the virus does not infect the mosquitoes, any viral particle the mosquito got from a diseased person just ends up digested by the mosquito digestory tract. </p>
<p>So, why mosquitoes are incapable of spreading HIV or Hepatitis from diseased to healthy humans? Because those viruses does not infect mosquitoes, so when a mosquito bites someone infected with them, the virus just get digested and it's the end of it.</p>
<p>The ultimate reason for that is evolutionary. Arboviruses (ARtrhopod BOrne viruses) emerged from a cycle involving mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts, so the virus emerged in a situation in which it's capacity to infect mosquitoes was a positive trait on it's perpetuity. However, HIV for example, emerged in a cycle that did not required it to infect mosquitoes, so it does not have this capacity, and this is why the HIV virus is not transmitted by mosquitoes bites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much about the mosquito, but rather the virus itself. Some viruses can live and replicate in both humans and mosquitos, thus they can be transmitted between the two hosts. Other viruses (or bacteria or parasites) can only live in one type of organism, so they can't be transmitted between animals/insect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exceptions always exist, there are a number of viruses that can be transmitted mechanically from a biting insect, the virus can simply exist in the mouthparts for some times and be transferred between meals. </p></div>		</li>
