			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there's plenty of life that doesn't have the capacity to want to live in the first place (microorganisms, plants, even animals like jellyfish and simpler invertebrates), and they're still about and in fact greatly outnumber those who might have some degree of self awareness. So the desire to live is by no means a necessity for life to survive but probably highly important in those animals that do have some degree of sentience</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not what the universe wants, its evolution. Species that are more inclined to value prolonging their existence will consequently live longer, breed more and be more successful. Any species that was not interested in its own survival will wipe out pretty quick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeh but that begs the question. why? why does a species care about survival? why are there organisms that <em>want</em> to propagate themselves? why is evolution a thing in the first place? what force is driving the organisms to continue to propagate? it seems to expend a lot more energy for these things to survive than it would for them to not exist. why did the universe create a self propagating force that seems to turn chaos into order?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the brain a future simulation machine is very detrimental to one's mental health because it gets you stuck in an endless loop of imagining scenarios and trying to get the best one happen in real life.</p>
<p>Not only is this impossible, because nothing ever happens as our volatile imagination like to describe it, but it leads to a vicious circle of imagining problems, imagining solutions and getting endlessly frustrated with this whole process eating up your mental resources.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking is addictive and you can get emotionally attached to your own scenarios on top of everything else. It's that euporia that starts going away when you realize your fantasies aren't going to happen the way you imagine them.</p>
<p>The brain does seem to be able to find solutions to problems, or, better said, navigate through everyday situations, but it does so on its own when it has enough relevant data. Much like a muscle flexes automatically when you're doing something, your mind offers paths for you to take when you're observing something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be referring to small everyday sorts of future role-playing/scenarios. </p>
<p>I believe the OP was referring to grand life plans. Such as, planning for a career that is intrinsically fulfilling and extrinsically rewarding. Long term financial planing, such as for a home, or retirement. Imagining a child in your life, and deciding if you want to conceve, which has financial, social, and psychological impacts on your life to be considered. The brain helps us to weigh out all of those great decisions, and plan for a future we hope will benefit our lives. </p>
<p>I agree, that it is detrimental to over analyze small daily occurrences, and events out of our control. </p>
<p>However, long-term strategic planning has clear merits. I believe what OP was trying to express was that, when you find the plan you've been following for years and years has failed you, (for whatever reason, could be totally out of your control) it can trigger a re-analysis of your life/choices/planning. &quot;What have I been doing all these years?&quot; &quot;What was/is the point of all my efforts?&quot; or some sort of grand panic over one's life purpose (existential crisis). It can cause one to become depressed/suicidal or, see life from a new perspective and drastically re-prioritize their life.</p>
<p>If you know your plan has failed you, it's beneficial to re-evaluate your life, and come up with a new suitable plan for your future happiness. </p>
<p>One solution is complete surrender, which some do choose, but not all of us have the luxury of becoming a yogi or monk. I know if I completely surrendered and stopped planning for my future, I'd be potentially putting my husband and daughter's well-being at risk. Planning pays out with comfort and security at far better odds, than not planning at all.</p>
<p>And, even if you don't plan for anything in life, there is still the possibility of having an exestential crisis triggered because you suddenly see the value of planning, and wish you had been doing it all along. I imagine that happens to a lot of adults that don't really &quot;grow up&quot; until they are well in their 40s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most common is worrying.</p>
<p>Other examples would be trying to think beforehand if you would enjoy something, making a plan for a social interaction, aggrandizing or justifying your actions to yourself to cope with an unwanted outcome.</p>
<p>Any mental fantasy that you forget is a fantasy.</p></div>		</li>
