			<div class="markdown"><p>Drop five pebbles in a pond, they make five different bulls eyes that add to eachother where they overlap. </p>
<p>Now watch just one tiny spot on that pond. You'll see the water go up and down based on each of the sets of ripples, even if it's just one point. Sound can be really complex, but at its heart it's just those waves of high/low pressure.  Just one real value. </p>
<p>But... If you paid attention to just that one spot long enough and paid really close attention to the added ripples, you could suss out the original waveforms.  </p>
<p>All a speaker needs to do is recreate the up/down pattern at that one point. At any moment the speaker membrane is only in one place, but it's expressing the added waves from dozens of recorded sounds. Instead of five ripples, though, it's pumping out the combined bumpy pattern from that point we imagined. </p>
<p>We lose some of the information without bringing stereo recording into the picture, but we're still able to pick out the ongoing pattern of the piano notes from a human voice from a cordless drill. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Thats all sound is really. Air moving back and forth (well more like forward at different pressure but same idea)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Multiple sound waves multiply together into a sort of &quot;compound&quot; sound wave. Imagine your hand is the surface of the speaker. You can wave your arm back and forth in a large arc to represent one frequency, and you can simultaneously flap your hand back and forth much more quickly to represent another frequency. The overall motion of your hand can still be tracked as a single waveform while generating multiple frequencies. That's what a speaker is doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;another small membrane&quot; is perhaps one of the most important parts of soundwave to hearing translation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilar_membrane#Frequency_dispersion" target="_blank">Basilar membrane</a>. This gets a little beyond eli5 perhaps, but essentially vibrations from your eardrum trigger 15,000 frequency-sensitive hairs in your ear. Certain frequencies will resonate certain hair cells, and translates that to nervous system information. The single vibration of the eardrum is essentially a material to receive incoming sound waves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually in his story &quot;another small membrane&quot; would be the oval window. Its the membrane that turns the vibrations from the bones into vibrations of the fluid in the inner ear. The basilar membrane would come after that. But the rest of your story is correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's these hairs that do the Fourier-like transformation of the incoming sound? I thought that was done by specialized brain sections (i.e. in &quot;software&quot; processing) as opposed to physical structures (i.e. a &quot;hardware&quot; processing).</p>
<p>Makes total sense for me now. How the brain could have the &quot;clock speed&quot; to process an analog signal with frequency in the tens of thousands of hz!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once the nervous information enters the brain, my knowledge on the matter is not so great. I would say that calling the process Fourier-like is correct, but I would say the brain plays a big part in interpreting &quot;what/where&quot; it is you're hearing. Kind of like how your eyes have individual photoreceptors, but your brain still puts it together into understandable information. I seem to recall there can be specific neuron sections for certain tonal qualities as well as frequencies.</p></div>		</li>
