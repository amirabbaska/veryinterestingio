			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: Swimmers do the opposite. We breathe in through the mouth and out through the nose</p>
<p>Breathing in through the mouth makes sure that they can get a whole lung full of air while only taking their body out of the water for a split second. </p>
<p>Breathing out through the nose is the only way to prevent water going up inside it while doing a flipturn at a wall. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked with many instructors that don't know this or ignore the fact that a kid isn't breathing out underwater. It happens a lot.</p>
<p>PSA to anyone struggling with swimming because of breath control issues: If you are running, there is no point in time that you would ever hold your breath and run. That would be stupid. Putting your face in the water changes nothing. Breathe out underwater. If your coach or instructor hasn't told you that, get a new one. Basic swimming competency is a life-saving skill that everyone should have. If you need pointers, PM me, I would be happy to help :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's weird. Learning to exhale underwater is supposed to be the very first thing you learn, usually by holding the wall with your mouth and nose in the water and &quot;blowing bubbles&quot;. Then you progress from raising your head to breath in to turning your head to the side to breath in. Add in some fake strokes while still on the wall to get the timing to sink in. </p>
<p>It sounds like you probably took lessons when you were over age 10, and your instructor did not understand swimming enough to make sure you understood the fundamentals. </p>
<p>Many swim instructors just follow the recommended lesson plans for each level of swimmer without variation. These lesson plans are absolute garbage, and should only be used by people who have no idea what they are doing so that at least their class does <em>something</em>. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The surgery to fix it all would cost me about $5000, so that’s not happening any time soon.  I use a daily nasal spray now and it clears things up by about 30-40%...better than nothing I guess </p></div>		</li>
