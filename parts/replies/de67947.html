			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a spiritual program, not a religious one.</p>
<p>People sometimes refer to GOD as &quot;Good Orderly Direction&quot; or &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea is finding something greater than yourself to &quot;give yourself over to&quot;, which isn't the same for every person. I spent about 4.5 of my 6 years of being clean and sober heavily involved in a 12 step community (NA) and at its core what it really promotes is a group of like minded people trying to help each other get through life, at least that was my interpretation of the whole scene. There are people that take steps VERY literally and there are those that don't, as with all things centered around a book of guidelines. It should be noted not every community or meeting has the exact same outlook on things, I've been to a meeting where they literally opened with the Lord's prayer and then went on to talk about how NA has no religious affiliation, so things are definitely somewhat up to interpretation.</p></div>		</li>
