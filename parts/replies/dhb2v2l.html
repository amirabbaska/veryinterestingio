			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for that. I'm going to have to read your book. Seems like this might potentially add several new factors to the Drake equation, or at least have the potential to make earth's bloom a smaller probability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Np, and thank you! It definitely does add new factors, several of which I add to my own equation in the book :). Drake's Equation is more of a general thought experiment at a time when we knew practically nothing about any of the factors (many of which we still do not). The most important one in my view is if and how many planets there are in the galaxy... now we have a good idea of that number, and it's a very positive number indeed.</p></div>		</li>
