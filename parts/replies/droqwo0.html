			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work a job where I monitored two different radio voice frequencies, had one in each ear.  If something interesting popped up in one ear that I couldn’t understand, I’d kill the other frequency and listen to the interesting one with both ears.  It really helped getting it into both ears if the audio wasn’t clear. </p>
<p>I would also monitor the more active frequency with my left ear (I’m also left handed, fwiw).  I have excellent hearing in both ears, but my left ear was better at comprehension if I had to use only one ear.</p>
<p>I can’t speak to the ambient noise issue, but my WAG is that using both ears would make it easier to hear something that’s otherwise borderline inaudible because that brings in extra brain processing power.  That was always my assumption. </p></div>		</li>
