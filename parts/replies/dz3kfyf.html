			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, for my interpretation to be correct, the islands would have to be raised above the level of the surrounding land. Were they higher than the land around the moat, even by a foot or two? The thing I'm imagining is like a camping pad in a swampy environment- flat on top, and just high enough that you don't get wet. I've slept on something like this in the Everglades.</p>
<p>If the islands are really not at all raised, then I can't think of an alternate possibility. I'm way more familiar with geomorphology than archeology, and these features are unlike any post-glacial landform that I've heard of. Also they seem too young to date from the ice age. Good luck figuring it out!</p></div>		</li>
