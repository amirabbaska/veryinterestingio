			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to pile on, I wrote some of this below but it was relevant here too:</p>
<p>Breasts are secondary sexual characteristics.  They tend to be 'runaway' traits, which are a weird combination of dramatic and unstable. More on that below.</p>
<p>Also, sexually-selected characteristics tend to get a second life as measures of mutational load and overall fitness.  Basically since they're hard to make, they're the first things to show genetic 'errors' if they exist, so if a person's big boobs are messed up that's a visible sign they don't have the best genes.  So the human body is a bit 'careful' not to make boobs bigger than it can make look good.  As well, there is a 'handicap' nature to the whole affair, where the hormonal traits (like high estrogen) necessary to make things like large breasts are disadvantageous to overall health, therefore only the very most fit individuals can 'waste' the health burden necessary to create and maintain them.</p>
<p>In a similar way, testosterone levels during puberty are correlated with facial attractiveness in men - wide jaw, thick beard, brow ridges, etc...however, testosterone decreases the function of the immune system.  So only men with the very best health and vitality can afford the hit to the immune system required to form a 'handsome' face.  </p>
<p>Anecdotally, the fact that I spent my teen years reading into the wee hours every night likely contributed strongly to the fact that I have a very handsome face (sorry, but true) with the exception of a kind of weak jaw line.  Testosterone levels correlate with sleep.  Once I started sleeping more in adulthood the bone-growth stage was past, but my muscle mass jumped up.</p>
<p>Any overall explanation of breast size variance needs to take into account the origin of large breasts as well, however.  Some people think that the reason they developed in the first place is as a defense against pedophilia.  Basically, since women's fertility declines so quickly men developed a preference for younger-looking women.  Women therefore began to compete sexually based upon how neotenous (having child-like characteristics) they were.  This is why women have smaller jaw, higher voices, less body hair, bigger eyes, etc.  The unfortunate downside is that men were literally becoming sexually attracted to child traits; breasts developed as a means to unambiguously signal 'I'm sexually mature.'  </p>
<p>But they piggybacked on all sorts of other intertwined traits.  Immaturity was basically meshing with maturity.  And everything was meshing with hormones actually responsible for crucial reproductive processes.  This created gigantic <del>boobs</del> instability in the selection process.  And the traits still haven't 'stabilized.'  We haven't formed robust biological means to create 1) fertility 2) neoteny and 3) mammary maturity signals all in the same person, simultaneously, reliably.  </p>
<p>Runaway sexual selection is like that.  Runaway traits create an immense amount of change quickly, and it just takes a while for the traits to 'stabilize' and become reliable.</p>
<p>So that's the complicated side of things.  The easier side of things is that breast tissue is more like muscle than like, say, finger length - it's dependent on constant levels (and your body's sensitivity to) certain hormones.  If you have naturally high testosterone you can easily have 100+ pounds of muscle even without working out, whereas if you have low testosterone (say if you're a woman compared to an average man who has more than 10x the testosterone of the average woman) you'll struggle to get even close to that even if you work out a lot - unless you take endogenous hormones.  And as soon as you stop them the 'gains' will go away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya know that's one of those numbers I've never thought to count. How many breasts have I seen in person. At first you try to count the ones you've seen in sexual situations. But then it gets more complicated as I recall seeing breasts out in the wild too, like parties where everyone's had a bit to drink and boobs just come out. Or I remember being at a concert and some woman was walking around on stage with her tits out. It's one of those things you think about and realize the world isn't always such a terrible place.</p></div>		</li>
