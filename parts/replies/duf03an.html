			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I guess in cases where they really need all that precision is in banking, because they don't want to short anyone. So perhaps they invented the convention.</p>
<p>In engineering you really, really don't need seven digits of precision. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in engineering you’d probably want to follow SI guideline, which is using a space between groups of three digits, and using a period or comma (your choice) for the radix (decimal spot). Because there’s no character for the number separator, whether you use a comma or period, there’s no ambiguity in what you mean. Allows people to both do what feels normal in your language, but also avoid confusion. </p>
<p>In math, you’d just avoid it. Write (1/64) instead of the decimal approximation, leave solutions as expressions. Most of the time it’s not necessary at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In math I've definitely seen the spaces but I don't know if I'd say it's the usual, in the US at least. There hasn't really been a convention for it that I've noticed. Plus the spaces every three digits function the same as a comma, so I'd rather have a comma, especially if it separates two of the same digit, which may be harder to see as a separation with a space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In what context have you seen formal math papers that leads you to say it’s not the norm?</p>
<p>I’d rather not have the separator, to avoid ambiguity. If I’m reading math, personally, I don’t mind reading big numbers carefully if I need to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would rather have the spaces.  A separator helps with my mild dyslexia and not having commas is easier to copy/paste between certain legacy software programs easier.</p>
<p>That's just me, YMMV. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just some regular math papers published in the US. Honestly, I just haven't noticed anything like that, which leads me to believe commas were used because anything else would look strange to me. It's perfectly possible I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with the comma is a <em>lot</em> of countries use them as decimal point. There is some standards meeting (General Conference on Weights and Measures) that decided in 2003 that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the symbol for the decimal marker shall be either the point on the line or the comma on the line</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>numbers may be divided in groups of three in order to facilitate reading; neither dots nor commas are ever inserted in the spaces between groups</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this is mostly for countries using metric. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator" target="_blank">But to quote Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This usage has therefore been recommended by technical organizations, such as the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 2003, the use of spaces as separators (for example: 20 000 and 1 000 000 for &quot;twenty thousand&quot; and &quot;one million&quot;) has been officially endorsed by SI/ISO 31-0 standard, as well as by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the American Medical Association's widely followed AMA Manual of Style, and the Metrication Board, among others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: Though you'd really want to use non-breaking spaces to avoid line breaks in the middle of a number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also differs by country/language.<br />
In my country, we write numbers like this 123 456,789 or like this 123456,789.<br />
&quot;789&quot; are the decimals here.</p></div>		</li>
