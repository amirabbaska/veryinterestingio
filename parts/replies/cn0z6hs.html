			<p>Bullshit. All of those other countries have health care for their people and the USA is the only country putting tuition debt onto people's heads. Those other countries also prosecute banker criminals and enforce a competitive market and protect their people from predatory finance schemes. The USA does not. For example, credit card interest and fees got a nice long ride to fuck everybody, and still lots of payday loan sharking and &quot;car title&quot; loan sharking. Well that shit is illegal in the rest of the modern West. USA is chock full of finance crime. Now I am going to stop typing before I call you names.</p>		</li>
