			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like me. I have an objectively good job, home, SO, but I’m bored as shit. I’m used to being stimulated by school, travel, language learning, or something that challenges me. Now I’m safe and life is easy and I’m getting so depressed all the time. </p>
<p>I think I need to feel like I’m progressing in life somehow. I felt great doing my masters, as if I was “going somewhere” in my career. I loved traveling France and learning French, similar feeling. Now my biggest interest is which iPhone I’m getting next, and it’s not something that feels like it matters at all in my life. I’m at a loss of what to do because there’s nothing I need to do. My life is fine but I’m just bored. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate to what you and u/Saul_T_Nautz have said. Particularly the travelling. Lived abroad for a year, been back in the normal swing of things for a couple of years, plus with a bunch of other things going on - I keep asking myself - is this it now?</p>
<p>And then I feel bad as it could be a lot worse really!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've pondered this question for a few years. </p>
<p>At 35, I tossed everything that made me successful and comfortable. Good job, awesome girl, family connections, etc.</p>
<p>I always found myself asking, is this it? Until I die? What more is there? </p>
<p>I started my own business, lost all the above, and yet, somehow I'm content. Not as depressed and not as lost. </p>
<p>I think we forget how to live for ourselves when everything is so easy to have in order to survive. </p>
<p>I also went into the withdrawal of losing all I had but at 40, I've come out of the back side.  I feel like I can't be stopped, I am my own person. I make things happen.</p>
<p>Fight or flight is real and its back. It keeps us young and sharp. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm. I wonder if that has anything to do with why there's been an increase in people who are content being single/ not looking for a relationship. People going childfree are even more common these days too. </p>
<p>I feel like I'm one of these people. Relationships are nice, but I feel like it's difficult to to be an individual or do anything on your own. That said, I think I would be happy in a relationship but I'm content being single. Definitely no kids though. Everything just becomes routine. Every day, every week, every year. Same thing. I would be so bored and wouldn't see the point. </p>
<p>Thing is, it's hard to avoid that when you're young. Money is what you need to survive and that whole thing of getting a job only to make money despite hating it etc. is a whole other thing. Don't know the stats but I wouldn't be surprised if teens and young adults struggled with suicide and anxiety the most. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you worry about kids causing you to fall into a routine/rut, I can tell you that my 3 year old never seems to do the same thing for longer than a month, then it's on to the next obsession. He just wrapped up drawing monsters for 5-6 hours a day and has been now making strange vehicles from blocks for about 2 weeks with similar intensity. I don't really know what the next phase will be. Sure, I need to provide a safe environment for him to try things out, but I'd have to provide that for myself anyway, so that's a routine I'd likely be fulfilling regardless. Just saying, kids, as curious and short-attention-spanned as they are, in my case at least, will not be the real source of routine. My wife, however, requires a good deal more compromise. Two adults with different needs will have to find middle ground, and sometimes, if I'm not being creative enough, that middle ground gets a little small and overworked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you are young, it's what you are told is right and see around you. The steps to maturing, etc. </p>
<p>I had guilt about just being around because it's what was expected. I honestly got married because it was the last thing left to do. We graduated university, got the jobs, cars, house, etc. Marriage was just the last progression that everyone expected. </p>
<p>I felt obligated. </p>
<p>And yes, I did love the woman but I often think that had those other things not been expected or pushed by others, and we just lived life as it came, would we still be together. </p>
<p>People are deathly afraid of two things: being alone when one needs to clear your head and change. </p>
<p>They become locked into things by cognative dissonance ie. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While your comments seems pretty anecdotal, it's really interesting. I definitely agree with most, if not all of it. I think another factor leading to depression is that we don't live the way humans lived for thousands of years. When we were hunter gatherers, people weren't sitting in their teepees for 12 hours a day five days a week. The happiest I've ever been was one summer when I worked outside for 10 hours a day  4 days a week. I was always in a good mood at work because (I think) I was outside, in the forest, in the sun all day. I had a roommate that had severe depression who would sit in the house all day when he wasn't at work. He also put blankets over the windows so no sun would shine through during the day. He just went to work and sat in a dark house afterwards. He never got better.</p></div>		</li>
