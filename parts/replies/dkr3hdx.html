			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to point out a little more detail so you don't think it's sound and guessing scientists use to measure what's in the earth. For example scientists know the thickness of lava, how it moves and everything about it -- assume that for many substances. So when scientists get vibration data from the earth they know the inside is a liquid and a liquid comparable to lava so it must be molten rock with x being the estimated thickness of the crust.</p>
<p>So when you have a box filled with water and you pick it up, your mind does calculations it self that tell you it's a liquid and upon further inspection your mind may narrow it down to being a liquid comparable to water instead of say a goo. To play on OPs original explanation.</p>
<p>They do the same with gravity and stuff, we know there is another planet at the edge of our solar system without seeing it because they know the mathematical effect of gravity on objects they can see. E=mc2. So using this mathematical effect on say an asteroid belt, they know there must be a large object nearby that is planet sized. So we know there's another unfound planet at the edge of the solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Magma inside the earth is far more viscous than lava on the surface due to the increase in pressure. While technically liquid, the mantle rock is more akin to very very thick treacle than lava you'd see on the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was our christmas tradition to box a gift in a mundane box like weetabix or cereal or something and then put it in another box and wrap it. Then every time you opened one you were supposed to go &quot;awww man, weetabix, I didn't want this&quot; and then open it and go &quot;ayyyyyeee&quot;. Silly tradition but it's what I remember most from my childhood christmas eves. I got TaleSpin and Ducktales from a weetabix box, best christmas ever.</p></div>		</li>
