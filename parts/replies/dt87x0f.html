			<div class="markdown"><p>2) is a really important point. The Romans figured this out and dominated the Mediterranean for a long time. The Macedonians did, and conquered vast areas of modern-day Greece and Turkey. The Vikings did, too, and pillaged with impunity for centuries.</p>
<p>4) Flags. The reason military units have flags now is that they have had those for a couple millennia already. The units used to be centered around their standard, and the standard-bearer was the second most important and high-ranked person in the unit. All members of the unit would follow the flag and defend it to their last breath. A unit was considered lost when its flag fell, as it could no longer fight as a cohesive unit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Different colours and different designs were painted onto the faces and armour of the warriors. This tradition was slightly older than the flag system which took its place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was referencing the comment I replied to, which was discipline. Googling the armies I mentioned might be a good start, but I'll list some of the tactics specific to each: Romans had the testudo, which protected them from projectiles and kept them in a tight, organized unit. Vikings had the shield wall, which mostly served the same purpose. Macedonians had the spear (or pike) wall, that provided excellent defense against cavalry. The mutual protection encouraged unit cohesion and staying where you should be. This bolstered morale and together, these things allowed those armies to offer organized resistance and stand their ground where less organized opponents would have broken and fled. Most ancient battles ended with a rout when morale broke, not with a massacre. </p></div>		</li>
