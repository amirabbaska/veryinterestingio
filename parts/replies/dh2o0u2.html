			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I've also spent some time measuring G (albeit as a summer intern)</p>
<p>So I worked for an astrophysicist last summer who's on the science team for LISA Pathfinder. My job was to take a first crack at measuring big G with data from its instruments to try and produce a measurement from space.</p>
<p>Essentially, the idea is that since the spacecraft expends ~10g of fuel a day, the change in mass in the fuel tanks affects the laser interferometer which is sensitive to ~10fm/s^2. Then we can back out a value for G.</p>
<p>I recall my mentor was hoping that some outside group would take interest and then he'd pass them my work as a jumping point. They're a bit busy right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question!</p>
<p>Not accurate enough. That was a big hurdle I ran into towards the end of my internship.</p>
<p>There may be ways to account for the inaccuracy. One idea is to determine the momentum change when the thrusters fire and compare it to the mass flow detected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think maybe there's an unknown cause causing those systematic errors? Cause i looked at Figure 1 in your dissertation and the values seems to be oscillating through the years.</p>
<p>Then again it could just be my mind trying to find a link where there's none</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are indeed some systematic effects that are probably not well understood, as the different measurements are not very compatible. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06604" target="_blank">Some authors</a> tried to find a time-dependence, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01774" target="_blank">others</a> found flaws in that approach. Meanwhile various groups try to establish new methods to measure G.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While measuring G is hard, measuring variations in G is about a million times easier.  You can get dG/dt / G  to about 10^-11 using <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1151" target="_blank">binary pulsar data</a> (pdf). </p>
<p>However, I've seen people trying to analyze the systematic errors from various different G measurements to determine a time variation of G.</p>
<p>It makes me want to pull my hair out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why?  Are we certain that it is it not possible for physical constants to vary over time?  Has the speed of light always 299792458m/s throughout all time?  How do we know?  Perhaps our definition of the metre is tied into the speed of light in such a way that it is always that value no matter what the actual speed is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course G might vary with time.  No way to know unless you measure it.</p>
<p>My point is that it is really, really easy to measure <strong>changes in G</strong>, while it is really really hard to measure <strong>absolute values of G</strong>.</p>
<p>If G really varies as much as the absolute measurements indicate, my phone could measure it with its accelerometer.</p></div>		</li>
