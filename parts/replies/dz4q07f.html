			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting source. I guess saying the &quot;hole&quot; itself reaches NZ might be misleading but the Ozone layer is heavily weakened if you compare it to the Northern hemisphere:</p>

<p>That would probably explain the other comments here. </p>
<p>The yearly videos are really amazing. You can see how NZ can get quite low at some times ( e.g. Dec 2016)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  32 y/o half Indian /half white guy here.   Grew up in Florida and I rarely got burnt, I really had to try.  Usually I just get really brown.  Then last year I went to Sydney.  I put on the same SPF 10 sunblock I’ve been using for years, went to the beach for about 2 hours, left, got back to my hotel and fuckkk!  I couldn’t even lay down in bed it hurt so bad.  The worst sunburn I’ve ever gotten.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow, SPF10 is considered sunblock? Normal here in NZ would be at least 30, commonly 50, and I've seen SPF80.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree. I have to wear sunscreen everyday in NZ or else get burnt(grew up there) and now living in the USA I can wear no sunscreen and not burn, and the same traveling in Europe and Asia. </p>
<p>I was always told this was due to the ozone hole. What is this due to if not the ozone hole? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Come to Wellington and get burned at 20C/68F in the summer and tell me there's no ozone hole :)</p>
<p>AFAIK the hole shifts throughout the year, and there's no reason to believe that the additional UV radiation that would pour through an ozone hole could only fall on those areas directly under the weakest concentration of ozone.</p></div>		</li>
