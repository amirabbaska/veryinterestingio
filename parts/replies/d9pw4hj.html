			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply replacing your toilet with a new/modern one might solve your problem too. I had one that clogged constantly, and replaced it <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/KOHLER-Cimarron-Comfort-Height-2-piece-1-6-GPF-Elongated-Toilet-with-AquaPiston-Flushing-Technology-in-White-K-3589-0/100668596" target="_blank">with this guy</a>.</p>
<p>It turned out, there was a TON of scaly buildup in the toilet and drain pipe. I cleaned it out and put in the new toilet, and it can flush anything. That &quot;aqua piston&quot; think in the link above really works! It doesn't even swirl, it just sucks down the whole bowlful in half a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well of course! I'm not exactly sure how much they are since we don't put them in often but you'd also have to run a larger water line to the toilet which could be pricey. Personally, I'd just split the work up and double flush hahaha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most cheap toilets do not have the ceramic glazing,that make the visible surfaces so smooth and shiny, in the drainage tubes. This creates extra friction when flushing and this could be your problem. They have that toilet with the larger valve that will flush all the golf balls but it really isn't nessecsary unless you have massive fucking shits</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thinks it's a plumbing code to have them in public restrooms for hygiene reasons. So people have room for their body parts and so they aren't touching the seat. That's why I think I've only seen U shaped disposable seat covers. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember friends pulling pranks back in the day and removing the water line from the tank and wedging it under the lid so the person flushing the toilet would get sprayed with water once they flushed.</p>
