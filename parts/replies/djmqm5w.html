<p>Also, could you explain what a &quot;turn up&quot; is in relation to one's trousers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am going to dissent a bit from the mainstream opinion of bureaucracy. What people tend to not realize is that government officials arent really just sitting around dreaming up new ways to make it harder on construction companies. The point is that government regulations are reactionary. In other words some one some where fucked up big time and government realized that its happening else where so applies the regulation throughout the industry. They can of course over react, but deregulation doesnt automatically make things better since the point was to nip a trend of abuse in the bud. The japanese have alot of bureaucracy (its kinda a thing they are known for), and they make it work.</p>
<p>That being said, I would emphasize organizational culture as the biggest inhibitor by far. In japan you organize a project with crews that are highly trained, specialized, and &quot;surgical&quot; for lack of a better word. A team comes in and does one very specific thing along side other teams for just a few hours and then gets out (goes to the next job or whatever). You then rotate in another team for the next task. This means you get high quality efficient work, and can run the project 24/7 till completion (which is essentially what the japanese do). A project is highly planned, in fact the planning for the project might take longer than the project itself because you literally train crews before hand on the exact time table and specifics of the project plan. In contrast, in the US you have a worker who is expected to either be specialized in everything, or just be a general do-it-all. US workers work the whole day 9-5, which means they put a couple good hours in the morning, and then run out of fuel as the day goes on. You're not running projects in this surgical team paradigm so come 5oclock everyone wants to go home. Project planning is more on-demand than pre-planned, in other words you have someone having to give orders out reacting to the project in real time instead of planning out and informing everyone of the whole project scope and game plan. Hence the project comes out lower quality, takes longer, and probably ends up costing everyone alot more.</p>
<p>The way we organize labor is very important. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So few people understand this.  Scottsdale has VERY a very restrictive wall permit process.. because a wall fell over and killed someone.  L&amp;I does routine inspections.. because contractors typically played fast and loose with regulations and someone sued the state when they got hurt.   </p>
<p>None of the government steps are done &quot;just because&quot; and it's so irritating to see people just bitch about government intervention without questioning WHY that intervention exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You reminded me of a video I saw somewhere where the Japanese were fixing a subway during rush hour, and somehow they were able to not disrupt traffic while they were doing it.  I tried looking it up in Youtube but a quick search only found that they repaired a huge sinkhole in a week.  Pretty amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am currently involved in a large Japanese funded, designed and managed protect. I have never seen such a poorly executed project in my life. Wildly bureaucratic and inefficient processes,  no ability to correct errors as they are found and foolish bowing to seniority.  I would estimate final cost snd schedule will be more that 2x benchmarks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bureaucracy is a bit of my Forte. The US government is very bureaucratic on all levels because of accountability. It's  it enough to know the city planning dept. messed up  we need to know who and how.</p>
<p>It is legal ass covering. This is a great way to track all the motion within a  organization and keep everyone accountable, but it is costly and slows the system down. </p>
<p>Let's say we want to build an overpass, we will spend 20 million dollars on it either way. So first, 20 million without bureaucracy: &quot;I spent all 20 million to build this. Don't worry about where the money went, I just did it. Yeah, it's totally safe.&quot; this method leave a lot to question, it is cheaper and easier to complete but you don't know if corners were cut because there's no documentation to back anything up. So if something goes wrong, it's harder to prosecute for criminal neglect. The other way: &quot;this paperwork is a pain in my ass, but the tax payer knows where every dollar went and when the overpass fails I can prove that the fault was the guy who did the bending and placement of the rebar and the electrician who shut through a critical piece of support&quot; Yeah, it sucks that the overpass collapsed and killed three people, but now we have a massive paper trail to prove who are at fault and an investigation will yield situations where expenses were padded and tax payer money stolen.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the elected officials in charge have to prove to the public that they did something and kept the corruption to a minimum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting. I know it's more complicated than what I'm about to say, but I've always had the impression that zoning laws and regulation of heavy industry in general was far more onerous in Europe, even in the UK, than it is in the US, but I guess you can't paint with too broad a brush when it comes to the details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno, I hear this about regulation, but I'm in the US and my work sort of gives exposure to the standards in the US/canada and western europe.  From what I can see europe is way ahead (read: far more strict) at least when it comes to buildings, from construction requirement, to HVAC, to indoor air quality, to what is accounted for such as radiant effects.  So it's weird to me when the codes themselves are more strict in general but the perception from construction folks is that regulation is worse in the US.  There's a weird disconnect somewhere, maybe it's that the technical/engineering details of what's going on is less strict/regulated in the US, but the actual construction/building details are more strict/bureaucratic </p></div>		</li>
