<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>What does the company do if they see the machine malfunctioned and people LOST for, say, 5 hours? Are they under any obligation to do anything or do they just laugh and pocket the winnings?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We laugh all the way to the bank and release a patch.</p>
<p>I tell everyone - don't play 'em. They are fair, the machines don't cheat, they are truly random, no voodoo hand waving or combos of button pushes or fucking with your player tracking card is going to do anything to influence the game, and even in the event of total power loss, the game will later reboot to <em>exactly</em> the same state it was in before the power loss. But they have among the worst odds in the casino, more than doubly so if you're at a Cesar's.</p>
<p>The first thing that happens when you hit Spin is it saves the ONE randomly generated number that determines the total outcome of the game. Whether you win or lose, how much you're going to get in the bonuses, everything is already determined. You know those Pick'em bonus rounds where you touch to reveal what's under a number of items? It doesn't matter what you touch, your winnings have already been decided - <strong>BY LAW</strong>. But... but... but... It showed me what was underneath all the other options! Listen to me very carefully - whatever you pick, we put your winnings under that option, and the other values you didn't pick are bullshit. We put those there for psychological reasons. It entices players, it triggers your addiction centers. We don't officially talk about gambling addiction, but in the lunch rooms, we totally talk about how to hook players.</p>
<p>I've seen our games in action, and I've watched grandmothers drain their wallets of hundreds of dollars. Hundreds. I don't know how many $20's that woman attached to an oxygen tank had in her wallet when she started, I know she didn't have any when she left, and I counted hundreds of dollars. My wife was a data analyst for the same company, and she would go into the field to interview players. Our &quot;best&quot; players are those who are playing entire banks of machines at a time, pacing the row, hitting Spin. She's talking to this one guy and he's not even looking at the fucking game! He's talking to my wife, looking at her, and tapping Spin as fast as he can without paying attention.</p>
<p>He was so mentally fucked, and our machines did that to him. We did that to him.</p>
<p>The executives would park their DB9's practically sideways in the building handicap parking spots. They were self important cocks like you wouldn't believe because they had money. I'd call the police and report the plates while walking into the building. The salesmen would do coke with the clients, the casino execs, and they were fucking stupid, they really had no idea how to use a computer to check their email and couldn't do basic math. They'd be told they can't sell a unit for less than $X, and they'd undercut us anyway - we'd take a loss on 1/2 their orders because &quot;they're selling relationships.&quot; Twats.</p>
<p>The company was doing great, so they threw extravagant parties that would go all night. You've seen Great Gatsby, they used it as a sort of manual on how to live in excess and debauchery. The company was doing poor, so they fired a bunch of people so it looked like we were doing great, and then they'd throw a party... I just remember the tents, and the hundreds of bottles of wine, troughs of beer... I bet we filled two dumpsters with just wine bottles alone per party.</p>
<p>I never liked slot machines. In fact, I fucking hated them before I even took the job. I was notorious around the office, and almost a decade later they still talk about me. I was so cynical. We have a suggestion box for themes. I suggested we build a large, multi-story black building. Completely featureless, no windows, painted concrete. Players will walk up and in the middle of one side, at waste level, is a bill validator. They put in their money, you hear a bit of rumbling, like the sound of large gears behind feet of concrete. And that's it. Eventually they just walk away confused and feeling unfulfilled. What's the difference between that and one of our machines?</p>
<p>I'll never understand why they didn't like me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did you hear about these Russians who got a hold of one and reverse engineered the random number generator to know what pull to place large bets on?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On June 9, Lumiere Place shared its findings with the Missouri Gaming Commission, which in turn issued a statewide alert. Several casinos soon discovered that they had been cheated the same way, though often by different men than the one who’d bilked Lumiere Place. In each instance, the perpetrator held a cell phone close to an Aristocrat Mark VI model slot machine shortly before a run of good fortune.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Novomatic’s engineers could find no evidence that the machines in question had been tampered with, leading them to theorize that the cheaters had figured out how to predict the slots’ behavior. “Through targeted and prolonged observation of the individual game sequences as well as possibly recording individual games, it might be possible to allegedly identify a kind of ‘pattern’ in the game results,” the company admitted in a February 2011 notice to its customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the numbers aren't truly random. Because human beings create them using coded instructions, PRNGs can't help but be a bit deterministic. (A true random number generator must be rooted in a phenomenon that is not manmade, such as radioactive decay.) PRNGs take an initial number, known as a seed, and then mash it together with various hidden and shifting inputs—the time from a machine’s internal clock, for example—in order to produce a result that appears impossible to forecast. But if hackers can identify the various ingredients in that mathematical stew, they can potentially predict a PRNG’s output. That process of reverse engineering becomes much easier, of course, when a hacker has physical access to a slot machine’s innards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the operatives use their phones to record about two dozen spins on a game they aim to cheat. They upload that footage to a technical staff in St. Petersburg, who analyze the video and calculate the machine’s pattern based on what they know about the model’s pseudorandom number generator. Finally, the St. Petersburg team transmits a list of timing markers to a custom app on the operative’s phone; those markers cause the handset to vibrate roughly 0.25 seconds before the operative should press the spin button.</p>
<p>“The normal reaction time for a human is about a quarter of a second, which is why they do that,” says Allison, who is also the founder of the annual World Game Protection Conference. The timed spins are not always successful, but they result in far more payouts than a machine normally awards: Individual scammers typically win more than $10,000 per day. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reno, NV checking in. I work in EMS, and I have to say that slot machine addiction is right up there with the hardest of street drugs, if not more so. If a couple of druggies are together doing their thing, and one of them OD's, one of the others will have the common sense to pick up a phone and call for help. </p>
<p>This is not the case with slot machines. I've seen 911 calls where an elderly player has dropped dead while seated at a machine, while chain smoking a pack of Virginia Slims. Being that the crowd consists mainly of octogenarians, one would think that they would be the overly concerned, grandparent-like people we expect. Negative, Ghost Rider. When it comes to slot play, they don't fuck around. If someone has to get up to use the restroom, steps away from their machine for any reason, passes out, or flat out dies in their chair, the grey haired individual seated at the adjacent seat will immediately assume play of the newly vacated machine, often placing max bets, in hopes to either drain the available funds or hit a jackpot and cash out the receipt before anyone notices. </p>
<p>Back to the case of a person dying at a machine. Asking other players to vacate the area so that resuscitation efforts could begin was all but out of the question. There were machines with credits on them, and nothing short of physical effort was going to pry those wrinkly old fingers off the &quot;spin&quot; button. Not even staff offering the holy grail of low-lever geriatric gambling addict comps, the free buffet pass, could get them to voluntarily vacate their machine. No watching on in horror as paramedics slid an endotracheal tube into grandma's throat and began breathing for her. No asking &quot;is she going to be okay?&quot; as CPR compressions began. Just staring straight ahead at those goddamn spinning reels and waiting for the next microdose of dopamine to be released by their failing bodies. </p>
<p>Congrats, man. You helped create one of the most addicting devices I've ever seen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a state casino regulatory agency for 6 years. The machines go through an independent testing lab before they're even allowed on to the floor at casinos. They have to meet a large amount of criteria to be allowed up for play.</p>
<p>Our state did regular audits on the machines to ensure they were up to date with current software. Just like computer software, glitches can happen and then the software needs to be updated/patched. </p>
<p>When a complaint was made it was taken very seriously. We shut the machine down, tested it, and sometimes even sent it back to the lab for forensic analysis. If the machine was found to have been paying people incorrectly then depending on who's fault it was (manufacturer or casino)we'd fine them a considerable amount. We'd also try to rectify any money patrons lost as a result of the malfunction.</p>
<p>Pay tables are very important on slots. After investigating what happened to this woman we'd probably fine the manufacturer.  However, we would not require a payment to the patron. According to the paytable on this machine it was impossible for her to win that amount. The casino paid her according to the symbols shown. An investigation would reveal that it was just a display error during the ticket print. From time to time machines have glitches and display erroneous amounts but that doesn't mean the patron just gets paid out. Most likely she knows she couldnt have won that amount and is just trying to take advantage of the situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/mredding how many flawed/&quot;beatable&quot; machines have you encountered?</p>
<p>My brother &amp; I encountered one 15+ years ago that we heavily profited off of.   The flaw here was that the game had a what seemed to be a pretty reliable cycle to it and most people didn't understand the game.... and often walked away from a game that was already 2/3 of the way to the &quot;jackpot&quot;.</p>
<p>It was some sort of &quot;crack the safe&quot; game that was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play for 20-30 minutes (~$75-150 for this machine) to get the bonus game</li>
<li>During the bonus game your prize was a small token to keep you playing (at a loss)... but you also could &quot;crack&quot; one of the numbers to the safe combination </li>
<li>A cycle to crack all three safe numbers and open the safe took approx. 60-90minutes of non-stop playing (and would cost you more than $500 to reach).  Once cracked, you played the &quot;super&quot; bonus that was eligible for the machine's max payout.</li>
<li>However... people would often get up from the machine after cracking 2 of the 3 numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We paced this bank of 8 machines all weekend.  If someone got up with 2 of 3 numbers &quot;cracked&quot; we raced to snag it.   We profited each &amp; every single time this scenario presented itself.   Granted most of the time we put in $150 and ended up with the minimum $200 payout.. but that was still a profit.   My brother hit the max payout once and we had multiple $500+ wins.</p>
<p>Again, over the course of 2 days... every time our ideal scenario presented itself, we profited.  It's been many years, but I'd put our 2-day total was $4000+ on a $0.25er (old school max 3 credits) between the two of us.</p>
<p>Sounds like this style of machine/payout doesn't meet the legal muster nowadays.  Unless my memory is faulty, you could weren't even eligible for the max payout until 2 of 3 numbers had been cracked... meaning for 2/3 of the time this machine was being played, the max payout wasn't even possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you stated isn't really a flaw with the game just that players didn't understand how the game worked.</p>
<p>Kinda like in order to get into the bonus round you have to bet a certain amount of money some people will still play the game below the bonus round amount. The game isn't flawed they just didn't know the rules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have a similar game at Chuck E Cheese. Every so often you win &quot;a letter&quot; and if you get 5 letters there's a big jackpot with a minimum guarantee. So you just wait till it's got four letters then play a bit and, boom, you've got 500 tickets after putting in maybe a dollar or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't explain how the company feels they have the right to keep the money that has been made off the broken machine.  Every single person who put money in that machine was essentially scammed because had they had no chance of winning.  What's to stop a company producing the machines to just put a minor flaw in the machines on purpose so they don't have to pay out if they don't feel like it?  How is it the person who won the jackpot's fault that the machine was flawed, everywhere I ever worked if something went wrong at our facilities we took responsibility for it and then had insurance deal with it if it was a bigger issue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It gets taxed just like the rest of it. If the government were to seize that money, then no manufacturer would bother entering the market. Too much liability, too much risk.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Every flaw that makes it into the field that is subsequently caught has to be reported to every single commissioner and regulatory region, who will then report it to every casino, whether they have the machine or not. There is huge negative backlash from the market and regulators. Enough of those, and the regulators have the authority to pull your products off the market. Products the casinos paid for, that they still own, and now it's not making them money.</p>
<p>That's bad. And that's happened before, just before my time in the company. They called those the dark times. No really, that was it's name.</p></div>		</li>
