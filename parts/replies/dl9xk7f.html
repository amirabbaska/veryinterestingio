			<div class="markdown"><p>Add a tiny amount to any coffee really. I add it in with the grounds (with high quality coffee beans) before I brew in the french press and it reduces the bitterness and enhances the other flavors quite nicely. </p>
<p>Obviously be careful not to add too much and ruin the brew</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This feels like a prank. A self inflicted one, sure. But it's like press 'alt+f4' to run in video games prank. Mostly harmless. Like I'm going to have to dump out a cup of salty mud water because I followed these directions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works really well, but you can only add a pinch or else everything goes to shit. </p>
<p>Not a teaspoon. Not a small teaspoon. A pinch and no more!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forgot that the work salt shakers don't have the humidity problem that I have at home with no central air. So my salt doesn't come out fast. The shaker at work dumps it like a truck. Cue salt in the office coffee. Way too much. It tasted weird, but drinkable.</p>
<p>Yea really only need something like 20 grains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also add a few grains of salt to a glass of &quot;old and bitter&quot; red wine to enhance the flavor. Learned this trick from a sommelier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that for most people, it'd be better to drink broth (or other salty things) than sports drinks because you don't actually need the sugar unless you're under extreme strain. </p></div>		</li>
