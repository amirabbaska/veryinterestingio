			<div class="markdown"><p>THANK YOU. As a Pacific Islander (specifically Chamorro) I hate being marginalized and labeled under an ethnic group that generalizes and downplays what it means to be Chamorro. From all the Pacific Islands that I have visited, many share similar values and customs that are very different from those of other ethnicities. It is far less insensitive to refer to a pacific islander as a pacific islander than typecast them as &quot;asian&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would a Hawaiian consider themselves the same as Maori? I'm sure a Maori has a strong and proud tradition <em>as a Maori</em> but I'd be surprised if &quot;pacific islander&quot; were all that important to them.   As I understand it, the &quot;point&quot; of the Pacific Island race is to simplify things for the US Census Bureau. It's like lumping Cherokee and Apache together under &quot;native american&quot; or lumping Russians and Spaniards under &quot;caucasian&quot; when none of them can trace their ancestors to the Caucasus. It's just a simplification made because governments want to collect data but don't have the resources to collect detailed data.</p></div>		</li>
