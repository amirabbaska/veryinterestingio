			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry but your definition of existentialism is very misleading and since yours is the top comment I think it's important that you give an accurate description of the philosophy. First off, you say, &quot;Existentialists believe that existence comes before essence, which is to say that things (and people) are not defined by something external, but by their existence, where they are, and what they do.&quot; This is in fact more in line with essentialism, saying that someone is a product of their environment and that they have to be the person that they are in order to be &quot;authentic&quot;. The quote you're looking for is by Sartre who says, &quot;Existence precedes essence,&quot; Which is to say that your existence trumps or has more value to who you are then what you may essentially be. The essentialist view is that you're born who you are and that intrinsic qualities are what make you you, but in existentialism it's the belief that after you reach a certain age one can use their own cognitive ability and consciousness to redefine who it is that they are. Oftentimes people find themselves in an existential crisis which is to say that they lost track of who it is that they are supposed to be, or that they have become so lucid and aware of the reasoning and function for all of their habits and actions that they can no longer be any one thing authentically. This is the existential man. He has no identity because he can't truly be anything honestly since he is too consciously aware of what he's doing and why. So to reiterate essentialists believe in the idea of &quot;just be yourself&quot; because that is reliant on intrinsic properties, while existentialists believe that they can define who it is that they are through their own consciousness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you would have to define free-will first I suppose, because what people assume is their free-will isn't always so clear cut. You have to identify the cognitive processes in place that are determining your judgements, many people assume that free will is their ability to make any choice at a given time but they don't understand the incalculable amount of events that lead to them making that choice, even if they decided to choose at random to prove they have free-will there's still some reason that led even to that decision, I think this is true of everyone regardless of philosophy. So to bring free-will into the equation I think is irrelevant, a true essentialist in their actions default to an identity that exists because they believe it's who they are meant to be, by god or genetics, upbringing, or whatever reason and this intrinsic identity is the guide or even auto-pilot for most of their decision making. Whereas an existentialist is not beholden to any sort of first degree rationality, as in, &quot;I'm a person who always tells it how it is, so therefore I'm going to be frank now&quot; but instead would take it a step further and realize that they only act that way because their dad said something to them about it when were eight, you can just disentangle a lot of your identity I suppose and then create your own based off how you want to act and how you want to be, and reinforce it by adhering to that, but only after you've done away with the essential characteristics you started with. If you want a much better articulated version of this concept I would suggest reading the first part of Dostoevsky's <em>Notes From the Underground</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the explanation of he can't live authentically as he is too aware. I wasn't aware of the term for it - existential crises - but yeah, I've decided to have one of those right now it seems. Thanks, I have some light reading to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean to undermine the thrust of this post. It's not the worst post I've ever seen on the topic. However there are a couple points that I can't help but to address only because this is the top comment, and I think the clarification is necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nihilism, from the Latin &quot;Nihil&quot; for &quot;Nothing,&quot; states as its basic tenet that nothing has meaning outside of the meaning we assign to it as humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking this is not nihilism. It is moral relativism.</p>
<p>Moral relativism means 'man is the measure of all things' i.e. human assignments of meaning are actually meaningful.</p>
<p>Nihilism means even human assignments of meaning are not actually meaningful, or at least one cannot know if any thing in itself is meaningful. Instead we are merely pretending that things have meaning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This flies in the face of the goal of philosophy in general, which for a long time was seen as the search for the ultimate meaning of things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Philosophy is very generally stated as an investigation into the truth of matters. However this does not mean nihilism flies in the face of philosophy, because nihilism/(empiricism) is a philosophical position concerning the truth of things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nihilism denies philosophy by attempting to show that not only will it never reach its goal of immutable universal truth, but that immutable universal truth does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a bit reaching concerning nihilism. I don't think a nihilist would ever claim that immutable universal truth does not exist (as if to make some sort of dogmatic claim onesself). Instead I think a nihilist would be more comfortable saying that nothing is barred from skeptical analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nihilism strikes a blow against philosophy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it doesn't strike a blow against philosophy, for if it does, it strikes a blow against itself for nihilism is a philosophical position. Instead it strikes a blow against dogmatists and rationalists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well put - the only part I'd disagree with is the claim that existentialism implies no God! It just implies there is no essentialist God, and that nothing he says or does could endow something with an essense or inherent rightness, wrongness, and so on. There have been many existentialist philosophers who were also believers in a God, but it takes a person to a very different view of what God is and what religion is. Coming from a non-dualistic/non-platonistic religion, existentialism seemed to be stating the obvious when I first encountered it, and if anything has led to a better understanding of my own community's values and goals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;nothing he says or does could endow something with an essense or inherent rightness, wrongness&quot;</p>
<p>Please forgive if I offend, I'm asking because I'm curious. If your God(s) can't do that, what are they? I of course come from the tradition of the Mediterranean Monotheists (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Zoroastrianism) and I genuinely have trouble understanding how something can be a God and not be an essentialist God. My central conflict here is thus: why would I take the infinitely precious time out of my one and only life on Earth to worship, or even acknowledge, a God to whom my acknowledgement is meaningless?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a God becomes a meaning making God, whose purpose is the relationship he has with the universe, with us, and so on. I specifically am in a Christian tradition, so my God is one who &quot;sees that it is good&quot; rather than declares it good, who allows a conflict over his character to play out rather than squashing opposition or simply declaring himself just, who seeks to act in such a way that he will eventually be declared worthy to be praised, rather than just demanding worship, and when he is worshiped, it is done through meaningful actions rather than ever so beautiful lip-service.</p>
<p>As to why taking time is with the effort, that is because worship is best done by properly using your time, and taking the time to learn about such a God is really taking time to better understand how to be present in your life, how to relate more strongly to the world and woven connections around you.  As to acknowledging God, or believing in such a God's existence, I'm fairly certain that the presence or lack of such believe is immaterial (if anything, it would be a very essentialist categorization), as it is the actions we do that are worship, though such a God still values the relationship and pursues it.</p>
<p>Such a God's purpose in being connected to us is not to pass on essentialist values, but instead to give us a rough starting point from which to grow in wisdom and understanding of existentialist values, as well as give some generally good advice, much of which becomes useless or negative if removed from context, i.e. essentialized. </p></div>		</li>
