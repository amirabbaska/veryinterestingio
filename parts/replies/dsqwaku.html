			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of the strings is to find the way to unify the Newtonian physics of large bodies like planets with the Planck physics of subatomic particles like quarks and muons. </p>
<p>Big bodies like planets have gravity and other Newtonian physics.</p>
<p>Subatomic particles donâ€™t adhere to Newtonian physics and have things like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. </p>
<p>String theory is our best current guess as to how we can unify both sets of physics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strings are supposed to be the very fundamental thing, so it's not &quot;made of&quot; anything else. A string is just a string. And I'm not sure exactly what it means to ask what the significance of it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe they are asking, what does the &quot;string&quot; in String Theory represent, and if you could explain it to someone who has only a layman's understanding of physics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strings are not made of anything, they are supposed to be the basic building blocks of matter. Macroscopically some strings will correspond to fundamental particles, like electrons or quarks, but there could be also strings with no known macroscopic interpretation. The most basic reason to use strings is to remove infinities from certain quantum calculations. The basic objects of QFT are Feynman diagrams which look like <a href="https://protonsforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/feynman-diagram1.jpeg" target="_blank">this</a>. This is a diagram of electron interaction via virtual photons, and QFT considers certain integrals over such diagrams. However, the singular vertices of these diagrams cause problems, so one assumes that those line diagrams are really a large-scale limit of smooth surfaces, like in <a href="http://universe-review.ca/I15-15-topology3.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> picture. At a great distance a loop can look like a point and a surface can look like a graph. Since those surfaces are now smooth, the theory behaves much better. There are also more abstract and technical reasons to assume that particles are represented by strings, but I won't discuss them here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love to, but already dropped physics way back in first year of college cause I could never remember formulas or anything math or science related in English (I went to a bilingual high school, first year college was the second class after OAC where I had maths and science in English, all of elementary and high school was French).  Plus I had ADHD and my memory was always terrible (which I found out later on was due to having MS)... </p>
<p>I prefer looking at it more like I found my usefulness in supporting architecture of the massive processing you guys need.  I'm really good at it, and in my current position I can help across multiple industries.  So I build private and public &quot;clouds&quot; (I hate that word), and you guys use it to do something awesome!</p>
<p>I'm really glad you guys are doing this stuff and joining theories together to make a story for us.  It's a lot of work, but it's so cool and I'm really excited to see what you guys find next!  Thanks :)</p></div>		</li>
