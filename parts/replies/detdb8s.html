<blockquote>
<p>Entanglement <em>manifests</em> as measurement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but the two are fundamentally linked, yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's things like these that make me regret having a horrible experience with physics in High School. No mention of Quantum Physics and its mysteries. Just a teacher that riddiculed our graph making skills. </p>
<p>Do we have any idea what the benifit of this is in nature, or is this phenomena primarily caused by humans?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's the reason the world around us looks largely classical.</p>
<p>Physics isn't like biology though, where there is some kind of utility justification for the way things are (e.g., we see visible light because it's the peak of the sun's spectrum, or giraffes have long necks to reach taller trees). Those explanations arise because biological systems have the opportunity to try out lots of different options, and then the most useful ones become more prolific. In physics we're stuck with the Universe we've got; it's not like the Universe tried different options and kept the most useful traits.</p></div>		</li>
