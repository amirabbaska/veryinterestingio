			<div class="markdown"><p>I have participated in surgeries to repair cloacal exstrophy, where most of the internal abdominal organs are exposed and the bladder and genitalia were split. It took a team of general, urology and orthopedic surgeons to do the repair on a 500 gram baby. It was both the saddest and most fascinating case I have ever scrubbed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While true, it isn't exactly true that it does not favor efficiency or effectiveness, since those things often offer reproductive advantage. Many features are in a balance between effectiveness and energy cost.  Many functions can be done better but to do so costs energy that is better used elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, when people mention evolution by natural selection they usually use the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, while it should be &quot; survival of the fit enough&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Survival of the fit enough&quot; describes a situation in which genetic variation is maintained in the population, like having different skin tones. Once a trait becomes fixed, like having two lungs, though, if this happens by natural selection then it can only be survival of the fittest. The expectation is that other things being equal, beneficial alleles will become fixed, so survival of the fittest is a perfectly acceptable phrase. It's important to understand that it in our modern understanding of evolution the phrase refers to genetic traits and whether they remain in the population, though, not individuals and whether they live or die.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This will be factored into the ability to survive. For instance, it is believed that our sensory organs are clustered near our brain because it would be too expensive to create them elsewhere and grow all the extra nerve tissue. That could also be due decreased conduction time giving them better response time. It's difficult to know with evolution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genuinely curious, what papers suggest senses are <del>near</del> always required near the brain (as opposed to coincidentally near the brain as a means of shortening distance)? That seems human/vertebrate centric, and even then our touch isn't centralized. Neither is proprioception, or many of the non-classical senses. And other animals can vary, like raccoons having a form of taste in their paws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the most primitive animals, all senses are decentralised and are processed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_net" target="_blank">nerve nets</a>, so a tentacle of a jellyfish can respond to prey by local neuronal processing of sensory information without any information processing of the event occurring in the rest of the animal, but as animals become more sophisticated in their behaviours, the sensory processing gets increasingly centralised and you end up with a central nerve cluster or brain emerging that has sensory information routed to it via nerves.  This allows the entire animal to respond in a coordinated manner to sensory inputs, rather than having parts of the animal acting autonomously in response to local sensory inputs, but there's no requirement for sensory inputs to be proximal to the organ that processes them; it's just convenient in some animals, especially in bilaterally symmetrical animals where there's a front and rear and you can have a head containing a brain and sensor package tightly integrated with each other.  It's not the only way of doing it, but it's an effective way for mobile, active creatures with complex behaviours, and even then, you still have distributed senses like touch and sometimes taste (flies tasting with their feet comes to mind).  The higher the bandwidth of a sensory organ (which translates to thicker nerve bundles to transmit the information to the brain) and the lower the response time required, the more pressure there will be to keep the sensory organ close to the brain.</p></div>		</li>
