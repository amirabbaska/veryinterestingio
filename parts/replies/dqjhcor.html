			<div class="markdown"><p>In the pharma world a large number of items are given expiration dates for non-liability purposes.  Once an expiration date has been reached, the manufacturer no longer has any requirements for tracking or recall.  Expiration dates are put on items that should never expire, like Oxygen in steel cylinders, because if it ever were to be determined that the oxygen was adulterated (or the production process was not documented correctly) after the expiration date, the manufacturer would not have to spend tons of money on a recall.</p>
<p>Since pharmaceutical manufacturers and food manufacturers share the same regulator and many of the same regulatory rules, I would expect similar circumstances in food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently found canned food from before 1990. Can confirm: some cans do leak within 30 years. Dried black ooze, sticking out to the shelf. And a white plastic bottle of Clorox had started to leak out, it looked like white hairs coming out of the bottle.</p></div>		</li>
