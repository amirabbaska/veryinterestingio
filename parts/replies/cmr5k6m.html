			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to consider is the fact that that sphere relationally speaking is like 1000 miles wide and high. Thats still a whole lot of water, id be curious to see it in realation to the size of the moon to be honest :).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>The Chicxulub crater is a prehistoric impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.  The crater is more than 180 kilometres (110 mi) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, making the feature one of the largest confirmed impact structures on Earth; the impacting bolide that formed the crater was at least 10 km (6 mi) in diameter.  The impact associated with the crater is implicated in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.</em></p>
<p>So yeah, 100x bigger than necessary.  That is assuming they have the same mass and velocity.  Every time I try to find out how big asteroids are, they are always described in volume instead of mass.  I don't know why. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Such an understatement. Something that big would liquify and sterilize the earth as well as throw off a near equal amount of debris into space. </p></div>		</li>
