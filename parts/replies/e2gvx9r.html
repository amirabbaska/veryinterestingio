			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that precision is probably more reasonable for the circadian rhythm to handle alone, but when it comes to waking on the minute or just seconds before (as OP also suggests in the title), confirmation bias if probably part of it.</p>
<p>It may also be that the last state between sleep and away is somewhat fuzzy, you may consider yourself asleep although you're really awake, and because you're really awake even for several minutes, and you hear the alarm, you realise you're actually awake but you don't realise for how long and it has been and just consider it a couple of seconds and still think you were asleep before that. (edit: as /u/baggier already mentioned)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same. I've had the same sleep schedule a bit over 3 years now. I wake up 5-10 minutes before my alarm goes off 5-6 days a week. The day or two that I don't is generally caused by something interrupting my sleep, usually my cat waking me up an hours or so before my alarm goes off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if you wake up an hour before the alarm you go back to sleep. Theres a good chance you won't remember that. If you wake up 5 minutes before, you stay awake</p></div>		</li>
