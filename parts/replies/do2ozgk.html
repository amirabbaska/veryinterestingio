<p>Maybe in our current political climate where a company taking an anti Nazi stance when releasing their Nazi killing franchise game is somehow a political statement, people just can't see that someone would enjoy their house looking good over the work of a vegetable garden.</p></div>		</li>

<ol>
<li>Pressure of society (the wealthy have decorative llants, not utility plants)</li>
<li>Restrictions (like condos or HOA's)</li>
<li>Complexity (veggies require specific fertilizers, have different harvest rates, and can start growing &quot;wild&quot; if not trimmed correctly)</li>
<li>Difficulty (cleanup of biomass after)</li>
<li>Fear (animals peeing in your crop, humans stealing it)</li>
<li>A touch of cognitive dissonance. Food seems &quot;cleaner&quot; when purchased in a store. You never see it in the dirt covered in bugs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Depends. Stuff like tomatoes, given the watering and soil, not to mention the work hours you put into it, you really don't save. On the other hand, the freshness and ripeness can be worth it. I can get tomatoes at the store for like $2/lb, but to get ones equivalent to what I would grow would end up $5/lb, but mine would be fresher. Especially pickling, you can pickle store vegetables but they come out significantly better picked that day.</p></div>		</li>
