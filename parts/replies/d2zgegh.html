			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I feel like you have answered everything except the question. You only told us that you make so called organic wine, hence there are few pesticides to taste.</p>
<p>I would like to know if you can taste the pesticides used during growth. Only about 10% of the wineries use only sulfur and copper (those are considered the organic wines). What about the 90% left that use hardcore chemicals?
Look up red Mouton Cadet 2010, 14 different pesticides have been found in it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify I use other pesticides as well.
There is no indication that these directly impact the wine flavor. But I am positing that by changing the makeup of what bacteria and yeasts live on the grape, they can indirectly affect the flavor of a wine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm kinda deviating from the main topic here, but I'm curious about pesticide application in vineyards (I'm an ag engineer and do research in chemical application). How large is your vineyard? How do you typically handle pesticide applications (like tractor, aerial application, using back-pack sprayers)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Organic doesn't mean less pesticides. By volume, it often actually means more pesticides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the government yes. In reality probably not.
When we get grapes in from the vineyard, before we crush, we add a small amount of sulfur to limit the growth of the bacteria on the grapes.
We also add some after the wine is fermenting, and this acts as a natural and safe preservative.
Interestingly white wines have a significantly higher concentration of sulfites a then red wines, but most people believe that they have a sulfite intolerance if they react poorly to red wine.
In practice now, most premium wines, have low enough levels of sulfites, that unless you are severely intolerant they won't affect you.
Gallo, has recently achieved complete elimination of sulfur based on some unbelievably sensitive tests, and are lobbying the FDA/USDA for permission to sell sulfite free wines. Their initial applications were denied, because the grapes at one point had sulfur on them.
So very interesting question, and long story short it depends on your perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wine has much lower levels of sulfites than malt beverages. If someone suspects they have a sulfite allergy, they can confirm it with a six pack of Mike's Hard Lemonade.

I love the smell of wine, but have given up trying to enjoy it. I can drink champagne, but it seems like only certain years and certain brands. Maybe it's time I understood what makes me feel so gross so quickly so I can enjoy a glass or two. Is it not the sulfites?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sulfites are a byproduct of fermentation, so all wines contain sulfites.  They are also commonly used at various stages of winemaking, as antimicrobials/antioxidants.  Some people have massively reduced or stopped adding sulfites because they believe it interferes with the 'true' flavour of the wine (this is very contentious), but they still have to put the 'contains sulfites' label on their bottles.  Some will additionally specify that they didn't add any sulfites.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, so there are four levels. The first level is a multiple choice test with over a 90% pass rate. So, not exactly a rigorous test of knowledge. The second level is slightly more in depth, and adds a requirement that you taste and identify a few wines. If you have seen SOMM, it's nothing like that. We are talking generalities e.g., this is a white wine, sweet, doesn't have a lot of fruit so it is from Europe, it tastes like reisling so it's probably from Germany, and hey I had to memorize that one region in Germany during class, so I bet it's from that region. It really isn't rocket science.
Levels 3 and 4 are significantly more difficult. I I respect the hell out of the advanced (3) and master (4) somms. They have dedicated their whole lives to the study of wines, and they objectively know a ton! Us over 200 people have ever become level 4s. It is absurdly difficult.
The main issue is much of their knowledge is bullshit. The believe in something called terroir (tear-waa). This is A concept propogated by the French to explain why their wine is superior to other regions' wines. Essentially the concept boils down to climate, soil, and magic (I shit you not). No one will argue soil and climate are important factors, but many other regions of the world have very similar climate and soil to France. So they claim some undefined quality exists only in certain regions that allows these regions to produce wine of a superior quality. The job of a sommelier is to memorize these regions, and identify wines from these regions. To some extent this is very simple. I could teach you in an hour to reliably distinguish French Cabernet from Napa Cabernet. But the extremes they take this system to, have no basis in scientific reality.
I am a biologist by training. Before I made wine I studied large groups of different species living in a single location. (Think all the different bacteria you have in your gut). Coming from this background, there is a very simple solution to the magic property of each region. The bacteria/yeast in the soil and in the air. Some recent studies have started to lend credence to this idea. The problem with this, is that means France etc. are no longer super special wine regions. We could take the bacteria and yeast from these regions, and mimic their effects in other regions to produce wines indistinguishable from authentic French wine.
Somms are reticent to accept that their magical terroir is simply some bacteria and yeast. As a result they have vehemently opposed this idea, in spite of mounting scientific evidence. These are the climate change deniers of the wine world!
On a slightly more personal note, I despise the somm certification program, because to become a level 4 somm you literally do not have to know how wine is made. I'm not talking detailed description either.
There is not a single question at any level of certification that asks about the process of wine making. They don't need to know about sulfites or the chemical constituents of wine. Yet they are self proclaimed experts.
I often pour my wine for somms looking to add wines to their restaurant menus. I invariably get asked some amazing questions, though my favorite will always be when a somm didn't know how grapes were picked!
We made the mistake of taking a group out into the field to talk about harvest, and to let them pick some grapes to get a feel for the process. They literally didn't understand that we had to walk to each cluster and cut it off (machine harvesting is not used for high end wines. Ever.) I am still not sure how they thought we harvested the grapes. Maybe through the magic of terroir?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to respond to a few of your points:</p>
<p>1) The series of exams administered by the Court of Master Sommeliers (CMS) are not what makes a person a sommelier. While they are certainly useful benchmarks, many excellent (even world-class) sommeliers haven't done any of the levels. If you're going to discuss the &quot;bullshit propagated by sommeliers&quot; it's worth reminding people of this fact.</p>
<p>2) The concept of terroir is widely used in the industry across countries and professions (including winemakers) so to characterize as a purely French idea (despite its French name) is misleading. It's also a term without a single accepted definition, so while some people will have definitions that are overly specific (i.e. when some people say &quot;terroir&quot; they mean soil) other definitions are pretty general and include climatic, soil, and microbiological factors which add up to a sense of place.</p>
<p>3) No one really thinks magic is involved in terroir. There's a huge difference between not understanding all the elements involved in terroir and thinking there is some magic at work. Painting sommeliers with this brush is not only unfair, it's absurd. Our understanding of the factors that contribute to terroir is evolving and becoming better as time passes. Increasing knowledge about the role of microbiology is a good example of this.</p>
<p>3) The inclusion of the factors listed above (and others as well) in a definition of terroir implies that some replication of the microbiological environment of a vineyard  - assuming such a thing were really possible - would be insufficient to replicate the terroir of that vineyard, unless all the other conditions were the same. So in order to replicate Chambertin in the U.S., all I would need is the same soil, light exposure, temperature fluctuation, average rainfall, etc., and then replicate the microbiological environment as well. Such a thing is self-evidently impossible.</p>
<p>4) Every serious sommelier understands how wine is made and at least some of the elements involved. It is frankly impossible to become a master sommelier without knowing how wine is made. They probably don't know as much as a winemaker (unless they get involved in winemaking themselves), but in terms of factors influencing flavor, this is a very important thing for sommeliers to help them sell wines to guests. And from a common sense point of view, think about what you're saying: A sommelier who cares enough about his/her career to study for exams and spend the time and money required to take them, is also not interested enough in wine to read about how it is made. How likely does that seem? So let's take as true that no questions about winemaking are asked on these exams (I don't think it is true, but for the sake of argument), that does not in any way imply that sommeliers won't know anything about it.</p>
<p>5) Even if your points about how little somms know about grape-growing, terroir, winemaking etc were true, it wouldn't necessarily make them poor sommeliers. The job of a sommelier (traditionally speaking) is to sell wine in a restaurant. If you're able to take a bottle of wine and properly analyze its flavor by tasting it, through guest interaction determine that that bottle of wine is what they are looking for, and sell them that bottle, then you have done your job. You have done your job well if your analysis was correct and the guest enjoys the bottle. That's why the CMS exams for levels 2-4 include a practical service demonstration. It acknowledges that the sommelier must apply any knowledge they have in a practical setting, that of selling wine and serving it to a guest.</p>
<p>6) I think this salesmanship element shouldn't be underestimated, because often it leads somms to use verbiage with guests that is more poetic than technical. There's definitely a balance that has to be hit, but that's a pretty challenging balance to strike, given that the somm probably doesn't know when he/she approaches a table what the knowledge level of the guests will be.</p>
<p>7) I don't even know how to respond to the grape picking anecdote, except that anyone serious (anyone who is doing the exams) and even anyone who has seen a wine documentary will know that some grapes are hand-harvested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read about the film Bottle Shock, where during a blind taste test the French wine experts were horrified to learn they had rated American wines as better to their own.</p>
<p>My understanding is they played it down and tried to suppress it, and the only reporter who covered the story was blacklisted from covering any future events. This was back in the 70's. Is this accurate, and if so have there been any other significant points in poking at wine culture? </p>
<p>It almost amazes me how that much ego can spread and self sustain.</p>
<p>Edit: Changed to the correct decade. And Bottle Shock was a drama film, not a documentary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness, the same stuff you talked about in your first post (complex groups of bacteria and other microfauna) are a big part of what makes terroir reasonable.</p>
<p>Even if you have the same soil at the same latitude with the same aspect (facing) and the same type of weather effects (moderation of rivers, rain shadow effect, irrigation - all depends), the yeast and other fauna present won't necessarily be the same, leading to a different set of flavors.</p>
<p>Not to mention any of the more dramatic factors that make certain sites unique - Kimmeridgian clay in Chablis, or eucalyptus literally dripping onto Shiraz in Australia, for example.</p>
<p>The real gist of terroir, at least as I interpret it, is that the process of making wine is composed of so many different factors - both those that we can and can't control - that it's impossible (or at least extremely unlikely) to make the same wine somewhere else.</p>
<p>Doesn't mean the French are the best - does mean that vineyard sites are unique.</p></div>		</li>
