			<div class="markdown"><p>No, Antarctica is warmer than the average for Antarctica this time of year. Ohio is colder than the average for Ohio this time of year. </p>
<p>Those maps are about deviation from the average, not absolute temperatures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this. Right now it's been a record warm year in AZ. We have been 80 degrees for weeks now and doesn't even seem like it's going to snow in Tucson this year at all. If we went by my local weather you would think it's a sure sign of global warming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My high school level understanding of physics is that high pressure areas are attracted to low pressure areas, and that warm air has a lower pressure than the more condensed cold air. Which would mean that cold air moves towards warm air. I'm probably wrong here, but it would seem like parts of NA are abnormally cold <em>because</em> surrounding areas are abnormally hot; the hot areas are drawing air out, lowering their pressure, and making the already cold areas even colder. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Another thing that can change that is humidity, if the warm areas have higher humidity levels it will create higher pressure and push back the cold front. </p>
<p>Without looking at the jet stream map I would guess the subtropical jet stream is coming in over the Baja California and moving fast east and the polar jet stream is coming from northern Alaska and headed south east getting spun so it loses a lot of moisture being over land for so long and also pulling more arctic cold into it. </p>
<p>If the subtropic jet stream dipped lower and missed the south or slowed down so it lost moisture the arctic jet could push further south and pick up more warmth. Or if the polar jet dipped down below Alaska before hitting the continent it would pick up moisture and heat to bring a crap ton more snow but warmer weather overall.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This part is correct...</p>

<p>This part, not so much. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7nm4ub/when_it_is_crazy_cold_in_the_us_does_that_mean/ds38vb4/" target="_blank">See my explanation here</a> for the reason the Eastern US is colder than usual while the Western US is hotter than usual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leaves don't fall Octoberish any more, my back yard tree hasn't even fully shed and last year around mid January it finally did and it immediately sproutted green... Climate change is messing with the tree's cycle. Also I have read that in AZ the days aren't necessarily getting hotter but there are more hot days in comparison to cold days then in the past. This is expected to get worse in the future.  One article went as far as to say that phx will be uninhabitable in like 30 years and asu professor coming out to that wasn't true. Lots of southwestern states have been talking to Israel because Israel manages their water supply so well. </p></div>		</li>
