			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I know we are beaten over the head with most important meal of the day messaging, but the truth is, you don't <em>need</em> breakfast once you are an adult. It is actually <em>ok</em> to be really hungry when lunchtime comes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of that &quot;most important meal of the day&quot; bullshit messaging came from the cereal companies decades ago. It's all marketing and got integrated into our collective 'common knowledge'...not people just take it as fact. I wish we weren't controlled by advertising. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? I rarely eat breakfast because honestly I'm never hungry enough until about 11am. (Usually at work by 8) people have always told me I should be eating as soon as I get out of bed but it always felt unnatural.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do children actually need it? My kids seem to differ (age 7 and 5, the 2 year old always wants it), some days they say they don't want it and I don't push it because I don't want to stuff up their hunger cues but then I feel bad sending them to school without eating.<br />
They have a dedicated thing called crunch and sip at school, so they eat a piece of fruit and have some water mid morning. So they're eating within about 3-4 hours of waking at least.<br />
Why am I asking you, I should probably Google it but now I've typed it out...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I rarely eat breakfast and it was the same when I was a kid. Eating any kind of food after waking up just doesn't sound at all appealing to me, so if your kids are like me, I'd say don't force them if they're not interested in eating breakfast.</p>
<p>My mum used to make a breakfast every morning, but I usually barely touched it, so it was kind of a wasted effort from her. My sister at in the morning, though, as far as I can remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>one of the best advice is this. &quot;don't eat when you don't feel hungry&quot; I love it that you don't push kids to eat when they are not feeling it. </p></div>		</li>

On that note, I apologise this is not a response to your question.</p></div>		</li>
