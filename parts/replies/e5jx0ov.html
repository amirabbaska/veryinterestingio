<p>The satellites used for TV are much much more powerful, around 10-20kW,</p>

<p>That's the TOTAL power for a BIG satellite. Each transponder in a communications satellite has a typical power of 100 watts. Add the power for a hundred transponders plus losses and you may get something like 20 kW, but the transmitted power for the channel your antenna is receiving is no more than 100 W.</p></div>		</li>

The Astra 2 'satellite' actually consists of <a href="https://en.kingofsat.net/pos-28.2E.php" target="_blank">3 satellites</a> close together, so your satellite dish sees them as one. <a href="https://en.kingofsat.net/sat-astra2g.php" target="_blank">Each satellite</a> has dozens of transponders. Two transponders can be received at the same frequency if their polarities (horizontal, vertical) are different. Each transponder can send several TV/radio/other channels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most have information on the right about how many transponders they have and what bands.</p>
<p>You can also see the model of the satellite they are using.  If you are curious about the output power still I would just google the stats for that model, they vary considerably between models.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>in space, do they gather enough power to maintain that? And the cooling!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, those are two big problems.</p>
<p>The power comes from solar panels, and batteries when the satellite goes through an eclipse. We are right now going through eclipse season, which happens twice a year when the earth gets aligned with the sun from the satellite's perspective. The batteries, which used to be nickel-hydrogen in the old days but are mostly lithium ion today, must last fifteen years at least with no replacement, so they spend a lot of engineering time doing analyses to maintain each cell for all those years.</p>
<p>The solar panels need to be <a href="https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Spectrolab-Intelsat35e-879x485.jpg" target="_blank">very large</a> to get 10 kW+. </p>
<p>Cooling is done by radiation alone, of course. This is also a very delicate design, there are extensive tests in <a href="https://phys.org/news/2012-06-trial-vacuum-galileo-satellites-closer.html" target="_blank">thermal-vacuum chambers</a> to validate the design of each satellite. These chambers are among the biggest investments a company must do to start producing satellites.</p>
<p>The heat must be radiated away to empty space, but any surface that radiates heat is also exposed to sunlight from one side, so it's a very complex calculation and design effort to make it work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Telecommunication companies have their own satellites, which are built by the same companies that build scientific and military satellites. And the same companies that launch military and scientific satellites also launch commercial satellites.</p>
<p>There are launch companies, such as Arianespace, which canlaunch two satellites in the same rocket. In those cases, it could be any two clients who happen to have a satellite ready for launch around the same time. It could be a scientific and a commercial satellite on the same flight, it depends on the particular occasion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WUT! I just became so much more fascinated with GPS. I should just use Google but I have so many questions. Does this mean the GPS satellite just repeats the same signal? Does the earth bound device find this signal and then calculate the difference between what it finds and its reference signal to determine location? There has to be more than one GPS satellite, right? I always wondered about how we overcome background noise. I always assumed we overpowered it or found a way to ignored it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Starting with a idealised system:</p>
<p>There are 24 satellites each in perfectly circular orbits containing a perfect clock. At exactly midnight, each satellite starts transmitting a pseudo random code. This code lasts exactly 24 hours and then is repeated the next day. Each satellite transmits a different code.</p>
<p>Your receiver has a model of where all the satellites should be vs the time of day. If you know the time exactly, and can pick up the signal from three satellites then yes, you simply measure the time difference between the signal you receive and the identical code generated in your receiver. If you know this and the speed of light then you can triangulate your position via the intersection of three spheres. (GPS assumes you are on earth, technically the same method would give a point in space too!). </p>
<p>Now to the imperfect real world.
The clock in your receiver is just a regular quartz clock, not an atomic clock like the satellites, so there will be a very signicant error. Three spheres will always intersect, however if you pick up the signal from a fourth satellite, then if there is any error in your clock the spheres will not intersect to a point, but to a volume. You can use this to adjust your receivers internal clock until the four spheres intersect to a point and you can calculate where you are. Modern receivers can blend the signal from over 10 satellites to give a more accurate position. </p>
<p>In reality the satellites orbits aren't circular, so the GPS signal actually encodes a bit of information describing how the orbit deviates from a perfect one. If this data is out of date then it's very difficult to pick up a signal and work out location. This is why old GPS's could take forever to lock on if they weren't used for a long time. Also if you know roughly where you are on the earth you can dramatically speed up fix time. Ground based radar is used to measure the satellites position, which is transmitted to the satellites, also any timing errors are accounted for and sent to the satellites. The timing errors accrue because of relativity! The satellites are moving faster than the earth and this needs to be corrected for periodically.</p>
<p>To pick up the signal in simple terms, you measure the signal at your receiver and you add to it the pseudo random signal. You threshold the combined signal so everything above a level is a 1 and everything below a level is a 0. In this case you'll just get a bunch of random 1's and 0's. If you now time phase your random signal back and forth, when it lines up with the real signal, suddenly you find those random 1's and 0's are a little less random and start to match your pseudo random signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting tidbit is GPS in phones. Firstly your phone can download the latest satellite position data when you use the GPS. It's also possible to roughly triangulate your position from the radio masts your phone can see. Android takes this further and uses the information of which WiFi networks you can see too. The interesting bit is addition lots of modern mobile phones contain a barometer too. They use this to estimate your elevation. If you know your elevation and rough position you can enable a near instantaneous GPS fix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 31 satellites actually and you need to be able to see 4. Three for direction and one for time. Basically each satellite sends out where it is and what time it has. Since light takes time to travel if you know the time it was sent and the time it arrived you can figure out how far you are from the satellite. If you know your distance from three points then you can figure out your location. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You only need 3 for a basic fix.  Three distances (each making a sphere) produce two discrete points.  The point closest to the Geoid (mean surface) of the Earth is picked as the winner.  There are <em>lots</em> of people that post online that you somehow use a fourth satellite to calculate the time.  That's incorrect.</p>
<p>As stated above accurate GPS time is...</p>
<p>The simplified version is that it makes an educated guess on the time based on ephemeris data, then attempts to plot a location, looks at the error, adjusts the clock based on this, repeats that several time while recording all the adjustments, then adjusts the clock rate based on that. Once the clock is mostly tuned, it switches into a phased-lock-loop to get the rest of the way and stay there.</p>
<p>That said, four or more are certainly better, especially if you are not an an altitude close to the geoid.</p></div>		</li>

Water resonates at 2.45 GHz so you'd really like to not be standing in front of a thousand watts at that frequency...  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_burn" target="_blank">It's happened</a>.  My understanding is people have been burned by eg: fighter jet radar too.  You're not supposed to power it up on the tarmac really</p></div>		</li>
