			<div class="markdown"><p>im rather confused now.
So, i could put an infinite amount of photons in the same place. But it might happen, that this infinite amount of zero mass creates a black hole with a huge mass?  Ok, makes sense with energy = constant x matter.</p>
<p>For the kugelblitz, does it have something like a halftime?</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glueball" target="_blank">I found this</a>, I'm beginning to think it's possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In particle physics, a glueball...is a hypothetical composite particle. It consists solely of gluon particles</p>
<p>Glueballs are predicted by quantum chromodynamics to be massive, notwithstanding the fact that gluons themselves have zero rest mass in the Standard Model. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to be very careful here or else you can easily lead people astray. <em>Single</em> photons are massless under any reasonable definition of mass as we use the term in special or general relativity. Specifically, the type of mass I'm talking about is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass" target="_blank">invariant mass</a>. The invariant mass is defined as E/c^(2) in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center-of-momentum_frame" target="_blank">center of momentum reference frame</a>, but only if such a reference frame can be defined. For example, for a bullet this is the frame in which the bullet is at rest, which is why a synonym for the invariant mass is the <em>rest</em> mass. However in the case of photons we can't meaningfully define such a &quot;rest frame,&quot; exactly because their invariant mass is zero. This fact has important consequences, for example the fact that the speed of a photon has to be equal to c in every non-accelerating frame of reference.</p>
<p>Now for systems of photons if the photons are not all moving in the same direction, we now <em>can</em> define a center of momentum frame for the system. We can then obtain a non-zero rest mass for this system as a whole. But this fact doesn't change the fact that individual photons remain massless in a very real sense.</p></div>		</li>

<li>No, (individual) photons have zero mass.</li>
<li>Okay, <em>technically</em> it depends on how you define mass. Using the modern definition, &quot;mass&quot; means the same thing as &quot;rest mass&quot; and photons have zero mass. There was a time when it was common that &quot;mass&quot; meant the total energy in different units, a thing that was also called &quot;relativistic mass&quot; when it was necessary to make a distinction.</li>
</ol>
<p>In classical mechanics, it's all a moot point because there are no relativistic effects. You can't meaningfully say that the m of classical mechanics is (rest) mass and not energy (a.k.a. relativistic mass), or vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, you could put any finite number in the same place, which is genuinely very different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could we realistically create such a Kugelblitz this way? For the very hypothetical &quot;black hole drive&quot; to power space ships, would this be a possible (or even the best) way to create the black holes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically yes, the problem is that the energy we get out from Hawking Radiation cannot be more than the total energy and mass put in. If we're using photons to create a black hole then the total energy it can give off is equal to the energy that were in the photons. We do not magically gain energy this way.</p>
<p>While a black hole might also be a theoretically efficient way to store energy, it is difficult to use the energy efficiently. A black hole  still has mass and would require being accelerated along with a space ship. Also the smaller a black hole is the more energy it gives off until it explodes very violently. In any case, it is most likely much more efficient to use fusion to power your spaceship since you can control it's rate better and you can direct it more efficiently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we were using black holes as an energy source, it seems the only hard part is creating one (and not letting it explode). Once it's made, you could feed it mass, effectively turning &quot;garbage&quot; into energy. A black hole powered space ship could collect an asteroid and feed that into the black hole. They wouldn't have to worry about getting the correct fuel, any mass would work.</p></div>		</li>
