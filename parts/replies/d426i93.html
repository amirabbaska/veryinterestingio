			<p>Technically (and importantly), it's formed from not-matter, rather than not-mass. A kugelblitz is formed from radiant energy, because that energy has mass. It's a misconception that photons don't have any mass at all. They have zero rest-mass, which is different.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JoshuaPearce" target="_blank">JoshuaPearce</a>
			<p>Well, you're right, which is what makes rest mass such a confusing topic. Rest mass is the mass a particle/object has in the frame of reference where that particle is stationary (where it has no kinetic energy). And of course, a photon moves at light speed, so that particular frame of reference is not generally a useful thing, because no time can pass.<br><br>The frame of reference where a photon is at rest is basically a divide by zero. Which is why a photon has a rest mass of zero, but still has momentum and can carry mass relative to other particles.<br><br>Edit: It's why I can <em>get away</em> with saying that, it's obviously not the actual mechanism. The mechanism is that photons are force carriers which behave in the way photons behave, because photons are photons and photons are not matter.</p>		</li>

			<p>Light always travel at light speed. The slowing down of the speed is because when the light colide with other particules it is absorbed. The particle that absorbed the light now has an excess of energy and will emit photon to come back to equilibrum. The emited photon will scatter or continue in the same direction depending on the situation. Different materials behave differently, like mirror for instance. So, the slowing down is because of the time it takes to absorb and emit the photon and how many molecules interact with the passing light. My physics class are a long way behind so there's probably some innacuracy but thats the jist of it.</p>		</li>

			<p>A system of photons can have non-zero mass only if not all of the photons have parallel momenta. (Mass is not additive in relativity.) In principle, a system of photons moving radially inward could have a large enough mass density to create a black hole.<br><br>Describing it as &quot;formed from excessive energy, not excessive mass&quot; is not right. All that matters is the mass of the system, not the energy. For one, any particle can always be given arbitrarily large energy by boosting into an appropriate frame. But the mass of a system is Lorentz invariant.<br><br>/r/RobusEtCeleritas and company are doing fine at answering the questions though.

			<p>I knew this as well. I'm curious why non-resting mass is not considered an equally valid version of mass? It seems to be under the assumption that things want to return to zero velocity, but if you assumed the opposite, that all things are always moving no matter what, the rest-mass vs non-resting mass conundrum goes away. Then, it really makes me wonder why the Higgs boson matters if we're so focused on rest-mass for no good reason.</p>		</li>

			<p>That fundamental particle spin is quantised can be determined by using iron magnets.

			<p>The null is that there is a statistical fluctuation which is responsible for the signal, so it can go away by a more careful analysis of the data. The treshold where discovery of a particle is announced is at 5 sigma, which corresponds to a 1 : 3.5 mio chance of a statistical fluctuation giving results as extreme as you see in your data. </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bortkik" target="_blank">bortkik</a>
			<p>Ok, so that establishes that the signal is real, but what is the null in comparison to <em>the particle</em>? Particles that only exist for fractions of a second sounds just a tiny bit like pixie dust to me. Again, excuse my ignorance, but why couldn't such a signal come the very same thing that produces the other bosonic/fermionic/etc signals? You classify them into this periodic table of sorts for particles, but say one signal is a result of looking at the hippo from the front, one signal is looking at it from behind, one signal is 45000 feet in space looking down on it, and one signal is on a beeline for its ass. Perhaps this raises a more fundamental question.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's a good question. Generally any motion of systems of particles that cannot be transformed away by choosing another inertial frame of reference, like rotation, will contribute to the mass of the system. Vibrations are also tricky but you can minimize the contribution from them by choosing the center of momentum frame. However if you just look at a single particle, say an electron, there are no vibrations but you have quantum mechanical spin which cannot really be talked about in the relativistic framework.</p>		</li>

			<p>Rest mass is more of a concept for our convenience than a thing the universe cares about directly.

			<p>Okay, so the idea is that photons move at the speed of light (in a vacuum), thus they can create this &quot;aritificial&quot; mass, but other particles do not move at the same speed, thus there needs to be some sort of way to anchor the concept of mass to a constituent particle to reconcile the observed effects of mass. Why couldn't it be a periodic motion (vibrational or rotational) that accomplishes the same &quot;artificial&quot; mass in the place that we are looking for the Higgs?</p>		</li>

			<p>If you want here is a bit of math<br><br>Mass in relativity is the modulus of the 4-momentum (which is a vector that has the momentum and energy as it's components, i.e. (E,px,py,pz)).<br><br>You have that:<br><br>E^2 - (pc)^2 = (mc^(2))^2 (in relativity we take modulus with the - sign)<br><br>If your particle is not moving, p = 0 and E=mc^2 and if your mass is 0, E = pc (which is the case of the photon). You can prove that for photons, E=pc (using electromagnetism or quantum mechanics) and from that it's mass is zero.<br><br>Now imagine that you have 2 particles, both with the same energy E but one with momentum +p and the other with momentum -p.<br><br>The total energy of the system is just 2E, but the total momentum is +p-p = 0, therefore you have that the total mass is<br><br>(2E)^2 - 0^2 = (mc^(2))^2 =&gt; m = 2E/c^2<br><br>This means that even if each one of the particles has 0 mass, i.e. they have E=pc, since the total system has 0 momentum, it has some mass.<br><br>Mass in relativity is not additive like in classical mechanics. A group of N particles with mass M will not have a total mass of M+M+...+M = N<em>M.<br><br>You could be thinking how is it that mass doesn't add in relativity but it does in classical mechanics? Ok. Remember that if p=0, then E=mc^2. This means that if you increase the momentum, the energy will increase, but it will always be greater then this value. Take a look <a href="http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/einsteinlight/jw/images/totalenergy2.gif" target="_blank">at this graph</a>.<br><br>For very small values of velocity, your momentum is small, and you vector will be basically in the direction of E (remember, we are dealing with a vector with components E,px,py,pz). If you have 2(or more) vectors all pointing in the same direction, their sum is just the sum of that components value. e.g.<br><br>(x,0,0,0) + (y,0,0,0) = (x+y,0,0,0)<br><br>So, the modulus is just |(x+y,0,0,0)| = (x+y)^2<br><br>Going back to relativity, if you have a vector which is (E1,0,0,0) and you sum with (E2,0,0,0), the modulus is<br><br>(E1+E2)^2 = (mc^(2))^2 -&gt; m = E1/c^2 + E2/c^2 = m1 + m2<br><br>And you get the additive property from classical mechanics.<br><br>You can see from the graph that I linked that this is true in everyday life, since the energy is basically equal to mc^2 while you are below 0.2c which is 6</em>10^(7) m/s. In comparison, a plain going at 10 times the speed of sound (well beyond any typical velocity) will be at 3000 m/s which is around 0.00001c.<br><br>I hope this wasn't too hard to follow. :) <br>edit: typo</p>		</li>

			<p>A system of photons will have a total energy. According to special relativity, there is a mass-energy equivalence (i.e mass is energy and energy is mass). As a result, they have a mass.<br><br>The reason we say photons have no mass is because as the frequency of a photon approaches zero, so does the mass-energy of the photon, suggesting that the mass-energy is a property of it's wavelength.</p>		</li>

			<p>Individual photons really do have zero mass.

			<p>Not really. Photons are photons from the moment they are created. It's not as if other particles speed up, shed their mass and <br>&quot;become a photon&quot;, or something. It's hard to put it simply, but photons are created from various forms of energy. For example, an atom can &quot;lose&quot; energy and spit out a photon. But the mass of the atom stays the same.</p>		</li>

			<p>When an electron orbiting an atom makes a collision with a high energy photon, the photon's energy gets absorbed by the electron, causing it to increase to an excited energy state. In principle (according to quantum mechanics), exciting an atom from it's ground state should increase the size of it's orbital. I could be mistaken though, I am unable to give any mathematical proofs that support this claim. EDIT: An important thing to note, in case you weren't already aware, electrons don't actually orbit the nucleons of an atom the same way the earth orbits the sun. They exist, or rather, tend to accumulate in <del>specific</del> predictable regions around the nucleus.</p>		</li>

			<p>The reason why photons are affected by gravity despite having no mass is because of how gravity is seen in General Relativity: it is a 'curving' of space (and time as well - this is rather confusing, don't worry about it too much) rather than a force in the classical sense that you're probably used to. Because space itself is warped we see the photons follow bent paths around massive objects, rather than moving in a straight line (see the phenomenon known as 'gravitational lensing').<br><br>Extend this to black holes, where space and time are warped to an insane degree, and the photons may not be able to escape since their paths are so warped that they always end up going into the centre of the black hole. The 'event horizon' is the distance from the centre of the black hole beyond which even photons (which move at the maximum speed - the speed of light) cannot escape 'falling' into the centre as they follow their absurdly bent paths, although if they are at or outside that distance they will have enough speed to escape.</p>		</li>

			<p>First of all, with our current experiments (like CERN) we haven't yet been able to confirm whether gravitons actually exist or not, so more or less everything that we say about them is purely theoretical.<br><br>We expect that gravitons will exist because of how we understand the other 3 fundamental forces (electromagnetism and the strong &amp; weak nuclear forces) to work. In my previous post, I said that gravity is different from 'normal', 'everyday' forces when we are looking at it through General Relativity, but even these everyday forces (like pushing a block) are rough approximations of the way that the electromagnetic force works at a fundamental level, which is through quantum interactions (&quot;quantum mechanical-ly&quot;).<br><br>In the quantum theory of electromagnetism, which has been demonstrated by experiment, when two particles interact via the electromagnetic force they effectively create and send other particles to one another - photons in the case of electromagnetism. These force-carrying particles (called 'bosons' in the standard model) are always involved for electromagnetism and the strong &amp; weak nuclear forces (which use different particles) and because these exchanges are required for the force to work, forces act locally, limited by how quickly these particles can move. The idea that the force carrying particles are created is actually possible and even in a complete vacuum, pairs of particles can (and do!) pop in and out of existence while having no effect on the overall picture.<br><br>An equivalent quantum theory for gravity, which combines General Relativity with this quantum concept of force carrying particles - the 'Graviton' would be gravity's force carrier - has yet to be fully figured out since one encounters mathematical issues not present for the other forces. Some theories aim to include all the forces in an overarching 'Quantum theory of everything' while others limit themselves to quantum gravity. Promising candidates include string theory, quantum loop gravity and the more recent theory of causal fermion systems (all of which are pretty wacky).<br><br>While a number of theories exist, the question of which one is correct will come down to experimental measurement. The problem here is that gravitons are expected to have very little mass or even be massless and only interact very weakly with normal matter, making them very difficult to detect by conventional means. The recent discovery of gravitational waves (which you may have seen in the news) is important here because further study of these waves could give us clues about the properties of gravitons, assuming that they even exist of course.<br><br>Overall, gravitons and a provably-correct quantum theory of gravity seem to be a long way off in the world of theoretical physics, but with the recent observations of gravitational waves, things are looking more positive than they ever have done since gravitons were originally theorized back in the early-to-mid 20th century.<br><br>TL;DR: Gravitons are still theoretical and may not even exist, although novel experiments on gravitational waves should give clues as to their properties (if they do exist).</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply, alas I'm still confused. It just seems like the general relativity approach (warping of space-time) and the quantum mechanics approach (force carrying particles) are two entirely separate explanations of gravitational force, that can't both be correct.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/loxorz" target="_blank">loxorz</a>
			<p>Your concern is reasonable, since many proposed theories are based on a fixed space-time background that is not present in General Relativity (where space-time can be warped or changed) and a quantum field of gravity should be 'background independent' (or at least locally). The ideas of how gravitons would interact with space-time are not something I really know about, so I'm afraid I can't add anything else there.<br><br>Loop quantum gravity is an attempt at making such a theory, although again I'll admit that I have no actual understanding of it. These sort of quantum field theories end up being very complicated and abstracted and I (and most others, I expect) find them impossible to relate to our everyday experience of the universe.</p>		</li>

			<p>Theoretically yes, the problem is that the energy we get out from Hawking Radiation cannot be more than the total energy and mass put in. If we're using photons to create a black hole then the total energy it can give off is equal to the energy that were in the photons. We do not magically gain energy this way.<br><br>While a black hole might also be a theoretically efficient way to store energy, it is difficult to use the energy efficiently. A black hole  still has mass and would require being accelerated along with a space ship. Also the smaller a black hole is the more energy it gives off until it explodes very violently. In any case, it is most likely much more efficient to use fusion to power your spaceship since you can control it's rate better and you can direct it more efficiently.</p>		</li>

			<p>If we were using black holes as an energy source, it seems the only hard part is creating one (and not letting it explode). Once it's made, you could feed it mass, effectively turning &quot;garbage&quot; into energy. A black hole powered space ship could collect an asteroid and feed that into the black hole. They wouldn't have to worry about getting the correct fuel, any mass would work.</p>		</li>
