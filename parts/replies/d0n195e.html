			<div class="markdown"><p>The best example I've seen is in the city of Sheffield, UK,  wherein an incinerator for rubbish generates a few MW of energy and also heats one hospital, two universities, and district heating for the city centre. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Incinerator" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Incinerator</a></p>
<p>It gets a lot of flak because it's an incinerator but ferrous metals still gets recycled,  recycled paper hasn't really got a market and this reduces the volume of waste being sent to landfills through pyrolysis. Also it reduces local carbon emissions from heating systems across the city.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We had a law forcing us to separate plastics from the rest of the trash for a while, but they found out that these plants had a hard time burning the remaining trash and added the plastics to fix that, then changed the laws so that only plastic bottles were to be collected separately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recycling paper isn't as energy-efficient as, say, glass or plastic or almost all metals.  Those materials take so much more energy to produce/extract from their most basic forms that it's up to 20 times more efficient to just recycle them.  Paper simply isn't like that.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the main use of recycled paper in the US is as blown-in insulation.  Which it does very well, I'll admit.  But other than that, the fact that it slightly degrades in quality each time it's recycled limits its potential uses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in the UK recycled paper was mostly sold to India and China when they were emerging markets. Domestic demand for recycled paper is far lower than produced so the solution is to burn it or check it. </p>
<p>Sheffield council recognised this and promoted paper recycling because it has a low moisture point perfect for burning than if it was mixed.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogeneration" target="_blank">Cogeneration plants</a> (Power plants providing both electric power and distric heating), is a type of heat engine and therefore follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_cycle" target="_blank">Carnot efficiency</a> law, where the maximum theoretical efficiency of the plant is directly linked to the maximum steam temperature - and larger plants are typically able to sustain higher temperatures, which is why they are generally more efficient (That, and due to operation costs, maintenance etc. are relatively smaller in $/kWh)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just economics of scale, but you also have to remember that smaller steam boilers can only handle lower amounts of steam at lower pressures, and you loose heat much faster from this type of system.</p>
<p>Large steam plants are usually made for power generation, not heating. But the same principle applies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an engineer or qualified to do anything but make a mean burrito but I would guess it's about surface to volume ratio giving an approximately 3/2 scaling power law for the efficiency</p>
<p>now we wait for that thing where people are more likely to give you the answer if you post the wrong one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>economy of scale provides a safe reliable source of utility,contrary to oponion we are not capable to provide every facet of life independent of others,best case scenario is to build central plants with redundant systems that provide utility service,steam,electricity,hot,chilled and potable water not to mention if you locate plants outside urban areas no need for natuaral gas to enter an urban area,similary most progressive community situate services in accesible vaults fir maintenance as well inspection</p></div>		</li>
