<p>Water will bend almost all the light that is passing through it, not reflect it back directly like mirror. This creates the shadow as the light passing through the is hitting a wider area and reducing the light hitting the area behind the water. </p>
<p>Assuming the water is extremely clean and clear this creates much more of an effect.</p>
<p>If you were correct, we would be unable to see very far into water at all. I'm sure you've seen pictures of crystal clear lakes and oceans where you can see the bottom yet it's extremely deep right? Water does reflect some light, but if any significant amount of light was getting bounced backward it would be impossible to see more than a few feet into even the cleanest water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This distorting is exactly <em>why</em> water has a shadow, which is what the parent to your comment said. Even eyeglasses have a shadow. Your scenario is impossible because you are assuming that it's possible to have water or any other liquid that has the same refractive index as air (the only way to get no reflection). The only way for something to be truly invisible is if it has the same index of refraction as whatever medium it is. Then there'd be no reflection, no refraction, and it would be invisible. You can't have refraction without reflection, but you *can* have reflection without refraction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hot air also casts a shadow.  If you’ve seen wavy air in the summer heat, it’s from a difference in density and/or refractive index between cooler air and hotter air.  That wavy air also casts a shadow as well as casts glimmers.  Since light isn’t being absorbed, it can’t darken, so for every spot of shadow (darker than normal) there’s a spot of glimmer (brighter than normal). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water would cast a shadow even if somehow it had the same refractive index as air, though, so long as its density were still higher. It would be a much fainter shadow, possibly even imperceptible depending on how thick the stream was, but it absorbs a nonzero proportion of the light that passes through it and therefore casts a shadow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's not assuming that at all, as he specifically said the water is going to refract the light. That means it has a different refractive index than air. Even in a perfectly smooth stream, and even if you disregard reflections, he said you will see the water, because of diffraction. Far from impossible! </p></div>		</li>
