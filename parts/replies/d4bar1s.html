			<p>The 3 repeats forever, but due to limitations of calculators is stops at a certain decimal point.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's a prime number.  If you try other prime numbers, you will find the same thing.  eg.  11/3=3.66667, which multplied by 3=11.00001.  Now try dividing 11/7, then multiply the quotient by 7.  Prime numbers are indivisible to an exactitude, except by 1 or 0.  EDIT:  or by -1<br><br><em>substitute a &quot;/&quot; for the division symbol, and it should work</em></p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not sure what you mean by what you said, but the property of repeating decimals is not limited to just prime numbers. Example: 4 divided by 9 is .444444 repeating, and neither 4 nor 9 are prime. <br><br>If you were saying that all prime numbers exhibit this behavior, that's not true either. Example: 7 divided by 2 is 3.5, and both 7 and 2 are prime. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah but 7 divided by 2 equals 3.5 and if you reverse the equation 3.5 times 2 you will end up back where you started from, this isn't true for my example of 1 divided by 3 (on old calculators anyway)</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm sorry, I'm still confused what you're trying to say.  <br><br>Are you saying that all prime numbers are &quot;irreversible&quot;, only some prime numbers are &quot;irreversible&quot;, or no prime numbers are &quot;irreversible&quot;? <br><br>I'm using irreversible to mean the property that it contains repeating numbers when divided,  and does not return to its original value once multiplied by the original divisor. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah I don't understand why if you divide something by three and then times the result by three, you don't end back up where you started from. It's sort of a flawed system in maths, although my iPhone gets it right, but most calculators don't. Sorry if I haven't worded it properly. I hope you can get the jist of what I meanðŸ˜Š <br><br>If I grab an old calculator and do the &quot;1 dived by three, times three, I get .99999999 repeater - why don't I get 1? Where's the missing value disappeared to?</p>		</li>
