			<div class="markdown"><p>We give some really good choices that my 4 year old turns down, so I don't think this explanation is adequate.</p>
<p>We've offered an array of sushi, but she will only eat the plain rice, so it's not just presentation.</p>
<p>Buttered crab? She would lick it and pretend that it tastes yucky [even though all she tasted was butter] because she decided she doesn't like it before trying it. So it's not just the flavor.</p>
<p>It has to be solid, too. We have tried giving her soups of every possible consistency, but it's a non-starter.</p>
<p>It can't be green except for apples, grapes, cucumbers, celery, and maybe one or two others. She probably won't even taste a <em>new</em> green thing. She loved asparagus once, but we don't eat it much [except an asparagus soup a few weeks ago]. I suspect she will hate it without trying it the next time we give it to her. She love cooked mushrooms for a while, but not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>More to the point, she had developed <em>tastes</em>.</strong> She disliked some things [she never liked cooked carrots or cooked squash], but she loved mushrooms, and she <em>loved</em> [mild] indian spinach [palak/saag]. It wasn't because we decided that was her meal. It was our food and we let her try it. She loved it and we didn't have to find something else for her to eat. She loved it dozens of times, to the point where we would make sure to have it so she would have something good to eat. Then, we didn't have it for a week or two [always at least a week -- this happened with several foods] and suddenly she didn't like it. I am still convinced that some of the things she still likes she could turn on at any moment id we go a week or two without it.</p>
<p>And she still like peas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do what my mom did for my sister - she didn't want supper, so my parents said it'd be waiting when she was hungry. A while later, she asked for a snack, and my mom put her supper out for her to eat. Sister still didn't want it, and went to bed hungry. Morning rolls around, I get cereal, my sister gets last night's supper. She finally ate it, and found it wasn't that bad. </p>
<p>Now, I understand there's a difference between a 4 year old and a 7 year old, and I would only suggest this for healthy foods, but it could be a valid strategy for picky kids. Eventually they'll be hungry enough to eat their food. </p>
<p>This also doesn't mean withhold their favorites, a little compromise goes a long way. But for stubborn kids, like my sister, it works. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grand mother used to do the same with us.<br />
The result is that we still hate some foods, and we're in our forties.<br />
No, sorry, that's not the way.  </p>
<p>In many cases, when the child is refusing the food is not because they don't like it, but because they are trying to express their feelings.  </p>
<p>My son (5 years old) didn't want rice with chicken, he said he didn't like it.<br />
I sat him on my lap, I ate my plate, and said how good it was.<br />
I offered him a bit of rice from my plate, he ate it and liked it.<br />
I proceeded to offer him my chicken, and again he ate it and liked it.<br />
I got his plate and spoon next to mine, fed him a couple spoons, then he told me &quot;I will eat it on my own&quot;, and devoured the plate.<br />
He just wanted to receive attentions, and to be &quot;helped in helping himself&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
