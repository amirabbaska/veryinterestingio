			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. I never considered the intensity at ground zero not being enough to destroy evidence. I wonder if someone could rig something downwind of an area to like, catapult a flaming pile goo or something into an area so it starts there, and by the time the fire gets to the device it's hot enough to destroy it. Or like a time delay fuse that runs along the ground a certain distance to a fuel source.</p>
<p>Not that I'm an arsonist or anything.... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the goo doesn't leave a residue itself, then you could just light the goo and leave. </p>
<p>The problem with both of these is that firefighters know fires don't start for no reason-- if there is no explanation, they're going to assume it was arson or someone being careless. </p></div>		</li>
