<blockquote>
<p>More money = more spending = higher prices</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that last equal sign driven by greed? </p>
<p>If companies collectively decided to NOT raise their prices, would it avert inflation? I understand higher prices raises labour costs, but if they all did it and prices remained stationary? The moment one company raises prices, everyone has to, but if there's an agreement not to...</p>
<p>Also, does this mean that companies which can decide to sell &quot;more stuff&quot; as opposed to the same amount of stuff with a higher margin are better equipped to deal with rising inflation? Llike, for example, a company that produces luxury goods decides to keep the same profit margin and price, but given inflation, access a bigger portion of the market.</p>
<p>I'm fairly sure I am wrong on various assumptions here, but hey, it's not a stupid question the first time you ask, right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Short answer: Partly. More complete answer: It's part greed, but also part survival because rising prices create a sort of feedback loop in which people expect prices to rise, so they raise their own prices in anticipation of having to pay even higher prices to restock their shelves when their current inventory runs out, and they have to cover their own costs, hence the cycle continues. If stores keep charging the same prices to consumers while the prices they pay to their suppliers keep increasing, they'll go out of business.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It isn't something that can be done by collective action. There are natural reasons for the price hike.</p>
<p>Companies do not exist in a vacuum, many generally buy stuff, process stuff, create product and sell it. The value they add in all this is why people buy their stuff instead of making their own.</p>
<p>So companies have expenses too. And those expenses rise too with added demand because there is <em>less</em> stuff around. People buy things, so there will be shortages. In raw materials. In product. So it is only natural that the rarer things are, the more expensive they get.</p>
<p>In a micro scale, think of a scenario: Companies A B C D use the same raw material for different unrelated products. Public is spending their money, even take out loans because interest rates are low. So much money around. So there is lots of demand. The company that provides the raw material has a shortage because that material is being used too much by A B C D. B has too fill a large order, but not enough raw material to go around. Raw material producer says, &quot;I can't fill your order. I can risk disappointing A C D companies and give you more material but you have to pay me more for it&quot;</p>
<p>And just like that prices for company A B C D has risen. So they'll either have to lower their profit margin, or sell the product for a more expensive price because their cost of doing business has risen. There is overall less of the stuff so it gets more expensive.</p>
<p>Now think that the company that provides raw material also uses other materials to create their thing. Multiple even. And each of those providers are connected by other relationships, it is a web.</p>
<p>In the end, there is a chain effect, some things become rare, so they naturally become more expensive. Them becoming more expensive creates a domino effect where other unrelated things get more expensive due to connections.</p>
<p>If the country's general outlook is good, the companies can grow. New companies can pop up to provide raw materials, new products because things are needed and they are rare so there is money to be made. So new companies pop up, they employ more people, more &quot;stuff&quot; gets produced, and things balance out. But the outlook isn't good, then prices keep rising, public feels an overwhelming urge to <em>not</em> save because their money will be worth less tomorrow. It spirals out from there.</p>
<p>There are dictatorships where dictators set price ceilings for certain goods thinking it will work. Economy is a highly non-linear system so you can't manipulate it that way. If price ceiling is there then it means you'll not make profit or even work at a loss which doesn't make sense. Then you stop working. Your employees are now unemployed etc. Venezuela situation is an example of such simpleton thinking from recent history.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, yes and no. Lemme explain..
We know that an increase in the amount of money in an economy leads to higher spending. This seems pretty intuitive, right? We can even illustrate this with a good old graph or supply and demand. If spending increases, that must mean that demand has gone up. In this context, we're not looking at a specific good or industry, but rather an entire economy. Instead of supply and demand, we say &quot;aggregate supply&quot; and &quot;aggregate&quot; demand. Essentially the same concept, but expanded to cover an entire economy's production. So as the amount of money increases, spending increases, which we can illustrate with a shift in the aggregate demand curve. Demand over the <em>entire</em> economy, on average, increases. Take a look at the graph <a href="https://textimgs.s3.amazonaws.com/boundless-economics/as-2b-ad-graph.svg#fixme" target="_blank">here</a>. As aggregate demand goes up, we move along the aggregate supply line and the price level increases. It isn't necessarily greed, per se. It's more like businesses simply acting in their best interests. But what if they decided to not raise prices? This actually isn't a hypothetical scenario. A group of businesses banding together and setting an agreed-upon price for their good(s) is called a cartel. This is usually industry-specific. OPEC, for instance, is an oil cartel. Let's entertain the concept of every company in an economy deciding not to raise their prices. Would this avert inflation? In theory, yes. There's also the nasty consequence of stalled economic growth, or even decline. </p>

<p>Well, remember that based on our graph I linked above, we move up on the supply line, meaning that businesses are already producing more than before. And remember, inflation doesn't just affect the consumers of the end product. Sure, inflation means people will pay more for a loaf of bread, but it also means that bread producers are paying more for flour. So maybe some companies can afford to take a loss on profit to capture more of the market. This gets a little tricky, however, because if a company begins operating at a loss (losing money) to undercut other companies in the industry and gain more market share, they could be facing some serious penalties for attempting to monopolize the industry. </p></div>		</li>
