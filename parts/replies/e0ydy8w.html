			<div class="markdown"><p>If you flew your spaceship up to one and matched velocities with it, you could catch it in your spacesuit's glove without any damage or injury and without even damaging the dust grain itself.  The rotational rate is extremely high but the size is extremely small and the two cancel out to arrive at a comfortably human speed of tens to hundreds of metres per second for the outermost atoms of the dust grain; the same sort of speeds that air molecules travel at, and not fast enough to break chemical bonds when they hit something.  In other words the rotational kinetic energy is tiny of the same magnitude as the linear kinetic energy of air molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As order of magnitude estimate, just take the linear velocity at the edge and assume all the mass moves at this speed. A cube with a side length of 1 nm and a density of maybe 2000 kg/m^3 has a mass of 2*10^(-24) kg, at 63 m/s this gives it a kinetic energy of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+2000+kg%2Fm%5E3+*+(1nm\)%5E3+*+(63m%2Fs\)%5E2" target="_blank">4*10^(-21) J</a>. A car on a highway can reach a similar energy per mass, but it has 27 orders of magnitude more mass and more energy.</p></div>		</li>

I had a hard time picturing that, so I thought of it as putting tires on my car that were 4/1000 of a millimetre in diameter, and how fast they'd have to spin to propel my car 450 km/h.</p>
<p>That's fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple questions since you seem know this stuff cold. </p>
<p>Do these dust grains slow down rapidly from the microwave emission?</p>
<p>Or are they always getting spun up by collisions...and have some stable distribution of rotational frequencies for dust of a certain size?</p>
<p>Last one...how do they separate this source from the CMB?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They measured the cosmic microwave background, and got some weird data (way more microwaves than expected). Whatever the source is, it appears to be thinly spread all over the sky. When you get weirdness in a big telescope, dust is usually the answer. So it's probably dust. For dust to be emitting microwaves, it would have to be spinning very very fast (at microwave frequency).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't quite right. Spinning dust - more correctly, the anomalous microwave emission (AME), as it's not entirely certain that it is spinning dust - is not spread all over the sky. Instead, it's only found in areas of the sky where we know dust is present from infra-red and optical observations - this is a strong pointer towards it being some form of dust. The first experiments to see the AME found that there was some kind of microwave emission that was where you'd expect to see dust, but had a spectrum (the way intensity changes with frequency) more like that of synchrotron emission - the emission that comes from electrons spiralling round in magnetic fields. There are several possibilities for what the AME could be. One of the first suggestions was that it was some kind of new high frequency synchrotron; unfortunately, it isn't bright enough for that. Another possibility is that it is magnetised grains of dust, containing iron or nickel, which emit when they align with the Galactic magnetic field. However, this would result in more polarised emission than we see - but it could still explain a significant fraction of the AME. It could be poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (certain carbon containing molecules), emitting thermally or through spinning, but the AME isn't well correlated with PAH density. In several regions, the AME is bright, but there are few PAHs, and vice versa. Spinning dust is the most likely theory, but some observations of the AME do cast doubt on it; the AME seems to be bright in regions where there are lots of photons about, which doesn't align well with predictions about the behaviour of spinning dust.</p></div>		</li>
