			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough, but could there be an evolutionary advantage to (almost) everyone having the same handedness? As in, the <em>actual</em> handedness doesn't matter (it's only &quot;right&quot; by happenstance), but there's an advantage in the majority of people all having the same dominant hand (particularly for a tool-using species)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the benefit seems like it would stem from giving one the instinct to repeatedly use the same hand.  Given that mastery of a tool would happen faster if the same hand was used, a trait encouraging the same hand to be used would be beneficial in tool mastery. I think you are correct when you point out that it doesnt seem the actual preferred hand matters, as left handedness isn't that rare of a trait (if it were selected against it should be much rarer), and dominance of a hand in general (left OR right) is completely universal and also present in other tool-using species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like there would be more benefit from being able to use each equally. But, thinking about it, maybe there is more of an advantage from having one hand that specialises - both hands are equally good for lifting, carrying and simple stuff, but having one hand that's really good at fine detailed stuff probably conserves brain space or something. And maybe having one &quot;instinctive&quot; hand (one that you instinctively use to catch a ball, defend from attack without having to think about it) is probably good too.</p>
<p>Still, I do think there's probably a mild evolutionary pressure from tools that are designed to be one-handed and the user not being that handed. Bear in mind that having an accident because you're using a tool that's designed for someone with a different dominant hand doesn't neccessarily have to kill you for you not to be able to pass your genes on - it just has to make you a less attractive mate. Maybe you only lose a finger or an eye - back in primitive times, that could be enough to put you out of the running when it comes to finding a mate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume we didn’t evolve any benefits based on tools simply because they’ve only had widespread use for a very small amount of time. </p>
<p>I might be wrong though, anyone feel free to correct me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats a tough one, humans have been using tools for over 2 million years.  thats a lot of opportunity for selection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely seems to be one. It's easier to say what traits do have an advantage (because you can list the advantages) as opposed to traits that don't (because you can't list a lack of advantages). But unless there was a time when food required tongue rolling, it's tough to imagine a disadvantage to lacking this ability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that phobias, and other apophenia-esque things, are very much the result of evolution landing us in the space where we do better (mate more often) with over caution than less caution. Phobias and apophenia mean that respond and spend energy, and phobias to the point of excess, but don't get caught unaware. </p>
<p>I am sure too, that a large portion of phobias are culture/nurture as we live in both a very very safe and very very dangerous world than compared to the pre-historic environment. </p></div>		</li>
