			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a PhD in stem cell biology, then a masters degree in science communication, then moved into science writing. All the while I was doing stand up, but I got bored with jokes about boyfriends and shared living accommodation, so decided to start writing comedy about science instead. The book I've written is hopefully scientifically intriguing, entertaining and funny. My experience of balancing science and arts has been hugely positive.
My advice to you is to prepare some material, develop a thick skin and get yourself some open mic slots, and then if you love it, don't give up! To get into science writing, maybe think about writing a science blog. Get involved in social media and try to drive traffic to your writing. There are also lots of great courses out there that offer training in science writing and science communication. Hope that helps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well thank you very much for the praise and inspiration! My laser decided to leak water all over the lab today, so it has been a long day. :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also super interested in this topic, as someone who will soon be graduating with a PhD in chemistry, and a declining interest in pursuing a career in that field. </p></div>		</li>
