			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum tunneling is not so much about propagating through some different medium as it is about crossing an energy barrier without &quot;enough&quot; energy. If I put a basketball in a pit and throw it halfway up the wall, it will never escape. Repeat this experiment with an electron and you actually get non-zero probabilities of detecting the electron outside of the pit. This &quot;classically forbidden&quot; region has a generic property that the probability (density) drops off exponentially with distance, so that these effects are very rapidly suppressed as you move away from the barrier. Thus, in QM, you can use a barrier to localize a particle, but depending on the width and strength of your trap, the quality of localization will vary. I'm not sure exactly what you mean here by &quot;solid&quot;, as that term usually refers to the thermodynamic phase of matter, but there is no ensemble here! Our lonely particle just feels some number at each point in space, the potential, and reacts accordingly. In fact, in vanilla quantum mechanics (ie not field theoretic as in condensed matter or hep), the way an electron would interact with some material is modeled by approximating the potential function (at each point in space) of whatever the material is, and solving the schrodinger equation for that potential.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Tunneling in general involves an electron being transmitted through a finite energy barrier that is greater than the energy of the electron. In this case, the energy barrier is provided by vacuum between the STM tip and the sample. It can also be provided by other things, such as atoms.</del>  </p>
<p>Edit: The response above mine is better/more accurate than mine. Refer to that one instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to be atoms traveling through solid objects, it can be any quantum object traveling through a potential barrier. In the case of STM it's electrons traveling through a thin layer of vacuum where their potential energy is much higher than in the atom. Quantum tunneling means that even if the electrons' energy is smaller than the potential barrier, there's a certain probability, that they appear on the other side. Essentially in quantum physics small objects can traverse small distances even with negative kinetic energy. A macroscopic analogy would be throwing a baseball at a wall, and seeing it just pass through, but of course it's so improbable, that it wouldn't happen if you repeated it for the entire lifetime of our universe. On the other hand electrons are small enough that they can tunnel through several <del>picometers</del> hudreds of picometers of vacuum and we can still measure the tunneling current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're totally correct in everything you said, great job. Just tacking on that the tip is typically several hundred pm from the surface unless you're scanning at extreme tunneling currents (&gt;1 nA)</p></div>		</li>
