<p>I've only found one other person that sees a lot of them, so far.  </p>
<p>Finally, I can put a name to this.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same reaction as you! I see these things all the time but never knew what to call it. I don't think I've ever found the right moment in conversation to ask someone else if they see it too. TIL.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A place in San Francisco called the Exploritorium has a device where you look into the thing, it flashes ultraviolet light into your eyes, and enables you to see the blood cells very clearly. After I used this thing, I can't unsee the blood cells. If it's a clear day, and I'm looking at a blue sky, I can always see them.</p></div>		</li>
