<p>-Reduce resolution and turn on AA.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the AA and the game. I find that AA <em>usually</em> hits less harder than increasing the resolution.</p>
<p>For instance, Skyrim Special Edition uses a &quot;shitty&quot; (subject of debate) AA method called TAA. It looks freaking GREAT when standing still, but blurs the image pretty badly when moving. However, it has almost no performance impact. But if you have a game with something like <del>FXAA</del> FSAA x8, it might just be better to turn that off and increase resolution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SSAA is equivalent to rendering the image at a higher resolution, then downsampling it to the displayed resolution. Other forms of AA are cheaper than increasing the resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deepens on the AA technique, but reducing the resolution and enabling AA should be faster. However, it'll look terrible if the resolution is below the native resolution of the screen.</p></div>		</li>
