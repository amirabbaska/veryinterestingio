			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at this, I'm quite interested in the triple point and the critical point. Is this to say that at .006 atm and just above freezing, you can get water to exhibit all three states? Or at the critical point, that water is now what would appear to be some sort of steam-bomb? I've heard of super heated and super cooled water before, is this similar?  Am I just looking at the charted points where these phenomenon occur or is this something different completely? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, at the triple point water can exhibit the three states of gas, liquid and solid. The triple point of water is actually one of the temperatures used to define the temperature scale, since there are zero degrees of freedom there. This video show this for Cyclohexane: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEbMHmDhq2I" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEbMHmDhq2I</a></p>
<p>At the critical point there is no difference in density between steam and liquid water, so there's also no difference between the states. Superheated water is water at temperatures in between the boiling point at 1 atm and the critical point, that due to increased pressure is still liquid water above the usual boiling point. Similarily, supercooled water is liquid water below the freezing point that hasn't frozen (because of an absence of nucleation points).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that's amazing! You can see the water freezing, and boiling at the same time. I had a mental image of water droplets and ice chunks floating in some water vapor (along the lines of water and vapor combining at the critical point), but this gives a good dose of reality to the concept of triple point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presumably this is because it's not on the triple point, it is just constantly near it?</p>
<p>If you could get each molecule to consistently stay at the triple point exactly, how does it behave? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The triple point is the point of equilibrium between the three states, meaning the three states constantly exchange mass between each other instead of going in one direction like when you freeze water (liquid -&gt; solid). The critical point is the point after which there is no equilibrium curve between the liquid and vapour states, so the substance cannot go from liquid to vapour (or viceversa) by changing just the pressure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At the bottom of the ocean there are volcanic vents where bacteria live in the cold water under high pressure. They are the only organisms on the planet that do not depend on the sun for survival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things at high pressure (like water at the bottom of the ocean) need to be even colder to turn into a solid, while things at very low pressure can turn solid at higher than usual temperatures. </p></div>		</li>
