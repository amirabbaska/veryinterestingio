			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity" target="_blank">toxic</a> when concentrated. There are both long and short term effects; you should be mostly immune to short term effects at that concentration (see also: medical oxygen therapy). Long term, oxygen oxidizes stuff, and that can be bad (see also: antioxidants are good for you). You'll probably see some dna damage related stuff like more cancer, but I don't <em>think</em> it would be an immediate problem unless you had compounding health problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put some numbers on this, the information I can find puts the lower limit for toxicity at around half a bar (the lowest number I found is .45 atm <a href="http://www.diverite.com/education/rebreather/tips/oxygen%20toxicity/" target="_blank">here</a>, while <a href="http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/3863" target="_blank">this thesis</a> suggests a lower bound of at least .55 atm, and <a href="http://www.nwohs.com/Oxygen%20Regulatory%20Limits%20I.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> puts the threshold for respiratory irritation at 400 mmHg, which is equivalent to 0.53 atm).  Twice today's concentration at sea level would be a partial pressure of .42 atm, which is uncomfortably close but shouldn't cause any direct problems.  If you were really worried about it you could move to higher land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sorry. A gross oversimplification. By saying they weren't around, I was referring to their lack of status in the animal kingdom, their lack of diversity and their relative lack of numbers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well probably not 65M years ago, simply because you picked the time of the KT extinction. Pretty sure that the ensuing global climate after the asteroid impact would have had some pretty bad effects on the air.
If we back up a few million years, though, say 100M, we're right smack in the middle of the Cretaceous period. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would we need to go back that far?  A human lifespan is comparatively really short, so couldn't we just say 1,000 years before the asteroid impact?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure we could peg it that closely, and I rather expect you don't want to be around just when (or just after) it happened.</p>
<p>Sure. My example of 100M is the same thing as 66M or 67M. The Cretaceous Period is the Cretaceous Period and is ended by the KT extinction event. Pick 67 or 100 or 110 or 80. It's all pretty well the same. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The difference between 80 and 100 is birds, that's pretty major. A lot of geographical divergences occurred during that period as well.</p></div>		</li>
