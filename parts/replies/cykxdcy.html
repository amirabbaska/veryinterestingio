			<div class="markdown"><p>As /u/superhelical implies, there is likely a finite number of 'smells' which can be combined. These would vary from species to species and even person to person. Only in the broadest possible interpretation is the answer &quot;no.&quot; Under that interpretation we recognize that each and every compound could have a unique receptor response. While these could then be combined to make any 'total' smell, there are an infinite number of potential compounds. Practically speaking the number is incredibly large but finite.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It could very well be like that.  Of course, &quot;incredibly large&quot; is very context dependent.  It might be that 100 different scents can be combined in the right proportions to reasonably approximate most common scents, and this would be very large for putting in consumer grade VR systems, but wouldn't be so bad for an industrial robot that wants to help identify things based on scent (although identifying base chemicals seems more productive there than identifying the human response to those chemicals).  Or maybe it is on the order of 1000, which would be a lot of a single laboratory to keep on hand, but not so much that we couldn't mechanically identify and then recreate scents for use in shampoos and air fresheners.  Or maybe the number is so large that there is no good general way to approximate scents short of using the actual chemicals involved in the scent.  </p>
<p>&quot;Incredibly large&quot; is vague, but more importantly, it is not the same as &quot;too large to have practical applications.&quot;  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that perhaps there is 1000 &quot;base&quot; scents but with only 20 we might generate 80% of common scents for example, and that might be good enough.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model#/media/File:CIExy1931_sRGB_gamut_D65.png" target="_blank">sRGB space</a>, for example, only encodes a subset of all possible colors humans can perceive (not even considering tetrachromacy or other individuals that can perceive more colors than usual). In practice this is not a problem, because our computer monitors can't reproduce all possible colors anyway.</p>
<p>It happens because sRGB is a linear space (we combine red, green and blue linearly) but the space of all human colors is not linear - in order to represent &quot;all possible colors&quot; with a linear encoding you also need to have some &quot;impossible colors&quot; as well (have some area in this triangle that falls outside the space of colors that humans perceive).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color#/media/File:CIExy1931_ProPhoto.svg" target="_blank">ProPhoto RGB</a> (the larger triangle in the image) is an example of color space that can encode more colors (about 90% of all colors), but also encode &quot;impossible colors&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space" target="_blank">Lab color space</a> is a space that encodes all perceived colors (and is also linear in the perception of the colors - 10 units of difference in one axis represents the same amount of perceptual change), but the transformation from sRGB to L<em>a</em>b is not linear.</p></div>		</li>

Companies such as Yankee Candle are also clearly adept at this in creating their scented products. However, the list of all possible compounds is far too large to be usable, or even all possible binding sites.  If our idea of practical applications is those which can be sensed by humans, then that would achievable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we would look at this from a basic programming stand point.</p>
<p>i.e. an 8 bit chip, which can have either a yes or no (on/off) response is 2^8 or 256 possible outcomes.</p>
<p>if we have 400 genes that would act in a similar matter, we would have 2^400 = 2.58 e120  , 2.58 with 120 zeros after it, which is a number so large that I don't even know if we have wording for it.</p>
<p>That's assuming genes work as an on/off, if there even more possibilities, the number could further multiply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, countably infinite, at least. There's no hard limit to the number of atoms you can tack onto a molecule, and there are 3.6757402Ã—10^48 isomers of 120-carbon (C120H242) chains, for example. I'm sure that it's possible to work out a diagonalization proof that the number of possible compounds in organic chemistry is countably infinite.</p>

<p>Diagonalization would show something isn't countably infinite. </p>
<p>I question whether there would even be infinite ways to combine atoms to make molecules. </p>
<p>Not knowing a whole lot about chemistry, I'll start simply. IIRC given a particular set of atoms, there is a finite way to combine them to produce a molecule. Great, so it's trivially true, given that and the fact that there can physically only be a finite set of elements, that the set of all molecules composed of n or less atoms of any type is finite. </p>
<p>Now where I'm unsure of things. Can n be unbounded? Can you always add some other atom like you said? The reason the number of elements is finite is because eventually you cannot add any more protons due to the limitations of the strong force. While molecules form from electron sharing, would we not have to eventually worry about gravity? Either gravitational forces eventually become strong enough to break bonds or the molecule collapses under its own gravity and becomes a black hole.</p>
<p>If there is an upper bound to n for for all collections of n arbitrary atoms, then there is a finite number of possible molecules. This seems the most likely scenario.</p>
<p>If there is not an upper bound to n, then the question becomes, &quot;can there be molecules comprised of infinite atoms?&quot; If the answer is no, then there are countably infinite molecules. If the answer is yes, then it gets difficult. We need to be able to represent the structure of those atoms. If we can view each of those types of molecules as a string of atoms wherein we encode the 3D structure, then we have to ask whether there are restrictions on the sequences that form within the infinite strings of atoms. If there are, then it may still be possible that there are only countably infinite combinations, but if there aren't, then there are certainly uncountably infinite molecules.</p>
<p>You don't really get to uncountably infinite unless you have objects that in some sense are comprised of an infinite amount of arbitrary combinations of other sub-objects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a few cents, this is a very important topic in... intelectual property law. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, if you want to register a trademark, your trademark needs to fulfill several requirements. One of them is that the trademark can be shown in a graphical form. If we are talking about &quot;typical&quot; trademark, like Nike or McDonalds logo, this is easy: logo = graphical form (more or less). It gets more tricky with sounds (jingle, specific sounds), but they can be trademarked too - sounds can be shown in a graphical way.</p>
<p>There was an ongoing half-legal half-scientific debate if smells fulfill this requirement. There were some claims that they do, but the general consensus is that until we discover a way to accuratly desribe smells in a graphical way, smells are &quot;untrademarkable&quot; (some of them can be protected in other ways though).</p>
<p>This is one of many, many examples how scientific/ technological progress  interacts with modern law. When we will be able just to show smells in some kind of graph, there might be many new products and services avaiable on the market. And this might happen without changing any bill or treaty - court rulings, legal practice and doctrine will adapt on its own.</p>
<p>Please note that I am talking from perspective of European law. This might be somewhat different in the US, but many of the laws regarding this topic are very similiar / the same (international treaties). Also there is no need to worry about trademarking smells that are already in use - there are other requirements that trademark needs to fulfill. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  And for the curious wondering if something equally &quot;basic&quot; like a color can be trademarked, there are quite a few trademarked colors.  The most well known is the pink color of Owens Corning insulation, but many well known companies, such as Target and Home Depot, have trademarked their brand colors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that trademarks are for specific domains (e.g., I could name my construction company Apple Inc. and not run afoul of the computer company's trademark.</p>
<p>The more vague the trademark, the more specific the domain must be (and vice versa). So the pink color is trademarked most likely <em>only in the realm of insulations</em>.</p>
<p>A similar concept is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_dress" target="_blank">trade dress</a> (imagine two taco chains using the same colors, decorative ideas, etc.).</p>
<p>Remember that, unlikely copyright and patent (constitutionally called out as tools for encouraging creativity), trademark's purpose is to protect against consumer confusion. So the way it plays out will be different in many ways.</p>
<p><strong>Central to copyright and patent is the question of whether you're ripping off a creator. The most important part of trademark is whether a consumer will confuse things.</strong> No way you're trademarking the color green generically applied to tons of commercial activities. But you might be able to trademark a specific green for your post-it notes if you're <em>really</em> known for your specific-green post-it notes (because it's important that a competitor can't make an inferior green post-it and confuse consumers into buying their inferior product).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth pointing out that, compared to closely related species, humans have <em>lost</em> a whole lot of olfactory reception. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/101/8/2584.full" target="_blank">This old chestnut</a> reported 339 intact olfactory receptor genes and 297 pseudogenes (genes that no longer produce any functional product but whose sequence is still recognizable). It's generally thought that humans lost a lot of our sense of smell as the sense of sight became more important. It's something we have to keep in mind working with lab animals - rodents really don't see very well, but we can't let anyone wear perfume anywhere near the animal housing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>some people believe it has to do with the fact that a human's head is so far above the ground, making many smells less relevant. others people believe that this loss of receptors is because humans are &quot;better&quot; at olfaction, and that the cortex helps make more efficient distinctions. I don't necessarily agree with them but it is interesting to point out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of perfumes use products,  or synthetic facsimiles of, from animals, such as musk. The issue with musky smells is that several predators  (the entire weasel family for example) also produce musky scents. Mice see the world first through their sense of smell. Perfumes especially are quite strong emitters of odor (it's their job). The scent can cause stress and anxiety in mice,  which raises their cortisol levels,  which can effect a ton of research. </p>
<p>For people who have regular interaction with the mice,  it is important to keep their scent profile the same. The mice can, and do, become acclimated to the scent of specific people. </p></div>		</li>
