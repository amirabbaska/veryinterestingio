			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question! Venus is able to retain an atmosphere while Mars and mercury aren't for a few reasons. Venus's atmosphere is mainly composed of CO2, a very heavy molecule compared to O2 or N2. This heavy molecule coupled with a higher escape velocity on Venus means that it is considerably more difficult for solar wind to strip a molecule off of Venus. Venus also has many charged particles in its upper atmosphere. This combined with the strong winds make a kind of induced magnetic field</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes a lot of assumptions.  Bacteria can clean up a lot of toxic crud and produce oxygen, but they can't make the core of a planet spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, the liquid iron in the core of the earth is flowing in such a way that it works kind of like a big solenoid. The Coriolis effect creates a swirling action that generates an electric field. This phenomenon works on the same principle electromagnets, electric generators and electric motors do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venus does undergo some atmospheric stripping, which is why the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/216/4546/630.short" target="_blank">atmospheric deuterium has been enriched</a> &gt;100 fold. It may indicate that Venus used to have a lot more water. If the global resurfacing hypothesis half a billion years ago hold water, Venus may have very well had an active dynamo and magnetic field before that or if resurfacing is a cyclic process, replenished the atmosphere through volcanism.  </p>
<p>I'm not sure how significant atmospheric carbon loss is on Venus, so my last sentence is some awful speculation on my part.</p></div>		</li>
