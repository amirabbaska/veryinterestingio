			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that our cells derive their energy from a part of the cell that used to be another cell altogether and has now become symbiotically attached to it. Is this wrong? If it is not, can we be said to be metabolically independent? That's what mitochondria are right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mitochondria were originally another organism yes (something related to a bacteria or archaea, probably) that entered our cells. But they are definitely part of our cells now, no matter where they came from, and they are created along with new cells when they divide, so it's not considered to be two different species in symbiosis. Besides, mitochondria don't produce all the energy of a cell, they're only responsible for the largest contribution. Cells can derive energy from nutrients without mitochondria, glycolysis (the first, most basic step in metabolism, when sugar is broken down) doesn't require them. Red blood cells contain no mitochondria, so they get all their energy from anaerobic glycolysis, in order to not use up the oxygen they transport themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, mitochondria have their own separate genome. And clearly, taking the mitochondria out of a cell would be detrimental. I think, like most things in nature, it isn't really possible for us to draw a solid black line when it comes to things like life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less. Mitochondria have become necessary components of eukaryotic cells (though there was one recently discovered that lacks mitochondria; this is an exception). To the best of my knowledge, mitochondria are not able to survive independently, as their genomes have experienced reductions and exchanges with that of their host (they swapped genes, which makes them further dependent on one another).</p>
<p>So...is a mitochondrion &quot;living?&quot; I would say no, according to the definition put forward earlier. Others would probably disagree.</p>
<p>Viruses may also have originated from living ancestors, btw! It's a pretty interesting idea! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we can't survive without mitochondria either, so doesn't that make us &quot;not alive&quot; by the definition provided? I mean, mitochondria are still genetically distinct from the rest of the cell right? </p></div>		</li>
