			<div class="markdown"><p>Our current system lets candidates run if they can convince people to fund their campaigns - sort of crowdsourcing the screening interview.  If campaigns were publicly funded, what would comprise the screening interview?  Any narrow political judgement would be criticized as unfair by those it excluded, but not excluding enough candidates would spread the money too thin.</p>
<p>Our current system sucks, but I'm not sure public funding is the answer.  Are there countries that do publicly funded campaigns? It would be interesting to read about.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/public_funding/" target="_blank">http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/public_funding/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A candidate or Senate group is eligible for election funding if they obtain at least 4% of the formal first preference vote in the division or the state or territory they contested. The amount to be paid is calculated by multiplying the number of votes obtained by the current election funding rate. This rate is indexed every six months to increases in the Consumer Price Index. 2016 federal election  was 262.784c.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my first thought to public funding. I don't want my tax dollars backing 100s of candidates. </p>
<p>A solution to bribe/contribution would be that a politician can raise funds but they are capped at a low number. Say $25M for POTUS. </p>
<p>That and/or single contributions would be limited to $200 max. </p>
<p>Just to compare with real numbers. President Obama raise $234M with contributions under $200. President Trump raised $87M with contributions under $200. And Hillary raised $102M. Mitt Romney was able to raise $25M. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/campaign-finance/" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/campaign-finance/</a></p>
<p>I couldn't find numbers for Gary Johnson or Dr Jill Stein from a reputable site. But the multiple sites had total raised (candidate and PAC) at $12M and $3.5M respectively. </p>
<p>A lot of money changed hands each election. It's wasteful and encourages corruption. While I am sure that the above $200/25M idea would be struck down by the SCOTUS it would be a breath of fresh air if candidates would voluntarily hold themselves to small contributions and a cap. </p>
<p>But most elections, whomever raises the most money, wins. So they won't tie their hands behind their back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important point. Public funding could very well mean that only people who are already politically connected can get access to the funding. You can't just give it to anyone. You couldn't really base it on some kind of earlier poll either, since that's just shifting the problem.</p>
<p>Then there's the problem of indirect help. If you have a large donor who doesn't give money to candidate X but does get a few commercials on air, is that banned? What if several famous people push one candidate, a luxury that a smaller candidate wouldn't have? Where would the line be between campaigning and simply speaking your mind?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where do you draw the line though? Can I spend my own money to campaign on their behalf? Can I buy signs to put in my yard? Can I buy these signs for other people? Can I buy commercials or advertisements? Limiting direct donations does very little because its very difficult to limit campaign spending without seriously limiting peoples rights.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thats exactly what is happening right now (in the united states) with Super PACs.  Groups of people &quot;separate from the campaign&quot; (wink wink nudge nudge) can spend whatever money they want on their free speech to the benefit of a candidate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any direct consequence for a politician to accept a donation from a company and subsequently make political decisions that don't favor said company? I.e. If a candidate got loads of money from the coal industry, got elected, and later took action to highly restrict coal on an environmental basis, what could coal do about it? </p></div>		</li>
