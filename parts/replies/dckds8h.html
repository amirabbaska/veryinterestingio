			<div class="markdown"><p>I linked <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/27/politics/nsa-snooping/" target="_blank">this</a> in another comment, but what about the cases when NSA employees have been caught using NSA tools to spy/stalk on certain people (ie. girlfriends, ex's). In some of these cases, their locations where being tracked by the employees. Your phone isn't a third party, but it has location services on by default. Does the government argue that by owning a phone, you opted to share your location with the phone company, and by extension, them?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It should be pointed out that the transgressions of individual employees isn't legal grounds against the agency as a whole</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would have a &quot;Bivens&quot; action -- a right to sue the federal government and the individual actors involved -- and contest those actors &quot;official immunity&quot; by showing they acted illegally or went rogue [one]. And if we are talking about state law enforcement using law enforcement tools for personal ends, you'd have a &quot;Section 1983&quot; action to do the same.  In short, there are legal remedies available through the courts.  But they are without doubt difficult to bring and prove. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The constitution defines the scope of the governments authority. The bias is 'if its not in here, the government can't do it', as opposed to 'if its not in here, the citizens can't do it'. </p>
<p>IOW, you have all rights unless the constitution permits the government to infringe on those rights. There was debate over the original bill of rights since they didn't want the enumeration of some rights to be construed as limiting all other rights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not exactly the explanation that I've come to understand. Several people have attempted to sue the government over alleged illegal surveillance, but cases have so far been thrown out because the plaintiffs couldn't demonstrate that they had been the subjects of surveillance (and of course, as you say, the programs are secret, so demonstrating it will be difficult). I don't know if the damage question was ever approached.</p>
<p>The PATRIOT Act allows the government to seek &quot;business records&quot; relevant to foreign intelligence investigations. My understanding is that this is how the Feds get phone records in surveillance cases. Getting access to phone records is otherwise still protected differently in different states. For instance, in NJ, police relatively recently got the right to look at your phone bill without showing probable cause (instead, they have to convince a judge that it would be relevant to an ongoing investigation, which is easier than showing probable cause). From my understanding, getting phone records, unless you're doing foreign intelligence, still takes more legal privilege than just politely asking.</p>
<p>But I'm not a lawyer, so if you are, you're welcome to tell me I've been wrong this whole time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The judge in ACLU v. Clapper cited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland" target="_blank">Smith v. Maryland</a> in his decision to dismiss that case. Smith V. Maryland created the so-called &quot;third party doctrine.&quot;</p>
<p>Whether or not that doctrine is <em>really</em> relevant to this discussion, I can't say, IANAL either. </p>
<p>EDIT: I think I misread your question. The question of standing in federal court is whether the plaintiff can prove the defendant caused some harm/damage to them. If you can't prove that you were surveiled, then you can't prove harm, and the case should be dismissed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By the way, it is case law that someone has no expectation of privacy over information that was shared with a third party. e.g. when you dial your phone to reach your aunt, you shared the fact that you dialed that number with the phone company, therefore it cannot be information exclusive to you and your aunt, and therefore no private information is taken when the government read your call records.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of this is extended to social media and even your Internet search history. There is no expectation of privacy if you voluntarily share information on social media about your interests, who you're chatting with, etc. precisely because you are sharing that info with a third party.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of ways to 'figure out' who you are talking to too. Much like how &quot;People You May Know&quot; algorithms on social media will figure out who you should know, the fact that you talk to 5 people in particular, all 5 of whom talk frequently with a sixth person, stands to reason that you probably know person six as well. Thus, a lot of 'private data' being mined really isn't all that private, and from there much much more can be extrapolated</p></div>		</li>
