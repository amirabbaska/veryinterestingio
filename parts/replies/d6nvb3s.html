<p>Anecdotal, I know, but this is definitely the reason I pace when I'm on the phone. Phone calls aren't fun - in fact, they're stressful, because you're forced to think on the spot and small silences can get awkward quickly (especially when the call is unexpected).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I make a lot of phone calls for work and those awkward silences are the worst. I tell someone the device I repaired is ready to go along with what times they can pick it up and 99% of the time they go &quot;Ok thanks!&quot; and hang up. Then there are the times where they go &quot;ok&quot; but don't hang up and there's an awkward silence like they're waiting for me to say more and when I ask if there's anything else I can help them with they just hang up. </p>
<p>It happens rarely but for some reason throws off my entire routine </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it's always seemed rude to just hang up on someone. I at least saying 'bye' at the end of the phone call just so that I don't end the call before they've finished speaking. idk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so true. I already deal with social anxiety and not being able to get body language REALLY makes me uncomfortable. I have to pace or be alone while on the phone but I never pace otherwise. Again anecdotal but it at least supports your anecdote.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find a lot of the time for me the pacing starts as a way to get away from roomates or other people that can hear me. I have a unique language that I use with my closest friends, and it's embarrassing to think about outside people hearing that.<br />
The same goes when Im on the phone with technical support, thinking people will think im dumb for needing it or think Im dumb for getting all rustled about a gmail account or whatever.<br />
Ill find an empty room, then realize I look even dumber for locking myself in a room obviously on the phone, then just pace around inside and out so they can only get snippets at best.<br />
It's definitely anxiety for me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's really good to know, because I pace extremely frequently. Whenever someone asked me why I was walking, I never really had an answer beside that it was just a habit while I was in thought.</p>
<p>TAKE THAT, MICHAEL FROM FRESHMAN P.E. TURNS OUT IM NOT WEIRD, YOU'RE JUST NOT AS CREATIVE AS ME!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely thought of this as well. In fact, my necessity to pace could be an obscure sign that I have below average intelligence. Wandering around would act as my &quot;crutch,&quot; in a matter of speaking.</p>
<p>But can't we just take this moment to tell Michael to screw off for picking on me over it? <em>Thank you!</em></p></div>		</li>
