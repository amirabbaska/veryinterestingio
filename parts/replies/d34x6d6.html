			<div class="markdown"><p>Except in 2D+1 there is no force of gravity since the metric is fully determined by the local energy tensor (at least from the position of GR). IE, your analogy is explicitly not what would happen to a black hole in 2D+1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^Oh ^my ^god, ^he ^said ^<em>tensor!</em> Yeah, well, if you say so: I am in no position to argue! The reason I included it is b/c of that last line in my comment. The analogy is sufficiently genuine to allow relevant experiments. That's about as good as an analogy gets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your hole things fall in because of density conservation/there is a force on particles outside the hole, in 2d gr particles do not feel a force of gravity.One can be next to the black hole and it would not attract. In fact Newtonian gravity doesn't work in 2d either since force goes as 1/r which is divergent.</p></div>		</li>
