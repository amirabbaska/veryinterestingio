			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, night time.... and if you don't move them 3 miles plus away they may fly back to where the Hive was and get very confused (in active season). Even a few feet can confuse them. Leave them there for 3+ weeks then you can move them nearer the original location.
Over winter (UK winter for me) when they are in the Hive most days because of temperature you can get away with moving them a few feet. When they emerge they will re-orientate.
They are incredible creatures. (I just realised I never said 3+ miles straight line not on the roads) </p></div>		</li>
