			<p>Interesting, your reason was on the near opposite of /u/owls_with_towels who published a paper on the topic. However I can see both responses as valid. Nature is quite enigmatic!</p>		</li>

			<p>Well not quite, like the guy pointed out the fishes arn't out to out-swim their prey. And it is obvious from the way they look they can't swim quickly. I believe what he meant when he said &quot;efficiency in swimming mode&quot; is not so much to say they wade water very well (aka sailfish), but rather that they can catch prey very well as and when they are moving if by the chance it appears. Sudden snaps, traps, lures, all work well in this respect.</p>		</li>
