			<div class="markdown"><p>to be fair, in the US a tiny number of rich people own over half of the country's wealth. </p>
<p>it really comes down to the UN. Russia does not like the fact that when the Soviet Union collapsed we created a wall of democratically elected countries where the iron curtain used to be. These countries, such as the Ukraine, Estonia, etc. are extremely close to Moscow and the Kremlin...making Putin and the Russian leadership nervous. now, consider russia's and the US's rapid militarization and nuclear programs during the coldwar and many of the people running both governments were children during the coldwar...it is understandable that our higher-ups are weary of eachother.</p>
<p>edit: adding link to US wealth inequality for reference</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Russian concern about US allies on its borders and aggression from the U.S. itself seem misguided to me. I can understand how the Russians might be annoyed at us keeping them in check and trying to counter their moves to expand or gain power. What I do not understand is their apparent fear that we or our allies are going to <em>initiate</em> some aggression towards them. What has the US or it's allies done to give Russia any legitimate reason to believe we would attack them? It seems foolish for us to have missiles still pointed at each other. My perspective is an American one obviously, but I don't see the U.S. as wanting anything other than for Russia to stay within it's existing post Cold-war borders and not to enable nuclear proliferation or sell weapons system to hostile unstable rogue nations. Russia on the other hand, under Putin, seems to be constantly playing games and trying to test the west and troll us. Why? Russia has a massive ass piece of land loaded with natural resources. Sure, they lost some sea access when the USSR collapsed, but those Cold War nations didn't belong to Russia in the first place and every one of them has done better since it got out from under the yolk of Soviet oppression and the failure of Communism. Is Russia still that insecure about losing the Cold War that it has the need to prove itself by trying to expand and push our allies around? Why? The colonialist era of shifting borders and musical chairs is over. The music has stopped. I think Russia has plenty of territory to work with and it only has itself to blame for any perceived misfortune it is suffering. The U.S. would more than likely drop all or most sanctions and trade with Russia and open access to more trade with our allies if Russia would just stop acting so thuggish and trying to have a dick measuring contest in the locker room. They were on their way to becoming a normalized modern westernized country with an economy that produces more than oil, natural gas and manure until Putin came along.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh we are in total agreement about wealth inequality in the US.  We are moving rapidly towards  Russia-like system even pre-Trump.  But now it is just blatant and because of race-baiting and other very Soviet-like tactics the middle and lower classes seem to be OK with it.  I mean, Trump's Secretary of Education hates public education, made her fortune off of taking government money for private education, and stands to profit enormously from the voucher program they are going to ram through with executive orders.  Same with private prisons, which is essentially a form of institutional slavery - Trump cronies getting lucrative contracts to lock up minor drug offenders and then pay them 10 cents an hour to do work for their affiliates.  It sounds crazy, and it is....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biggest addition I'd like to make is that Russia wants buffer states around itself, the whole reason for the USSR during the 50s. They want to protect themselves against land invasions on all sides because of WW II, which killed millions and devastated their cities.</p>
<p>Let me be clear, this isn't meant to be apologetic, but it's the reason for the Crimea invasion. Everything they're doing is for national security, same way as the US, EU, or China. </p></div>		</li>
