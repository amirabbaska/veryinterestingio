			<div class="markdown"><p>So there's some truth to this, but it also way oversimplifies things and misses the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>So the big difference between them is that Japan borrows in Yen, their own currency, while Greece borrows in Euros. Japan cannot run out of Yen because if worse comes to worst they can simply print more. Greece on the other hand can't just print more because the supply of euros is controlled by the ECB (European central bank, the organization that decides how many Euroes there are) in Frankfurt and indirectly by all the euro countries, Germany being the most influential.</p>
<p>Government debt is traded on the so called bond market. Since Japan will always be able to pay their debts, their bonds are considered risk free and have a very low interest rate, that is they can borrow very cheaply. The only thing to look out for is inflation (their money becoming worth less) since if Japan were to start printing lots of money to pay their debt the bonds (essentially government IOU's) which are denominated in Yen would become worth less and so the Japanese government would have to pay higher interest rates to compensate. However no one expects this to happen since Japan has had so little inflation for so long and for complicated reasons it is thought that if inflation were to rise it would also mean more growth in the Japanese economy so there wouldn't be any problem to pay the debt. So Japan is safe.</p>
<p>Greece on the other hand has debt in a currency that they can't print. So them running out of money and be unable to pay their debt is a real fear. This almost happened a few years ago. Banks considered lending to the Greek government risky since they weren't sure if they would get their money back, and so they started charging higher rates which made people even more nervous and round and round and Greeces interest rate on their debt shot up to impossible levels. To save Greece from bankruptcy the ECB said that they would do whatever it took to prevent bankruptcy. Essentially just saying that if needed they would print money to loan to Greece. This calmed the banks who knew that they would get their money back no matter if the Greek government had any money or not. This was enough to make the crisis calm down, the ECB didn't have to do anything other than promise to help just in case.</p>
<p>However in return for this promise plus some help packages the other euro countries demanded that Greece get its finances in order by reducing their expenses to try to reduce their deficit. However this austerity has led to huge unemployment and recession. The drop in GDP made the debt ratio even worse, and the reduced tax revenue made the deficit even worse. This led to calls for even more austerity and you can see where this is going.</p>
<p>It's all exacerbated by the fact that their currency can't drop in value to compensate. When a country with its own currency has a crisis like this normally their currency will drop in value, which is kinda like everyone in the country taking a pay cut at the same time. This will make their exports more competitive which helps their economy recover. However in Greeces case they can't do this because of the euro so they have to cut their wages manually to try to become more competitive. This is a very slow process (not just in Greece but everywhere, wages falling in net terms is never easy) which means that it can take a very long time to get out of this crisis.</p>
<p>When people reduce this to a morality tale where Greece behaved badly and the gods of economics are punishing them for their sins I think it's very unfair to the Greek people who certainly didn't deserve this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your reply unfortunately is misleading. While certainly Greece's lack of control over the euro removes one of the levers to deal with its debt problem, you're skirting around the fact that Greece's monetary problems developed well before it adopted the euro in 2002.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, while Greece had control over its own currency, its economy was in a mess with high unemployment, inflation and surging debt. Its borrowing costs were sky high. Its adoption of the euro brought with it financial stability and lowered borrowing costs.</p>

<p>My point is that the Greeks gave up their drachma and control over their own currency because of their own financial mismanagement.</p>
<p>The problem is that the successive Greek governments took advantage of the lowered borrowing costs to overspend on non-critical infrastructure (Olympics anyone) and political patronage. </p>

<p>Take note that Venezuela is another country having its own economic issues, its currency has depreciated tremendously in value and this has not helped its economy. You cannot fix the economy without taking care of its underlying problems. In both Venezuela and Greece's cases, the underlying problem is excessive public expenditure greatly in excess of its income.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, they promised government retirement programs that were so far above and beyond anything they could ever afford and now want to blame everyone else.  It's ridiculous.</p>
<p>The spoils system was also in place.  Every time there was a new administration, they would fire everyone and hire their own people.  Often times empty government buildings not being used for anything would have 150+ &quot;janitors&quot; to clean a building that wasn't being used.  Ofc none of these people actually did any work, or if they did, it didn't create any wealth.  A decade of this has just destroyed their economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the fuckups don't end there! Greece is plaged by corruption in all levels and tax evasion is a national sport (as in most countries) and the Greek IRS/HMRC-equivalent is one of the most inefficient in the world, leaving billions of tax euros untapped.</p>
<p>Look up how many people were actually paying their swimming pool taxes....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't help Greece that they are actually a highly profitable market for European lenders. Because of the risk they are being charged a high market rate for the money lent to them. The risk is probably less than the interest rate suggesed because the lenders know the EU is at the end of the day likely to pay off debts lent in Euro's or it risks destroying the lenders.</p>
<p>If Greece could start to improve it's situation it would create a virtuous circle allowing them to refinance their debts at lower rates which would improve the amount they could invest in infrastructure, improving public confidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great explanation. This might be a bit outside of the scope of the question, but could you ELI5 what the benefits of joining the Euro are for a country like Greece? Simply that they offload their risk onto the rest of the EU? Because from my viewpoint it looks like the issues are coming from their inability to get their fiscal and monetary policy on the same page. Doesn't it seem like the plurality of currencies in the world actually helps deter such crises while being under a single mega-currency like the Euro makes them more severe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm studying this right now, it's a pretty difficult topic. Under fixed exchange rate, Greece (nor any other EU country) can't use monetary policy. They can't inflate away the debt, devalue to export, or adjust interest. Shocks coming from what is called the <em>real economy</em> are amplified. Moreover, they have legal obligations, such as the need to remain below the deficit threshold. Sounds pretty bad, but then, if each european country had it currency, several defaults would have happened already, and it's possible that some states wouldn't even exist anymore. It's simply a matter of choosing what you think is the best trade-off. Single currency does indeed have its merits, if implemented with diligence. The rise of far right and skepticism is just a signal that diligence wasn't exercised, when it really should</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the short term it allowed them to borrow much more money at a much better rate from banks outside Greece.</p>
<p>Prior to the Euro, foreign banks looking at lending in Greek Drachma faced a major risk if the Drachma lost value relative to their currency either in trading or because the government devalued it. German, French and other banks could charge a much higher interest rate to Greek customers allowing a lot of real things to be built in Greece so they did knowing that the debt was denominated in Euro and &quot;safe&quot;.</p>
<p>While things were going well, Greeks also did well from this - the housing boom there gave years of high employment which fed into the rest of the economy booming. The downside of this  only became apparent when the credit crunch in 2008 exposed the weakness in most of the PIIGS nations. </p>
<p>To be fair, every economic crash is obvious in hindsight but impossible to tell ahead of time. The world economy is a chaotic system built on public confidence and millions of competing companies and systems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interest rates for mortgages in Greece before the Euro were insanely high (above double digits). That adds a lot to how much you pay for a house over time. After the Euro, they had the same low interest rates as everyone else on the Euro, which was a HUGE advantage. In talking to people I know from Greece, they went on a buying binge of houses and durable goods after switching to the Euro because borrowing money was so relatively cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that Japan is a near-retirement doctor who decided to borrow money because interest rates are so damn low, and he has the loan covered by assets in his brokerage account.  He not only is still wealthy, he's still SOLVENT, and probably would cut debt if interest rates rise.  He's using debt as a tool.  </p></div>		</li>
