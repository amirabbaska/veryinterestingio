			<div class="markdown"><p>It's dual damascene; the via and trench are filled at the same time</p>
<p>It's not silicon dioxide, it's a carbon-doped silicon oxide, sometimes porous</p>
<p>Lithography is the process of drawing the lines in photoresist using light, masks, and lenses</p>
<p>The etching is a direct plasma reactive ion etch</p>
<p>It isn't a buffer layer, it's barrier/seed - the barrier is usually tantalum nitride, not TiN. TiN is a barrier for WF6-based W deposition though. </p>
<p>In the plating bath, the wafer <em>is</em> the working electrode, it's the cathode. It's hooked up to either a potentiostatic or galvanostatic (or both) power supply to enable plating via ions usually supplied by the anode</p>
<p>Edit: Every single step here is hard to do and requires an incredible amount of optimization. And you jerk integrators just look at your data and tell me I'm the problem when it's always a goddamned litho/etch problem you motherfuckers. They run the damned fab! Let them sort it out!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newest litho machines don't use lenses as they rely on extreme ultra violet light, which won't pass through a lense. They rely on mirrors and the light path is under vacuum. Still quite a bit of loss per mirror; about 1/3 of total euv per mirror. </p>
<p>I maintain a EUV litho tool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that EUV is not used in any commercial products now.</p>
<p>And that even once EUV is used, it will only be used for the finest features, and that DUV will still constitute the majority of litho process steps.</p>
<p>Are these beliefs correct?</p></div>		</li>
