			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree it's unlikely, but the universe is enormous.  And the life formed by chemicals made of other elements doesn't have the reach the complexity of carbon-based life.  It just has to be self-replicating and maintain some form of disequillibrium with it's environment.   The first organisms on earth (though not cellular/living) were made of a single self-replicating molecule...I would not be surprised if certain sulfur chains, boron chains, or silicon chains could do this.  Additionally, I would not be shocked if we found 0 cases of this (if we had all the information in the universe).</p>
<p>There's some information to suggest this may be possible; however, the chemical concentrations needed and conditions necessary are probably extremely rare...orders of magnitude more rare than abiogenesis for carbon life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe, but 2+2 = 4, no matter where you go in the universe. </p>
<p>What I mean by this is that just because the universe is enormous, we still know a lot about it. Atoms are atoms, and there's not going to be some alternate periodic table. Atoms will always combine in the exact same manner, no matter where you go in the universe. The laws of physics must be observed, even though the universe is enormous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your reply is off-topic.  I never insinuated laws would change.</p>
<p>I just think the probability of forming life from other elements is small.  As such, if we had a small universe, I would say our chances of encountering such life are nearly impossible (as the probability would be so infinitesimally small).  However, our universe is not small...so even events that have a tiny probability of occurring often still occur many times.  </p>
<p>The problem here is, how small do you think the probability of forming this kind of life is? (it could be such a small number that our large universe isn't enough to give us a decent probability of observing it, this probability could be zero, or it may occur in our universe - just much less frequently than carbon) - and that is something science has not been able to put a number on yet.  Until then, taking either side is a legitimate stance as long as you know the facts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't necessarily need analogous compounds for life though. It may be possible to make something that meets the definition of life using a much smaller group of compounds. It's all guesses based on what we've seen. What we've seen is likely just a fraction of what is possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still think carbon is the natural choice. Nothing else can come close to the complexity that organic chemistry provides, and any sort of life would require this complexity. Any life would require some analogue of enzymes, because the formation of complex molecules will always be kinetically unfavored and it is difficult to imagine an inorganic chemical framework allowing for this. Self replication in biological systems <em>always</em> requires a macromolecule of some sort, and this is pretty much exclusively catalyzed by protein enzymes. Even viruses require host proteins for replication. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Life may not require this complexity, though evolution is likely to make life (in most environments) extremely complicated over time.  </p>
<p>Abiogenesis is believed to have originated with single self-replicating RNA molecules.  It is entirely possible we may find life consisting primarily on non-carbon material, albeit their &quot;complexity limit&quot; is likely to always be lower than what ours likely is.</p></div>		</li>
