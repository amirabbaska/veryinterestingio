			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>In brief:</strong>
the oxygen isotope ratio in marine microfossils can vary with other contemporary factors, it is often imperfectly preserved, and the ocean floors only give us 200 million years of records (less than 5% of Earth's history). </p>
<p><strong>To explain a bit further:</strong>
The oxygen isotope ratio described above is actually used as an indicator of how much water is in the oceans compared to how much is locked up as ice at the poles, and so <strong>global temperature</strong> is indirectly inferred from this (as well as the potential extent of glaciation). </p>
<p>It's not just the balance between water in oceans and ice at the poles that influences the ratio. Temperature of the water itself that the microorganism shells were originally formed in is another factor that affects it, and so <strong>local and/or small scale  temperature</strong> variability in the water may complicate the picture, for instance more variation may be seen in the shells of species that lived in surface waters, where solar radiation has caused temperature differences. For this reason bottom dwelling species are preferred. </p>
<p>There are some other confounding factors, particularly for surface waters: the carbonate ion concentration of the original seawater, the composition of the local precipitation (which varies with latitide), and other local disturbances to the ratio like rivers flowing into the ocean or iceberg melting. </p>
<p>Another problem is the fact that not all microfossils are perfectly preserved, and in many cases there has been a recrystallisation of the minerals that get analysed for isotopes since the original deposition, which messes with the ratios. </p>
<p>Having said all of this, the chemistry of the above problems has recieved a lot of attention and can be largely corrected for. Despite local variabilities, within certain geographic regions the relationship between isotope ratios and one of the other variables can be reasonably close. </p>
<p>When wanting to reconstruct past global climate, the age of seafloor is an unavoidable limitation. The fossils that are analysed for isotopes are in marine sediments, where a nice continuous record has been built up. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera" target="_blank">Foraminifera</a>, or forams for short (hence my username) are commonly used as the microfossil to get the isotope data; forams have made up a part of marine sediments raining down on the seafloor for the last half a billion years or so. Unfortunately, there is practically zero seafloor out there older than about 200 million years, as it gets recycled back into the Earth at subduction zones. There are marine sediments which have become part of continental rocks, although these can be much harder to place in the record and are only tiny snatches of the puzzle. </p>
<p>As with much of the science in reconstructing past climates, the key is to correlate findings with as many other different sorts of records as possible. Only this way can some of the limitations be resolved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I didn't understand half of that. I guess I should have also asked how much does this data help predict future weather patterns and climate? And limitations on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what gets me- if we're looking a few tens of years into the past, we have extremely accurate measurements- in both temperatures, and times. We can, therefore, see the patterns in the temperatures- it was low for 35 years, then shot up for 15 years, for instance.</p>
<p>But when we look at the temperatures from millions of years ago, we are getting a very inaccurate numbers- in both temperatures, and timeframes.  The temperatures are not directly measured, but are second-or third-generation extrapolations from other data.  And, because of the relative scarcity of evidence, any given result will only be the average of a relatively long period of time- a 50-year cycle will not even show up.  Also, even a minor variance in conditions may cause a relatively large difference in the outcome - that ice core sample may have been taken from an area that was in a crevasse millions of years ago, and thus not exposed to the elements, and thus has more or less of whatever you're looking for.  An ice core from 10 feet to the east would have completely different results.  (And, yes, I know they take multiple core samples to try to avoid this problem.)</p>
<p>Thus, we have detailed info of the temperature going up over the last few years/decades, but only vague and fuzzy data from long ago, which vagueness and fuzziness may be hiding temperature swings as large or larger than the one we are in now.  Think of it being really foggy out, and you have two billboards- one 10 feet away, and one 1000 feet away. You can see the near billboard clearly enough to see the small details. but the farther billboard looks fuzzy... but it may be just as detailed (or even more detailed) as the near one.</p></div>		</li>
