			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty close on most (white chocolate contains at least 3.5% milk fat, for example), at least based on the US FDA Standard of Identity for chocolate.</p>
<p>There's basically 4 types of chocolate: semisweet, sweet, milk and white (there is no &quot;dark&quot; chocolate - it's a subset of semisweet). Sweet and milk each have a couple of sub-types. They're all combinations of cocoa powder and cocoa butter, sugar and milk. </p>
<p>The FDA specifies minimum levels of each component to be able to call a food &quot;chocolate.&quot; If it doesn't meet the standard, the best it can be is chocolate flavoured. (Fun Fact: Hershey's Syrup is no longer chocolate syrup, as it doesn't meet the standards. Read the label carefully- it's Hershey's Syrup, genuine chocolate flavoured. Nestle Quik Syrup is chocolate, though.)</p>
<p>There's also a SOI for nibs, and various forms of cocoa solids.</p>
<p>Source: worked in confectionery, have taken classes in chocolate and have eaten the cacao fruit and beans.</p>
<p>Here's the FDA's Standard of Identity for various forms of chocolate (definitely not ELI5, though): <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=fe2b45308c9c24d02c822a6f8146302a&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&n=pt21.2.163&r=PART#sp21.2.163.b" target="_blank">https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=fe2b45308c9c24d02c822a6f8146302a&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&n=pt21.2.163&r=PART#sp21.2.163.b</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less milk and (maybe) less sugar. There is no SOI for dark chocolate, so it's really just a marketing term (at least where the SOI is concerned) - I've seen sweet dark chocolates with more sugar than milk chocolate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>White chocolate isn't actually chocolate though. That's why it's usually called white fudge. It doesn't have any chocolate solids in it so it isn't technically chocolate </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's made from cocoa butter, which is part of the cacao bean. It is chocolate, just without cocoa powder. :) The FDA passed the rule in 2002.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No no no, don’t eat them plain, look for something that has them in it. I work at a Lindt store, so I can tell you it’s usually paired with dark chocolate but it taste much less bitter cuz even dark chocolate has sugar in it. You gotta have something to sweeten it up</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yogurt topper. Granola topper. Salad topper. </p>
<p>Delightful crunch and stupendous super food. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the new kind: Ruby chocolate is made from the Ruby cocoa bean. Can't find any other particulars of the process.</p>
<p>It's not even in stores yet (as far as I know), but it's supposedly naturally reddish and fruity. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_chocolate" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> says it's &quot;sweet yet sour.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experience (ie having tasted it), it is much less fermented. Personally, I was expecting something totally different, but it tasted more like a fruity white chocolate.</p></div>		</li>
