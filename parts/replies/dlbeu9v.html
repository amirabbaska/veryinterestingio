			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, illegal by plumbing code???</p>
<p>My brother and his wife have <a href="http://soak.com/1160mm-harper-gloss-grey-combined-vanity-unit--cesar-iii-pan_p31371215.htm" target="_blank">a setup like this</a>, and it's set up to run water through the tap to fill up the tank, so the tap runs from when you flush, to when the tank is full. They love it because it pretty much mandates washing your hands (since the tap turns on anyway when you flush). They also have a regular no-flushing-required sink of course. </p>
<p>But, how is this illegal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk where they are at. Keep in mind I am all for those systems but I do this for a living Wich means abiding by codes for state county city etc and dealing with the inspectors. By upc it must have the stamp on it certifing eligibility. But again, good on them for doing it anyways. Japan has these and I loved them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, given your knowledge and design, would people ever be able to use enough grey water in this system for flushing? I've never thought about how many flushes I do a day, but if I did 5, lets say, would that be about 10 gallons of water? One shower would be way more than that I assume. Seems like toilet use is just a single digit % of how much water a person uses in a day at home.  </p>
<p>I thought of this when you mentioned the overflow switches - seems like it would always be overflowing...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly the best way to reduce your overall water consumption is to reduce your indirect consumption. That would be like stuff you buy and eat. If I remember rightly, a 3oz serving of beef takes something like 500 gal of water to produce. Sure limiting your direct use is a good thing, but if you really want to make a difference, buy fewer things and eat less meat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct sir, I won't bore u w the math but just off the top of my had toilets use bout 5-10% of the total water used so there's an obvious over filling issue....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or, far more likely, the codes were written 80 years ago and the very concept of something like this was all but inconceivable at the time.</p>
<p>Either way, I'd like to hear some elaboration on the matter, as well!</p></div>		</li>
