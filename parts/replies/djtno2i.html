			<div class="markdown"><p>Reproduction is always a race between the sexes due to the male wanting to have a lot of children and invest as little as possible into them (Sperm is very easy to produce) and the female wanting to have few children with the best male (eggs are very costly) and have the male invest as much time into the children as possible. That's the basic principle of sex in nature. We also evolved in this kind of race, but with society the race is not that obvious anymore, but the mechanisms are still there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of concealed fertility is to make the male stick around so he knows the child is his, always watching his woman to make sure he's no cuckold. If it was overt fertility he'd be over it after he knew he put a baby in her and it would decrease the fitness of the mother and child (they are much more likely to die). </p></div>		</li>
