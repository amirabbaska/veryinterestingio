			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect explanation. Just to clarify, imagine a bunch of white straws <em>standing up vertically</em> packed together on a black table. Looking down on them, the ones that are directly below you will allow you to see the black table underneath. but for the ones in your peripheral vision (outside a small circular area directly below you), you won't be able to see all the way down the straw to the black table, you will only see the white interior walls of the straws from an angle</p></div>		</li>
