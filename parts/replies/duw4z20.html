<p>A redshift is nothing but shifting the spectrum more towards the red or more precise: due to the movement (just that in thise case it is space between us and the object that expands) of the observed object the wavelength appears to us shifted. It is changing nothing else (like blurring out or so; that those images of far-away galaxies are only blurred dots has to do with the fact they're really, really far away and the telescope cannot resolve them better due to this (to add one more nested comment: it is a stunning miracle we can resolve so far away galaxies at all)). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hubble only sees visible light. If the light goes out of the range of visible light into infrared, it can't see it. The James Webb can 'see' infrared light. So extreme red shifting will still be picked up by it's detectors.</p></div>		</li>
