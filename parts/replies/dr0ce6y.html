			<div class="markdown"><p>Lux doesn't measure light it measures light flux, hence the name lux. But I do think that it is a good measure of the relative brightness of a  light source in a given area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's lumens that measure luminous flux.  Lux measure <em>illuminance</em>.  The name is not derived from <strong>lu</strong>minous flu<strong>x</strong> <em>or</em> from <strong>l</strong>ight fl<strong>ux</strong>, but from the Latin <em>lux</em>, meaning &quot;light&quot;.</p>
<p>But the point really is that the meaning of <em>light</em> in the standard register of English covers several concepts, luminance (SI unit: cd), luminous flux (lm), and illuminance (lx) all among them.  For this particular question, I consider illuminance to be the most applicable one, and hence lx to be the appropriate unit.</p></div>		</li>
