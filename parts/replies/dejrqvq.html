			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I guess any fish waste could feed plants on the surface. It was all about how small of a fish farm could be used to grow crops with minimal water usage too. Figuring out ways to feed people in drought. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think most animals figured out sex leads to baby animals. While humans can be proud of out many discoveries, I don't think that's one we need to frame and put on the wall.</p>
<p>Also minor point, evolution doesn't work via &quot;figuring it out&quot;. Those humans who had more sex, and stronger sex drives, just reproduced more than those who (presumably) didn't. They won the numbers game, probably without realizing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd disagree that most species understand sex leads to babies. I think they have an innate drive to simply have sex (proximate cause). The byproduct (ultimate cause) is that it leads to offspring.</p>
<p>It probably took humans a very long time to figure out sex leads to babies. After all,  there is a 9 month gap between the cause and effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most animals don't have a written or verbal form of keeping history so you might want to rethink your theory, unless you mean each individual animal somehow worked out sex leads to baby animals. In which case you might want to rethink your theory. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most animals don't have abstract reasoning, which is what is required for complex language and history, etc. Nonetheless many species do have an innate knowledge of sex and reproduction, which can be seen in how they organize their social heirarchy. Many species will form harems, trying to prevent other males from mating with females. They recognize their own offspring, atleast prior to maturity. Other species form pair bonds long before birth, for example birds mate and build a nest together. Why would they do so unless they &quot;know&quot;, on some innate level, that what they are doing will result in fertilized eggs down the road? Obviously they don't have the same reasoning capabilities as humans, but they don't need too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of the idea is that a stronger sex drive and essentially year-round estrus evolved because those without that extra push didn't have as many babies. And, perhaps those without the push didn't have as many babies because, with growing intelligence, they were more aware of the dangers and burdens of child-rearing.</p>
<p>So, intelligent animals &quot;need&quot; a higher sex drive to off-set an awareness of the dangers and burdens of child-rearing.</p>
<p>There is small evidence that a higher IQ correlates to a higher sex drive:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well my understanding is that evolution dosn't go off needs or wants,  but simple survival and reproduction. So if deaths in childbirth were an issue that negatively affected the survivability of a group, the women who died in childbirth would have a lower chance of reproduction than those who were able to survive. Over a few generations those with a greater chance of survival would dominate the gene pool. That would result in the population that we have today. I'm not sure if being aware of the dangers of childbirth factored in, unless that awareness drove sexual selection, for example women with wider hips (one of the adaptations to our babies big brains) were able to attract fitter mates or something along those lines.</p></div>		</li>
