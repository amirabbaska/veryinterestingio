			<div class="markdown"><p>Can our bodies come with instructional manuals? How the fuck are we supposed to know all these body life hacks? There's probably something like if we rub our right pinky toe while squatting, it will release some chemical from our brain that accelerates our digestive process and makes up poop really quick so that we can run from a predator quicker. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About rubbing toe, I have this thing that if I press the tip of my ring toe (next to the pinky toe) a bit hard, I somehow feel good. I also like trimming that particular toe's nail. Don't know why. None of the other toes feel like that one toe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't really stimulate the vagus nerve without changing cardiac output. It's within the carotid sheath in your neck and just putting pressure on the nerve wouldn't do anything. I explained the &quot;Carotid Massage&quot; in another comment but if you google Carotid Massage is is indeed a medical maneuver that's very well understood! (But by glossopharyngeal, not vagus. OUTPUT to your heart is vagus but the initial stimulation is CN IX)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but /u/ronkmaster is claiming that the reason people run their necks when anxious is to stimulate the carotid. That seems like a huge assumption. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So carotid massages stimulate the glossopharyngeal nerve and not the vagus nerve, but it still works to reduce blood pressure and heart rate and stuff? </p></div>		</li>
