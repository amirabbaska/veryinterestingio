			<div class="markdown"><p>yea, .. a chess-computer is a very complex machine, made a strong chess opponent by <em>many</em> features adding to one another to its strength:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>whole branch depth,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>brute force inquiry into variants depending on e.g. strong change in position's rating,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hash tables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opening book, endgame-module,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>different playing styles (&quot;aggressive&quot;, &quot;defensive&quot;, &quot;strategical&quot;, &quot;tactical&quot;, a.m.m.),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the (different) weighing of different attributes of a position to rate it and choose a move,</p>
</li>
<li><strong>..</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>and many more - I'm actually lay in such things, just a player - and all of these make up the &quot;<em>engine</em>&quot; and last not least, such &quot;engines&quot; can work together.</p>
<p>Any of these features that make the chess-computer strong can be handicapped, be it in matter of reducing thinking-time or by random values within a threshold or by setting them according to a chosen strength level or by simply switching a feature off or.. or .. or ..</p></div>		</li>
