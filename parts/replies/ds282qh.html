<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_salicylate" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_salicylate</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In pure form, methyl salicylate is harmful, when taken orally. A single teaspoon (5 ml) of methyl salicylate contains approximately 6 g of salicylate,[20] which is equivalent to almost twenty 300 mg aspirin tablets (5 mL * 1.174 g/mL = 5.87 g). The lowest published lethal dose is 101 mg/kg body weight in adult humans,[21] (or 7.07 grams for a 70-kg adult). It has proven fatal to small children in doses as small as 4 ml.[11] A seventeen-year-old cross-country runner at Notre Dame Academy on Staten Island died in April 2007 after her body absorbed methyl salicylate through excessive use of topical muscle-pain relief products.[22]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most instances of human toxicity due to methyl salicylate are a result of over-application of topical analgesics, especially involving children. Salicylate, the major metabolite of methyl salicylate, may be quantitated in blood, plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in an autopsy.[23]</p></div>		</li>
