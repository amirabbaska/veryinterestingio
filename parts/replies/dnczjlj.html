<p>This is why new drugs cost a lot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For clarity, do the major drug companies in the US spend more money developing drugs or marketing them? And another question - is a huge part of drug research, especially for priority-rated NMEs (the most innovative drugs) as opposed to slight tweaks on existing ones to keep the patent longer, funded by public dollars or is it all pharma companies' money? Final question - the law that allowed results of public research to be patented had a provision to allow price caps in exchange, how many drugs have had such a price cap applied? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think most of the sources that say drug companies spend more on marketing are based around a misunderstanding of accounting as well as how many drug companies develop drugs from a business perspective. For example many times articles will take the whole SG&amp;A expense and compare it to R&amp;D. </p>
<p>SG&amp;A includes many not marketing expenses such as HR, accounting, finance, sales and office space for the corporate office.
The amount spent on pure marketing is likely much lower  than the quoted expense. </p>
<p>Another aspect is that if company A spends 500 million developing a drug and company B buys company A for 1 billion this is not included as an R&amp;D expense for B even though it effectively cost them 1 billion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even taking your argument at face value, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28212223" target="_blank">compare the profits column with the research costs column.</a> E.g. Pfitzer, 22 billion profits (not revenue, profits) vs 6.6 billion on R&amp;D. What accounts for drugs being so expensive again? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response, but I think it's also worth noting that these &quot;great treatments&quot; ARE being used, with more introduced all the time. When my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, it was a type that several years earlier would have killed her in months, but they discovered a treatment that worked for another 10 years, and a few others that bought her another year or two, most of that time with a good quality of life. </p>
<p>My father in law has been doing something similar, and it seems that each time a treatment loses its effectiveness, some new option has just been introduced. </p>
<p>No, cancer hasn't been cured, and still wins way too much of the time, but we are able to put up a better fight all the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they are. I'm in drug development (not in oncology), but I have a collaborator at the Norris Cancer Research Hospital at USC. Novel therapies are definitely being developed and improved upon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your 4th point was a great read. I sometimes feel bad how people aren't able to appreciate the things they don't understand. I'm sure a person who has studied physiology would be getting goosebumps on that last point because s/he realizes the complexity involved. </p>
<p>I wish people were able to appreciate more what their body does for them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I wish I didn't know what I know. It's better to think of science and medicine as a magical thing. The deeper you get into it, you begin to understand how little we actually know and how much of what we do relies on assumptions we have to make because there is no better alternative. </p></div>		</li>
