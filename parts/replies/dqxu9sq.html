<p>helium can fuse to carbon. The higher temperature causes the outer layers to expand into a red giant. </p>

<p>No, this is a common inaccurate statement about stellar evolution. The red giant phase does <em>not</em> occur at the beginning of the helium fusing phase. </p>
<p>Rather, a star goes red giant at the beginning of the hydrogen shell burning phase (as opposed to the hydrogen core burning that it was previously doing). Once it runs out of hydrogen to fuse in both core and shell, it begins helium burning at the core, and shrinks back down in the process to become a horizontal branch star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right about that iron cannot be used for fusion. Actually no process that creates a nucleus heavier than iron-56 or nickel-62 will produce energy but instead use energy. So the sun can't run on anything that will fuse into a nucleus heavier any of those two. This is because for elements lighter than those two elements, the reactants together will have a higher mass than the products. This excess of mass will be 'transformed' into energy. This difference in mass is due to difference in atomic binding energy between the reactants and products. The opposite is true for nuclear fission.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Iron can be fused and many stars do fuse iron. It just does not release more energy than it takes to fuse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iron and heavier elements are typically produced endothermically by the energy from lighter elements and gravitational collapse in a super nova. The super nova phase is also necessary if any of those heavier elements get out of the star to form the dusts and things that condense into planets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Supernova nucleosynthesis within exploding stars by fusing carbon and oxygen is responsible for the abundances of elements between magnesium (atomic number 12) and nickel (atomic number 28).[1] Supernova nucleosynthesis is also thought to be responsible for the creation of rarer elements heavier than iron and nickel, in the last few seconds of a type II supernova event. The synthesis of these heavier elements absorbs energy (endothermic process) as they are created, from the energy produced during the supernova explosion. Some of those elements are created from the absorption of multiple neutrons (the R process) in the period of a few seconds during the explosion. The elements formed in supernovas include the heaviest elements known, such as the long-lived elements uranium and thorium.</p>
