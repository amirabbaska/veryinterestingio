			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus many animals actually DO eat a fairly varied diet.  The word ALL in OPs title is incorrect.  </p>
<p>Example:  When wolves eat prey, they don't just eat muscle meat.  They will eat the eyes, brain, and organs; these items all contain different nutrients.  Then they will eat some grass for fiber, or clay to help with digestion.  They have been known to lick rocks for minerals.  </p>
<p>There are many other examples of this in the animal world.  So it's not like all animals only eat one thing.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Its not that wolves evolved sharp teeth because they only eat meat.  Its just that they only evolved sharp teeth because they use the teeth of their prey to chew their fruits and vegies for them.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been looking for a source on that for years now. Could you please send me a link or point me to any source about predators eating their preys stomach contents.</p>
<p>The idea is that we as humans did not invent by accident our fermented stuff (cheese, pickles, sauerkraut, salami, etc.) actually we were trying to reproduce/recreate something we loved and craved during our hunter-gatherer era: the stomach contents of our prey but also during our scavenging era the rotten meat, (which we now know how to do in a controlled fashion to be sure that it's not dangerous for our health: salami, ham, fish sauce, stink fish from Sweden and Iceland, etc.)</p>
<p>Today the main theory is that somebody was making bread or milking, then left and forgot all about it. Came back to a nice smelling and liked it a lot, thus started the fermenting era. I call bullshit. Fermented food smells awfully disgusting and looks spoiled if you have not first somehow developped a taste for it like when you hunt and kill your prey: you try to get to that sweet liver while some of the stomach's content spills on it.</p>
<p>Interestingly many cheeses are made by mixing the curd/milk with a cow's gut bacteria. In the past, the milk would be held in a cow's cleaned intestines for a few weeks to months. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, during the lean months wolves actually will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf#Diet" target="_blank">eat plants</a> for energy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wolves supplement their diet with fruit and vegetable matter. They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apples and pears. They readily visit melon fields during the summer months.</p>

<p>They don't like it, and it's not particularly good for them, but they will do it in order to avoid starving to death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, the old life expectancy data is very much influenced by child mortality. Sure, many people died from diseases that can now be cured easily (eg. appendicitis) or from accidents (eg. eaten by a bear), but people from older generations still could live to be 75-80 it was just not the average as it is now in developed countries. Many people did live to be 75 and the averages dropped because many babies died on their first years of life. It is not true that eating an unvaried diet is going to make you live 30 years, I bet an eskimo who only ate fish could live to be 75 easily.</p></div>		</li>

Today breaking your leg means a few months off work, possibly financial hardship, but 200 years ago it could have easily meant death.

</blockquote>
<p>Feral cats typically live less than seven years. Even a moderately cared for indoor/outdoor or housecat can live for 15 years. A well taken care of cat can live as long as 24 years, but 15 is fairly average.</p>
<p>Also, don't be fooled into thinking that the same cat/dog food two to three times a day isn't a varied diet. Look at what's in it. There's a variety of stuff in those kibbles, animal proteins, vegetable proteins, fiber, all sorts of oils, vitamins and stuff to boot. Kibble isn't the end-all-be-all, but it's certainly not the same thing as eating the same microwave TV dinners every night.</p></div>		</li>

I took her home, got her fixed up, healthy , she stunningly regained her hearing and she'll turn 8 this year. It's almost a guarantee she has outlived her brothers and sisters that were still in the wild. She likely outlived most of them in the first winter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wildlife biologist here</p>
<p>I often get asked the lifespan of wild animal species, and it is extremely difficult to give an accurate answer because there are so many factors that come into play. Regardless, the average lifespan of a wild animal population is always going to be significantly shorter than the average lifespan of the same species in captivity, whether that means domesticated or in zoos. It is not uncommon for Chimps in zoos to live into their 50s, while 30 would probably be a more reasonable estimate for a wild chimp (if it makes it past infancy, that is).</p>
<p>This has to do with a number of factors, not just quality of diet (although that does play a large part).</p>
<p>As Tar_alcaran said above, the goals of a wild animal are much different than the goals of most humans. Health means something different to us than it does to them.</p>
<p>Additionally, different species have evolved in different ways, leading to different nutritional requirements. Realistically, a lot of the health and diet stuff you find online is mumbo jumbo. Humans who eat in moderation and lead an active life (as do basically all wild animals, out of necessity) can be exceptionally healthy on a very limited diet.</p></div>		</li>
