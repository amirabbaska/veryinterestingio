			<div class="markdown"><p>Just an important heads up:</p>
<p>The ISS is not in a vacuum. It is in fact in the ionosphere, probably one of the place with the highest natural density of ions... or charge carriers if you prefer. </p>
<p>This means that a lot of the actual problems of a vacuum doesn't apply to the ISS. </p>
<p>As a corollary, it also means that a lot of the actual advantages of a vacuum doesn't apply either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suppose you could build a high voltage DC generator and end it in a negatively charged needle to shed negative charge. But will that even work in a vacuum?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's called a <em>electron gun</em> and can be found in every Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). The opposite works just as well, by shedding off protons (ionized Hydrogen). This is how ion thrusters work (and it also means, that <em>every</em> ion thruster actually emits two beams, the main propellant beam and a neutralizing beam â€“ without doing so,  the propellant would be drawn back to the thruster over long periods of time).</p>
<p>However there's not much need to actively dissipate charge in lower Earth orbit. There are enough free charge carriers up there and any kind of charge imbalance will draw the oppositely charged ions from the ionosphere, resulting in a net neutral charge.</p></div>		</li>
