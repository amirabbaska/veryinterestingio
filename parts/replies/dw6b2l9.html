<p>Stress coming from having your work judged after it's done. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This. When the project is finished, then people can judge it. Those people might be the teacher, your peers, your customers, or yourself. Nobody criticizes a &quot;work in progress&quot; - it's still getting better. But once you tag it as &quot;finished&quot;, then you're open to criticism.</p>
<p>And the worst judge in all that is yourself. In the end this is the person that's getting in your way.</p>
<p>Source: suffer from the very same thing for a very long time. And no, I don't have any useful advice on how to overcome this self-inflicted affliction.... I'm open to advice;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted this in another comment, but I feel it important to call out imposter syndrome on this. I feel the weird uncomfortableness of presenting work because I feel like I shouldn't be there in the first place. This may be a lot of your feelings on the matter and may help in taking the plunge to publishing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One strategy I like is to imagine the worst possible outcome and then rationally analyze that situation. See it wouldn't be the end of the world, and then problem-solve what actions can make the situation better. OK, if I fail this test... can I do better on the next one and pass the course? Can I take the course again in the summer? I might even learn something useful I missed the first time around. Can I still graduate, and is anyone going to care after I get my diploma, land a job, and I move onto a better one? </p>
<p>Making a mental checklist of the resources at my disposal and the actions I can take to make the most of an unfavorable outcome can turn some of that anxiety into confidence. If I miss one shot, I know what to do next time to score.</p>
<p>Then there's a strategy of let's be realistic about other people. They're not as intently focused on you as you may be on yourself. Other people have their own problems and they're not going scrutinize your every mistake unless they have to, not because they are lenient but simply because they don't care. Let's be optimistically cynical. With the possible exception of your boss, the audience is not listening to your big presentation at the company meeting. Your co-workers are checking their email and thinking about what to cook for dinner. They know when you're bullshitting and they don't care, so long as it doesn't hurt them in a big way.</p></div>		</li>
