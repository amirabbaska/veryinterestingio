It takes a massive amount of work and watching to be able to pick the winners more often than not, and it's not just watching the races themselves, it's watching the trials, watching horses in the mounting yard, understanding the temperaments of the horses, how they react to certain types of tracks, how they race based off how many races they have been back from a spell, how they like to race in the field vs the preferences of the other horses in the race, and even then there's all sorts of minor variables that can have huge outcomes on races. Even the guys I know who follow it religiously and should know better tend to succumb to silly decisions or not doing their due diligence, and watching those guys fail constantly made me quit gambling for years so I didn't end up betting on horses every day and losing like those guys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone from the other side of the fence on sports betting, I can assure you that some people make good money on Horse Racing. Most modern Sportsbooks do not have hardcore handicappers on their immediate payroll anymore. Instead they post the lines &quot;good enough&quot; and with smallish limits and then wait on their known sharps to bet either side, moving the line accordingly and slowly raising the limits.</p>
<p>That means, in most of these markets, you are more playing against the other punters while paying the book their Vig like a flat fee.</p>
<p>The reason it is so hard to make money on Horses then is, that it is a sport with a long betting history and lots and lots of punters who pay attention really well and know their statistics. In many other sports, you get a huge amount of less sharp bets from people who just want to spice up their game night or support their local team no matter the odds or whatever and it is easier to win against those. But in Horse Racing, virtually everyone has at least heard something about the relative strengths and favorable odds of all the horses. It is a betting sport and that means it is much harder to beat the field (of punters).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think if you imposed limits on yourself you could consistently win money, but gamblers in general have poor impulse control which makes them want to bet on every race, instead of selecting a few choice horses over the course of a day and only sticking to those bets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that the moves the other players make do not affect you in anyway. Even when counting, you are just tracking the cards being played. It doesn't matter if they are played due to a bad move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinking about this more, someone who makes a mistake will not affect your equity in that hand.  But it can affect your equity for the rest of the shoe.</p>
<p>For example, a non-counter hitting a 12 vs a 2 when the deck is +10 is (1) bad for them even though they don't know it, and (2) bad for the counter, because it's one less card remaining in a good deck, which could potentially cost you a hand at the end of the shoe while the deck is still in your favor.  It's a very small decrease in equity, but it's there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. However, this bad move has an almost equal chance of using up a low card from the shoe. In that case, it would make the shoe better for the counter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: Horse racing</p>
<p>I've got a golf buddy who owns race horses, and he is just plugged into the system.  He does very well gambling on horses (actually keeps all of his betting receipts for tax purposes).  </p>
<p>But at the end of the day, its just like betting on football. He knows all the trainers and jockeys. He has access to data bases that give him stats on prior races, so he's always looking at race length, track conditions, and a million other factors that might impact the outcome. I've seen him going through the Racing Form for hours at a time.  To me, that's like spending hours looking at the stock pages in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Then he hardly ever bets on single races.  Its always multi-race bets that pay the best, and when the favorites do well, the payoff is less.  Many times he'll have twenty different bets on a single day of racing, and he only needs one of the them to &quot;hit&quot; to have a good day.</p></div>		</li>
