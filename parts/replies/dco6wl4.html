Cosmic rays have a predictable angular distribution and energy deposition in the various kinds of detectors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For LHCb it is quite challenging as the detector is built for particles that travel close to the horizontal. ^(I know you know that - it might be interesting for others.)</p></div>		</li>
