			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I'm wondering.  Is it a difference in brain development that causes us to recall memories from so early an age?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who develop speech earlier tend to form memories earlier too. Just one factor I've come across from a researcher who studied autobiographical memory. Others did include the cultural differences mentioned by the other commenter, like individualism in the US that means they tend to form memories earlier than those in China.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I have a couple memories from before age 1 and then a gap until age 3, but from there I have a pretty decent timeline. I was told I had a above average vocab by 9 mos. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some cross cultural psychology studies that compare age of earliest memories in different cultures, which influence age of onset autobiographical memories. For example, US kids have earlier first memories than Chinese kids, likely due to a higher importance of individualism in America. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that really so, though? I am a Chinese and while I agree with the lack of individuality in Chinese education systems, this doesn't affect toddlers since our <em>home</em> lives don't tend to be non-individualised to the point of it being significant. I personally have memories from when I was two years old, which were definitely real since I can recall a lot of details that there are no photos of. I also doubt that individualism affects very early memory, since most of our early memories are of things we see, not related to ourselves or who we were, so would the importance we place on ourselves really affect it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. Individualism is just one piece of a much bigger cultural shift that creates a trend for such a difference. I was just being lazy in such a reply. But I shall give you a more in depth exploration. Greenfield's theory of social change and human development (originally published in developmental psychology vol. 45 no. 2, 401- 418, 2009; and I believe again in 2015) contains an expansive discussion of the ecological, economic, and social changes occurring that affect these cultural trends for human development. I will try and find the article of the cross cultural comparison I originally mentioned as well. </p></div>		</li>
