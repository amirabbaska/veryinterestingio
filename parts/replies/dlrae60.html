			<div class="markdown"><p>isn't that also how a hygrometer works? (for humidity)</p>
<p>a thin piece of cloth is glued to a thin metal coil and it winds/unwinds slightly when humidity changes, causing the cloth to contract/loosen</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also how older thermostats worked. Two metals with different thermal expansion rates were glued together to make a bimetallic strip that curls up and down in response to the ambient temperature. This can then be hooked up to a circuit such that it turns on when the temperature exceeds or falls below a certain value. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite the same thing but some hydrographs used human hair to measure humidity, it would lengthen or shorten depending on humidity level, this would move a pen on a lever and draw on a rotating cylinder.</p></div>		</li>
