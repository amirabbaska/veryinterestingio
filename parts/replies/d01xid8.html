			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, a pressure wave builds up in front of your fingernail or you hand when flicking or swatting at insects that essentially cushions the initial impact.  Imagine standing in a open field and suddenly a 30x30 wall comes at you around 30mph (some have measured a finger flick at around 8-9m/s if I remember right).  That wall has built a huge pad of air directly in front of it like a pillow that, even if it does not push you out of the way, will seriously soften the impact of the wall.  You may be hurt but you will likely walk away with scratches rather than death.</p>
<p>Obviously for a fingernail this pressure wave is much smaller than a hand would be but the point is the same.  For an entire hand, the comparison is like a 150x500 foot wall coming at you and the wave is even larger.  This is the reason flyswatters work...all the small holes do not allow any significant wave to build, the fly or insect gets the full impact, and death occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That slight gush of air in front of the wall would be comparable to a very small 30 mph gust of wind. It would only decrease the impact if it started accelerating you. That's not enough wind to accelerate you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yo good explanation but I flick the shit out of small insects all the time and they usually die and if they don't they are at least fucked up when I inspect them after. Good response but the real response is up your flick game is weak you are a human being flick it into the grave you bitch no excuses</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes.&quot;</p>
<p>I will never forget the principles involved here because of that quote.</p></div>		</li>
