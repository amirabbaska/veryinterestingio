			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live, abortions are free if you're a resident or citizen if you're referred (pretty much everyone) and they'll happily slip an IUD (copper) in for free too. There are family planning centres that cost as much as $25 or free up until you're $23 I believe and they'll give you shit loads of condoms for $5, Also, birth control is relatively cheap and easily accessible. Lastly sex ed is pretty standard across all schools here, unsure of the private schools though (I've been to many schools). BUT the poor people definitely have lots more kids compared to say, the middle class. </p>
<p>Edit: sorry, just to rephrase, I meant most people are referred for abortions here so it is free. It makes me sad that public healthcare is so expensive in other countries.</p></div>		</li>
