			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is theoretically possible to build reflecting telescopes of that size. But it would be extremely expensive to do so. The next generation of telescopes will have 30-40m diameter mirrors. That is tripling the size of our current largest telescopes. They cost more than a billion dollar. <a href="http://www.space.com/27930-european-extremely-large-telescope-construction-approved.html" target="_blank">source</a><br />
We are pretty smart so we will probably eventually figure out how to build telescopes of that size, but that will be at least several decades into the future. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember learning about this because I had a friend who thought the moon landing was fake, that there were aliens hiding on the moon, the whole enchilada. Even the Hubble telescope can't make out the detail of the lander on the moon. So when <a href="http://www.space.com/14874-apollo-11-landing-site-moon-photo.html" target="_blank">NASA's LRO satellite returned pictures of the Apollo 11 site on the moon,</a> with footprint trails and everything, that pretty much shut him down... about the landing being fake. He still believes there are alien bases on the moon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tURyKxAfEtg" target="_blank">example video</a> lol</p>
<p>edit: additional article:  <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/11jul_lroc/" target="_blank">Abandoned Spaceships - For the first time since the 1970s, a NASA spacecraft will get clear pictures of Apollo relics on the Moon.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are six landing sites scattered across the Moon. They always face Earth, always in plain view. Surely the Hubble Space Telescope could photograph the rovers and other things astronauts left behind. Right?</p>
<p>Wrong. Not even Hubble can do it. The Moon is 384,400 km away. At that distance, the smallest things Hubble can distinguish are about 60 meters wide. The biggest piece of left-behind Apollo equipment is only 9 meters across and thus smaller than a single pixel in a Hubble image.</p>
