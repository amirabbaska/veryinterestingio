			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add to this that monitoring anaesthesia for obese patients is supposed to be more difficult to manage as well. Too much vs too little, hard to judge with 100% confidence in obese patients.</p>
<p>Another thing, doing cpr or other life saving maneuvers are a lot trickier when someone is overweight. The weight on their chest when they're laying down makes it harder for them to breathe. If anything goes sideways during an operation, unless there are &quot;cranes&quot; in the OR, it's a huge task to move them at all.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law just had a crazy health scare and she's significantly overweight. It was so hard for the emergency doctors/nurses to find a vein in her arm that they could slip an IV into that they were considering putting it into her neck or on/around her foot or ankle. The hospital had an anesthesiologist on call and he had to come in to do the IV.  </p>
<p>I recently read a book written by a surgical nurse and he related a story about a colleague that was helping to deliver a baby whose mother was obese. All of the sudden, the baby was going into distress and she was going to order an emergency c-section when she realized that the baby had already come out but was being held in place by a large fat roll. Not even her fault, but she literally couldn't see any vagina under all that fat.</p>
<p>I'm not here to bash people that are overweight/obese, just wanted to state that the quality of care for these patients is <em>WAY</em> lower than patients of average BMI. Again, not to say anything against any doctors, but there's a reason that there are some that specialize in overweight patients. It's just much higher risk, and there's no reason to end up with a malpractice lawsuit because a patient wanted to skip the exercise.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty ignorant about that sort of thing so excuse me if these are generally obvious questions. If you don't want to answer, that's fine, I'm just curious.</p>
<p>Is your team sent out on many other calls aside from obese patients or are you only routed after a weight/size is determined? Because of any of the reasons I stated above, is your ambulance equipped with completely different equipment beyond what's in regular ambulance units?</p>
<p>Do you have a fully fledged doctor with you when you get sent out, just in case a wall really <em>does</em> need to be knocked out and your patient is expected to need a wait?</p>
<p>Any other info is appreciated. I didn't even know there were bariatric specific ambulances until just now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend told me that's it's not a good procedure in the long run because you're killing the fat cells. Should you ever gain the weight back, the body will just store it somewhere else. Is this right?</p></div>		</li>
