			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a lot of interwebs people you're talking to are actually not American, we're not used to your strange ways of putting the $ sign before then number although you pronounce it after. </p>
<p>In my country you don't do that, so I often make the mistake of writing 50$.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're probably from a region of the world where they put the symbol after the number. Same reason you often see 1,000 written as 1.000. Either that or they were sick that day in Kindergarten when they taught what money is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This varies even inside the countries.</p>
<p>For example in Poland, standard is writing 1.000,00 as one thousand, but I personally never seen anyone do so. We just write 1000,00 or even 1000000000, we just can count zeros :P But I've also seen currency amounts written with 1'345'222.23zł, with apostrophe separating thousands and a period for decimals.</p>
<p>We also write our currency in two ways:<br />
1150 PLN<br />
1150 zł<br />
and with decimals:<br />
820,20zł<br />
820zł 20gr  </p>
<p>zł is <em>zloty</em><br />
gr is <em>grosz</em> (read grosh with hard r), it's 1/100th of 1zł<br />
PLN is <em>Polish New Złoty</em>, which came from 10000:1 denomination in early 90s.</p>
<p>As you can see, it's written always after the amount. Basically same with any other unit of measure: 300 miles, 100 joules, 80 watts, you name it, writing currency symbol after the amount is just so unnatural.</p>
<p>With swapped . and , in our notation system, there comes one caveat: our keyboard layout has comma in the numeric block. As an IT guy and a programmer I literally cringe every time I think someone thought it is good idea (well maybe it was for some things), so I always inject my own modified keyboard layout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because in other languages, the symbol goes after the number. People that are not native English speakers might write as what they learned in their first language.</p>
<p>For example, in French, you'd write it as 50$.</p>
