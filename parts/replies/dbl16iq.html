			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a reason for the rotation? Does it initiate during formation (and/or when more matter is introduced) and just never stop, or is it something else?</p></div>		</li>

<p>When matter coalesces, it tends to form rotating planes. This angular momentum is conserved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It had to form from something, and the odds of everything collapsing into it <em>perfectly straight</em> and not having any rotation or offset that'd start it rotating is just zero. Every star, planet, and spec of dust in the universe is rotating or moving at least a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much what karantza said. There are a lot more ways for something to be spinning than for something not to be spinning. It would be unusual for some system to naturally form without any kind of spinning at all</p></div>		</li>

<p>If it does, why is that the case? Aren't black holes treated as point masses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A rotating black hole has multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric#Important_surfaces" target="_blank">important &quot;surfaces&quot;</a>, some of which are spherical and some of which are more oblate. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric#/media/File:Schematic_Kerr_Black_Hole.jpg" target="_blank">this diagram</a> for example. The shapes are exaggerated, in a realistic black hole all of the surfaces would be <em>close</em> to spherical.</p>
<p>Also notice how the singularity is no longer a point but a ring.</p></div>		</li>
