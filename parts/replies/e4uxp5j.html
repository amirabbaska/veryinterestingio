			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but all things being equal, a purely switched L2 network will always be faster. There’s just simply more to do at layer 3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be pendantic but not all switches can route you need a newer L3 switch to be able to route, otherwise switches switch and routers route.</p>
<p>In human terms it's fast as shit lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically there are three &quot;levels&quot; to the internet: Access, Distribution, and Core.</p>

<p>That link is about Enterprise networks, not the Internet. Do you have a link that explains how the three-layer model relates to the Internet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Actually your local ISP is part of the Access layer, including all of its COs. The distribution layer includes the wholesaler(s) that your ISP gets its bandwidth from, and the Core layer connects those wholesalers together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good catch.  To be honest, I'm not enough of an authority on this to lecture beyond an ELI5 level.  I grabbed that link after a quick google search.  However, from a lay-person's perspective I'm not sure how significant the difference is.  In broad strokes, you've got your basic home/office networking hardware most people will be familiar with (access level). Beyond that is the customer facing network provided by your local ISP (or, in the case of larger businesses, the corporate network) that falls more in the distribution-level domain.  And beyond that is the internet backbone that ISPs and larger corporations connect to directly (core level).</p>
<p>... and that's about as much detail as I should probably attempt to answer this I'm afraid.  If someone else wants to jump in with corrections or more details (especially at the core level), they're welcome to do so.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While your explanation is decent, unless I'm not reading it right it would actually be 200ms for transport. 100ms each way. </p>
<p>This leaves 40ms for routing. As OP said 16 hops to the destination, this would be 40ms for 32 hops, or 1.25ms per hop. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But, yeah, 16 hops each way might mean 32 round trip, so halve the per-hop times.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pretty damn impressive though. I've never ceased to be amazed by the speed and efficiency of data transfer, and how the technology is improving so much. </p></div>		</li>
