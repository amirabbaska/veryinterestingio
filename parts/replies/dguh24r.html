			<div class="markdown"><p>Well how I thought about it was:</p>
<p>Dividing means splitting the (number on the numerator) into groups of (number in denominator).  For example, when you divide 10 apples by 5 students, each student get 2 apples. But when you are dividing 0 apples by 0 students, the answer cannot be 1 because there are no apples to give in first place. </p>
<p>EDIT: But I thought, if there was a situation where you wanted to split 0 apples by 0 students, wouldn't it make sense to say 0 students get 0 apples, because that is possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you are in charge of distributing apples.</p>
<p>If you have 10 apples for 5 students, you give 2 apples per student.</p>
<p>If you have 0 apples, you tell each student that you ran out and give them nothing.</p>
<p>If you have 0 students, it doesn't matter how many apples you have, there's nobody to give them to. </p>
<p>If you have 0 apples and 0 students, do you really have a job? You are just sitting around, contemplating your lack of apples that you are going to give (or not) to your lack of students. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what you said pretty much sums it up.</p>
<p>10/5 = 2</p>
<p>0/x = 0 (because there is nothing to divide)</p>
<p>x/0 = undefined (because if there are zero groups, you are simply not doing division)</p>
<p>0/0 = undefined (even worse you have nothing to divide AND no groups to divide it with!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Division is the opposite of multiplication.  </p>
<p>So if we have the equation:<br />
0/0 = 1  </p>
<p>Then obviously if we multiply both sides by zero...<br />
0 = 1 * 0<br />
0 = 0</p>
<p>Well that seems fine so far, but... what if it was 2 instead?<br />
0/0 = 2<br />
0 =  2 * 0<br />
0 = 0    </p>
<p>So is 0/0 1? Or 2?
Or it could be any number we choose to be on the right hand side. Clearly that makes no sense and our initial assumption was wrong - 0/0 can't be 1, or 2, or any number at all. It's undefined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The argument: 0/0=1, is equal to a/a=1.  There are no circumstances with rational numbers that make a/a=2.  IF there was any possible defined solution it would 1 and nothing else.</p></div>		</li>
