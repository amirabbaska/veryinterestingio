			<div class="markdown"><p>The restoration point, at least, has, if not a solution, a mitigation - actually, my power company does a similar thing with the OH lines, to cut down on the amount of 'driving around until they see a pole down' (repairs are really freaking fast since they put it in - if the power goes out at all, since depending on the break location there might be a way to reroute power, which happens automatically).</p>
<p>Put in the occasional sensor that relays status. Or, rather, stops talking if the line breaks. Then you know a lot better where the break is - between such and such poles, in the case of OH lines, between such and such stations for UG.</p>
<p>Adds more cost, though. Not just for the sensors, but for the network lines they communicate on (my utility ran fiber for it... and has paid for it and more by allowing it to also carry internet service. They don't even charge as much as Comcast, either!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah sorry as the person below said it was already long answer. We implemented a MILES system, a da/scada system (which I'm involved in) and the good old fashioned thumper. If all else fails. Run new and either abandon old or replace if possible. We also have scada fault indicators and our regulators and reclosers are slowly all becoming scada. We also are a lucky group with smart metering and a control center. So while trucks still have to roll, were typically well informed when we get there.</p>
<p>Our service territory can cover 80km from customer to substation and over 100km from service point to customer. So restoration time for blown fuses for example can still be lengthy.</p></div>		</li>
