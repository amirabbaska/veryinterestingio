			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an oscillator in which the amplitude response as a function of the applied frequency is Gaussian. A &quot;standard&quot; oscillator (a damped spring) will be Lorentzian, which looks like a slightly thinner Gaussian. It's been a bit since I did optical modeling, so I can't remember what a Gaussian corresponds to physically.</p></div>		</li>
