			<div class="markdown"><p>to elaborate on this without the lego metaphors, method 2 is still implemented in some games without any hiccups. (open world games such as GTA).<br />
there's a radius around the player set by the programmers.<br />
whenever an area which hasn't fully loaded enters the radius, all the assets gets loaded slowly while the stuff leaving the radius gets flushed.  </p>
<p>since you probably can't see most areas entering or leaving the radius,(buildings in the way etc) they can be loaded very slowly and efficiently without creating hiccups.  </p>
<p>this method is used to some extent in almost every game, in combination with the loading screen method.  </p>
<p>if you want to learn more about the constant streaming(buffering) method, i'll leave a few links.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujTCzh4yvt4" target="_blank">this video</a> shows the buffering process from a 1st person perspective.<br />
anything BEHIND the player, as well as outside the radius i mentioned, gets loaded in as the player looks around.  this specific video is regarding the environmental textures.  </p>
<p>[this[(<a href="http://renderingpipeline.com/2012/03/megatextures-in-rage/" target="_blank">http://renderingpipeline.com/2012/03/megatextures-in-rage/</a>) is the article i pulled the video from.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In open world games, both Method 1 and Method 2 are used. GTA builds Lego molds via Method 1 (GTA V's loading screen is horrendous), but as you move around, it uses Method 2 to finish making your legos and place them into the parts of the massive world that you can see.</p>
<p>EDIT: it then recycles legos behind you that are out of range to save resources (ie, memory, cpu cycles, and render time)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add do this, some games come with different levels of detail for each asset. For example a car can have a super detailed shiny version with a little guy inside, reflective windows and hub caps. As they get further the effect for shininess is removed, then the passenger disappears, then the hubcaps, and finally the car starts to look like more of a toy model rather than a decked out vehicle with decals. This is done so that the environment can have a longer field of vision without sacrificing precious processing power and load time to show every detail earlier than it needs to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually slightly different. That image shows what's being rendered as the player moves the camera.</p>
<p>Most of the time all of those assets are already loaded into memory, but it will only render those areas that the player can directly see at the given moment (rendering is very GPU intensive). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many games have had interactive loading screens. They've been around since the 1980s.</p>
<p>FIFA, Assassin's Creed, NBA Live, and others have had them on various editions of the games.  The three mentioned can all act as trainers for the game to practice various moves. Some have had quizzes or other simple interactive elements. I remember Black and White had a bunch of black and white squares that fell into a bucket to form the logo, but you could drag the logo and they'd be physics controlled cubes you could play with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a patent on them that kept them from being popular for a while.</p>
<p>These days I usually load games too fast to enjoy one anyway... SSD and all that. The days of slowly loading from an optical drive are gone.</p></div>		</li>
