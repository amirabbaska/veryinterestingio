			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea behind the warp drive isn't to go above the speed of light, as that's impossible with our current understanding of physics. The idea behind the warp drive is to literally warp the space around us, say fold the space between point a and b, to make the distance between the two shorter. </p>
<p>Edit: I guess this is the idea behind wormholes, not warp drives, although as I see it, the warp drive is doing the same thing, just on a much smaller scale. Sorry if I'm causing confusion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keeping in mind with &quot;warp drives&quot; and not space folding, Points A and B are not origin and destination, warping space as proposed wouldnt shorten the distance from earth to alpha centauri but more like constantly shortening space immediately infront of the vessel and expanding space behind the vessel. </p>
<p>Honestly this sounds like fluid dynamics but with space time ..(high pressure region behind object and low pressure infront of object = flow in the direction of low pressure) </p>
<p>is this a correct way to think?? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't space and time related ? The farther you see in the universe, the farther back in time you are looking at. So I am a bit confused about what warping space would result in. If I warped to alpha centauri in time 't' and warped back, would I be gone for just 2 * t in the perspective of people on earth ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always feel dumb when these conversations come about, but it just does not make sense to me. I can't wrap my head around a scenario that is not one-to-one. How can I spend one year in space, come back, and more time lapsed? I mean, how can a clock tick differently simply because I am farther away? If I spend 5 days watching a clock on, say, Mars, how is the clock ticking at a different rate on Earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit of a roundabout/tangential answer about how scientists try to perceive the universe.</p>
<p>Practically all of our experience as human beings occurs at well defined, but very limited scales. What I mean by this is that we're about that is that we're a meter or two tall, and we can maybe see things as small as a micrometer, and in the modern world we're sortof ok with the concept of thousands of kilometers. That is 12 orders of magnitude of human experience of the concept of length, and we think that's a HUGE amount. We look at and experience the world at these length scales, and learn how the universe behaves, and anything at those scales we become comfortable with, through sheer repetition of exposure, and not necessarily because we completely understand it. </p>
<p>And so, a thousand years ago, it made sense that if you were to drop something it would fall to the floor. Not because you knew everything about gravity, but because you're just so familiar with the concept of things falling. So effective is this familiarity that I'm willing to bet that right now you'd have to concentrate surprisingly hard to break out of the up/down paradigm enough to, say, throw an object and visualise it being attracted to the center of mass of a large spherical earth rather than just &quot;falling down&quot; again... despite the fact that you have the knowledge that the former is more correct.</p>
<p>Now, it so happens that the universe extends to significantly larger and smaller scales that we can perceive: the smallest arguably significant length in the universe is the Planck length at about 10^-35 meters, and the biggest structure that we're aware of is the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, which is about 10^26 meters long. So the observable universe spans 61 orders of magnitude in length! And at different scales, the laws of physics cause some dramatically different behavior than we're used to.</p>
<p>However, as scientists we wish to not only logically describe, but also get an intuitive feeling for more than the regular 12 orders of magnitude. And we do! If you spend a lot of time with a subject, be it an equation, a computer model of quantum phenomena or a simulation of galaxy collisions, it becomes part of your experience of the universe. You get a feel for things. </p>
<p>So now your question. You're talking about a scaled of <em>speed</em> that is extremely far outside of the scales that we are sufficiently familiar with to have an intuitive understanding of. Our experience of speed is extremely limited -- we can barely perceive the motion of the minute hand on a large clock, maybe 0.1mm per second, and by the time we get to a few multiples of the speed of sound (300m per second) our regular understanding of how things move through air has broken down quite a few times, each time needing us to refine our understanding: Objects move through air unaffected. Objects are slowed by air. An object's shape changes its motion through air. Objects make sound when moving through air. An object heats up when moving through air. An object makes a shockwave when moving through air. An object trails vacuum when moving through air. An object's shape doesn't affect its motion through air.</p>
<p>If we keep speeding up, more and more things that we thought we had an intuition for turn out incorrect, and eventually this includes our feel for things like length, time, and simultaneity. </p>
<p>However, if you play with the equations, you can develop a feel for them. And you will realize that several of the intuitive assumptions we have made about the universe due to our lack of experience of other speed-scales are incorrect. However, it's incredibly hard to convey that sense of familiarity to someone else through logic alone. That is not something that's strictly covered by science. But luckily there are other aspects of human endeavor that are able to cope with such issues, and so we go to the domain of art, and we borrow the concept of a metaphor. So what I will tell you now is probably not correct, or even self consistent... but it follows some of the same sort of patterns as reality does, and you can use it to get a feel for how things work at very high speeds:</p>
<p>We are not moving through 3d space at variable speeds, subject to an ever advancing, universally true concept of &quot;time&quot;.</p>
<p>Instead, we are moving through a 4d space at a constant rate. Three of these dimensions you are familiar with, the other is what we experience as &quot;time&quot;: the further along it we go, the more we age, the more our clocks tick. If we turn all our speed towards this time direction, we're aging as fast as possible, but our position in space is not changing -- this is the condition we know as &quot;at rest&quot;, and describes the universe as we experience it, at low speeds. If we instead turn all our movement towards a space dimension then we are not traveling down the &quot;time&quot; axis at all, but we are travelling as fast as is possible in space. This describes photons, which move at the speed of light, but for which no time passes. All objects are somewhere between these extremes, moving at the same rate through spacetime, only the directions are different. If you move a lot in time, you only move a little in space. If you move a lot in space, you can only move a little in time. And whatever time passes for you -- that's only for you. What passes for others depends on how fast they're moving! <a href="http://www.adamtoons.de/physics/relativity.swf" target="_blank">This page illustrates that concept</a></p>
<p>So what happens when a spaceship moves very fast away from us for a bit and then comes back? Well, it's moving very fast in space, so it's not moving very much in time at all. When it gets back to the space-origin, its time will have progressed very little. However, someone sitting at the origin watching all this happen is at spacial rest, so moving very rapidly in time! While the spaceship does its trip, a lot of time passes for our stationary observer, because all objects move at the same rate in spacetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a couple questions with this analogy.</p>
<p>Why is there seemingly a maximum amount of speed that you can travel along the &quot;time dimension,&quot; but not the &quot;space dimension&quot;? </p>
<p>If I'm understanding you correctly, when you put all of your &quot;speed&quot; into traveling through space (by traveling at c, like a photon), you are effectively moving at an infinite velocity in your own frame of reference. You can travel anywhere instantaneously since time does not pass at all locally.</p>
<p>Yet when you are &quot;at rest&quot; and putting all of your &quot;speed&quot; into the time dimension, you don't travel through time instantaneously. You travel along at what seems to be a set rate. How did this rate get set and why is it what it is?</p>
<p>My second question is how does the understanding that time slows down locally when you approach the speed of light mesh with the concept of a universal &quot;speed limit&quot;. C is about 300,000 kilometers per second. Thus, you would think that a person traveling at .99999999 C would need to wait about 10 seconds to travel 3 million kilometers. Yet it seems like that person would, in fact, hardly wait any time at all. They would travel the distance from their own perspective in far less than ten seconds, effectively moving at what would clearly seem to be a speed &quot;faster than light.&quot; How is this possible?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sitting in a chair right now, on Earth. But the Earth is both spinning and orbiting the sun. The sun is orbiting the centre of the milky way galaxy. The milky way galaxy is moving in comparison to other galaxies (it doesn't orbit anything as far as I know).</p>
<p>I'm sure the sum of these movements is,  although extremely fast, negligible in terms of the speed of light. Meaning from a mathematical perspective, sitting in my chair is the equivalent to being at rest. But we're not. </p>
<p>So my question is this: How do you define 'at rest'?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not intuitive. And it's not because you're far away, it's because you're moving really fast relative to the Earth.</p>
<p>The differences between Earth and Mars in this regard are negligible though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What doesn't make sense to me is that you'll still feel like you're experiencing the same amount of time, regardless of speed. I.e., if you're travelling close to the speed of light for seven years, you'll still experience 7 years, just as someone at a stationary point would.</p>
<p>If that's true, and you both experience 7 years of time, how would one age more slowly without time itself slowing down and causing you to experience less time as a result?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just read through this entire thread and I don't even know who to reply too, but I still don't get this. My understanding of time (and this may very well be wrong but it's how I've grapsed it) is that no matter where you are in the entire universe, &quot;time&quot; is always passing the exact same. It can't be changed, it's not an entity or something that can be warped, it simply is time. Because of the speed of light, things may <em>appear</em> older or different, but it's simply an illusion caused by light travel. So how can simply moving away from the earth at the near-speed of light warp time and cause everything to be dead here? I really don't get it at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible that there were objects in the universe that were traveling close to the speed of light relative to the earth and were therefore visible to us, but then by cosmic fate were accelerated past the speed of light relative to us (by some interaction with a gravitational field, but NOT sucked into a black hole) and are now no longer visible to us? And we are no longer visible to them? If so, would they still influence objects that we can see? My guess is that in the spacetime of this universe such an event is impossible. No force can cause an object to exceed C? But entering a black hole can cause this? Confusion!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not intuitive.  Light passes all observers at the speed c.  No matter how fast that observer is moving.  So if you're standing still or travelling at 0.99999c light still <em>passes you</em> at c.  Doesn't make sense right?  If your standing on the sidewalk and a car passes at speed x you observe it at speed x.  But if you're in a car at speed y the other car approaches at x - y.  Light doesn't work that. It gives no fucks. It's gunna pass you at c all the time <strong>no matter how fast you are going</strong>.  Time itself changes to make sure light does that.</p>
<p>Relativity has other weird things too.  Time slows down for things moving fast, but it also slows down in high gravity. These aren't just math tricks either. It actually happens. The fast moving, but in low <em>g</em>, GPS satellites have to take into account relativistic effects constantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this time change happen at all speeds or only those that get close to approaching light? Like if someone orbited the Earth in the 17000 mph ISS long enough, would there be any noticeable difference between the time experienced on Earth and in orbit?</p></div>		</li>
