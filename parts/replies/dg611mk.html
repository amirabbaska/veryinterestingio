			<div class="markdown"><p>As an operator our policy was, if we someone we thought was too fat, to point to the list of restrictions and ask &quot;Have you read all the ride restrictions and are you able to ride this ride?&quot;  Now I'm not actually calling you &quot;fat&quot; but you sure as shit ain't too short.  If you say &quot;yes&quot; then it's all on you from this point on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm apparently too tall at 6'3&quot; to ride the Dragon Challenge roller coaster at the <em>Wizarding World of Harry Potter</em> at Universal: Orlando. I had to hunch to get the restraint to lock into place. My back did not thank me at all the rest of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Semi-relevant, but I almost rode the very same ride last week, although we ended up getting lost on our way in and only had the one Park pass and couldn't go through to the other park. The real question is, was it worth it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting at a similar height it didn't register as an issue to me on the same ride. It must depend on the height distribution from the waist. Never would have though about that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I did bring it up. I have lost 110 lbs since the last time I tried to get on a ride at a theme park. It didn't occur to me that I would be able to fit now till I read your comment.</p></div>		</li>
