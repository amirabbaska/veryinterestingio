			<div class="markdown"><p>The type of orbital is determined by the second quantum number l. While l can only go to n-1, the type of orbitals the question is about are from l = 4 and up, which are not Rydberg atoms per se </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. And not just g either. K and L shell transitions are important in high energy plasma diagnostics. M shell transition data is very important in nuclear physics, and some of it is classified. </p></div>		</li>
