			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my answer too, and also am engineer.  This is almost a comical display of how engineers vs mathematicians think.  Math people are all talking about domains and spaces and how this isn't a real question.  Engineer people are giving you the rather obvious and common sense answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also works as an answer from a mathematician. The forward difference operator (the fancy name for the first difference) is the usual notion of derivative for discrete sets. In fact, there's an area of math called time scale calculus that gives a more general definition of the derivative that you can apply to many underlying sets. In the special case of the integers it becomes the forward difference, while for the reals it reduces to the usual derivative.</p></div>		</li>
