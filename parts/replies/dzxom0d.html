			<div class="markdown"><p>But why would you say is the cause? I mean, how would it be different if we only had a single &quot;mass&quot; of neurons, not separated into two hemispheres? I can't think of a practical reason, or due to optimization or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider the rest of the body plan. Bilateral structures such as organs, limbs, face, eyes, ears, etc. The brain in its most simplest function is the control center for sensorimotor integration, taking in information from the environment and outputting appropriate behaviors. The brain has to connect to all these structures which are already bilateral.</p>
<p>Take your limbs, for example. You have arms on both sides of the body, and the way the neurons connect is by segregating into the spinal cord and following that development plan up to the brain where it all remains separate. </p>
<p>I would recommend reading up on Hox genes for more info on how the body and brain develops.</p>
<p>I also would caution trying to overly rationalize anatomy which has been shaped by genetic selection through evolution. There isn't a wise, rational engineer that comes up with a plan. Traits evolve because they don't disrupt an organism from reproducing and passing on genetic information to offspring. Maybe you could design something that makes more sense but that doesn't mean biology will always take that path. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, to put it simply biology can't overwrite the previous structures it just adds onto them for the most part. Eyeballs look the way they do because they evolved underwater originally on very specialized organisms 540 million years ago. Now eyeballs are a generally shared trait among life because that is how advantagous a trait they proved to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But since it's mentioned that all living things that have a brain, have a bilateral brain, even worms that don't have bilateral bodies (no arms etc.), does it not follow that the only reason we have two arms, two legs etc. is because of the brain being bilateral first?</p>
<p>Also, a reason why evolution favored bilateral brains could have something to do with having a backup, if one side is damaged, due to illness or other physical damage, having a second side that could take over could have been advantageous. Although it is a bit of a stretch since you would still find some living things with a single brain.</p>
<p>Sleep patterns could be another reason?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a &quot;cause&quot; because the development of the bilateral plan <em>preceded</em> the development of brains. It's a chicken and egg thing. </p>
<p>Basic body plans evolved very early on in animal evolution, they are very basic and fundamental features. And pretty much all body plans (as in, the primary structural characteristics) develop from some degree of repetition, because it's easy to genetically program repetition, versus evolving a completely new set of instructions all the time.</p>
<p>Think about segmentation as a simple example. You have a functional &quot;unit&quot; of an organism, containing useful features like say a pair of legs. It's easy to get more legs just by repeating the development of that same functional unit, using the same underlying genes, just like copying function sets or classes or objects in computer programming.</p>
<p>So, you can repeat segments a few times to get 6 pairs of legs like an insect, or repeat it a whole bunch of times and become a millipede. </p>
<p>Same principle for body plans, where a repetition in development patterns makes for an &quot;easier&quot; and more efficient way to evolve more complex bodies, vs doing it &quot;from scratch&quot;. Basically copy-pasting, sometimes literally carbon copying, sometimes with some modifications (like when limbs evolve into sensory appendages, for example). </p>
<p>So now let's briefly consider the types of geometry involved in various body plans. Segmentation is a form of linear repetition, typically from top to bottom (anterior to posterior). Super common in Arthropods, but is also visible in advanced organisms including humans (look at the segmentation in someone's abdominal six-pack!). </p>
<p>Symmetry is a common feature in body plans. You might have radial symmetry, where there are multiple axes intersecting a central point (look at a starfish or anemone from above). And then you have bilateral symmetry, visible easily in vertebrates. It's a form of symmetry where one side mirrors the other, in terms of development and resulting structure. </p>
<p>So, asking why the brain itself is bilateral isn't really super useful, in the sense that the brain is bilateral because <em>the body as a whole is already bilateral in the first place</em>. The brain's bilateral structure reflects the underlying structure of your entire body. The brain evolved from very simple origins in bodies that were <em>already</em> bilateral. And so, the underlying question is, why are our bodies bilateral? </p>
<p>That's a whole other topic, and plenty of people research this. There are various reasons why the bilateral body plan seems useful, including having an anterior head, and benefits relating to locomotion (especially in a primary direction, i.e. forward), etc. </p>
<p>I hope this provides some clarification.</p>
<p>Biology is super cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of corrections: first, you say &quot;6 pairs of legs like an insect&quot;; of course, you meant to say 3 pairs of legs, or 6 legs.</p>
<p>second, and this is splitting hairs, starfish are actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish#Phylogeny" target="_blank">bilaterian.</a> They have larvae with bilateral symmetry, but the adults develop a radial symmetry, like you said. But phylogenetically they are still bilaterians. Biology is indeed super cool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It did, and actually even made me have even more doubts about our nature, but that's super cool!</p>
<p>The chicken-egg thing is confusing me, did our body actually developed its bilateral structure before the brain even existed? I thought they develop together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks to both of you u/sexywhormones and u/tdjester14 !</p>
<p>I'm now trying to imagine the body as a tree, and the brain as the roots that connects to each part of the body.</p>
<p>But this made me wonder why the left part of the brain controlled the right part of the body and u/tdjester14 greatly answered it!</p>
<p>If I think about our arms, I wouldn't be able to explain why the brain should control the right one with its left hemisphere. But thinking about fish and birds, they have to move their right part of the body to actually turn to the left! </p>
<p>Evolution and its consequences can be so interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The right part of the brain controls the right side of the body in fish, but gets the sensory imput from the left eye.</p>
<p>The optic chiasm happened to compensate the image inversion the retina experiences (because optics are sorcery). And fish process visual imput with the midbrain, so the crossing over may help. And with the crossover, if a fish sees a predator with its left eye, its right side midbrain would send a reflex downwards to its right side muscles, which would contract and thus allow it to swim away to the right.</p>
<p>However, on land, if you want to jump to the right, you have to move your left side muscles. And, working with the ancestral fish system, you either had to throw in an adfitional synapsis in the brain to cross the midline, or cross the exit fibers over, so the right brain innervates the left side of the body.</p>
<p>And thus we have crossovers both in the way in and out.</p></div>		</li>
