			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who's been fat her entire life, I know how shit that in itself can make you feel. I have had my own battles with depression and unhealthy eating habits over the years, but I consider myself lucky because I got my wake up call simply by seeing a friend turn her life around. Yes, I've probably caused a fuck tonne of damage to my body by being morbidly obese most of my life, but I'm going about things the healthy way. I've changed my eating habits (for the most part. I still have my bad days), and have been working out. I've managed to lose about 25kgs in the last year or so, and am still heading in the right direction. But I'm seeing my friend go down this horrible path right now and feel so helpless. I know how personal this fight can be. And I know I can't stop her unless she wants to stop. But I'm just hoping someone can say something I can take to her to show her how she's destroying herself. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for sharing your story. I'm glad you're on the right path as well now. People don't realise how much these things can destroy you, without their extra judgements on top. I don't want to do that to her. But I'm hoping sharing stories like yours will go down better with her. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I don't feel like it right now. Kinda just feel like That Entitled Shit That Thinks She Knows It All. I've been at the receiving end of well wishers advice. It sucks. But being on this side of it, I can't just sit around and watch her destroy herself like that. </p></div>		</li>

<p>My weight was always yo-yoing, it was part of my charm. Until one day, nothing in my closet fit me. No big deal, I thought, I'll just cut down my intake a little more. But I kept gaining weight. A year later, I had gained 130 pounds.</p>

<p>This comment doesn't make any sense... What sort of medical explanation did you get for why you were gaining weight despite the fact you were barely eating?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've already answered this but I'll say it again here. When your body is not able to filter out things that are not useable nutrients (like alcohol) it has to store it. So it wraps it in a protective coating of fat. Over time, these add up. It doesn't just make you fat, it also jams up every one of your joints so that you can eventually barely move. Too much alcohol is way more damaging than they lead us to believe. As much as I enjoyed it. No more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just going to go ahead and say it: You gained weight because you were eating too much. There is no way around this fact. There is no magical switch that will suddenly make you gain weight while you're barely eating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. It's not a very hard thing to process, you drank alcohol, that has calories, you eat more than your TDEE you put on weight.</p>

<p>If you actually did cut down on your weight, and not just say you did, you wouldn't have gained anything.</p></div>		</li>
