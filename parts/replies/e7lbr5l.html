<p>Warn of inconvenience rather than potential destruction? What a plan!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a holdover from the past.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you put diesel in a petrol car running on a carburettor, and if that engine is warm enough then the engine will run. The difference is, that with a petrol car you can no longer stop the engine once it's running on diesel. You have to wait until it explodes or runs out of fuel.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you put the wrong fuel in a diesel car, you can just turn it off. Of course now, with electronically controlled injectors then a petrol car will stop also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely wrong. You heard the term 'dieseling', and just assumed the meaning. A gasoline engine dieseling has nothing to do with the fuel used. It has to do with residual combustion chamber temperatures being high enough during the compression stroke to ignite the fuel without a spark. Since carburated engines turned off the engine by killing the spark, this condition makes it almost impossible to turn off the engine. I also doubt that a carburated engine would run any better on diesel than gasoline. The big problem is that diesel doesn't vaporize quickly enough to work well in a gasoline engine. High pressure fuel injectors do a much better job of atomizing fuel than carburators do, so I'd assume a fuel injected engine would run better.</p>
<p>I suspect the reason for the one way compatibility is that gasoline cars used to be (and still are, but not the point) the standard consumer option, while diesel vehicles were usually driven by professionals, who you could probably trust to know what fuel to use. You probably wouldn't want to trust the average consumer with the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diesel pumps have larger nozzles because they are usually for larger tanks.  Bigger hose and pump makes for more flow.  Imagine filling 200+ gallons at a &quot;normal&quot; pump, it would take way to long.  On the other side, I've had to use semitruck pumps for my diesel car and it was hard not to trigger the stop because there was so much fuel flow and my filler neck couldn't keep up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a similar dynamic with premium gas, where it won’t ignite until it’s at higher pressure. This lets you get more energy out of it. A lower octane gas will ignite too early, <del>so the piston has to push against the explosion</del> causing “knocking”.</p>
<p>With diesel, the compression difference is much more extreme (around 2x gasoline).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to get toooo technical but engine knock is technically right AFTER top dead center on the compression stroke, ignition has begun and the piston is usually on its way down. It happens when the air gas mixture expands faster than the flame front originating from the spark plug, and reaches something hot and ignites, with damage usually occuring at the edge of the piston near the cylinder walls. Pre-ignition, however, is when the piston has to work against a spontaneous combustion that occurs BEFORE the piston reaches top dead center in the compression stroke. Usually youll see that damage in the center of the piston. Happens when something is REALLY hot in the cylinder.</p></div>		</li>
