			<div class="markdown"><p>When Cassini first flew between the rings and Saturn (couple months ago), they actually turned the spacecraft to use the radio dish as a shield since they didn't really know what to expect. It actually encountered so little dust, that they opted not to use the &quot;shield&quot; in later dives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s worth noting that a radio dish can sustain some damage and still work, which is why they did this. The dish is really just a big radio mirror whose goal is to focus all the radio waves coming from Earth to one point (the antenna) by reflecting off the concave dish. A few holes here and there will make the signal strength slightly worse, but not much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just saw a talk last week from Alan Stern, the guy who was in charge of New Horizons. He did mention that they had to very carefully check as the neared Pluto (near meaning ~2 days before arrival) for dust, and found a little piece and had to slightly divert their path or it would have shredded the vessel. So I guess it can happen, it's just rare. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there some equation for how long in any direction you go and the probability of hitting something in space?</p>
<p>Found it: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2pe4oj/say_you_had_the_ability_to_fly_a_spacecraft_from/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2pe4oj/say_you_had_the_ability_to_fly_a_spacecraft_from/</a></p>
<p>Mean Free Path: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put another way, if the entire universe had stars as densely packed as they are in galaxies, you'd still have to travel all the way across the observable universe 6300 times before you'd expect to run into anything planet-sized or bigger by accident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it doesnt seem like it will ever run into anything. Now obviously that math cant account for black holes and the like</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space is so vastly empty even the (in relative terms) dense rings around Saturn, things can pass through without any contact. And we have to create long equations to try and land or impact an asteroid. When sending objects through the asteroid field we don't even consider it. Space is really really really really big. And it's also pretty empty, and cold.</p>
<p>The only reason the earth and moon get dusted occasionally is because the gravity of the earth and moon attract the particles to them. But even still we don't get too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that asteroids to the nearest asteroid? </p>
<p>If there were a ring of evenly-spaced asteroids in the asteroid belt, then the average distance would be greater than the distance from the asteroid belt to the sun, since you are averaging across every possible pair of asteroids, including those on the opposite side of the orbit.</p></div>		</li>
