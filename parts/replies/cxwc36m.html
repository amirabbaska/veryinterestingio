			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife had surgery on her brain stem a couple months ago and didn't wake up until about 24 hours after surgery was over.  The surgeon explained it was probably this reticular activating system that was stunned, causing her to stay asleep.  Her brain was just simply waiting for the trauma from surgery to settle, and she slowly started coming to.  The signals that pass through her brain stem were temporarily delayed that would otherwise tell her brain to 'wake up'. Scary stuff but it's the brains way of protecting itself I would believe.</p></div>		</li>
