			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're asking for a biophysical or neurobiological explanation...and as of now it doesnt exist. Thats what neuroscience hopes to explain. In neuroscience, we relate memories to long term potentiation (LTP) of neurons (sustained altering of firing rates). However, how this neurobiological process actually translates to memory/cognition? We're far from understanding the mechanism perfectly. You'd think we'd be there by now, but we aren't. Psychology/cognitive sciences and the biological neurosciences are still distinct fields for this reason. </p>
<p>So we look at memory formation through the lens of cognitive sciences/behavioral neuroscience. The other commenters are correct when they say the hippocampus is unable to allow memory processing. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but even in ELI5, you can't answer the question &quot;why can't I form new memories after drinking too much alcohol&quot; with &quot;Alcohol makes it so your brain can't form memories.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
