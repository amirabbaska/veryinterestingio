<p>I mean... I suppose it makes sense, but I've never once contemplated the possibility that stars aren't perfectly round.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People always point out that the earth isn't perfectly round and that it bulges, but never specify how much. To put it in scale, the amount of bulge at the equator is within the size variation allowed in professional billiards. The earth is more in round than a cue ball. Both are not 100% spherical, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing which is spinning is perfectly round. Centripetal force means that the object will squish outward a bit perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The Earth does the same thing, as well as the atmosphere, the latter of which is damn near twice as thick at the equator as it is at the poles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it's real. <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/592146/meta" target="_blank">This is the paper</a>. The period of the orbit is 12.94 days, apparently. As you can see, they're quite close to each other compared to their size, which is why the orbital period is so short.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Ultra-violet studies of Mira by NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) space telescope have revealed that it sheds a trail of material from the outer envelope, leaving a tail 13 light-years in length, formed over tens of thousands of years. It is thought that a hot bow-wave of compressed plasma/gas is the cause of the tail; the bow-wave is a result of the interaction of the stellar wind from Mira A with gas in interstellar space, through which Mira is moving at an extremely high speed of 130 kilometres/second (291,000 miles per hour).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[LOWER RIGHT] In UV light, Hubble resolves a small hook-like appendage extending from Mira, in the direction of the companion that could be material from Mira being gravitationally drawn toward the smaller star. Alternately, it could be that material in Mira's upper atmosphere is being heated due to the companion's presence.</p>
