<p>This requires at least QED in your first paragraph, QFT in your second paragraph, and Particle Physics in your third paragraph. Chances of you taking all of these courses before being at a PhD level are low.</p>
<p>Are you able to elaborate in a way that lets say, and senior year undergrad would understand? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well QED <em>is</em> a QFT, and the whole question is about particle physics. So I'm not sure where you came up with those dinstinctions.</p>
<p>But anyway, to say that electromagnetic interactions are &quot;mediated by photons&quot; means that it's a coupling term between electrons and photons, in the example of MÃ¸ller scattering, which mathematically governs the process.</p>
<p>If you interpet that interaction term literally, you have operators which create and destroy electrons and photons, and you can pictorially describe what's happening in the Feynman diagrams linked above.</p>
<p>Two electrons come in, exchange a virtual photon, and then go out with different four-momenta.</p>
<p>Feynman diagrams are not meant to be taken literally, they are just a pictorial code for a complicated integral, but to someone first learning about perturbation theory in QFT, it can be helpful to imagine the process semi-literally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a person who has very little knowledge on Quantum Mechanics and whatnot, but I do understand a fair bit of physics.  When you say a &quot;virtual photon&quot;, are you saying that the electrons exchange energy in the interaction like two tennis balls would, but on a vastly smaller, and theoretical, level?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that during electromagnetic particle interactions (particularly semiconductor interactions like LEDs or optocouplers), some of the energy required for the event will be stored temporarily as a change in the quantized energy state of the electron(s) in the crystal lattice of the semiconductor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trying to follow. </p>
<p>You mean the energy is stored &quot;in&quot; a charge, by bumping up an electron into a higher energy state, right? Not &quot;as&quot; a charge in the sense that it has created a new particle. </p>
<p>Or are you referring to the virtual particles? In which case it would be &quot;as a photon&quot; or &quot;as a pair of charges&quot; (i.e. an electron and a positron) to conserve conservation of charge. </p>
<p>Again, particle physics isn't my thing. I have just enough of an understanding to get by with what I'm doing but by no means an expert at it. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Real photons satisfy the relativistic energy-momentum relation, E^2 = p^2 c^2.  They are coherent excitations of the quantum field A (strictly speaking they're a coherent excitation of all the quantum fields simultaneously, but to lowest order A is the most important one), which means that they have long lifetimes. </p>
<p>Virtual photons are a calculation tool used for describing transient excitations of the quantum field A. We can approximately describe these transient excitations by treating them as photons that do not satisfy the relativistic energy-momentum relation. Because they are not coherent, these excitations tend to decay very quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be reasonable to carry along the analogy of a particle as a wave propagating in a field in this way?<br />
When an electron is moving freely, it can be described as a simple propagating wave obeying the dispersion relation of its &quot;medium&quot;. When two such waves collide, they interact with each other and create a complicated mess of a waveform at that point. This waveform can not be expressed as simply the sum of waves obeying the dispersion relation. However, it can still be expressed as the sum of an infinite series of functions.<br />
These functions do not fulfill the dispersion relation, so they can only be used to describe the waveform in this single moment. The waveform will continue propagating, but the components you used to describe it will not individually propagate as waves. As such the waveform will change its shape as it propagates. As it propagates, it will break up into waves which obey the dispersion relation.  </p>
<p>To be honest, I have no idea if that description is clever and good or complete drivel. Trying to explain QFT in layman's terms gets you into some weird territory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some semantics involved, but quantitatively, you might say there is no absolute distinction between &quot;real&quot; and &quot;virtual&quot; photons. There is a mathematically smooth and continuous difference between them in the quantum propagator of the photon field, which is a factor in the quantum probability governing interacting electrons. The more E^2 = p^2 c^2 is violated, the more the photon propagator factor is supressed.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any configuration of the electromagnetic field can be decomposed into a (potentially infinite, and not necceseraly unique) set of photon particles, real and virtual. Real photons are those that describe configurations of the electromagnetic field that can exist in a vacuum and they are what you use to describe things like laser beams and starlight. </p>
<p>If you want to describe the electromagnetic field in the pressence of charges using the language of particle physics then it turns out you need more than just the real photons. In pretty much all situations you need to add in extra photon-like particles that cannot exist in a vacuum. These virtual photons are basically the composition of the field generated by electric charges onto the basis given by the tools of particle physics. </p>
<p>The advantage of doing things this way is that the virtual photons still obey the fundamental laws of particle physics. This means that we can meaningfully talk about things like &quot;Two protons collide and send out a virtual photon which decause into an electron-positron pair&quot;. If we would instead describe these processes using the bare fields alone, the mathematics gets way more complicated and unintuitive.</p></div>		</li>

<greek salad>

I get the general concept of a fermion field and a photon field, but what are the superscripts, and how are you even supposed to interpret this notation where you're representing a field with a variable? What is the Y and why is the fermion field in the term twice?

If explaining this to a dumbass like me seems daunting, don't worry. You don't have to distill years of physics classes into a single reddit comment. All you'd have to do is move my abstraction one rung above "photons mediate the force" and I would be happy.</div>		</li>

<p>The mu is a Lorentz index. The photon field is a vector field, and the fermion current is a vector. This is like a four-dimensional dot product of the fermion current vector and the photon field vector. The gamma is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices" target="_blank">gamma matrix</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This expression is the first nontrivial term in a power series expansion. Mathematically the fermion field enters twice because of its symmetry properties, otherwise the integral represented by this term would equal 0. Physically, it represents a process where you have an incoming photon and an incoming electron, which absorbs the photon, changing it state. The first fermion is the incoming one, the second is the resulting outgoing state. You can have more complicated terms, corresponding e.g. to a pair of electrons, one of which emits a photon during the interaction and the other absorbs it. This would be 4th order in fermion fields and 1st order in photon fields. The powers of both fermion and photon terms can be arbitrarily large, but in a well-behaved theory like QED those higher terms can be regarded as a small approximation.</p></div>		</li>
