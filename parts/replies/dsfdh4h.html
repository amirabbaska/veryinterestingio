			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a nervous laugh. I can't help it. It just comes out. My co-worker asked me one time, &quot;Don't you think the customers take offence when you laugh at them on the phone?&quot; (I work in IT). I was like, &quot;I never laugh at people what are you talking about?&quot; and then I realized. Whenever I gave people bad news I would laugh. Sorry, the repair will be $1000. This only happens when you need your machine the most am I right hahaha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was teaching high school students, I recall covering the Holocaust, including in-depth details of gas chambers, the odorous smell of burnt ash, and children who never returned to their families. The content I was studying mentioned that it is not unusual for students to begin to snicker or laugh, fully knowing that these stories are horrendous to hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the closest thing to the correct answer. I've had one really close encounter with serious injury but walked away unscathed and I started laughing and just everything was pumping. </p></div>		</li>
