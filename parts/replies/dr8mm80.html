			<div class="markdown"><p>My calc teacher in High School taught us how to count to 512 (2^9) on our fingers by using our fingers in binary. Each finger is a binary number (thumb is 1, index finger is 2, middle finger is 4, ring finger is 8, and so on). To count to five you'd count thumb (1), index finger (2), both index and thumb together (3), middle finger only (4), and middle plus thumb (5). You can keep going like that until 512 using just your hands (though it gets a bit complicated once you start using your other hand). If you use your toes you can count all the way up to 524,288 (2^19)! </p>
<p>EDIT: Why was our calc teacher teaching us how to count on our hands? I'm not really sure; I think he was just showing off. He supposedly trained himself to count like that all the time.</p>
<p>EDIT2: He also wrote &quot;Don't Drink and Derive&quot; in my yearbook. So yeah, he's that kind of nerd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can count up to 1023, not 512. 512 is 1000000000, which you can do with your leftmost finger up. You can still raise all the other fingers adding an additional 511.</p>
<p>The maximum value of a given number of bits is 2^(n)-1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can store any number from minus infinity to infinity with just my thumb and index finger. </p>
<p>Let the tip of your index finger be -1, and the base be 1. Then slide your thumb between those points to get a value in the interval [-1,1]. Finally, take the inverse hyperbolic tangent of your thumb's position, and you have any real number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1024 is a round number in binary, but a big reason we use it (instead of other round numbers) is because it is close to a round number in decimal too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, it's conveniently (to our decimal minds) 2^(10), which is a round decimal exponent.</p>
<p>Edit: I feel mildly dirty for saying &quot;decimal minds&quot; and should say decimal-conditioned minds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it depends on your specific field, but I've never known anyone I've ever worked with to use the term gibibyte. It's hard to even write the word on my phone because it keeps trying to correct it to gigabyte.</p>
<p>It might be written into some standards, but that doesn't mean people widely use it.</p></div>		</li>
