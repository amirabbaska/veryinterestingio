			<div class="markdown"><p>It's marked by the 20-ft wide gap in the trees, but the borderline is actually the precise center.  When you're standing in the gap, you aren't in some area of no country, you're typically on either one country or the other.  If you stand directly in the middle, you might be partially in one or the other, but the line itself has no thickness, just the physical representation of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. I don't get how people can't understand this. It has no thickness.</p>
<p>Say for example on a graph, y axis, anything less then 2 is USA, anything more then 2 Is Canada.</p>
<p>There are an infinite amount of numbers between 1 and 2, the more you go the more accurate it is. There's no thickness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lake on the border of NH and Canada that I can’t remember the name of because phonetically it sounds like “men from eggnog.” In the winter my dad and his pilot friends fly up to it and land on the ice. They have to arrange it with border patrol so there is someone there to keep them from crossing the border accidentally. Sometimes Canadian pilots will meet them there, but they can’t even shake hands because of the border. </p>
<p>Edit: it’s Lake Memphremagog and it’s actually in VT not NH, my bad. </p></div>		</li>
