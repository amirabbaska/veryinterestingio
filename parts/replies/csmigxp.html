			<p>It is important to note that this can only happen in systems where there is a finite number of states, that is systems which have a highest energy. For systems such as atoms translating in space there are infinite states and hence all the temperatures are positive.</p>		</li>

			<p>Why do you need a finite number of states? Can't we for example have a system with infinite number of low energy states and then a rather big gap to a higher energy state?</p>		</li>

			<p>Could you have an infinite number of states under a finite energy? It seems like you would then need to have either infinite particles or infinite volume.</p>		</li>

			<p>Good question. I would probably need an infinite volume, which makes it a little less practical. </p>		</li>

			<p>Or a single pair of atoms which are of infinitely varying distances from one another.<br><br>The planck distance doesn't set a fundamental grid for the universe; it only sets a distance below which our current physics isn't explanatory.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fair enough. Perhaps I should have said infinite positional arrangements rather than infinite volume.</p>		</li>

			<p>doesn't this mean that it is non-physical. So basically not corresponding to reality?</p>		</li>

			<p>Hmm, I believe you have a few typos in the text.<br><br>&gt; but if you want to know the defined lowest temperature, it is -0K.<br><br>Defined highest/hottest?<br><br>&gt; While temperature is defined as T = dE/dS, aka- Temperature is defined as the derivative of temperature with respect to entropy.<br><br>Derivative of <em>energy</em> with respect to entropy (as the linked page states)?</p>		</li>
