			<div class="markdown"><p>It is important to note that this can only happen in systems where there is a finite number of states, that is systems which have a highest energy. For systems such as atoms translating in space there are infinite states and hence all the temperatures are positive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you need a finite number of states? Can't we for example have a system with infinite number of low energy states and then a rather big gap to a higher energy state?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess you mean the derivative of inner energy not temperature here.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>but if you want to know the defined lowest temperature, it is -0K.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defined highest/hottest?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While temperature is defined as T = dE/dS, aka- Temperature is defined as the derivative of temperature with respect to entropy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Derivative of <em>energy</em> with respect to entropy (as the linked page states)?</p></div>		</li>
