			<div class="markdown"><p>The story as told to me by one of my professors: Newton basically went around for a couple of years claiming that he'd discovered a new principle that would turn the mathematics world on its head, but wouldn't release any formal proof. Leibniz started collecting all the hints that Newton dropped, and pieced together the concept of the integral. Newton responded by claiming Leibniz got it all backwards, and only then released a proof of the derivative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newton was always a stickler about not releasing a lot of his papers. They are credited with discovering it separately, but recognized that Newton did discover it first. However, Leibnez's notation and calculus live on while Newton's &quot;Fluxions&quot; and his notation do not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a pretty great summary, but one minor quibble — in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…but wouldn’t release any formal proof…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…and only then released a proof of the derivative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it’s not really <em>proofs</em> that are in question, in either the 17th-century or the modern sense of the word.  It was that Newton wouldn’t release any kind of detailed description at all at first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a great book you probably already know about called <em>The Calculus Wars</em> that goes into great detail about Leibniz x Newton. Sorry, no time to find a link right this second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that two people independently arrived at what is basically the same thing is what leans me toward &quot;discovery&quot;. How likely would this be if calculus were just an arbitrary human invention?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this, though I would add that &quot;the notation <em>and it's proof</em> was invented.&quot;   Calculus was always there. It has always been possible to <em>do</em> calculus.  Aliens from a planet with calculus can well have been doing it thousands of years before Newton or Leibniz.  In that sense it was always there and was a discovery.  </p>
<p>However, someone needed prove calculus is an extension of accepted math in order for it to be considered valid and to invent a system of notation in order to do it. Someone had to build the proof, like a bridge out to where calculus is.  That's what Newton And Leibniz did and it was their invention.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not before there was someone or thing to do it. The things it can describe may have existed beforehand, by they aren't calculus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't say I agree with that thinking. It's always been possible to build an internal combustion engine (and aliens may have been using them for a very long time) but it was still invented, not discovered.</p></div>		</li>
