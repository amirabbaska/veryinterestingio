			<div class="markdown"><p>haha I'll give you that! As a materials scientist (and one that specializes in ceramics) it always frustrates me when people compare most advanced ceramics to diamond on the Moh's scale. Since it's a relative scale its not always the best thing to getting good numeric comparisons. I totally understand that it's much more relevant in geology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In geology, relative scales are important because we're usually trying to verbally, or in prose, describe and compare the hardness of something with something that the reader is able to conceptualize in their mind. </p>
<p>Like, is this mineral harder than talc? Yes. Is it harder than diamond? No. Is it harder than quartz? Yes. Then it must be blah blah blah. Plus crystallinity, habit, faces, etc. Oh, well then it must be this... </p>
<p>It helps us, in real-field terms, how to identify and understand a bit of rock that you're folding on your hand. </p>
<p>Coincidentally, your finger nails are 2-3 hardness. A steel knife is about 7 (depending on whether or not it's foreign or domestic steel). These are tools in the field that help make these determinations on hardness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Mohs scale is super-useful for identifying minerals in the field.  Its nice because if you have a few references of known hardness (A streak plate, a knife blade, a piece of quartz, your fingernail ect. all common things for a geologist to have on hand) you can quickly narrow down what mineral you may be looking at.  From a materials perspective, the Mohs scale is useless.  I was astounded that the actual difference in hardness between diamond (10 on Mohs) and Sapphire/Corundum (9 on Mohs) is almost the same difference as Sapphire from Talc (1 on Mohs).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in all my materials studies as a welding engineer (which is admittedly not as much as a materials scientist) I heard it basically sum down to &quot;there's really no one accepted hardness scale&quot; and &quot;it depends on industry or use. Especially if it's really more of wear or toughness your after and not ultimate hardness which is generally meaningless for any real world task.  As I recall PCBN and some other ceramics can be harder than diamond when used in cutting tools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, though I'm not entirely sure why I can take a stab at it.</p>
<p>The windshield is laminated panes of glass, which means if you get a crack in them (like a rock hitting your window) it won't shatter into a million pieces. It also isn't a single sheet of non tempered glass so if it does fail you don't get impaled by a massive shard of broken glass. There are advantages to having tempered glass on the side windows, notably that emergency responders can break through them easily with punches. You can as well in case you and your car are submerged in water. Most cars nowadays are equipped with side impact airbags as well, which helps mitigate the risk of a collision between your head and the side windows. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually it DOES shatter into a million pieces. the lamination prevents those million pieces from &quot;going all over the place&quot; including into your face IE it holds them together (layer of plastic inbetween IIRC)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Safety.  Tempered glass is a lot safer because it doesn't form sharp edges when it breaks, which is important in a crash.  The reason your windshield is laminated is because it takes so many impacts that it would blow up too often if it was tempered.  Also, I think windshields have to be a lot thicker and therefore heavier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For auto class I came late and my punishment was to take apart a car without breaking the windows. Well, I broke one and we decided to turn it into a science experiment. New park plug porcelains and used spark plug porcelains were used. The used ones went straight through the window whereas the new ones bounced off. Is there a difference between them? Does having an electrical charge in the porcelains affect the glass at any rate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm interesting experiment. Can you give me a bit more details? I doubt it has anything to do with electrical charge or properties. My guess is it has something to do with the temperature profile that the used spark plug has seen while in service. It could effect the microstructure and from their the mechanical properties. It could also be a difference in material. The newer spark plugs could be made from a different ceramic than the old ones</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heating cycles it was exposed to may have made it harder. When a material is heated up, it expands and the material grain gets torn up and when it cools, the grains come back together but smaller. This leads to having more grains. More grains = harder material. This is an extremely simplified explanation. Also the basic theory behind heat treating metals. </p>
<p>Ceramics are special though, because they are very good heat insulators, and the effects of heat treating would be very small.</p></div>		</li>
