			<p>haha I'll give you that! As a materials scientist (and one that specializes in ceramics) it always frustrates me when people compare most advanced ceramics to diamond on the Moh's scale. Since it's a relative scale its not always the best thing to getting good numeric comparisons. I totally understand that it's much more relevant in geology.</p>		</li>

			<p>In geology, relative scales are important because we're usually trying to verbally, or in prose, describe and compare the hardness of something with something that the reader is able to conceptualize in their mind. <br><br>Like, is this mineral harder than talc? Yes. Is it harder than diamond? No. Is it harder than quartz? Yes. Then it must be blah blah blah. Plus crystallinity, habit, faces, etc. Oh, well then it must be this... <br><br>It helps us, in real-field terms, how to identify and understand a bit of rock that you're folding on your hand. <br><br>Coincidentally, your finger nails are 2-3 hardness. A steel knife is about 7 (depending on whether or not it's foreign or domestic steel). These are tools in the field that help make these determinations on hardness. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; What is the difference in foreign and domestic steel? I noticed you mentioned this in your reply and I am wondering how these two forms of steel are different. Thank You<br><br>Well, strictly speaking, nothing. Steel is an alloy, a combination of different metals (iron and carbon, in particular), and steel made according to the same &quot;recipe&quot; of ingredients and process will be the same, wherever it is made. <br><br>That said, various shorthands have emerged, maybe similar to the way that people might refer to &quot;Hollywood movies&quot;, even for something filmed in New Zealand or Toronto. There are only so many companies in the world that make raw steel, and language and geography mean that you tend to get certain localized cultural norms.<br><br>Traditionally, &quot;Japanese&quot; steel implies high carbon content, high hardness, but also increased brittleness. There are exceptions to every rule, but the Japanese steelmaking industry is an old and proud one, and in Japan, &quot;steel&quot; typically and traditionally refers to a very hard metal, capable of keeping a sharp edge for a long time. <br><br> &quot;German&quot; steel, OTOH, traditionally means a softer, more pliant and flexible metal. Something resilient, that will bend, not break under stress. A German-steel knife will traditionally require more-frequent sharpening than a Japanese knife, but it will also be much more resistant to cracks, chips, and actual &quot;damage&quot;. <br><br>&quot;American&quot; can be either a compliment or an insult to steel, depending on the context, since it tends to imply an alloy that was purpose-made for the thing, rather than made to an ideal. &quot;Chinese&quot; is basically never a compliment, when applied to steel. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Well, strictly speaking, nothing. Steel is an alloy, a combination of different metals (iron and carbon, in particular), and steel made according to the same &quot;recipe&quot; of ingredients and process will be the same, wherever it is made.<br><br>to provide a (likely useless) slightly more specific explanation of this, these specific recipes are typically called &quot;grades,&quot; and while grades often have specific chemical values and physical properties, they are also governed by (largely) global &quot;specifications&quot; or &quot;standards.&quot;<br><br>as a for instance, 316 is a very common, popular grade of stainless steel.  you can typically expect that it will contain 62-72% iron, 16-18% chromium, 10-14% nickel, 2-3% molybdenum, up to 2% manganese, and smaller amounts of silicon, nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, and sulfur.<br><br>when people/companies want to buy 316 stainless, they often have a specific application in mind.  they know what they expect from their material, and they know what it must be capable of.  in order to promote uniformity, specificity, predictability, and a few other cool words, companies like ASTM International exist.<br><br>ASTM is a standards organization that develops technical specifications (ie: a list of specific requirements that must be met) for a huge variety of things.  from metals to safety equipment to concrete to bicycles to test methods to children's toys, ASTM specs allow purchasers to demand compliance and know how their product will perform in advance.<br><br>so, using the above examples, an aerospace company might decide that they need a piece of 316 stainless steel plate, in compliance with ASTM-A-240.  316 tells us about the chemical composition of the material, but the ASTM-A-240 is what really tells us about the metal's properties.  in order to say, &quot;yes, this material complies with A240,&quot; one must be able to show that the material not only meets a very specific chemical composition, but also has a specific tensile strength, yield strength, elongation, hardness, and (occasionally) reaction to Charpy impact testing.<br><br>knowing this in advance, mills creating the 316 stainless will perform a battery of tests on each &quot;batch&quot; they make (usually called a &quot;heat&quot; or a &quot;lot&quot; in the industry, and assigned a specific heat number), and report these results on a document called a (wait for it...) Test Report.  the test report will show the info of the producing mill, the specifications they claim compliance to, the heat number, and the actual chemical composition and physical properties.<br><br>so yeah, while that rambled pretty well off course, let me bring it back home by saying that earlier today, i handled a bunch of 316 a240 plate, some of it produced in Brazil by Aperam, some of it produced in the USA by North American Stainless, some of produced by Outo Kumpu in Sweden.  you could reasonably expect them all to perform very similarly.<br><br>on a final note, many american companies (especially those that work with the government) will only accept material produced in the USA, or from DFARS (Defense Federal Aquisition Regulation Supplement) approved countries, which ends up being almost anywhere but Asia.  while this is mostly political, there has long been a bit of perceived disdain for asian metals, writing them off as inconsistent, unpredictable, or sometimes just simply inferior.  as someone who simply buys and resells metals, i can't comment on the accuracy of this last bit, but it's definitely a common perception in the current american metals market.</p>		</li>

			<p>Aside from the alloy composition, how the steel is made also affects its properties. Annealing (heating then cooling) decreases the hardness for examples. </p>		</li>

			<p>Mechanical work on the steel also effects properties(like cold rolling, shot peening, etc). Shot peening is often used to add compressive stresses to the exterior of parts much like tempered glass.   <br>Heating then cooling describes almost every heat treatment though  so to add a little, the temperature reached and the rate of cooling end up being the biggest variables(other variable tend to be depend on the parts and the process equipment more). There are a couple of different processes that get called annealing and some processes that might as well be annealing but aren't typically called such which muddies the waters somewhat.   </p>		</li>

			<p>Im not sure what you mean by hardness by annealing typically makes  metal (steel) stronger. Annealing allows for potential energy to be spread out over a larger area reducing the chance of breaking,fracturing what have you</p>		</li>

			<p>I think the term you are thinking of is toughness. Toughness is the ability of a material to absorb energy of deformation. Charpy impact testing is a common means of testing this in steel. To maximize toughness you really need a balance of hard and soft which would take a quench and temper for your typically carbon or alloy steel.  <br>Strength is typically tensile strength in steels and only has a supported load. Strength correlates strongly with hardness which is the ability of a material to resist deformation.  <br>For a carbon or alloy steel annealing won't give you a very tough steel due to lack of strength. Solution annealing an austenitic stainless steel will but that is a very different process. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>Steel that has not been annealed has a higher hardness on the Rockwell scale. <br><br>I work in a mechanical lab for a steel mill. When testing tensile strength, if a sample has not been annealed it will break quickly with very little elongation. </p>		</li>

			<p>Your guess is correct. Steel is whatever you put into it. That whole Japanese-harder/German-softer thing is a bit silly, perhaps it pertains to knife making, but you can't make a quality car without purpose-made alloys. Driveshaft on your car? Japanese, German, or American, it's probably a carbon-boron alloy, induction case-hardened to a depth of about 2 to 3mm (deeper at the bearing raceways), and induction tempered on the splines to make them less likely to chip. Body panels? Has to be malleable enough to draw properly when you stamp it. The list goes on, but basically if you state a specific set of requirements, then a particular alloy is going to be your best option, no matter where you're from. </p>		</li>

			<p>The reputations really only apply to more traditional applications like knives and wood working tools and are only maintained now for tradition.

			<p>Now this is only a guess, but I'm guessing that application had more to do with it than materials or processes. The Japanese were really big into slicing, whether you're talking about katanas or food prep knives. So you need a blade that's going to keep it's edge, but that blade needs special treatment to stay useful. For instance, you didn't block a sword blow with the sharp edge of a katana, you blocked it with the side or back. <br><br>The Germans had to deal with metal armor and group combat being more likely. (Compared to the combat style of people who had katanas) A sharp sword was great, super against the peasants, but it needed to be durable against armor. You don't have to cut through the helmet, all you have to do is crush it in enough to break some eye-socket bones. Who cares if it's dull after that, the hardened point is what you need to stab the guy through his gorget. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah I figured it wasn't super accurate. However I have recently bought a high end chefs knife and everyone was saying Japanese steel is harder and German steel is softer. It held true for all the knives I looked at. It may be a knife thing and then it would make sense to know that typically knives from certain countries are harder for checking hardness in the field. This is all purely speculation on my part.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm wondering if the style of food prep led to that. Japanese food has a bunch of slicing and chopping, maybe the harder steel keeps it's edge longer while you're banging it against the cutting board. Or maybe the hardness difference is just one of those things that happened and nobody knows why.</p>		</li>

			<p>I feel as if 'domestic' and 'foreign' steel has huge variations depending on where you're located in the world. It probably refers to the primary constituents of the steel and how they're made. <br><br>Steel is generally made up of iron and carbon, but their percent composition, as well as their inclusion of other elements, such as aluminum, chromium, manganese, etc. depending on what they're used for (i.e. Stainless steels must have 10.5+% chromium, tool steels have 0.5-1.5% carbon, etc. Even within these subsections there are further specifications). While Wikipedia generally isn't considered a 'scholarly source' I feel as if the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel" target="_blank">classes of steel articles</a> cover this topic pretty well if you want to learn what makes the different steel types unique (disclaimer, it's dryer than the Sahara).<br><br>As well, the way steel is treated also contributes to its hardness, strength, and other characteristics. If you're interested in the different treatment methods, check out <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=yu2r5uqJBGIC&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA1&amp;amp;dq=treatment+of+steels&amp;amp;ots=Ks4Rshog3-&amp;amp;sig=wgIR2yu6WPAzxg7btukyp69AhM4#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=treatment%20of%20steels&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank">this link</a>. There's way more ways to treat steel than you'd ever imagine!<br><br>So going back to the original question of 'domestic' vs. 'foreign' steels, it's probably pretty arbitrary what those definitions mean. It's likely more to do with the above qualities and how they relate to hardness, strength, brittleness, etc. </p>		</li>

			<p>The Mohs scale is super-useful for identifying minerals in the field.  Its nice because if you have a few references of known hardness (A streak plate, a knife blade, a piece of quartz, your fingernail ect. all common things for a geologist to have on hand) you can quickly narrow down what mineral you may be looking at.  From a materials perspective, the Mohs scale is useless.

			<p>Good question, though I'm not entirely sure why I can take a stab at it.<br><br>The windshield is laminated panes of glass, which means if you get a crack in them (like a rock hitting your window) it won't shatter into a million pieces. It also isn't a single sheet of non tempered glass so if it does fail you don't get impaled by a massive shard of broken glass. There are advantages to having tempered glass on the side windows, notably that emergency responders can break through them easily with punches. You can as well in case you and your car are submerged in water. Most cars nowadays are equipped with side impact airbags as well, which helps mitigate the risk of a collision between your head and the side windows. </p>		</li>

			<p>What are you talking about? Have you never gotten a chip or crack in your windshield? If it shattered like tempered glass, then you wouldn't be able to see anything when a rock or something hit it. That wouldn't be very safe. It's not tempered, at least not like the safety glass, which means it's weaker and gets cracks easier, but it doesn't shatter when it does get a crack.</p>		</li>

			<p>They do shatter, but in a different way. Tempered glass, when something breaks the external layer, will cause the <em>entire</em> sheet to shatter at once, regardless of point of impact, since the interior stresses will force everything apart. Normal glass will break around the point of impact as the force of impact is distributed throughout the pane. Anything not directly affected by the impact force, or spreading of cracks (I've no idea the correct term here), will not break.<br><br>Laminated glass will shatter more similarly to &quot;normal&quot; glass. However, the layer that is impacted will not be able to flex as much, leading to the force of the impact being unable to spread to a larger area, limiting the length of cracks that can form. What happens to that kinetic energy, though? Some will be spread into lower layers, potentially causing damage, while the remainder will be transferred entirely into the area that <em>did</em> manage to flex. Unable to dissipate further this will cause more local damage, resulting in your typical spiderweb pattern.<br><br>(note: I really should be sleeping right now, so apologies if my phrasing doesn't make a lot of sense)</p>		</li>

			<p>Correct, most windshield glass is three layers I think. They can adjust the strength by varying the thickness of each individual layer. The outermost layer is usually non tempered.

			<p>Safety.  Tempered glass is a lot safer because it doesn't form sharp edges when it breaks, which is important in a crash.  The reason your windshield is laminated is because it takes so many impacts that it would blow up too often if it was tempered.  Also, I think windshields have to be a lot thicker and therefore heavier. </p>		</li>

			<p>The heating cycles it was exposed to may have made it harder. When a material is heated up, it expands and the material grain gets torn up and when it cools, the grains come back together but smaller. This leads to having more grains. More grains = harder material. This is an extremely simplified explanation. Also the basic theory behind heat treating metals. <br><br>Ceramics are special though, because they are very good heat insulators, and the effects of heat treating would be very small.</p>		</li>
