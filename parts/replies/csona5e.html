			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought of this initially, some of the better scientific mirrors have reflectivity of <a href="http://www.semrock.com/high-reflectivity-mirrors.aspx" target="_blank">99.97% to 99.999%</a></p>
<p>which when raised to the millionth power end up as 4.921x10^-129 % and 4.539x10^-3 %.  That's not a lot of light from the initial reflection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah, crazy how such a small difference in the original value can lead to a difference of 126 orders of magnitude when raising to the millionth power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought you were being sarcastic at first but the phrasing &quot;such a small difference&quot; convinced me otherwise.</p>
<p>Compound interest is a powerful effect indeed. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good point, some of the light would miss the next mirror entirely.  I'd bet this is a much more important factor than the reflectivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No; distant things aren't dimmer than close things. e.g. a building two blocks away from you isn't 1/4 times as bright than a building one block away from you, because the area that the light (which <em>is</em> 1/4 as much) falls on in your retina is also 1/4 the size, so you're getting the same number of photons per area, so the brightness is the same.</p>
<p>So the problem wouldn't be that you'd be much darker due to inverse square. But your image <em>would</em> be tiny (your image in the million mirrors would be the same size as somebody standing 3 x 10^8 m away). So you'd need a really good telescope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neato!  Though if you spaced the mirrors further apart, then you could still get significant lag using only 70,000 such mirrors, and still get half the original light intensity (assuming the 99.999% reflective ones)</p></div>		</li>
