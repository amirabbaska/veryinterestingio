			<div class="markdown"><p>As an anecdotal addition to this:  I personally have very little empathy to give.  It is just my nature and I have always been this way.  However I am always very embarrassed by embarrassing videos or situations.  I can't even count how many youtube videos or whatever I have closed in the middle because it was too awkward, or looked away from the TV when things get weird, etc.</p></div>		</li>
