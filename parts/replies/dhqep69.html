<p>horse physiology is designed so that blood flow to the foot and leg is partially accomplished through pressure to an area on the sole of the foot called the frog. </p>

<p>What an interesting evolutionary trait. Is that common amongst all large hoofed animals or is it more unique to horses in general? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this seems like an evolutionarily maladaptive trait for the genus Equus to possess. You'd think that millions of years of natural selection and biological fitness, combined with tens-of-thousands of years of selective breeding after human domestication of the horse - would lead to horses that developed a workaround to laminitis. I wonder if there are there horses that are less-prone to this condition and can sustain a leg or hoof injury without any negative effects?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Adaptations affecting healing a leg never have a chance to be selected for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses evolved to be able to run quickly and for a long time.  That helped them adapt more than being able to survive a broken leg, so those are the qualities which natural selection favored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dairy farmer here. This happens to cows too. If a cow spends too long lying down because she's sick or injured they can find it extremely difficult to get up, and sometimes have to be helped up. When they then get up their hooves seem to be stiff, which always seemed to me to be because of a lack of circulation while the animal was lying down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, equines are fairly unique in having unsplit feet. They walk on one toe essentially, so this structure was an adaptive trait related to that. Other ungulates pretty much walk on two or more toes, so don't need this adaptation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classic case example was Barbaro, the Kentucky Derby winner who broke his leg later in the Triple Crown. He was extremely valuable and they attempted to save him through surgery and keeping him in a sling. However he ended up getting laminitis in two feet while healing from the break. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbaro" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbaro</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on how you explain this, could this not simply be solved by creating a device which puts pressure on the sole of the foot, so that bloodflow continues and the leg heals?</p>
<p>Surely it can't be as simple as you describe. Horses can be pretty expensive and I'm sure someone would thought of a simple device that enables the bloodflow to continue so that the horse doesn't have to die. </p></div>		</li>
