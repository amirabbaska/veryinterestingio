<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kenkuoescapement" target="_blank">Ken Kuo's YouTube channel</a> is completely dedicated to animations of a variety of escapementsâ€”mostly uncommon ones.  For example, contrary to the sorts of escapement that /u/rewboss describes in the GP comment, in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL4hnrneN5E" target="_blank">pinwheel <em>coup perdu</em></a> escapement the escape wheel pins only impulse one of the pallets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as an aside the late, great  author of the Disc World series Sir Terry Pratchett loved clock and timepieces so much so his book Thief of Time is ostensively about a clockmaker &quot;Jeremy Clockson&quot; trying to make the most accurate clock ever by designing an escarpment to slice time itself.</p>
<p>But my favourite is his character Vetinari the pure Machiavellian Patrician of the city of Ankh Morpork. He has a waiting room for people who come to see him. In it they are left alone in silence except for the quiet ticking of a wall clock.  He has had the clock specially designed to occasionally tick-tick or tock-tock or just tick with no tock every so often just to sub consciously un-nerve people before their meetings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's incredible.  I've known a little about how they work and have been fascinated how the used to make them, have you seen a fusee chain?  I inherited a set of various shaped small files similar to the ones he is using and often wondered what they were actually used for.
Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His entire series of videos are quite impressive; I subscribed to them a while ago and ordered a mini-lathe and a mini-mill (along with a few other tools) so I can eventually build my own.</p>
<p>Check back with me in about 2 years to see how this goes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the mechanism with a mechanical pendulum actually sync up with the length of a second? Does it just have to be precisely made with a certain dimension and weight? Or is there another regulator involved? (Or are grandfather clocks just horribly inaccurate at telling exact time?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fun thing about pendulum is that it doesn't matter how much it swings back and forth, the oscillation will always take the same amount of time. In other words, the oscillation period is independent of the amplitude and this property is call <em>isochronism</em>. That's for small angles though, so almost all of the timekeeping accuracy is engineered during the manufacturing process. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rate at which a pendulum swings depends mostly on its length -- it also depends on a few other things, like the local gravity and the exactly distance it swings, but length is by far the most important.</p>
<p>On Earth, near sea level, a pendulum of just slightly under one metre in length will take one second to swing from one side to the other. This can be fine-tuned, though: the weight on the end of the pendulum can be moved slighly up or down by turning a small nut. A half turn will speed up or slow down a longcase clock (the correct name, incidentally, for a grandfather clock) by about 30 seconds a day.</p>
<p>But mechanical clocks are not very accurate by our standards. A few hundred years ago, nobody cared (or needed to care) about a few minutes one way or the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I get how the pendelum regulates the interval at which the escapement operates, but how does the pressure and interrupted motion from the great the escapement connects to not throw off the timing and cycle of the pendelum?</p></div>		</li>
