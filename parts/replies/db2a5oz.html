A lurking variable is something effecting the outcome you don't take into account in an experiment. First off there is always cells in any organism that mutate. Might be a little, might be a lot, might not be expressed, but they're are there. If expressed it will generally lead to changes in phenotype (physical expression). The longer the plants are there, the more likely that one will have a mutation and change. Aside from this there are many other lurking variables as with any organism in an experimental setting. </p>
<p>If you ever have known identical twins, its kind of like that. One might have a mole the other doesn't have, or might have a birthmark in a different spot. </p></div>		</li>
