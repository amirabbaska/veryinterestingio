			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't underestimate that we're visual beings, and the layout of the piano keys is a perfect visual &quot;graph&quot; to how western music works - laid out right under your eyes and hands. I can't think of other instruments that are basically a functional &quot;chart&quot; of how music works, which makes it an excellent first instrument. You can go deep into theory or just develop muscle memory or play by ear, but the visual grasp of what's going on provided by the piano must be a huge assist in learning music overall. (It sure was for me).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure! Learning piano as my first instrument made it so much easier for me to learn my main instrument because of this. The only other instruments I can think of that are so visually clear are tuned percussion that are obviously based off piano</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm. I don't know. In keyboard-style instruments you've got a clear visual pattern. Chord and scale inversions on guitars are a nightmare compared to keyboards. </p>
<p>Source: 25 years of dedicated guitar practice. I only know guitar, and learned theory on guitar. Years later I wished I had done it on piano. The things my brain does in a rehearsal when I need to instantly know the sixth of a relative minor in a high fretboard position, are things a keyboard player never has to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, it should be stressed that people who are not visual at ALL can still learn music fairly well, and understand the relationships between notes. </p>
<p>For example, I'm aphantasiac, and play music not by thinking in sight or touch, but basically in arrays, as in programming. Which makes communication interesting, since in the key of C, I think of the note C as note #0, not the first scale degree. Same thing with Roman numeral analysis. </p>
<p>Of course, since I've mentally remapped Roman numerals to be one less than what try actually are, reading analog clocks is... interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly - I wasn't forgetting about Stevie wonder or Ray Charles when I mused about that. But I'd guess the adaptations to live with blindness could create completely different pathways to learning music in different individuals?</p>
<p>What's more fascinating to me is that music is very much like learning a language, but it's a language solely intended for artistic expression. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the piano's original popularity was fairly limited to continental Europe and England, plus their subsequent colonies. In Celtic cultures, the harp has evolved to be the instrument of choice for playing polyharmonic sounds. Traditional Irish lever harps are small enough to easily transport but can play a wide range of sounds similar to a piano and can easily change keys mid-song. Additionally, one can easily sing along while playing the harp and it can be a solo or backing instrument, depending on the goal of the musician.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that unsurprising that the popularity of the piano was 'limited' to continental Europe, given that the piano and its tuning systems originate in western music traditions built in England, Germany, Vienna and France etc. When the piano was invented in the 1700s the entirety of the Western world WAS continental Europe and England (and colonies). It wasn't applicable to non western musical traditions because of the very Western way it splits the octave.</p>
<p>Harps were less widely distributed I guess. Plus maybe they were often used in modal music rather than diatonic western music?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Range isn't really all that amazing. </p>
<p>Violin has a massive range aswell.</p>
<p>The Primary reason for piano lies in how it is essentially the foundation for modern western music in it's setup and it can be play more notes than any other instrument.</p>
<p>The guitar comes down to it's massive ability to develop unique styles of play.</p>
<p>Sure Rock music is heavily influential in why everyone plays guitar these days.  </p>
<p>But that doesn't happen if guitar could only be played classical with nylon strings and fingers.</p>
<p>Guitar has any between pick, finger, finger pick, right handed hammer-ons, pinch harmonics and slide, half slide, finger, open chord, bar chord, capo'd open chord to choose from. <strong>THEN</strong> we added electrical sounds and modulation. </p>
<p>Electric guitar also has a massively clean sound which lends itself to modulation more than other instruments. Try listening to a cello with an effects pedal. It's muddy as all hell.</p></div>		</li>
