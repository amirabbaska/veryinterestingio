<p>Cyanide for Phosphorus, if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>Cyanide is a carbon triple bonded to a nitrogen, so I doubt it.  It was probably arsenic, which is also a poison and has mostly the same properties as phosphorus but heavier</p>

<p><em>Much</em> closer.  Venus straddles the closer limit.  The zone also goes out as far as the inner section of the asteroid belt, with the entire orbits of Earth, Mars, and several asteroids being completely within the habitable zone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I was trying to remember and I was in a hurry. I knew it was a traditional poison and said the one I remembered. As for the habitable zone, I realize it is fairly broad. I was just trying to keep it stupid simple as much as possible. Venus is a good example of how just because it is in the zone doesn't mean it is in any way habitable. So, a habitable zone is sort of a suggestion, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, pretty much.  And like Mars is squarely in the habitable zone but is really small and can only really support Earthlike conditions in the low areas where there's a decent atmosphere.  Eitherwise the low pressure makes it so water can't exist in liquid form.</p>
<p>Most of your stuff is spot on, just a couple things here and there.  </p></div>		</li>
