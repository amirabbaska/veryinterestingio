			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes the average person about 15 minutes to fall asleep. It's not too difficult to gauge how long you take to fall asleep each night if you start to think about it. </p>
<p>I recently started doing some sleep meditations that are 10 minutes long. It used to take me quite some time to fall asleep but now I will often be out before the meditation finishes. </p>
<p>So while, at first, it's not always easy to predict the wake up time, you can definitely get a better feel for it and start waking up more refreshed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is why I wrote &quot;and can get to sleep by 12:30 am&quot;.  I go to sleep really quickly (less than 5 minutes from when I turn off the light, usually about 2 minutes) so it is easy for me to estimate what time to set my alarm.  In order for it to work, you will have to figure how long it will take to get to sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>90 min cycle confirmed. Feel asleep at 11:00pm, woke up naturally at 3:30am, and feeling pretty rested (even with this sinus infection). That is 3-90 min sleep cycles (12:30am, 2:00am, 3:30am). Now browsing reddit, hoping to feel tired soon so I can go back to sleep. </p>
<p>During the work week, when I sleep at 11:00pm, and set alarm for 6:00am, I feel awful, because I am interrupting the 5th cycle. I feel better waking up naturally at 5:00am or 6:30am. This only works though if you STAY asleep. If my husband snores or tosses/turns, it wakes me up multiple times during the night, I am a light sleeper, this will throws the numbers off a little.  </p></div>		</li>
