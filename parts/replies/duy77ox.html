<p>If you get too worked up and anxious, being held/ deep pressure can help bring you to the just right zone.</p>

<p>Interesting. Like, crossing my arms and squeezing my torso can reduce anxiety?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially. The tricky thing is it depends on your scenario and your body.
If you hug yourself in a comfortable place, and give yourself time to calm it would have a much higher success rate than quickly hugging yourself on a crowded train, making you feel self conscious and more anxious. </p>
<p>It really depends on your body and your tempremant. I don't know you well enough to recommend anything, so please take everything with an open mind. And try to engagr in what you think would work.
Sorry to give such a nondescript answer but thats the thing with anxieties, they are soooo subjective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, I expected a physiological explanation. As a sufferer of anxiety, I don't believe it is majorly subjective (if, by subjective, you mean it is self-induced by mental constructs, or indeed is even unique to most sufferers), but is a biological response having more to do with survival instincts than anything else. </p>
<p>Edit: In saying that, I think mental constructs may signal the biological mechanism to kick in, so I can see why one might think that anxiety is directly caused by being self-conscious. But I think it goes deeper than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I have no idea about long term prognosis. Maybe just use it as a reason for her to stick around?? </p>
<p>But you may need to be more active in your workplace/life if you are constantly bouncing your leg.
Either that or get a fidgeting ring, standing work desk or a new girlfriend (not recommended).</p></div>		</li>
