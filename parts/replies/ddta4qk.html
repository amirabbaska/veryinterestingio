			<div class="markdown"><p>For those of you that don't like grapes and are willing to develop some... Acquired tastes, like rocks or glass, if you use a convection oven to preheat them to several hundred degrees it increases the specific absorption rate (SAR) of the material. This is the rate at which microwave power is absorbed by the material in Watts per Kilogram and normally the SAR in rocks and glass is less than the rate at which they radiate that acquired heat energy and so it's completely safe (boring) to put those things in the microwave.  However, SAR is temperature dependent, so if you want to spice up your cooking by preheating the materials in a convection oven you can raise the SAR to the point when you put it in the microwave that causes a feedback loop of heating which increases SAR which allows for more heating called thermal runaway.  At this point the temperature limit is governed only by the power output of the microwave and the size of your ehrm, meal, and as a result it is possible to make small amounts of lava with a normal home microwave.</p>
<p>Tl;dr <em>Fake Italian Accent</em> Todaya we are 'a going to be making the lava! (No, not hot pockets: LAVA-lava)</p>
<p>1) A preheat some 'a rocks in the oven to 'a 500 degrees</p>
<p>2) 'A put 'a  the rocks in 'a the microwave and 'a nuke 'a them like 'a Hiroshima</p>
<p>3) Enjoya your 'a spicy meal 'a thanks to thermal runaway and 'a me, 'a Chefa Mario!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so various things are getting mixed up here. First off: The plasma forms because of the high <em>temperature</em>. Anything could cause that temperature; doesn't have to be electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>In this case, it's a current, which is created by the grapes absorbing the microwaves electromagnetic radiation, a bit like an antenna. You <em>don't need ionizing radiation to create a current</em>. Any electromagnetic radiation can create a current; that's how your radio functions the way it does. It's just the <em>intensity</em> that's insanely high inside the microwave, so instead of a tiny, unnoticeable current, you get a 'fuckton of current' as OP puts it, which heats things up real quickly. (you can easily melt steel with a bit of current)</p></div>		</li>
