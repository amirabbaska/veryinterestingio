<p>Note that the sharp cutoff that changes at the bottom is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QOXjYT6.jpg" target="_blank">from the limb of the Moon itself</a> as the spacecraft came up over the top of the Moon during the eclipse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it would be crazy if in the history of all lunar rovers and all lunar satellites, that none have ever taken a photo of Earth during a lunar eclipse, right?</p>
<p>But I can't seem to find one, and the visualization leads me to think that one has not been taken. </p></div>		</li>
