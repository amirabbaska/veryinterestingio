			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend told me that these actually just made it easier for 13 year old joyriders to get sufficient leverage to break the steering lock. In the early 90's the disc lock was the preferred visible deterrent. </p>
<p>I just went with &quot;why would you bother to steal this&quot; as theft control. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funnest part about these things is like, okay a thief can't break the harden metal, super-forged, dealy, but the steering wheel is just like plastic and rubber. A small serrated knife or hacksaw and you can cut part of the steering wheel and just pop it right off. It's like putting a heavy duty iron lock on a door made of balsa wood or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most physical security we rely on is just based on deterrence and a false sense of security.</p>
<p>Most commercial padlocks and door locks are notoriously easy to pick. They're generally regarded as beginner practice on /r/lockpicking</p>
<p>Or they're easy to cut. Or break.</p></div>		</li>
