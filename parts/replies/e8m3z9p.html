			<div class="markdown"><p>You should also think about sleepwalking. Your brain is kinda &quot;thinking&quot; about all kinds of activity, and it is supposed to be sandboxed, so your brain can experiment while nothing will actually happen. But there's a glitch in the sandbox, and the inhibition suddenly doesn't work anymore. This is where the dog starts actually running with his legs while being fast asleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when I sometimes say a word or two while asleep, it's my brain accidentally letting that action get passed the inhibitor? Interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What will really blow your mind are the studies showing visualisation training in sports can be as effective as actually training skills.  It's effectively the application of this interesting way of how the brain works.</p>

<p>Are there cases of people who have this part of the brain damaged in some way? Is that what causes weird ticks and stuff? </p>
<p>Do babies not have this fully developed for some time, and if so, is that why they jerk around randomly like badly programmed robots? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I have focal Dystonia and that’s exactly what it does to me. Dystonia isn’t super understood, but it believed that it’s caused by damage in the basal ganglia. I’m no Neurologist, this is just how it was explained to me as a patient. I have jerking in my left arm, leg and neck as well as a laundry list of other things. But what’s most irritating is trying to move my hands or or feet and them ‘not doing what I tell them to do’. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're already doing something, like say picking up small weights and putting them in a basket, does your body still &quot;interrupt&quot; those motions? Or does that kind of &quot;jerking&quot; like you said only happen when you're not doing any one particular thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just googled &quot;alien hand syndrome basal ganaglia&quot; and found this case study you might find interesting. </p>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/588798" target="_blank">The Alien Hand Syndrome Clinical and Postmortem Findings</a></p>
<p>Here's the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two patients had automatonlike movements of their left hands and arms (alien hand syndrome) following damage to the brain. Autopsy findings in one patient demonstrated gunshot wound damage to the medial frontal white matter bilaterally, as well as the corpus callosum, right basal ganglia, internal capsule, and thalamus. The other patient had a ruptured anterior communicating aneurysm, with subsequent resection of the right frontal gyrus rectus. We postulate that this syndrome is due to the combination of a partial callosectomy and mesial frontal lesions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alien hand syndrome blows my mind, there's a subject we're trying to recruit for a study (we do work on brain development) who happens to have alien hand syndrome (unrelated to what we're trying to study). I had never heard of it until then and was blown away after looking further into it. The idea that you can see this limb moving but have no recognition that it's your own is fascinating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huntington's disease involves damage to the inhibitory function of the basal ganglia, which causes &quot;chorea&quot; (jerky involuntary movements).</p>
<p>Huntington's can kind of be thought as the opposite of Parkinson's where the inhibition can't be switched off, which results in trouble initiating movement.</p></div>		</li>

So glad my Basal Ganglia got my back. Thanks for the understandable explanation :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a real trip: when you read sentences like &quot;the roads runs alongside the shore,&quot; there is evidence your brain actually employs the motor cortex to help understand the metaphor, so processing takes longer vs the sentence &quot;the road is next to the shore.&quot; From what I understand, our brain is silently simulating motor movements all the time to help us compute things and understand language, but just hides those things away from our muscles!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah language actually plays a part in evolution of complex thought. This thing 'A' has a relationship to thing 'B' &lt;-- this is what it allows us to do. There have been experiments that show when you lose this language, you can't put things together anymore. It's very interesting </p></div>		</li>
