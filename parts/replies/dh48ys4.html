			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm skeptical. Shorting the microphone for a few milliseconds would essentially create a thump at maximum volume at a frequency of, say, 400 Hz (2 * 1 / 5ms). That is easily audible.</p>
<p>The link you provided is about the headphones for the iPod which don't have a microphone. This kind of control circuit would normally be in a separate conductor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would make a thump only if the ground state was drastically different than the rest state. Plus, if the phone is prepared to recognize it, it could easily cut out that particular few milliseconds of audio in addition to whatever else its doing. The question would be, if you use the mic on an unsupported phone what does the button do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess there are lots of ways you could do it on the mic conductor, but to do it well you'd need to have a sensible circuit controlling it. I figured the easiest way would be to have the mic shorted to maximum signal (one which would not be produced normally even if the microphone clips) so that you wouldn't have to work out whether the signal was the result of the button or just ordinary talking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The analogue signal from the headphones goes through a digital signal processor, it's not hard to filter out chirps and pops.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And the problem exists, event without the button.  What if you are in the middle of a phone call and you pull out the headphone jack to switch to the built-in microphone on the body of the device.  The electronics have to deal with the noise of that removal.  So, the logic generally already was understood how to detect these interruptions fast enough to clamp them from the transmitted signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what he says is right from my limited experience. When I use my android compatible headphones with my work laptop and press any of the buttons on the remote I get a pop up telling me I've disconnected a device from the audio jack, and another telling me I've connected one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed that I triggered a prompt for voice control when I accidently unplugged and replugged my headphones, which didn't have any extra mic or buttons. Is this the same concept as what you just mentioned? </p></div>		</li>
