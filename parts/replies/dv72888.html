<p>This is the most accurate answer.</p>
<p>Toothbrushes are made by companies that dont give a fuck about your health. They just care about profit.</p>
<p>I remember in a big simposium hosted by one of this companies i asked this same question. Why do you make this toothbrushes if we know that they are bad for people?
The guy didnt knew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>one thing to keep in mind though is a medium bristled toothbrush that gets used is more effective than a soft bristled toothbrush that doesn't.  Sometimes giving in a bit to what people want helps.  sort of the various diet such as counting points or no carbs or you have have as much X but no Y type things.  Losing weight comes down to more calories out than in, but most people aren't going to track calories, so giving them an option they will follow even though it isn't the most effective is better than nothing.  So if a medium bristle brush feels better to them and gets them to brush more often, it is going to be more effective than a soft bristled brush that the person doesn't feel is effective so they apply way too much force or they skip brushing some because they don't believe the brush is doing much good anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might get lost.  I used to be in Dental sales.  What your dentist told you is correct.  No dental office carries hard bristles.  The consumer believes you have to scrub your teeth hard to get plaque off.  This is false.  You can remove plaque by gently wiping your teeth with a piece of tissue paper.  Retailers carry the hard bristles because consumers buy them.  People are dumb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are using metal to remove calculas.  Calculas is what forms when plaque isnt' removed.  After a few weeks it hardens and turns to calc.  They only way to remove it is manually with metal.  It's because people are bad brushers and don't floss.  </p></div>		</li>
