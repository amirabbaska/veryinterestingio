			<div class="markdown"><p>As a simple A.F.A. all we have to do is stablize the casualty, but im curious does a person who started at say... lets say 6 or 7 and progresses to a solid 15 mean that they are generally &quot;recovered&quot;? or is there a good possibility of lasting damage or maybe a slowly progressing injury like a subdermal hematoma? I guess what im asking (its late and im exhausted) is at a GCS of 15 is there still risk of severe injury? (people still get treated for the worse situation but this is more so a curiosity)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally haven't encountered anyone who I would class as having had a severe injury with an early 15/15 so no examples to give. This is possible given the more long-term symptoms of a TBI aren't addressed by the GCS, as it is an immediate/short term measure of functioning.</p>
<p>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15179250
This is an old article but points out that the GCS is not an effective indicator of long-term function nor mortality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long would it take for that motorcyclist to be able to stand on his own without losing his balance, to think and reason normally, and so on?</p>
<p>30 seconds of unconsciousness seems like it's on the edge of being something you don't wake up from, and from what I've seen of people with even mild brain injuries, it can be days or weeks before they're fully themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he could have stood at the end of the scene but we had him in sitting - he was a bit agitated so we let him sit but had his neck supported and then collared and put him on a stretcher.</p>
<p>You are right, 30 seconds is a long time! I unfortunately did not get to see him through to recovery so cannot comment on his future function.</p>
<p>The variability of TBI could mean he could be weeks to months before he is 'allright' at most everyday tasks. Or he could be up and out of hospital in days! I think it would be reasonable to anticipate long-term issues with personality changes, memory, fatigue and advanced tasks with someone who has this level of injury.</p></div>		</li>
