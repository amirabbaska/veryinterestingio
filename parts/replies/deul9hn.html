It's not that they are inherently a threat though it's that Putin is a threat due to the way that he looks at the world and the future he envisions for Russia and his resentment towards america and his fondness for the Soviet Union.  When Putin was briefly out of power there was a marked change in the way Russia was cooperating with the US and a lot got done that would have been impossible with Putin in full control.  NewStart for example and the development of the North path into Afghanistan which is what enabled us to capture bin laden(we didn't have to go through Pakistan who was tipping of bin laden).  Russia is quite good at cyber-warfare and has launched a full blown massive propaganda/disinformation campaign, invaded Georgia, annexed Crimea and interfered in our elections whilst simultaneously contributing to the rise of right wing nationalist parties all across Europe and the world with the intention of sowing discord and creating chaos and doubt in our democracies and trying to suggest that we are just as bad as they are which is just categorically untrue.</p>
<p>You're definitely right that they are seriously declining and the fundamentals of their economy aren't good, they are far too dependent on resource extraction and their economy is straight up rigged .  But the thing about cyber warfare and information campaigns are that they're cheap and quite effective.  Their recent behavior throughout our election has shown us that they aren't afraid to use that newfound ability in ways that is startling and disturbing.</p>
<p>China is certainly an issue but they are much easier to contain and are much more predictable and reliable due to our dependence on each other and their historical inward looking behavior.  We can contain them through things like the TPP and although their ip theft is a real concern and issue, it's not like they are trying to actively disrupt our government and economy.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's worth noting that in 2012, President Obama mocked Governor Romney for stating that Russia was a threat saying that, &quot;the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite that your point about Democrats hyping up Russia to score political points is valid, relations vis-a-vis Russia were much better in 2012 than they are now. President Obama expressed this rhetoric before Russia's invasion of Ukraine/annexation of Crimea, involvement in Syria, and noncompliance with the INF Treaty. This obviously omits the very recent Russian political disinformation campaign directed at the US presidential election.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is pretty reasonable in 2012 for Obama to say that Russia did not pose a serious threat to the U.S. Meanwhile, today the threat that Russia poses to the Western liberal order is much clearer.</p></div>		</li>
