<p>In warm climates and developed cities it definitely does. Each 10 degree increase in temperature doubles the amount of energy used by air conditioners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ya I meant directly not indirectly. it totally affects GhG emissions indirectly - use of land for urban development, increased energy usage, typically increased personal vehicle usage etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not a direct result of the asphalt though, that's a reaction that humans take in reaction to the increase from the volume and density of asphalt.</p>
<p>If the people living in that city were fine with the 10 degree increase and didn't run their air conditioners to compensate, there would be no GhG increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to think about it:</p>
<p>In warm climates people run their air conditioners 24/7.  The air conditioners are set at a constant temperature.  During the day, when the sun warms the city, the air conditioners have to work twice as hard because of the asphalt. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Nice statistic.  What's the source?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read that Las Vegas is a prime example of this. Even though it is in a desert, there has been a notable and traceable increase in average yearly temperatures as the city has and continues to develop. There is also the matter of infrastructure, for instance solar fields in Southern California have become a huge hazard to bird populations since the reflections from the panels literally cook birds to death as they pass overhead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So serious question, how much of the global temperature rise we are seeing is due to taking temperatures in these heat islands and subsequent year-over-year increases from sprawling development? What do historic temperatures look like globally if we only look at rural/remote temperature stations free of this effect?</p>
<p>Note: these are simply questions, not looking for political bias either way, only data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Global satellite observations of Earth temperatures as well as statistical controls of in situ measurements can eliminate the effects of the urban heat island on the global average temperature calculation. Well, satellite observations would include the anomaly but it would be negated by the amount of unurbanized space they also measure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately they aren't being so much cooked alive as singeing the tips of flight feathers causing them to plummet to their doom, unable to fly away or evade predators. And while the number of bird deaths is quite high from it atm we must remember they're working on the problem, and the renewable energy likely saves wildlife lives indirectly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Could there not be some adaptation the birds could develop to cause them to avoid these areas or simply fly through unharmed. I say this after hearing about birds that live close to busy areas getting smaller so they are more agile and able to dodge stuff. Yes shrinking is a trivial adaptation compared to a behaviour that would cause them to avoid solar farms but just a thought. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, they're being cooked.  Employees call them &quot;streamers&quot; because they leave a smoke trail.  That's not singed tips. </p>
<p>&quot;Workers at a state-of-the-art solar plant in the Mojave Desert have a name for birds that fly through the plant’s concentrated sun rays — “streamers,” for the smoke plume that comes from birds that ignite in midair.&quot;

<p>&quot;In  the  US  this  urban heat-island  effect was  estimated  at  an  average  of just over  1.1°C  for  a  sample  of 30  US  cities  and  about  2.9°C   for   New   York   City   (Viterito,    1989). In Moscow, USSR, the heat-island effect is projected to add  about 3°-3.5°C  to  average  annual  temperatures  (Izrael, 1989).
The  urban  heat-island  effect  in  Shanghai,  China,  is  quite pronounced, with  a potential  intensity  as  high  as  6.5 °C  on  a  calm,  clear December  night  in  1979,  but  no heat-island   effect   observed   on   days  with  strong  wind  and  heavy  rain  (Zhou,   1989).&quot;</p></div>		</li>
