			<div class="markdown"><p>So in other words, if you would show a caveman a picture of a Prius and tell them it's a vehicle, they wouldn't necessarily be able to recognize a truck as a vehicle because of a lack of a concept of a vehicle and a lack of frame of reference?
Concepts and a massive reference collection are hard to come by for a computer.
Makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like if you showed a caveman what a Prius could <em>do for them</em>, then based off of its purpose, they would have a concept of what something that looks like a Prius is.  That's how we went from a wheel to a cart: we made an object perform a function, then got more specific about what that function should be.</p>
<p>Show a caveman a cave.  Then show a caveman the same cave during a rainstorm.  Then show a caveman how to build a simple hut.  They'll quickly grasp what it's supposed to be used <em>for</em> even if they don't have a name for it...which is why cavemen wanted to stick their dicks into every hole they could find.  (just kidding!)</p>
<p>The same applies to many simple tools like a wrench or a screwdriver, which could be used as weapons because they look like them, but set to their proper context, we tie their purpose to their appearance.  A computer doesn't have that kind of cognitive recognition or associative memory: there is no context, only the object itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of all of this, our brains are really good at comparing new things to our past experiences and noticing small differences.  This was very important to us evolutionarily as it allowed us to differentiate between friend and foe, safe and potentially poisonous, docile and aggressive animals, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 makes a lot of sense when you think about our baby and toddler years when we spend hours trying to figure out if the circle goes in the square hole or the circle hole... and so on.
We have pretty fancy programs in our head but the initialization process takes literally decades. </p></div>		</li>
