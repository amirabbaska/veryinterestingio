<p><em>(credit to Eliezer Yudkowsy)</em></p>
<p><strong>MORPHEUS:</strong> For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it. But then I saw the fields with my own eyes, watched them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living -</p>
<p><strong>NEO</strong> (politely): Excuse me, please.</p>
<p><strong>MORPHEUS:</strong> Yes, Neo?</p>
<p><strong>NEO:</strong> I've kept quiet for as long as I could, but I feel a certain need to speak up at this point. The human body is the most inefficient source of energy you could possibly imagine. The efficiency of a power plant at converting thermal energy into electricity decreases as you run the turbines at lower temperatures. If you had any sort of food humans could eat, it would be more efficient to burn it in a furnace than feed it to humans. And now you're telling me that their food is the bodies of the dead, fed to the living? Haven't you ever heard of the laws of thermodynamics?</p>
<p><strong>MORPHEUS:</strong> Where did you hear about the laws of thermodynamics, Neo?</p>
<p><strong>NEO:</strong> Anyone who's made it past one science class in high school ought to know about the laws of thermodynamics!</p>
<p><strong>MORPHEUS:</strong> Where did you go to high school, Neo?</p>
<p>(Pause.)</p>
<p><strong>NEO:</strong> ...in the Matrix.</p>
<p><strong>MORPHEUS:</strong> The machines tell elegant lies.</p>
<p>(Pause.)</p>
<p><strong>NEO</strong> (in a small voice): Could I please have a real physics textbook?</p>
<p><strong>MORPHEUS:</strong> There is no such thing, Neo. The universe doesn't run on math.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that was just a mistake.</p>
<p>I think the energy talk was supposed to be attached to &quot;metabolism&quot;, and &quot;producing&quot; in that case would be photosynthesis or eating.</p>
<p>Using the energy... well that's everything that living things do. That includes growing, but also things like moving, thinking, etc. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What I can get from his wiki sounds pretty interesting. Do you have any interesting links on the matter? I mean, the fact that you point him out shows that you know more about it than me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not agree that evolution is a good metric for life, because viruses &quot;evolve&quot; in the same way information evolves. In fact, to a cell, viruses <em>are</em> information. If you have trillions of genes floating around sooner or later you're going to catch one that messes with your body, go at it long enough and some of those will cause your cells to replicate the genes. They are more alike to a code error than they are to bacteria.  </p></div>		</li>
