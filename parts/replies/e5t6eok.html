<p>Poaceae (the family that contains grasses) was originally thought to be around 55 million years old, but older fossil evidence keeps turning up. Plant structures associated with grasses have been found in fossilized dinosuar feces dating back to 66 mya, and revised dating of the rice tribe and fossil evidence of mammals with apparent grass-feeding adaptations have pushed the origins of Poaceae back to around 100-120 mya, about the same time that flowering plants became widespread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is correct, but I feel needs to be added to: there is an important difference between the evolution of grass and the emergence of the grassland. It took grass a while before it was truly defining it's own biome. Last I heard was around 25 mya, but that may have been since updated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s all correct (with the caveat that others have mentioned of <em>grasslands</em> being a more recent phenomenon and a different thing than the emergence of grasses themselves).</p>
<p>Ground-covers in the Cretaceous and earlier appear to have largely been ferns, mosses (true mosses and club-mosses), and biocrusts (mixtures of lichens, algae, liverworts, and mosses).  Given the relatively early dates of flowering plants there were undoubtedly some forbs mixed in as well, but not in significantly highe enough densities to leave a strong fossil record.  It would not be surprising if there were some small, ground-cover adapts confiers or conifer relatives, but I’ve never read of those being found.  In more damp areas horsetails would be common as well.</p>
<p>Ferns, once established, can be extremely tenacious (as are horsetails) due to their rhizomatous growth (a network of tough underground stems from which new plants can grow even if they are broken).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to sidetrack the discussion, but how do ferns manage to exclude other plants in an environment like that? I often am in very open woodlands, with only mature trees and fern groundcover, but not real understory. It seems like it wouldn't take long for something to grow through the ferns following a disturbance, unless they use some sort of allelopathy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it depends a lot on the type of fern, but where I took that photo (Appalachian Trail in Shenandoah NP, Virginia) and elsewhere along the East Coast the lack of apex predators and the resulting <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/controlling-understory-fern-competition-for-regeneration-success" target="_blank">overpopulation of white-tailed deer seems to a major driving force</a>.</p>
<p>Many types of fern (and things like hobble-bush) are not preferred forage for the deer.  They selectively eat what they like, leaving the plants they don't, which gives those plants, ferns especially, enjoy a competitive advantage as a result.  Hay-scented fern is one of the ones that's often considered a &quot;problem&quot; fern in that part of the US.</p>
<p>On the West Coast it's a bit different, the old-growth tall forests are dark which limits what can grow in the understory.  Certain ferns tolerate the dark well and grow so densely that they effectively drown out other plants.  Not all others, obviously, but enough so that they dominate.</p>
<p>Situations like this are why the occasional blow-down is so important in old, primary growth forests.  Blow-downs open up the forest to light and promote the growth of important species that have been sort of &quot;waiting in the wings&quot; for the opportunity to grow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226278266_The_allelopathic_mechanisms_of_dominance_in_bracken_Pteridium_aquilinum_in_Southern_California" target="_blank">Allelopathy, of a more chemical nature, also plays a part, particularly in the case of bracken ferns</a> and studies have been done on a wide variety of other ferns, indicating that this is a trait that is widespread.  Of course, it's a mix of factors that leads to suppression of other plants, in the linked paper one of the findings was that small animals sheltering in bracken fern stands foraged on seedlings and suppressed the growth of certain plants as a result.</p>
<p>Like a lot of things, the full answer is complex.</p></div>		</li>

<p>edit: Found an <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151205-one-amazing-substance-allowed-life-to-thrive-on-land" target="_blank">interesting read on the history of soil</a></p>

<p>By about 360 million years ago, soils were much like they are today, with the same range of varieties we can find beneath our feet – including swamp soils and forest soils.</p>
