			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, this is one of those things that many popular franchises don't seem to care about. In many developers mindsets, by the time the online for one game is shut down, a sequel will already be out.</p>
<p>It's honestly a poor mindset, and can ruin many games just years after release because their developers decide to shut down the servers.</p>
<p>As a side note, if you ever do want to play Mario Kart Wii online ever again, try using <a href="https://wiimmfi.de/" target="_blank">wiimmfi</a> to play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Online Multiplayer has been a thing on PC for years, however it took until it got to console for it to truly become this more mainstream service. It was often only used in PC-exclusive games such as Starcraft and many MMOs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh? Steams been around for years. And anyone with a PC whose a gamer has been mainstream gaming online since at least half-life 1, CS and TFC... but really even further back. Every PC gamer I know has been playing online since 56k and that was awful.</p>
<p>It's really just console gamers finally catching up to the rest of us.</p></div>		</li>
