			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are a pharmacist (or work with them): What is your advice when pharmacists <em>don't</em> do this? Because of insurance, I can pretty much only go to one pharmacy (CVS) and while I'm sure there are good pharmacists out there, mine do not seem to be...They have messed up my prescriptions; they've failed to notice an allergy; and they seem reluctant to say anything more than &quot;talk to your doctor about that.&quot; What can I do to ensure this doesn't keep happening (other than reporting them to the managers/corporate)? Are there tips to building a better relationship with the pharmacy? Can they <em>not</em> answer questions, for their own liability? Or do I just happen to have bad ones?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't a computer algorithm determine with 100% efficiency and accuracy the laundry list of possible drug interactions(mild to deadly) in lightning speed? In current form, the onus is placed on the pharmacist to remember everything from common to obscure drug interactions and anything less than 100% accuracy could potentially put a patient at risk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is true that computers can tell you what drugs interact, however it is impossible for it to make certain judgement calls. For example, blood thinners like warfarin interact with NSAIDS (they both impact clotting). A computer will say they interact, but who is to override it when they should be used together? Some patients are able to look over their entire body for bruising and such which would allow them to stay on both, while some patients are sedentary and won't notice new bleeding. A pharmacist in this situation would be able to say it is okay to override in one situation vs the other.</p></div>		</li>
