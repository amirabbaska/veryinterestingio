			<div class="markdown"><p>That... is not exactly another side. The information you linked states the following: ISPs probably will be allowed to collect urls you visit. They can then change their privacy policy to start selling the information and the only recourse you have is to completely cancel you r subscription. In that case only 2 in 5 (less than half) Americans have access to a competing ISP (I think we can agree that a 3mbps connection is insufficient). And even if you belong to those lucky 2 in 5, if the other ISP engages in the same practice you are out of luck.</p>
<p>That is literally the information on that page. If that is the best attempt of the other side to make it sound good, then it really must be bad. Almost comical how they write &quot;two in five U.S. households had access to at least two providers offering 25 Mbps downstream&quot; as if that implies working competition.</p>
<p>Also, their main argument appears to be that the rules are redundant, there are already safeguards in place. Well in that case having the rules should not change anything for you; if you don't intend to break the rules, then why do worry so much about them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The isp speeds are about competition and shows how most Americans jumped from 3mbps in 2013 to 25mbps in 2014 due to competition. That's huge! In plain terms, if one isp changes their privacy policy (which they must inform you about and have an option to opt out), pressure from customers will force them to change. </p>
<p>The rest is staying rules and regulations that are already in place and how the FCC is still able to regulate everything after this.</p>
<p>I like this article because 90% of all the other articles are saying &quot;EVERY ISP IS GOING TO SELL YOUR HISTORY&quot; and that's pretty much it. Mind you ISPs already collect data such as sites you are visiting (also stated in the article) so I'm not sure what the bill was really doing. </p>
<p>I'm not saying this bill being repealed is a good or bad thing but it is most likely going to happen. This is more of a &quot;why it's not the apocalypse isn't coming&quot; unlike most of the articles I've read. I'm still trying to find more info about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;That is literally the information on the page&quot;.. I guess that's accurate in the loosest possible sense. It's a tiny fraction of the information on the page. It actually presents pretty valid points, none of which you addressed. I'm not stating an opinion on this issue, just saying that your description of this article is wildly incorrect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was not trying to give a comprehensive summary of the linked article, and I still don't think I gave that impression. But let me be explicit: I was showing how bad the situation is using only information that the liked article contains.</p>
<p>My motivation was as follows: I was surprised someone could read that article and get away with the impression that everything is A-OK, just because it is phrased in a confident way. E.g. they composed the phrase as if they were saying 'the overwhelming majority', but it really say 'two in five'. Honestly, I find it to be a bit insulting.</p>
<p>I think that simple basic literacy should allow a reader to come to a similar conclusion, therefore I wanted to show how flimsy the ... - well, can't even call them arguments - are, to encourage others to actually read it and employ their literacy. I.e. my comment is meant as a starting point for others, not as a summary or end point.</p></div>		</li>
