We can send a radio wave signal close to the nitrogen's resonant frequency and this will penetrate the cage. Radiation will be absorbed by the nitrogen atom only if it is at the right frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I don’t have access to the PRL article, but typically these resonances are on the order of GHz (billions of oscillations per second).  In order for the molecules to even care about the pulse, it has to be within a certain range of frequencies usually 10s-100s of kHz.  So if you had stray sources at precisely the right frequency, you could cause some unwanted excitations.  However, you would need a lot of power to see anything measurable.</p>
<p>However you also have to consider the fact that in order to get a transition, you have to have proper polarization (direction) of the electric field pulse.  If it is incorrect, the atom won’t care about it (conservation laws and dipole matrix elements).  </p>
<p>And finally, the volume is probably pretty small, so you would have to have your stray pulse directed exactly at the cloud.</p>
<p>So in short, 1) you need the exact frequency (to within less than a fraction of a percent) 2) it has to be polarized 3) it has to be hitting the atoms and 4) if 1-3 are met, you need a lot of power for a measureable signal.</p>
