<p>Venus and Mars are uninhabitable due to the composition of the atmosphere and the near lack of one respectively. For that matter, ceres and the moon are both planetary mass objects in the habitable zone, however like mars they're not able to hang onto an atmosphere. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Determining the habitable zone is quite difficult, and the estimates have changed over the years. But it appears that the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.8174.pdf" target="_blank">Earth might actually be quite close to the innermost edge of the habitable zone</a>, with Venus well outside it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mars has an atmosphere, albeit not as dense as Earth's or Venus's. The composition and density of the atmosphere are related to Mars's mass (among other things). </p></div>		</li>
