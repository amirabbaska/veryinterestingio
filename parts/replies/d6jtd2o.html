			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more that you could hold it at 1m above the ground the entire way around. Hovering would definitely not occur spontaneously.</p>
<p>The question was worded a bit strangely, but I think a lot of people are just overlooking it as it's a fairly well known statement/problem due to the linear increase (<a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/67/" target="_blank">xkcd even mentions it</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A completely rigid ring might float. </p>
<p>It would depend on completely even force all the way around the ring - so the ring would have to be of perfect cross section and density (which you can't do), and gravity would have to be completely even all the way around (which it isn't).</p>
<p>If the force was unbalanced the ring would sink down on one side and stick 2m up on the other. </p>
<p>If you spun it sufficiently fast it would float even with the unbalanced force - but it would easier to just prop it up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/hilburn said some good stuff. One thing to add:</p>
<p>While it may float in a perfect scenario, that would be an unstable equilibrium. Any disturbance would cause it to no longer float.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Randall mentions planets' rings toward the end. Does anyone know if the reason Saturn has so many rings and Jupiter so few is that hardly any matter gets by Saturn? If it escapes the gravity at the orbits of Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn, I can imagine it must be headed directly enough towards the Sun that it has slim chances of catching Jupiter. Is there any substance to this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is really about the geometry of the situation, not the physics. We're assuming we don't need to worry about keeping the rope wherever it needs to be to perfectly encircle the earth. (We're also assuming we can find a circumference of the earth that's perfectly flat.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that makes more sense to me. I was wondering why we might find it surprising that it is <em>possible to hold</em> such a rope 1m above the ground, given 1m-high supports around the circumference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's more like: given a ring of rope with the precise length to wrap around the earth (assuming the surface is flat, and the planet is a perfect sphere [which is not]), how much longer would the rope have to be in order to wrap around a planet with a radius bigger than earth's by 1 meter.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a mathematical thought experiment, the rope us assumed to be perfectly circular. It's probably not physically realizable because of gravity etc.</p></div>		</li>
