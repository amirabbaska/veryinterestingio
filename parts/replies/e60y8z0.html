			<div class="markdown"><p>Off the top of my head… A passing hurricane drops the surface temperature of water by about 1-2 C. “Surface” is about 10 meters, give or take, and the size of a hurricane (measured by RMW) is around 7000 sq km, giving us <del>70,000 cubic km</del> (uh… <strong>edit</strong>: actually 70 cubic km) of water we need to raise by 1-2 C.</p>
<p>This is a hard thing to calculate accurately. But we can guesstimate. Let’s assume a water temperature of 20 C (tropical but not exactly steamy). Raising 70 cubic km of 20 C water to 21 C by adding water which is 37 C (body temperature) should roughly require 4.1 cubic km of pee.</p>
<p>The average human bladder has a capacity of about 500 mL, which is 0.0000000000005 cubic km. You would need 8,200,000,000,000 (that's 8.2 trillion) people to all pee into the same area of the ocean simultaneously. Which is to say, 80 times more people than have ever lived in the whole history of our species.</p></div>		</li>
