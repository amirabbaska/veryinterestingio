			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do we do genetic testing if most breast cancer does not have a family history component? My mom had a radical mastectomy last year and they did genetic testing on her. This is a true question and not at all an accusation or meant to be confrontational.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because some cancers do have identifiable genetic causes such as BRCA1/2 and if we find those then you can recommend prophylactic mastectomy to kids, because these almost always result in breast cancer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some tumors have receptors (such as HER2) that can be used to target chemo and other meds. If you do carry a BRAC gene, it can also influence treatment decisions. Since these cancers have a high rate of recurrence, some women opt to have more aggressive treatment up front. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Why don't we use synthetic hormones to artificially induce lactation at a certain age into adulthood in order to prevent this issue? I know we can do it - plenty of medications have this as a side effect in both men and women already. Just seems like common sense if we've already isolated this as a cause. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about what you're saying... Women already choose not to  use because of the inconvenience of more frequent feeding and the (supposed) impact on breast shape afterward. What woman is going to sign up to express milk on a frequent schedule without even feeding a baby? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well presumably you'd only have to do it long enough for the cells to mature. It'd be a pain in the ass, sure. But cancer is arguably a bigger pain in the ass. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The well excepted theory is that lifetime estrogens exposure is directly correlated with breast cancer incidence.  Hence early menarche and not having kids are well known breast cancer risk factors.  The longer you have breast tissue exposed to estrogens the higher the likelihood of developing breast cancer.</p>
<p>Prolactin makes the breasts swell and is not associated with cancer risk.  You've got it almost perfectly backwards.</p></div>		</li>
