<p>They said that in Vietnam, the F-4 was originally crafted for this purpose and they ditched the cannon, until later on when they started to engage in dogfights again. Turns out missiles aren't 100% guaranteed and there will always be a need for a backup solution. Although, we've gotten better, but we learned a hard lesson in Vietnam that we won't soon forget. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The Navy instead focused on training (the Top Gun program) and IIRC, fared slightly better in K/D than did the AF, albeit with fewer engagements total. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to say that there was a difference in application of the aircraft as well, however my knowledge on it is a bit fuzzy. If I'm not mistaken, the USN would typically focus on the Attack role and the USAF would focus on fighter support. Not that both couldn't perform both roles, but I could be way off base here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude, Vietnam ended 49 years ago. Things have changed slightly in terms of AtA missiles, but more importantly, the tech for planes and avionics is so much improved from back then that they might as well not even be called the same thing. An f-4 could be called a fighter jet, an F-22 is more like a mobile precision weapons platform that is nearly undetectable and supposedly nearly impossible to engage from another aircraft</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am absolutely not arguing against what you're saying, however it is still equipped with a canon for the reason I pointed out. &quot;Better safe than sorry&quot; type thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot the vectored thrust on the F-22 giving it great maneuverability compared to, well nearly anything. I'd say that rates it as also a fighter aircraft, even if current tactics call for it to not be used that way. After all the then current tactics called for the F-4 to not be used that way. Things changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand - the reason Pilots engaged in dog fighting in Vietnam is that they were forced to visually identify their targets.  At visual range - the AIM-7 Sparrow missile gave up all of its advantages of Beyond visual range firing.</p>
<p>This was a political decision, not a military one because we were definitely afraid of shooting down a Russian advisor instead of the North Vietnamese Air Force jet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are the planes still designed with that in mind? Seems like the sort of thing that would have a massive impact on the kind of planes you put in the air. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now days our airplanes are designed to kill the opponent before they even know we are there. We still make air superiority fighters that are designed to kill other airplanes in whatever airspace we want to control...but if they can see us well enough to fight us then our design has already failed. </p>
<p>To add to that though...our modern fighters like the f22 and f35 are highly maneuverable and would still be effective in dogfighting.</p></div>		</li>
