			<div class="markdown"><p>That may be true but the article directly discusses the possible existence of Jupiter sized rocky planets. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>for orbital distances less than about 0.05 AU
weakly magnetized or highly irradiated gas giants may lose a large fraction of their initial
mass and even completely lose their gas envelopes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other planets have been discovered that are theorized to have near Jupiter sized radius but composed of rocky ad metallic elements. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corot-20b has 4.24 times Jupiter's mass but a radius of only 0.84 that of Jupiter—it may have a metal core of 800 Earth masses if the heavy elements are concentrated in the core, or a core of 300 Earth masses if the heavy elements are more distributed throughout the planet</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid planets up to thousands of Earth masses may be able to form around massive stars (B-type and O-type stars; 5–120 solar masses), where the protoplanetary disk would contain enough heavy elements. Also, these stars have high UV radiation and winds that could photoevaporate the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements.[82] For comparison, Neptune's mass equals 17 Earth masses, Jupiter has 318 Earth masses, and the 13 Jupiter-mass limit used in the IAU's working definition of an exoplanet equals approximately 4000 Earth masses</p>
