			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much. This was great. </p>
<p>I feel like I'd like Post-Postmodernism. I'm taking two fine art courses right now (screenwriting and horror lit) to finish my gen eds, and we focus on a lot of postmodern works (hence me asking the question of what exactly it is; my professors never explained it). And I agree that postmodernism is a bit too cynical for my taste. But then again, I do really enjoy deconstructions of tropes. ASOIAF is one of my favorite book series, and I love Scream (the examples given by another commenter). I just dislike the overbearing cynicism and relativism and rejection of all objectivity that seems to embody postmodernism (and like a little cynicism is okay. I enjoyed No Country for Old Men in my lit course. And Gatsby's my favorite book and also pretty cynical, although I know it's a modernist work instead of postmodern). Idk, I find art and literature and beliefs that I like and dislike in all the movements, I guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it can definitely be a breath of fresh air -- though it does have its own share of cynicism, since it's very much an Internet-era, post-9/11 kind of cultural moment. I tend to see postpostmodernism not as a blanket rejection of all the things postmodernism said; that'd be reactionary. It's more like... the postmodernists saw all these problems, and when they saw them, they just threw up their hands and said &quot;well, shit! Guess the most we can do is make a joke out of it.&quot;</p>
<p>The postpostmodernists acknowledge the same problems, but actually have a go at trying to tackle some of them. Even if it's ultimately impossible, the intention behind it is valuable, IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Postmodernism seems to me a dangerous recursive trap that not even DFW was able to escape. From reading much of all I could find about his life, it seems he would agree with that criticism(I was surprised to read that much of the anxiety and depression in his later life that led him to suicide was a result of his worrying that HE couldn't write the novel he knew needed to be written. A novel about the repetitive and soul-crushing work humans must do to survive but do so in silence) Do you think HE was incapable of writing that novel or do you think postmodernism has a certain quality that is hard to &quot;overthrow&quot;?( namely self-consciousness and idk cynicism?) I have just recently started reading big boy books and am glad to learn more. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I think it's probably impossible to ever cast it off completely. And if it's to be done, it isn't be people like DFW -- it'll be by people who don't know what postmodernism is, have never even heard the word before. In any case, even if it's impossible, the attempt is valiant. We must imagine Sisyphus happy.</p></div>		</li>
