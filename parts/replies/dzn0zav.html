			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait I thought mentos cause it to fizz a lot because of a chemical reaction due to the acidic soda and the basic mint. But thanks for the answer. It makes sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the other half of the reason why it's such a violent release of foamy soda.</p>
<p>If you where to just put the ingredients in without the pitting mentioned it would still foam up, just not as big.</p>
<p>The bigger surface area mentioned allows not only to release the gas in the soda, but allows more of the reaction to happen at once.  Giving you a lot more bang for your buck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is any chemical reaction, it's pretty minimal and gets lost in the physical reaction or the carbonation.</p>
<p>Easy way to test: Pound a Mentos into dust and add enough water to make a paste. Let it sit while you open a bottle of soda and do various things to make it go flat. (Shake, open, close, repeat. A little bit of sand. Pour from one container to another. Heat it up.) Pour the Mentos mud into the flat soda and see what happens.</p></div>		</li>
