			<div class="markdown"><p>Much like how a cold drink outside on a summer day collects water, the evaporator coil in the air conditioner also collects water from the air as it cools your house. Because the coil is colder than what is called the &quot;Dew Point&quot;, the humidity in the air collects into water droplets. That water is what you are seeing drain from the unit. The same action occurs with nearly all forms of air conditioning including houses, cars, and even portable devices. </p>
<p>If you wish to learn more, YouTube has many videos on the subject and many aren't too technical to understand as a beginner! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting, this is why air conditioners in low humidity regions won't produce a lot of water, because there's very little of it in the atmosphere being cooled. Whereas air conditioners in max humidity regions seem to be portable shower units. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you make air cold, it holds less water vapor. So that vapor condenses into liquid water on the cold surface, like on the outside of a glass filled with a cold drink. </p>
<p>An air conditioner runs warm air over a cold surface to cool it, and some of the water vapor in that warm air condenses on that surface as it is cooled, and has to be removed (by dripping out of the air conditioner). </p>
<p>On a window unit, that usually just drips right out of the unit onto the ground. </p>
<p>Central air units also drip, but since the cold part is inside the house, often in the furnace in the basement, those drips usually run into a pump that pumps the water to a drain or a pipe running to the outside of the house. </p>
<p>In your car, it drips out the bottom of your the engine compartment (where the &quot;cold thing&quot; is onto the pavement. You can often see those water spots in parking lots on a hot day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dripping is the same reason your glass of ice water becomes wet with condensation after a little while. The coldness from the evaporator coil causes water vapor or humidity in the air to condense and collect on the coil. As more accumulates, it drips off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're almost right. The &quot;evil wizard&quot; is actually the frost pixies father, who wants nothing more than to bond with the pixie, and train her to one day take over his HVAC business. Naturally, she rebels against this. Wanting, instead, to be more like her sexually adventurous older sister, Kate. The &quot;evil Wizard&quot;, Bob Vance, knows she will one day leave as well, and that's why he drinks so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wish you didn't say &quot;creates&quot; heat... It doesn't, the heat/energy is all in there, it's compressed &amp; the temperature rises which makes rejecting the heat to the hot outside air possible.</p>
<p>Inside (evap coil) it's expanded and the temperature drops allowing it to readily absorb heat/energy.</p>
<p>Great explanation regardless.</p></div>		</li>
