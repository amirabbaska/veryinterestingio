			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also a plot point in Jurassic Park 3. IIRC Alan Grant creates a mold of a velociraptor nasal cavity and later blows into it to try and communicate with the living velociraptors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this similar to that Jurassic Park movie where they recreated the voice box( I don't remember the name of the part) from a dinosaur and blew through it to recreate the sound, but they would factor in for the soft tissue that would have been present, nasal cavities, and modern animals with similar structures?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. It's far from perfect, but in some cases it can work quite well. While it used to be thought that dinos weren't as diverse as mammals have become, it is looking more and more like there were many different types. So maybe some roared and maybe some growled and maybe some peeped or twittered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's really cool. would it be possible that certain types of dinosaurs had better chances of becoming fossilized(either body composition, or the areas that they roamed)? follow up, is it possible that some types of dinosaurs never ended up becoming fossilized?</p></div>		</li>
