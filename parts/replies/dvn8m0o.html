			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you maybe confusing radiation and contamination.  Radiation you can get from the sun or an x-ray.  Contamination is radioactive material.  Walking around in a nuclear power plant and you can get a tiny dose of radiation, but you probably won't get contamination.  And if you do it's not like you get to stroll off site you have to greet it off, even if it means losing your pants.  </p></div>		</li>
