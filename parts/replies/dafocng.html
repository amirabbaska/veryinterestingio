			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly recommend &quot;<a href="http://www.voidtools.com" target="_blank">Everything</a>&quot;. It indexes all the files of your drive (just the filenames, not the contents) and lets you find files realllly quick. Its database is only a few MB's, and the search results are instantaneous, and can work with regex and such.</p>
<p>It really puts Windows Search to shame. Windows Search does attempt to index the contents of the files too, though, but it usually fails miserably and leaves you with a ~20GB useless database.</p>
<p>Edit: and it's free</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it's a good idea to turn this off for ssd based drives as it lowers life and costs in storage.</p>
<p>Don't fret it's automagically disabled if you have windows 10</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you wanted, you could build a highly optimize database of your hard drive's contents</p>

<p>This is built into Windows, but has always been catastrophically poorly programmed. Not only is it generally hyper redundant, it seems to intentionally only do indexing when you're actually actively using the computer (pretty much the opposite of ideal).</p>
<p>There have been a number of fantastic alternative programs to do this over the years. The indexes are tiny, processing is efficient and out of the way, etc. But this notion that Windows Search would beat them all killed the market, leaving a garbage solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad someone else remembers that. It was so handy and I was really upset when they discontinued it. Although I seem to remember disabling the hard drive in results feature in favour of a local search.</p></div>		</li>
