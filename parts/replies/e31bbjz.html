			<div class="markdown"><p>I met a physical therapist that had moved into research and he said that basically everything he learned in school was just &quot;passed on&quot; and that no one really had any idea if treatments actually worked, if patient improvement was a collateral effect (e.g. simply due to movement needed for the &quot;treatment&quot;) or if it was just placebo.</p>
<p>Now I'm not sure who to trust when it comes to this type of stuff. :[</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those same body builders will also tell you that it's basically medicinal torture. For your muscle groups to actually receive benefit from a massage it's going to hurt a lot.</p></div>		</li>

From the time I was 11, I helped her each time she came home like that by kneading her muscles firmly but gently until my hands were tired. She would fall asleep, and woke up feeling much better. </p>
<p>I'd never had any training, but I knew what worked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, sometimes you just know. Several people here say the knots are a theory or possible placebo. Makes no sense to me. I have constant knots in my back, I can feel them, and I have to rub them a certain way to get the pain to stop. The amount of good even a simple rub can do for muscle fibers or headaches is quite incredible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think people are denying that it doesn't work. 100% in a lot of cases massage or pressure in those areas can help alleviate pain and increase movement. </p>
<p>There are just so many unanswered questions with regards to trigger points.
Such as why:
People with and without pain have them, people even after having being treated with trigger point therapy still have trigger points, people, why even though the tensile forces of adhesions and scar tissue far outweigh any mechanical force the human body can provide that we are able to increase ROM of said tissue?</p>
<p>The list goes on and on</p>
<p>Now the thing that may come to mind is, if it works then why does it matter?</p>
<p>In my opinion, it doesn't. But we are practising a science (health science) to be precise. And just like how people back then wanted to know if the earth is round or flat, people want to know what trigger points are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I later devised, from an elementary knowledge of dyslexia, a simple test and a method of teaching severely dyslexic students, including an adult. The fact that I worked one-on-one, and so could tell quickly what worked and what didn't, helped me develop these methods over time. </p>
<p>Edit: I must add that at no time did I present myself as an expert on dyslexia. Several students came to me, whom I realized were dyslexic, and I set out to help them. If I couldn't, I would have referred them to someone who could. The parents of one girl, who was 9 and reading at a grade level of 1.5, knew she was dyslexic and didn't tell me. I guess they wanted to see if I could tell. </p>
<p>Every one of these students was intelligent, and learned quickly. They even used my methods to continue improving after I was no longer tutoring them.  Dyslexia is a disorder of the brain, not the mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Source: I am a physical therapist so I have working knowledge in this area but am by no means an expert. </p>
<p>There is some new(ish) evidence and techniques regarding “knots”. The theory that makes the most since is that microtears in the muscles cause an inflammatory response. The inflammatory response results in hypersensitive motor units is the areas, resulting in the motor units being “always on” and forming an area of tightness that we call knots. </p>
<p>As far as treatment goes, I’ve had great success with my patients when using dry needling. It is an extremely thin needle (sometimes you don’t even feel it) that goes directly into the “knot” and sends pulses of electricity. These pulses fatigue the motor units within a few minutes, lessening their sensitivity and allowing them to “turn off” Even stubborn knots ease within a few hours. I would definitely recommend finding a local physical therapist who dry needles if you have trouble with knots</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you can! Idea should be to dry needle, and then work out w/ proper form with your improved mobility. Eventually that tight muscle will relax, but it needs other muscles helping it out more so that it can do that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense, yes, but it’s tricky. The most effective way to get rid of a knot is to completely fatigue the small area of muscle involved without putting so much stress in the surrounding muscles that it causes more knots to form. This is why prior to needling, stretching and massage were a PT’s most effective tools in treating knots, but those techniques take multiple sessions for stubborn areas</p></div>		</li>
