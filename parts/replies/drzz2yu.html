			<div class="markdown"><p>I switched to an auto a couple of years back, my last job had me doing on average 40k miles per year, it's simply not worth the hassle of having a manual when doing silly miles.</p>
<p>With that said, I wouldn't switch back to manual from a decent automatic. The zf8hp gearbox is really slick,I have manual control when I feel I want it and the rest of the time I don't move my left leg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I loved driving stick but my latest car is automatic and it's great! Why? I mainly use my car to commute and I just have a lot of traffic. Stop and Go and that stuff and automatic is just so relaxing in these situations.</p>
<p>The only time I miss driving stick? Hitting the passes in Switzerland but hey I can still shift manually if I want to</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you didn't switch because you're lazy as the previous comment states.. You probably evaluated the fun/effort/comfort triangle and made the right decision :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's so relaxing that I had to fight not falling asleep at the wheel that one time I had to borrow an automatic to drive to work in stop and go traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't driven a manual since I got my license about 10 years ago. I went straight to automatic because I live in London and quite simply could not be bothered with all the faff. I tried to drive manual recently and my brain just said no. I just don't get it at all and I don't get how I used to know this cos it seems so foreign now. Makes me a bit sad but I'm too lazy to relearn lol. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I have tried both handwashing clothes and throwing them in a washing machine, <em>and find that the washing machine makes me lazy; you have to do so little to actually wash the clothes!</em></p></div>		</li>
