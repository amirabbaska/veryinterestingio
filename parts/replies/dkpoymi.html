			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this absolutely happens.  Degrees of freedom &quot;freeze out&quot; as you lower the temperature of something.  An example might be the &quot;oscillatory&quot; (i.e. spring-like) degree of freedom in the bond between the two atoms in a diatomic molecule.  That excitations of that bond are quantized and thus if the average thermal energy is below that the specific heat reduces accordingly and you expect something like this:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes absolutely. The important thing here is the density of states, telling us essentially how available certain states are to electrons for a given energy/momentum. This changes as we change number of dimensions. The exact effect for quantum gases is finicky to calculate, but in the classical (high temperature/low density) limit, the equipartition theorem tells us that we get k/2 heat capacity for each quadratic term in the energy. </p>
<p>So, in 3D, a free particle has 3 directions it can move it, so a heat capacity of (3/2)k, while in 2D, a free particle has only 2 independent directions, so the heat capacity will just be k. </p></div>		</li>
