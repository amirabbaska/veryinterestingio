			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, they can't occur any more</p>
<p>The reason is that the natural enrichment of Uranium (percent content of fissile isotopes, mainly Uranium-235) used to be much higher, but the fissile isotopes have a shorter half life than others (mainly Uranium-238). The enrichment is now too low for naturally occurring ores to start a chain reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the water (which serves as the moderator) had suddenly more dissolved oxygen(great oxygenation event), which increased uranium solubility and enrichment to a point where fission could kick off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When did the enrichment become too low, and why does all of the uranium lose enrichment at the same time? Sorry for all the questions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup in Oklo, Gabon it happened at like 16 sites and the reactions were self moderating on a reasonably fast cycle. We only discovered it because some french scientists were worried about isotopes of uranium that were missing, but the isotopic signatures point to fission byproducts.</p></div>		</li>
