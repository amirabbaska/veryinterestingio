			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! ELI5 is one of my favorite subs since I learn so much about things I never thought to ask. I’ve never seen a question that simultaneously (1) was a worthwhile question, (2) hadn’t really been answered, and (3) I KNOW THIS ONE!! </p>
<p>Fun fact: I now live in India, and there are no prices posted on signs, so it seems the man with the sign was not from around here.</p>
<p>Happy gas purchasing!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree — and I learn something by responding to an ELI5 on a subject I know, because it demands complete understanding that can’t be glossed over with fancy technical jargon.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman was once asked to give a freshman lecture on a specific aspect of quantum spin theory. Two weeks later, he politely declined, saying (paraphrase) “I can’t come up with a freshman-level lecture on this topic, which means I don’t sufficiently understand it.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second the bit about Buc-ee's. They manage to have high quality gas, super clean restrooms, all kinds of food and drink, and they pay a minimum wage of something like $12 per hour</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to look at it from their point of view.  Just the ice to fill you cup, costs more then using their cup and filling it up with just soda.  So you're asking to use the most expensive part of selling drinks, for free.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Light at the end of the tunnel: check out Buc-ee’s. I don’t know how widespread they are, but they are all over Texas and they will change what you think about gas stations.</p>

<p>For my wife, that was Quick Trip's or QT's that did that. We live in a vacuum of them, but when we go out of town, they're always our go-to for food and gas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know, right?! They have little pamphlets in their stores saying you can call or write in to request a QT in your area. I'm considering getting a bunch of people to spam them until they open one around my city. You wanna talk about places I'm willing to drive a bit across town to get gas from? Yes? Yes.</p></div>		</li>
