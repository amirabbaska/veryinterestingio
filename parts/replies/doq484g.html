			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to say this. Basically, the heavy/light molecules behave typically nearly indistinguishably with regards to chromatography and mass spec analysis (QQQ, ToF and Ion/Orbitraps are the ones I'm most familiar with). </p>
<p>I was at a conference recently and heard someone talking about using heavy compounds for experiments (SILAC, KAYAK, Protein Turnover) and that it may have an impact on the biology of the system. Here's an <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/36/11247.full" target="_blank">article</a> talking about how heavy isotopes reduce enzyme catalytic site chemistry rates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. If you use 13C or 15N for metabolic labeling (SILAC), there is not chromatographic shift between unlabeled and labeled peptides. But if you use 2H such as dimethyl labeling, for most part, there is little shift. but the overall chromatographic shift in the sample already made it not as reliable as metabolic labeling. That's why people rather do label-free than dimethyl labeling.</p></div>		</li>
