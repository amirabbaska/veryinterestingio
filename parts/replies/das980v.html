			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the previous comment, it's worth noting that the US actually has a significantly higher percentage of young people living at home than much of western Europe.</p>
<p>I can't get my hands on the stats for 25-34, but 32% of American 18-34 year olds live with their parents, <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/24/in-the-u-s-and-abroad-more-young-adults-are-living-with-their-parents/" target="_blank">compared to 19% in Denmark</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That probably wasn't anywhere near as high as 32% in America up until after the meltdown of 2008. I know a huge number of my peers around that time were hit pretty hard and had to move back in with family after being independent for some time, myself included. It took a few years to get back to independence, I've no doubt that some still haven't managed, and many of the people who came of age after that point have not been able to take that first step out yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any idea why the Scandinavians have the lowest percentage of all Europe? I'm guessing there's an economical explanation but I'm not sure there's all there is to it.</p></div>		</li>
