			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm having trouble understanding this.  On a flat surface it makes sense, like the bowling example.  But on a sloped surface, the ball is not contacting the surface in the exact centre.  So wouldn't the side with more mass want to roll faster?</p>
<p>\o  For example the right side of that ball would..... shit nevermind, I just remembered everything falls at the same rate no matter how heavy it is.  Assuming no air resistance/friction in this experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is that the reaction force of the ball against the surface fighting gravity will be perpendicular to the surface and if the ball is perfectly round then this force will act through the centre of mass. As such it will not generate a torque. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wouldn't there be really tiny amount of torque because the top half of the ball is slightly lighter than the bottom half and thus the center of gravity is ever so slightly under the center of the ball, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a discussion further down the thread I want to copy again here. Speaking as an engineer (not a physicist) this answer is not correct unless you make more assumptions about the material, namely that it is completely inflexible and impervious to any sort of damage. A normal material would be damaged sliding down the slope, this has nothing to do with friction and would be a function of the momentum of the ball creating forces against it while interacting with the surrounding surface. As a thought experiment imagine you take your frictionless ball and drop it from 100 feet high directly onto the pavement. What happens to it? Well that is the question, because any normal material would be damaged. It would have a big dent probably, maybe some cracks, scratches, etc. Again, this has zero to do with friction. So if you assume this ball would be damaged from something like this then it stands to reason that when it is sliding and bouncing down a rocky slope it will also be damaged, maybe not as much but it would still get some scratches and dings probably. These imperfections then would serve as contact points where the ball would be rotated when a force is applied. The only way this doesn't happen is if you assume your ball is completely inflexible and impervious to any sort of damage. You could also assume your slope is absolutely smooth and so cannot damage the ball, though I'm not certain this would work exactly.</p></div>		</li>
