<p>70, that is pretty impressive. My best is 112, but that is while playing on my smartphone (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itbenefit.android.Minesweeper" target="_blank">Minesweeper Classic</a> for Android), and without guessing until forced to.</p>

<p>Yeah, the calculations definitely are not simple. Sometimes you can take a guess at a tile that has a slightly higher risk of being a mine, but in turn it could give you more information about the location of other mines. Solving Minesweeper completely seems unlikely in the near future from my layman's point of view - too many iterations are needed, and too many options are available for each of those at a glance.</p></div>		</li>
