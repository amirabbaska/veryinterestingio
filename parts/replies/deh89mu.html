<p>Edit1: long post will highlight(in bold) important items in it</p>
<p>Edit2: i didn't touch on political issues because that would be a thesis by itself.</p>
<p>I have decided to post as a response to this comment because I would like to counter some of the arguments that you raised. Coming from having an economics background as well as lived in africa for about 17 years(in an area that is known to have developed sickle cell anemia as an adaptive response to malaria), the whole geographical/disease theory pretty much downplays the main reason why Africa does so poorly. </p>
<p>First of all, It's understandable that Africa has a whole range of climates. We range from Mediterranean to an Equatorial climate and there are significant changes as you move towards the equator. At the Equator, its largely warm and changes are relatively +-20 degrees(US scale). One of the main reasons, Europeans could not come to Africa during their voyages was(at the time) their boats could not handle the waves and the presence of diseases. Malaria was a big issue in the 19th and 20th century and in fact it really inflicted loses among kids (hence why Africans tend to have big families). However towards the end of the 20th century malaria medication started becoming relatively cheap. Literally, you could go to the shops and buy a Malariaquin tablet if you suspected that you had malaria(without prescription). </p>
<p>The main problem with geography doesn't lie with diseases or tech. It is mostly 2 things:</p>
<p>1) <strong>A country is landlocked (As you had mentioned before).</strong> Trade is impossible and the country has to proxy out trade through another country. A good example of this is Uganda. Kenya being a neighbour is relatively way weathier than Uganda because they are right next to the indian ocean. For trade to occur in uganda, they have to go through Kenya and even though they have tried creating trade blocks, it's still expensive.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Climate.</strong> This Affects countries that are tropical. Am talking about the North Eastern side(Nigeria, Senegal {most french speaking nations before you get to Algeria, morrocco and the like}). It gets bloody hot and muggy in those nations and honestly sometimes not much -in terms of work- goes on. Am talking about the muggy feeling where if you walk out, your body is covered in sweat within 5 mins. What happens is that most people will often work for 6 hours in a day and the rest of the day they don't do anything because of the heat. A friend ordered a beer from a vendor while visiting nigeria and within a minute the beer was pretty much room temp(from refrigeration).</p>
<p>The problem Africa has is not a Geographical one but more of a socio-political one. Let me just list a few down:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Cultural problems</strong>. Africa has a shit tonne of Tribes. For instance in kenya, i can count atleast 12 different tribes. They are all classified into 3 categories. Bantu, Nilotes and Semites. Here is the problem with this, when you mix in different cultures in a pot trouble is bound to start. One tribe thinks they are the chosen tribe and the other tribe thinks the same thing. In the process you get what i call &quot;soft issues&quot;(Nepotism, Favoritism etc). Nepotism in Africa is a huge problem. Am talking about the issues where someone will be promoted without any credentials just because his boss speaks the same dialect as he does. This guy goes into office, fucks everything up and then is transferred to another office or promoted. </p>
<p>2) <strong>Older people do not want to give younger people a chance. If you think that the unemployed youth in the united states is a problem, wait until you go to Africa</strong>. You have to understand some things. For one, there is absolutely no structure of accountability like a social security program there. Loans are extremely high risk and bankers usually don't want to give them out unless you have alot of money in your bank account. For instance, if you needed a loan you would have to print out your bank statements and your salary plus your employer would have to send a letter saying that &quot;until the loan is paid, the sum required every month will be deducted from your salary to the bank&quot;. There is a middle class but vertical upward movement between classes is very difficult.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Brain drain</strong>. I am a very good example of this. Moving to a first world country because i will be treated with some sort of equality amongst everyone else. In Africa, young people are told &quot;wait, it's not your turn yet&quot;(i kid you not there is a swahili proverb that translates to moving slow in life). So young people move to Europe (Norway specifically) because they know that they may be able to atleast get a shot at school and work. Once they complete school, they feel indebted to their host country and work for majority of their careers then they move back to Africa to retire and become a CEO. And the cycle continues.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post, just wanted to clear up some stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, you can cite cultural issues, but those come down to poor governance and lack of institutions, and a few of the things you cite here are symptoms and not causes. I will explain:</p>
<p>Rome had way, way more diversity than any nation in Africa does today. Didn't matter, still prospered. Why? They had institutions to lubricate those differences. Specifically: the Roman Army. In this case. Now, that might not work in the modern world because you can't parade around invading all your neighbors. But <em>other</em> institutions can be made to lubricate social frictions.</p>
<p>Next: unemployment is a symptom, not a cause. Why is there unemployment? Especially among youth?</p>
<p>Well, many reasons. Most importantly you have high birth rates. Incredibly high birth rates. You can't multiply population by three in a generation (six children per couple was the case in many nations until the 1980s), and expect the economy to grow enough for those people to have work by the time they're 25. Economies don't grow by 300% every 25 years. </p>
<p>Also, you've touched on one, which I also mentioned. <strong>Bad governance</strong>. Nepotism is bad governance. Are you under the impression that diversity causes nepotism? It doesn't. Germany was as diverse as any African nation is today in terms of regionalisms. The United States is more diverse. Nepotism is not <em>caused by</em> diversity.</p>
<p>Nepotism is caused by bad governance. By a lack of proper incentives. Perhaps by an unarmed populace (I said it). Perhaps the leaders that continually take and give bribes need to have the proper incentives put in their face. Perhaps that incentive is a gun. </p>
<p>Brain drain is again a symptom. People move away because there are structural issues that do not allow for opportunity. There is not foreign investment (a multinational firm that could, would open a firm in the nation with cheaper labor if they felt it was profitable. Why isn't it profitable? Probably partially due to the nepotism. Due to the unclear nature of laws and terrible enforcement of them).</p>
<p>Good governance is rare in human history. But when it happens, it changes lives for generations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy's got it down. Also took developmental econ. I respectfully disagree with the intuitive part. There's quite a lot of debate on the path towards prosperity. eg. whether autocracy is better for development. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is debate but I personally disagree with a lot of that debate. That's just me. I feel that people overcomplicate it. In my opinion the form of government is irrelevant. Both an autocracy and a democracy <em>can</em> work for development. As long as the people living under that regime support it and trust it, and feel safe and that they can have faith that their dealings with their neighbors are enforceable with the state.</p></div>		</li>
