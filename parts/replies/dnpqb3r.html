			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, some species beyond the dripline <em>do</em> live for quite a long time, even orders of magnitude longer than the timescale necessary to form an atom (~ 10^(-14) seconds).</p>
<p>A few long-lived unbound nuclides on the proton-rich side have been found. It's harder to do on the neutron-rich side, but some candidates have been identified.</p>
<p>For example, iron-45, a two-proton emitter, has a half-life of over 2 milliseconds. That's comparable to the lifetime of a bound particle inside the dripline, which decays by beta emission. Many orders of magnitude larger than what you'd expect for an unbound nuclide.</p></div>		</li>
