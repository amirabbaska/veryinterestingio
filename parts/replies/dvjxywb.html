			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason to go to space is that you don't need to &quot;build arms&quot;. You simply launch multiple satellites shooting lasers at each other (lookup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna" target="_blank">LISA</a>).</p>
<p>This would allow us to have &quot;arms&quot; with millions of km of length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You still get some ambiguity (similar to the two two-arm interferometers of LIGO alone).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_Observer" target="_blank">Big Bang Observer</a> is a proposed array of four triangle-shaped interferometers in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all the information, with one detector you are still massively limited in terms of source direction. To see this, imagine our 3 armed detector in space. If you imagine a GW event in the exact direction of one of the arms, you would have no way of telling whether this event happened above or below your detector (because one of your arms is redundant in this case). And you would still have degeneracies between polarisation and position, and even certain polarisation and direction combinations would pass entirely through the detector without triggering a signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you expand on why you can only have arms on the same plane ? Is it because the laser would change in frequency due to the change in the gravitational field if it went straight down for example ?</p></div>		</li>
