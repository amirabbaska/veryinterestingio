			<div class="markdown"><p>Take the example of the tethered bead. At any moment in time, the bead is moving perpendicular to the string. In order to maintain a circular path and proper trajectory the bead must consistently accelerate toward the center of the circle.</p>
<p>Now imagine the circle as a large tube. To an object on the surface of the tube, the surface of the tube is always accelerating toward it (like gravity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All right, think about what happens when the older kid spinning you around lets you go. Suddenly the force that is keeping you spinning in a circle isn't there anymore, and you go flying away from that kid.</p>
<p>If you spin a circle around in space, the floor of that circle is the force that is keeping you from flying off in a straight direction. It is doing the same thing that the older kids hands were. It is holding you in the circle despite the fact that your body wants to go in a straight line because of inertia. And the straight-line would send you away from the circle, and thus down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put a bead on a string.  If you spin the string, the bead will slide along to the end and eventually off the string.  If you tie a knot, the bead will slide until the knot stops it.  That same principal is what artificial gravity is working on.  The force of the spin keeps the object at the end of the string.  (Kind of)</p></div>		</li>
