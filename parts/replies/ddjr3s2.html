<p>They have already tried to repeal those laws in congress to support the president, is that not against the law in itself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Repealing a law is not against the law - that would just be counterproductive, right?  The whole point of a legislature is to update and change laws as needed.  If you could write a law that says &quot;this cannot be changed ever,&quot; there's a lot of harm that sort of thing could do down the line.</p>
<p>That being said, Congress set a dangerous precedent last year by delaying a replacement for Justice Scalia, basically stating &quot;party unity trumps the spirit of the law anywhere we can make an argument for it.&quot;  We can see that in full effect now, as well.  </p></div>		</li>
