			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst this is true it doesn’t really answer the question. I don’t believe OP was looking for how the quality of hunting techniques improves over generations or how prey fish manage to become better at escaping every year. </p>
<p>OP wants to know specifically how do deep sea fish, that live in total darkness anyway, get attracted to the light of an angler fish. Light isn’t something they interact with and is something many of them can’t even detect, so how does it work? </p>
<p>It’s like someone trying to capture humans through a trap made from ultraviolet light - we wouldn’t be able to see it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That whole premise is wrong since <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_fish" target="_blank">More than 50% of deep-sea fish as well as some species of shrimp and squid are capable of bioluminescence.</a>. A lot of deep sea species can see that light and either associate it with food or a potential mate. That is why they are attracted to the light</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THAT is the answer OP was looking for - they (and me) were previously unaware that deep-sea fish could see at all, so the idea of a glowing lure was useless in our heads. Now we know that deep sea fish aren’t blind the idea of a glowing lure makes more sense.</p>
<p>‘The whole premise’ was the thing OP was questioning, and you just solved it :) </p></div>		</li>

<p>Some fish might be able to detect it and some might not, but the illicium doesn't have to be an effective lure for all fish in the sea, just for enough to keep the angler alive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s the question OP is asking - considering that deep sea dish don’t use light, are all the fish that ARE attracted to the illicium from higher up in the sea? Or are the blind fish from the depths somehow ‘seeing’ the angler fish’s light?</p>
<p>I believe someone answered it below this comment </p></div>		</li>
