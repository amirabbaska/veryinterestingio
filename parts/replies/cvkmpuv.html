			<div class="markdown"><p>It's quite expensive ~ $1100 a liter. Considering you need to replace about half of the water in a person's body ~25 l for a fatal dose, you would need a lot of money and virtually complete control over everything they ate and drank</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This could be extremely detectable; all you would have to do is run it through an instrument called an NMR (it's complicated, but basically, if you shoot radio waves at a nucleus, it shoots radio waves back after a while). D2O does not show up on the NMR, so you would notice that the person has half the water he otherwise should have in any given sample.</p>
<p>Now, the question is why you're running NMR for cause of death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, but to also be nitpicky it might be better to compare heavy water in the body to a heavier weight oil rather than fuel since we don't get energy (ATP) from water. </p></div>		</li>
