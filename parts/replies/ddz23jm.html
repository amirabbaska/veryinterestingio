			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding onto that, most motherboards have a switch circuit that when completed sends specific instructions to the motherboard to initiate a restart operation.</p>
<p>There are a couple circuits on motherboards that give specific instruction to the rest of the motherboard to initiate a boot and reset. Those circuits are normally open, or incomplete but <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=case+button+prong+motherboard&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd9p73r5_SAhWKllQKHZDABb0Q_AUICSgC&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=797#imgrc=yKq4BlOb35j9rM:" target="_blank">end in a series of prongs that attach to special buttons that attach to the front of the computer case</a>. Press button to complete the circuit and activate the boot/reset command on the motherboard. </p>
<p>When building a PC and I want to test the motherboard, I usually actually activate these circuits by tapping the two leads with a screwdriver to activate the boot/reset command circuit.</p>
<p>Some motherboards, and especially ones in your phone combine these functions into one button that tell the motherboard to perform boot/reset cycles based on how long you hold a certain button down. Some motherboards also add functions that send a command to the operating system instead to perform a certain action. For example pressing power on a laptop usually actually only sends a signal to the operating system to activate the OS's sleep or hibernate function and must be held down longer for the motherboard to actually activate the power off/reset actions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The same mechanism: with newer computers (newer than, say, 1990), the power supply always provides power to the motherboard. On the motherboard sits a firmware chip (either a classic BIOS or a newer EFI-style thing) which is also powered on whenever the PC has a power connection. That firmware chip is running software which can decide to power on the computer when certain events occur. The most obvious event is you pressing the power button, but it can also be a 'power applied' event (which of course always fires when the firmware chip starts up.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forgot to check my current motherboard when I installed it almost a year ago, but does that mean modern ones don't have the little watch battery? I always (as in long after 1990) thought that was how the BIOS could keep track of time and listen to wake-up signals over network.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: you can program it to do anything as long as the code fits in the memory. </p>
<p>Long ago now, friend had just gotten some kind of apple laptop, one of the first to have EFI. Said, &quot;want to see something cool?&quot; and flashed it with a version of Pong. If the computer was plugged in, you were playing pong. That's it. </p>
<p>He gave the most uncomfortable laugh and insisted I immediately change it back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At work, I was forced to set the computer to always boot up with power from BIOS, because some ass would shut it off on the next shift and I could not access it from home.  They are always supposed to be left on for mass corporate updates.  I assume at your school, the IT can always have remote access for issues or updates if they are kept in that state.</p></div>		</li>
