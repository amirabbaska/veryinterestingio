			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally agree with your reflex theory. Which really comes into play in the U.S., anually of the ~30,000 people killed by guns every year, +20,000 are suicides. You want to talk about something that can be done quickly, without proper thought, think about being able to end it all with the flex of a finger muscle. And also like you said less then 10% of those that fail at suicide ever try again, unfortunately guns have ~90% success rate (and those that survive are usually horribly scarred or mentally disabled) compare that to the next highest successful method, hanging, at &lt;70% success rate. Im a gun owner, and I love the sport but I think there needs to be better steps to protect those that are suicidal. The best you can do is  please if you know someone who just hasn't been acting right lately just reach out and just talk to them, and even more importantly listen, and suicidal people won't always just seem &quot;blue&quot; sometimes you might notice the opposite, manic behavior can be just as concerning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an impressive post. It's both clinical and anecdotal. Nicely done. </p>
<p>I like how you explain the impulse motivation behind suicide, and how having energy from antidepressants can suddenly give a person an urge to commit whereas they were too apathetic beforehand. This is one of the reasons I'll probably never take antidepressants.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then that's a bad reason.</p>
<p>See a psychologist or therapist and do what they tell you. Stop creating excuses to avoid helping yourself. </p>
<p>People with depression often find any excuse to avoid proper treatment. One of the most common side effects of depression is a feeling of having the veil lifted off of reality, and you begin to believe you can see the world in a way others can't; and if they saw it like you then they'd be the same. </p>
<p>This is not the case. This is the depression and this is you avoiding helping yourself. </p>
<p>Listen to your medical professionals and realise that more people commit suicide because of depression than those that do from anti depressants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, it's not so much an excuse as it is a reason. I've attempted twice in the past, and by some stroke of luck (or misfortune, whichever you prefer) I survived both times. I've never given up the idea of suicide, try as I might, and ultimately it will be the thing that does me in. I 'make an excuse' to not take antidepressants because I know it'll give me exactly what I need to make one final attempt.</p>
<p>I'm also very aware of the sensation you talk about in your comment. I've experienced it and just about every other symptom in the last 15 years of my little MDD adventure. </p>
<p>I thank you for your comment of concern and advice (if that was the intent?). Unfortunately, not everyone can afford professional help :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on antidepressants and antianxiety meds,  and when life takes a wrong turn its the first thing my brain thinks of. Often the idea that if medicine can't even help, nothing will. Sometimes I can fend off the thoughts by setting a distant goal (such as when I was really lonely and having thoughts, I told myself if I'm not married by  30 I'll do it. I'm 32 now and engaged) Right now my deal is that I tell myself that no matter how bad thongs get, i can't do it while my mom is still alive (she's 62). She's the person I love the most in this world and i cant leave her. Hopefully things will improve before then, cuz when she does pass I don't know what will happen. </p></div>		</li>
