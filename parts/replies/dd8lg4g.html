			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever heard that, from the photon's perspective, it arrives as soon as it leaves? No time passes for an object traveling at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Due to time dilation, a person traveling at the speed of light for one year would experience absolutely no passage of time whatsoever. The year passes from our perspective as normal, so we get a year older. The traveler hasn't aged a second in that time.</p>
<p>If the travel is slowed down slightly, so that it's not all the way to light speed, some time will pass for the traveler in his own reference frame. It could take only one hour from his perspective to travel the distance we see. From our reference frame, the year passes as normal. </p>
<p>So OP's question is, since the frame of reference is only one hour for the traveler, but he crosses a year's worth of distance from our frame of reference, which reference frame accurately depicts the amount of radiation he would absorb? </p>
<p>The answer is that, despite moving faster, the traveler still travels through the same amount of material, so it would be a &quot;year's&quot; worth of radiation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Time and space are the same thing.  If you move through space you stop moving through time as much, if you stop moving completely you'll go through time faster.  Gravity also affects time because it also affects space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually on their journey they will have to accelerate up to or close to light speed at first, then after the journey nears completion they will have to turn over to decelerate the rest of the way in braking mode. For the traveler it would probably seem that they go &quot;pedal to the metal&quot; till they reached the target speed, then turn over and &quot;Stand on the break pedal&quot; until they arrive.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>If they had heard it, they should forget about it because photon does not have perspective since there is no frame of reference in which photon is stationary.</p>
<p>This may seem like nitpicking, but it is in the core of special theory of relativity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then let's determine how fast he's going. t=t'/√(1-v^(2)/c^(2))</p>
<p>It's stated that the ratio t'/t is 1 hr / (1 yr), or ~1/(365.25×24)=1/8766.</p>
<p>That means that √(1-v^(2)/c^(2))=1/8766 approximately, or</p>
<p>1-v^(2)/c^(2)≈1.3×10^(-8)
v^(2)/c^(2)≈1-1.3×10^(-8)</p>
<p>and so by the fact that √(1+x)≈1+(1/2)x near 1,</p>
<p>v/c≈1-6.5×10^(-9).</p>
<p>Thus the astronaut was traveling at 99.99999935% the speed of light.</p>

<p>re-explain this question? A ship travels at light speed for a year (so it travels a light year), yet the time inside the ship has only been one hour?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That ship travels a light year <em>as we measure it.</em> Remember that when the astronaut measures that distance, it seems like just a light-hour.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is helpful to remember that (and this is just a formalism, but it's a useful anchor) photons experience no time at all. Something traveling at fully the speed of light would report that no time has occurred and no distance was travelled.</p>
<p>Of course, photons aren't really fully <em>things,</em> and it's impossible for matter to travel at their speed. But (according to what physicists currently believe to be true) it's perfectly reasonable to assume that it's possible for a person to travel at 99.99999935% the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also means that if you accelerated to the speed that that astronaut is going, say, on a journey to the edge of the Milky Way (which is 22000 light years away as we measure it), and look out your front window, you would notice that your destination is in fact only 22000 light hours away, or a mere 2.5 light years.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! If you want to go to the next galaxy, Andromeda 2 million light years away, using a perfectly efficient photon drive (machine that somehow converts matter into photons that shoot out the back), and then stop, experiencing no more than 1g of acceleration the whole time, and you and all your stuff together (including your food and your food regeneration technology—whatever that means!) weighs 100 kg, then <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Rocket/rocket.html" target="_blank">you have to bring 420 billion tons of rocket fuel and you experience only 28 years</a>.</p>
<p>If you used a circular path instead, making it only about 1/3 of the way to Andromeda and returning home, all these numbers wouldn't change too much, so it takes about 420 billion tons of rocket fuel to travel 2 million years into the future, experiencing no more than earth-gravity equivalent acceleration and aging 28 years.</p>
<p>If you wanted to go only 30,000 years into the future, that would be 100,000,000 tons of rocket fuel, and you'd age 20 years;</p>
<p>27 years into the future, just 100 tons of rocket fuel and you would age 7 years. That's a fun trick to play on your friends!</p>
<p>Of course, we've never developed a photon drive, and if we did, there's no reason to think that it would be perfectly efficient or lightweight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Time slows down as you get closer to the speed of light (it's confusing, I know). </p>
<p>So, from our perspective (Earth), the ship is traveling for a year, but to the astronaut on board, time has slowed down to the point where that year is only an hour to him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He would have aged 1 hour. It's not like the astronaut would notice time slowing down - to them it would seem as if the distance to travel has shrunk enormously instead. Relativity is fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One hour.</p>
<p>Let's say his destination is one light-year away from the Earth and he travels at almost speed of light</p>
<p>Earth's point of view:
Dude entered spaceship and is traveling almost at speed of light. So he would need time = distance/velocity = 1 year to get there. No funny businesses there. But if you look through window on his spaceship he looks almost frozen - his clock has slowed down and he barely moves. After year on earth his clock ticked only an hour. That is effect of time dilatation.</p>
<p>His point of view:
On the Earth he still sees that he has one light year distance to travel. But as soon as he enters his spaceship and starts accelerating, whole distance he has to travel starts to shrink and when he reaches desired speed (which is almost c) whole distance is now 1 light hour long and he traverses it in only an hour - because it that long. It has contracted, which is also effect of relativity.</p></div>		</li>
