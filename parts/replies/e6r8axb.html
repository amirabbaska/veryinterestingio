			<div class="markdown"><p>So dumb question. I used to have a lazy eye as a kid but got that shit sorted by going to some sort of physical eye therapy I no longer remember the name of (this was 20+ years ago). I no longer have a lazy eye, unless I'm very tired and / or inebriated. Isn't that strengthening the eye muscle? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it isn't strengthening the eye muscle per-se.  Wearing the patch retrained your brain to use your 'lazy eye' -the danger being that if you did not treat it, your brain would be trained to ignore the image from the lazy eye (to avoid double vision) which would permanently damage your eyesight.  By treating the visual problem in the lazy eye (either strabismus or cataract or something else) and wearing a patch over your &quot;good&quot; eye, your brain is retrained to use the lazy eye.  Then the goal is to remove the patch, and the vision can improve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you have amblyopia? I had that when I was younger. They found out because I was basically blind but the teachers thought I was dumb because I couldn’t tell the difference between a circle, triangle, and a square, and I’d have to miss out another year before kindergarten. My mom was stubborn and said that I wasn’t stupid, and it turns out I just couldn’t see. It was almost bad enough to need therapy and a patch on one glasses lens, but they tried without first and my vision got better. This was almost 20 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There appears to be no known mechanism for this, but even if there was, you wouldn't want to. Increasing the size of your smooth muscles - intestines, circulatory system, etc. would be disastrous. In many cases a widening of these structures is caused by inflammation, and the result is usually a serious condition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know your credentials or even if you have any but I still want to ask!</p>
<p>The only mechanism I can think of, is steroid use. Supposedly it can enlarge your heart. It's not a natural mechanism but I wanted to ask about your thoughts </p></div>		</li>
