			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree - what we need to know is whether /u/MILeft could <em>see</em> through their eyes while they were taken out of their sockets. However I'm guessing based on the word &quot;anesthesiologists&quot; that they were heavily sedated or probably unconscious at the time. Which is a shame from the point of view of this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am eternally grateful for anesthesia. The lingering effects of the surgery caused many visual distortions for about four months afterwards, but without the surgery, I would have gone blind.</p>
<p>At the time I posted, there was a lot of confusing misinformation in the thread, so I limited my answer to the question of whether vision was possible after eye balls were popped out. The simple answer is <em>yes</em>, assuming that great care was taken to treat the eyes and the optic nerve as precious and fragile.</p>
<p>There are many possible visual distortions with this surgery, but the goal is to prevent blindness, so sometimes it pays to gamble on the skills of great surgeons. I'm very glad I did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because one of the side effects of Graves Disease is dry eyes, I have been on various eye drops for many years. Steroid drops. Anti-inflammatory drops. Antiseptic drops. The surgery and the drops kept me and continue to keep me from going blind.</p></div>		</li>
