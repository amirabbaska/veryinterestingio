			<div class="markdown"><p>China is seen as an important growth market or as an important supplier for intermediate goods, and a bad signal related to China will then also be a bad signal for US companies. </p>
<p>It is also true that the market tends to react more stongly to negative signals than positive ones, and more importantly, dislikes uncertainty most of all. The stock market is fine with risks, as long as those risks can be evaluated, when the meaning of a shock can't be precisely interpreted the market tends to overreact as well. Both of these things may play a role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the physical mechanism? I'll give it a shot of explaining like you're five - </p>
<p>Markets have buyers and sellers. When the buyers are more aggressive (or desperate) than the sellers, stock prices will rise (because they have to reach and reach for more sellers than the current prices allowed). When the sellers are more aggressive than the buyers, prices drop.</p>
<p>This isn't what you asked, though, right? Well, it is somewhat. When a market like the Chinese one drops a lot and the US market hasn't moved at all, who do you expect to be more aggressive/desperate? Buyers or sellers? Typically sellers, since they're worried that the same might happen in the US. And, if you're a buyer in the US market, why would you pay the same price you paid yesterday for a US stock when you can see that China is getting killed? Might as well see if some desperate sellers show up, so you stay out of the market for now, or move your targets lower (causing prices to drop even more, since normal buyers that would have been there have now disappeared).</p>
<p>Also, there are people who trade different markets against each other. China is down 10% and US is up 1%? That's a good time to sell US stocks and buy Chinese stocks (according to them). China is now up 5% and the US is down 3%? That's a good time to go the other way. People like this keep the markets moving together as well.</p>
<p>There are also economic reasons <strong>why</strong> the US market should react to moves in the Chinese market, but I hope I summed up some of the simpler methods of <strong>how</strong> the US market might follow a large move in the Chinese market.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So if China takes a shit, our outlook on Apple goes down a bit (we are less confident Apple will grow as fast/large)</p>
<p>Multiply that by a shitload of US companies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, it works like this. In simple terms there are so many companies that have investments in China, like apple and mcdonalds which both are big players in the US and European markets. So if the Chinese market takes a hit so do those big player companies which in turn dominos over to other parts of the world</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>US Companies, and companies from most other nations, buy and sell a lot of goods and services with China. If their economy declines, they will be able to buy less and that will hurt companies that sell to them. Furthermore, the instability this brings creates additional risk for companies that buy a lot from China. </p>
<p>Take Apple for example. They sell products to china, so are hit on that side, and they also do a lot of manufacturing and purchasing from china, so they get hit there too. </p>
<p>Net result over the whole market is a decent downturn.  </p></div>		</li>
