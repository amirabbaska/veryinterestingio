<p>Save the white and stems of green onions if you're only using the tops for garnish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do people really only use the tops? I love the sharp clean flavor of the bulb of a green onion. Cut the white bulb into 1/4&quot; or 5mm thick rounds and throw in a fresh green salad. They are like salad candy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the opposite, I mostly use the white part and about  half of the green part. The white part has more crispness that I like to add in a tuna salad mix. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same for me.  I didn't even realize people didn't use the entire stalk.  I tend to use green onion for a lot of different dishes, along with white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My relatives would throw the whole thing on the grill during cookouts and it was a sweet snack for kids or a side dish for adults. Most would just eat the white part, but we'd be able to munch on the green for a long time extracting the flavor. </p></div>		</li>

<p>First, Red onions: In nicer restaurants you will rarely experience these cooked. They tend to have a muddy and or sulfuric flavor once heat is applied to them. They really only have the potential to be sweet when raw so more often than not you will experience them shaved or pickled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depends.  A number of nicer restaurants will (wrongly) serve sauteed red onions as an accoutrement for steak.  And it's not because they don't have yellow or sweet onions on hand.  </p></div>		</li>
