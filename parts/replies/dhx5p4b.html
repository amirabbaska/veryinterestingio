			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Another example is the difference between a &quot;Mass Shooter&quot; and a &quot;Terrorist&quot;. One's someone who shoots up a school or a park or something just because they've snapped/had enough/whatever,  and the other is someone who's doing it to strike fear into a populace, a government or anyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, in terrorism, the fear created by the attack is the main effect, not the attack itself, and the goal is to harness that fear into a political agenda.</p>
<p>If a lone madman blows up his neighbour because he doesn't like him, that's just murder, not terrorism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't disagreeing; one comment is saying &quot;terrorism is about the use of fear&quot;, the other one is saying &quot;terrorism is about achieving ideological ends, the fear is just a tool/bonus to that end&quot;.</p>
<p>These are not in conflict, the latter is just more focused on objectives, and is therefore adding nuance to the discussion.</p></div>		</li>
