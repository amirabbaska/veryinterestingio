			<div class="markdown"><p>It has nothing to do with where the power is going, only how much is being used. In Australia, power is used more during the day because of air conditioning. Especially during hotter months, the gap between energy use during the day and night can be huge. Traditionally, this has meant that two types of plants must be used: a base load power plant and a peak load power plant.  </p>
<p>The base load power plant is generally something like coal or nuclear (but in this case wind). The base load plant, in general, is geared towards matching the average need for power or slightly less. Base load plants, in general, are not good at varying their power output. Then, the peak plant (usually if not always fossil fuel based) comes on only during peak times.  </p>
<p>These battery farms will catch the excess power from the base load during times of low usage and essentially become the peak power during times of high usage. Thus removing the need for fossil fuels as a source of electricity.</p></div>		</li>
