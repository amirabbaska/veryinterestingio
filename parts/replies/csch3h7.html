			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that the usual method of defeating armor was applying a heavy object with a small contact patch, can we do that better? </p>
<p>Specifically, could we use a dense metal (steel jacketed uranium?) more optimally concentrate mass further out on something like a mace, or get a smaller contact patch without losing significant strength? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't have any &quot;super-strong but lightweight material&quot; in that sense. We are still using steal for a reason. Besides it is the weight of the mace that makes it work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that the total energy of that heavy object is always going to be intrinsically linked to the person wielding the sword.  Medieval long swords usually only weighted about 5 pounds, and that for a good reason: F=M*A.  Essentially, any increase in mass decreases the rate that you can accelerate the sword.  So after a certain point, heaviness becomes useless because the swing up time required to hurt someone is too long for it to be a useful combat weapon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Angular momentum changes depending on the distribution of weight though. A rod of even density will have lower angular momentum than one with all the weight at the end, given the same rotational speed. So the question becomes how much you can minimize speed losses while shifting the center of gravity out. </p>
<p>Given modern materials though, we can probably beat a rod of static length with something that looks like an extendable baton. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about a modern estoc?</p>
<p>I imagine we could probably make something that is lighter, stiffer, and maybe with a finer point if that really matters.</p>
<p>So instead of looking for a better slicing tool, what about a better huge stabbing tool?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stabbing would be more effective than slicing, but you'd probably have to hit at a very steep angle (close to perpendicular to the armor surface), which in the heat of combat is more a matter of luck than weapon quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think you go for the joints/get enough weight behind the blow that it could pierce a thinner part of the armor?</p>
<p>There is no way to get through the thickest part of something like a cuirassier's chest piece, so aren't you obviously going to aim elsewhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then you'd have to pick a steel that would allow a lighter, stiffer blade that isn't brittle and that holds a fine cutting edge.  What you're describing sounds a bit more like a short rapier than a longsword, you give up a lot of distance.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Estoc's do not cut.</p>
<p>They are only lethal on a thrust.</p>
<p>So we only need stiff, light, and preferably not brittle, but holding a cutting edge is not at all needed.</p></div>		</li>
