			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not that people don't think dealships deserve to make money, it's that dealerships make their money in skeezy and opportunistic ways without any competition.</p>
<p>In fact, the way dealerships are handed down from father to son is like their own little fiefdom because there are laws that divide dealerships into territories in which only a certain amount of dealerships are permitted is in itself disgusting. It's non-competitive and simply does not fall in line with the values of the U.S.A. So when you have a monopoly on the business for &quot;x&quot; amount of miles, you can run a skeezy, no good dealership, and most do.</p>
<p>It's like the cable and internet companies that have divided the U.S. into territories so that they don't have to compete. We will give you our money, but the jig is up; everyone knows that dealerships are nothing more than bottom feaders trying to suck every dime out of their customer through exploitation and ignorance A.K.A. The add ons</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong, but I've found that a lot more common among used car dealers. Most manufacturers dealerships are just volume sales places now where it's more about the number of cars rather than the profit in each car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, Iâ€™ve always assumed the manufacture sells their cars at (wholesale) blue book price along with a certain markup(depending on the number of units purchased). Afterwards, the dealerships sells the car to customer at MSRP.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The unfortunate part is that unlike any other business, people don't feel a dealership is entitled to make a profit. But like, people still have to get paid and lights still have to be kept on. So it is what it is.  </p>

<p>Unlike other business, dealership refuse to advertise their actual prices. Like you said they make a few bucks for selling it at invoice, so why don't they mail me ads saying they'll sell me cars at invoice? They do that and I guarantee they'll advertise way better rates than all my other local dealers. And when companies like Tesla actually do that the other dealers sue them for not involving a middle man.</p>
<p>Yet that's exactly how Apple sells their products, straight from their site and via third party sellers. Those sellers do advertise the price they'll sell the Apple products for. I can go online and compare different retailers and buy it wherever I want and do it online. In fact most products today are sold that way it seems to only be cars where you need to argue over the price and it seems they are just testing you to see if they can sell it to you for a few grand more than it's worth before giving you their quote. To me that's just scummy to start with an unfair price first </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the problem is that manufacturers set MSRPs, not the dealers. So a car is gonna have the same MSRP in an apples to apples comparison, but the dealer is allowed to sell it for whatever it wants to under that price. It's a horrible way to go about it, tbh, and that's sort of the benefit of shopping for a car online now if you're looking for the best price. Sites like Truecar now basically strip out the MSRP on a new car and give you the price at or below invoice, and so long as the dealership isn't scummy it's going to honor that price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a franchise thing, pay GM a fee to become a dealer, follow their rules and you're an authorized dealer. That's it. There are other income streams too, the manufacturer pays for stuff like interest for the car to sit on the lot and various other back end rebates to the dealer. So the faster it's sold the less it costs them. Plus warranty work is paid for by GM, not the dealer (so that massive bill for work that got covered via warranty...GM actually pays it, and the dealer makes money from that). When you get recalls done, again the dealer is paid for it.</p>
<p>They even got some states to ban manufacturers from owning dealerships, so they can &quot;compete&quot; but not be beat by the manufacturer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To your part about how much you (the salesperson) make, does this mean you make a lot more selling me that pre-owned car that's marked up $5k than selling me the new car? Does this distort your behavior (ie I walk in saying I want a new car X, you, knowing you'll make $50 selling me car x, says &quot;car x is good, but the 2015 car y is like the car x but way better,&quot;)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is pretty much yes. But also, the manufacturer I work for gives us a bonus if we sell 6 new cars in a month, and a bonus per new car after that. So either way works but obviously if someone says they're open to a preowned, I'm gonna focus more on that fact.</p></div>		</li>
