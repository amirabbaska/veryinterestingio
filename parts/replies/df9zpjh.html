<p>I don't think if I noticed it, that I cared.  Or at least, that it was soothing to the dry spot in the back of my throat. </p>
<p>And, I like the smell of diesel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes the same place as Coke. Boogers/snot and the drip.. it's either going in your gut or out into a Kleenex. Seeing as pretty much only a fraction of your bag is actually Coke. Most of what you are snorting is filler, cut. Once being gaked out I tried to snort coke and Xanax. (Seeing as Xanax doesn't work like that) I woke up the next day after my binge and felt like something was stuck in my sinus. After blowing my nose a half inch cylindrical-esque booger came out. It was disgusting and you could actually see bits of Coke and Xanax </p></div>		</li>
