			<div class="markdown"><p>As the top two posts show, the painting is famous in part due to information (or misinformation) about it. It's less about what it is, than what it has gone through. Leonardo was a child genius, adding more realism and shadow into his works than the master he studied with, and being thus credited with sfumato as a newish style. He was commissioned by a businessman to paint his wife (some say his daughter) Lisa Gherardini. Drawings tend to show that it is likely the painting was cut at both sides from an originally wider format with columns framing the portrait. It was lauded by the french as the ideal femme fatale, and listed as one of the most famous works of all times by the Baedeker guide, a travel guide most people used in the late 1800's. That Vencenzo Peruggia (maybe working with others) stole it, only added to the story. Actually, before the theft people cared little for the painting.</p>
<p>Value, and greatness (as in this painting is seen as great by many people who have no education in art) is a form of Gresham's theorem. Think of a penny, it's worth a penny. Now think of a 1909 S VDB penny, it's worth about $1,000. They are both still pennies, but one, because about 480,000 instead of millions were made, there is a rarity and desire to have one by collectors that drives the price up. This in turn drives the rarer works out of circulation, it puts a sort of fake premium on the work. So that's a part of it.  In art the story about the art, adds to the rarity, as the theft shows us. The enigmatic smile adds to the story. Over time the press builds upon press, reproductions abound, we see the myth of the work overtake the work itself; it's called great, genius, priceless.    </p>
<p>As a piece of painting, in which we talk about color, syntax, form, etc. there really is nothing that special about the work. Leonardo revised it numerous times over years. He added and subtracted from it.  There is debate whether it is even finished.  The painting itself does not stand a head and shoulders above other works of the time by other great artists (think Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, Lippi, Giorgione). </p>
<p>So the takeaway here is that values, such as &quot;greatness&quot; are both arbitrary and relative.  There is no all-objective measure to determine, and as we see with the Mona Lisa, greatness can be developed and manipulated. This is not a critique, it's just the way it is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>According to the author, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa dazzled his contemporaries because:
A)  The sitter was a wealthy woman
B)  Da Vinci was a famous artist
C)  The portrait was almost miraculously lifelike
D)  All of the above
E)  None of the above</p></div>		</li>

<p>But you sort of said it yourself, it's subjective. For all I know it might be much better than Raphael, relative to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it referrs to a lack of outlining, which is apparently called Sfumato. There's a reference to this in the Mona Lisa Wikipedia article, and the Sfumato article references the Mona Lisa:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While &quot;border free&quot; refers to a lack of borders, sfumato does not. </p>
<p>Sfumato is the technique of allowing colors to gradually blend together, producing a hazy shaded effect. This can best be observed in the background of the Mona Lisa, and while not extraordinary today was actually a new technique for the time pioneered largely by da Vinci. </p>
<p>Just FYI </p></div>		</li>

<p>Da Vinci himself even continues to gain fame every few years or so when someone tries out one of his centuries-old sketches and makes it actually work, then the internet goes into a frenzy researching the man and inevitably comes across the painting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You think the Mona Lisa's enduring popularity is due to DIY artists building sculptures from Da Vinci's sketches causing Redditors who have never heard of him to flock to Google and learn about the Mona Lisa for the first time?</p>
