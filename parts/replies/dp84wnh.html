<p>The force acting on a charge due to a magnetic field is a vector (like all forces) but the magnetic field is a pseudovector.</p>

<p>Isn't that a bit of a chicken-and-egg sort of thing? Given that explanation, aren't I going to ask, &quot;Well then how do you know it's a pseudovector?&quot;</p>
<p>We didn't find out how magnets worked by creating a mirror universe and seeing what was flipped around what axis. Aren't you describing a mathematical formalism as though it's empirical evidence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're missing his point. Say OP knew about the pseudo vector fact but not that the force is perpendicular to the field he could have asked the question &quot;Why is it a pseudovector?&quot; and someone could respond &quot;because the force is perpendicular to the field&quot; and we would be back where we started. A vector or a pseudovector is a purely mathematical construct used to describe something in the world, hence the answer given here is just an explanation of how we represent the physical phenomenon in maths, it does not answer the question of &quot;why?&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I piggyback a question here? Why does current flow in a particular direction given the direction of motion of a conductor through a magnetic field? I know the right hand rule etc, but why does it behave in that way? Thanks! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m with you that far. But the direction has me stuck. When moving down through a field that’s N-S is left to right, why does the current move toward you as opposed to away. Both are perpendicular. This is assuming conventional flow. </p></div>		</li>
