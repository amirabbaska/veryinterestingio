			<div class="markdown"><p>People overuse the fuck out of phillips even in cases where it is a terrible choice (when someone would almost always use a screw driver). I've had a seatbelt with a phillips torqued in so hard it was going to have to be drilled out. Also people that use shirtty materials for screws so they strip with even the right sized head and hand torqued (fuck everbilt and HD for carrying them)</p>
<p>Edit: Since post is locked (why???) Amazon probably. And... one of my higher rated comments is on why I hate phillips so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was it a Japanese car by any chance? If so, then it may have been a JIS screw, not a Phillips. JIS screws look very similar to a Phillips, but are designed to not cam out like a Phillips does. While you can sometimes get away with using a Phillips screwdriver on a JIS screw, it will chew up the JIS screw if much torque needs to be applied.</p>
<p>JIS screws are common on cars and bikes made in Japan.</p>

<p>Don't ever do projects for a cheap guy. He saves all the money by costing you all the extra time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are meant to be impact driven out, safety equipment like seat belts also often have a touch of some kind of loc-tite which needs to be sheared which takes extra force to accomplish meaning you need an impact driver or an impact gun with a Japanese Phillips sized bit to remove the fastener </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this a lot of appliances and machines are made from out sourced parts, there are very few proprietary pieces. An example of this is the printing press I use at work is made in the US with a UV curing system from England, drive motors from Japan and a web guide from Canada. It contains a mixture of Phillips, Hex Standard and Metric, Torx, Robertson and even a few slotted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fucking torx...</p>
<p>I work on a lot of European made equipment, and they love their torx... They strip more easily than hex screws, they don't stay on the screw driver as well as a Robertson, and I can never find the right sized bit, but unlike a Phillips you can't used one that's close enough.</p>
<p>And every once in a while they throw in those security torx screws, just to mess with you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The philips head is designed so the screwdriver slips out if you put too much torque (twisting force) on it.</p>

<p>&quot;Slips out&quot;. Nice try, philips head patent holder. We all know that thing is stripped and never moving again.</p></div>		</li>
