			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question, a little googling (of &quot;air pressure in deep mines&quot;) turned this up:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v105n06p387.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v105n06p387.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The total increase in barometric pressure while
descending from surface to a mining depth of
5 000 m would be approximately 0.55 ATA
(Atmosphere Absolute), i.e. a <strong>66% increase in
ambient pressure compared with surface.</strong> This
is equivalent to a depth of 7 m in seawater, not
enough to produce decompression sickness,
narcosis or toxic effects among recreational
divers. This indicates little risk of routine
pressure-related effects during descent into an
ultra-deep mine and even less risk during
ascent, assuming good dental care, healthy
sinuses, unobstructed external ear canals and
normally functioning Eustachian tubes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is a lot more dense so 8 km of water creates <em>a lot</em> more pressure than an  (additional) 8 km of air. You can easily calculate it but I'm too lazy, since at least for me is the gist of the question you raised and putting numbers on it does not add anything to (my) intuition :-)</p>
<p>EDIT: For numbers see</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As has been said the pressure increase would be moderate, but the adiabatic <em>temperature</em> increase would be severe. Models of the dry Mediterranean 6 million years ago predict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messinian_salinity_crisis#Relationship_to_climate" target="_blank">summer highs of 80 celsius</a>, 40 degrees hotter than the weather at sea level, so for the Marianas trench it would be ludicrous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere has been known (or at least postulated) to be finite since at least a manuscript of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Mu%CA%BF%C4%81dh_al-Jayy%C4%81n%C4%AB" target="_blank">al-Jayyānī</a>, from the mid-11th century, a single <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0083665676900180#" target="_blank">Hebrew copy</a> of which remains at the French National Library.</p>
<p>Ptolemy also argued for it: when stars appear near the horizon, they do not appear where they should but higher, and their positions seem to oscillate. That effect is nto discernible when the stars are close to their zenith. Likewise, the light of the Sun shines on the sky before the Sun appears and after it is has disappeared from direct view. Ptolemy correctly understood this to be the effect of atmospheric refraction.</p>
<p>Ibn Mu'adh computed the size of the atmosphere assuming that it was a homogeneous refracting material, and that the &quot;aether&quot; surrounding it was non-refracting. Coupled with the observation that no lingering light is visible after the Sun has sunk deeper than around 18°, this yields an estimated height of the atmosphere ~80km.</p>
<p><a href="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~lehn/_Papers_for_Download/history_of_refr.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is an article discussing the historical evidence behind knowledge of atmospheric refraction, that includes all of the above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is amazing- Ptolomy knew in the second century AD that the atmosphere was surrounded by something much less dense. What a terrific deduction from observation. </p></div>		</li>
