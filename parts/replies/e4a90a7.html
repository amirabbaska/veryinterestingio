<p>So does that mean that at one point the universe was expanding faster than the speed of light?</p>
<p>Also I know they wouldn’t be able to get us the images quickly, but if that person 13 billion light years away took the same telescope and looked away from us, out further,  then what would they see? Wouldn’t they be able to see 13 billion light years further? (26 billion to us) but then essentially further and older then the universe? If not, why?</p>
<p>Again, thank you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It doesn't make sense to measure the expansion with a speed, only speed per distance is meaningful.</p>

<p>Some matter we don't see. It would be 13 billion light years further <em>today</em>, but significantly less in the past.</p></div>		</li>
