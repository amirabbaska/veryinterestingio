<p>Most phenomenon involving waves (sound, light, earthquakes, etc.) work in a logarithmic progression. </p>

<p>What does this mean? I think you are confused. We measure <em>amplitude</em> of these things in terms of logarithms (for vibrations at least), not frequency. </p>
<p>See my comment above, this is a 1/rc scale, not a logarithmic scale. </p>
<p>Edit: just look at the picture. If it were logarithmic, then two points would be related by the same ratio if they are the same distance apart. Clearly 60/55 is not the same ratio as 80/70. (To use op's example, clearly 130/100 is not the same ratio as 70/60.) </p>
<p>Edit 2: not sure how to do formatting to do the strike through thing, but I think it should actually say <em>intensity</em>, which is the square of amplitude. </p></div>		</li>
