			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I understand it, the electrons aren’t in lower energy levels, it’s just that they are under so much pressure from the intense gravity that instead of being a nice cloud around their individual nuclei, the electrons blend together with the other atoms electron clouds to form a dense soup of freely moving electrons. This also has the consequence that nuclei are no longer protected by their electron cloud, so they can get much closer together, and thus denser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully someone who knows this better than I do can fact check, but I’m pretty sure that’s a decent way to look at it! I’ve seen it as normal atoms being like an egg, with the shell and egg whites being the electron cloud, and the yolk being the nucleus. EDM would be like breaking the eggs, so you have a soup of whites and yolks that can freely mix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although whenever you try to think of materials dominated by quantum or relativistic effects you sort of have to be willing to drop some common sense intuition, the best sort of everyday model I can think of to describe EDM would be a jar full of glass marbles with some water poured in. The marbles, representing the electrons, strongly resist any compression because you can't have two marbles in the same place at the same time while the water, nuclei here, can freely flow around the marbles. Also notice in this example the contents of the whole aren't really locked into place, you can swirl everything around but the marbles don't really change in density all that much.</p></div>		</li>
