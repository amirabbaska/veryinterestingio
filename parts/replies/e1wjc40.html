			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly how stars start! Jupiter would need to be quite a bit larger (~10-100 times as massive) to start fusion at the core, though and even then, it would be what's known as a brown dwarf and wouldn't sustain the fusion for very long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, I thought that with stars, mass was inversely proportionate with age. Arent red and brown dwarfs the longest lived stars able to burn dimly for trillions of years?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any &quot;planet&quot; that did do it would be considered part of a binary star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. basically there is a pressure threshold, we think a gas giants can be close enough that feeding a gas giant more mass might ignite it. But that can depend on what makes up to the exact core of the gas giant to determine how much more mass.  But probably if you can get 2 gas giants to collide you would have start</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok cool so if, theoretically, Jupiter and Saturn were to collide, that could cause some sort of nuclear reaction? My guess is that the sun would expand to devour the solar system before that would happen but itâ€™s a cool thing to think about. Thanks for the reply!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Armchair conjecture, but I don't see how it doesn't have a large rocky core.  All the planets coalesced from the primordial detritus of the solar system as it formed, via the same gravity-driven process, from the same cloud of dust and gas.  It only stands to reason that all the bodies, Sun included, contain a large amount of rocky material (iron, silicon, carbon, etc).  I'd love to know for certain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting point, but you have to take into account the fact that this solar system formed from a supernova and so the heavy elements would not have been ejected as far as the lighter gasses. So while it definitely is plausible for the gas giants to have heavy elements in them, since they are so far out in the solar system, it is much more likely that they would be mainly lighter elements.</p></div>		</li>
