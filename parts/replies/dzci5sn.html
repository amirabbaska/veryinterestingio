			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the isotope. The OP is confusing stable isotopes with those that decay however. To reconstruct diet, we use stable isotopes.  </p>
<p>Stable carbon isotopes tell us about the plant-based components of diet. The three different types of photosynthesis (C3, C4, CAM) discriminate against the heavier carbon 13 to varying degrees, resulting in different carbon isotopic ratios. So we can tell if an organism was eating more C3 (most plant biomass on earth) or C4 plants (mostly grasses), for example. </p>
<p>In terms of the &quot;food chain&quot;, you are probably thinking trophic levels (eg - who is eating who), and for the most part, nitrogen isotopes are going to give you that information. In a general sense, higher nitrogen values indicate more carnivory.</p>
<p>I'm somewhat skeptical that anything fossilized would allow for stable isotopic analysis, as the process of fossilization replaces biological tissues with exogenous minerals, but I know it's been done before on a number of fossil vertebrates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was wondering, and I think you're right, that the lack of original tissue would make it impossible. I was also wondering if we could get all Jurassic Parky and go for insects trapped in amber, but then my other concern is that we don't know enough about the stable isotopes present elsewhere in the ecosystem around that animal that we can pinpoint a source for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also inverts. The delta-13C standard is derived from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9413C" target="_blank">Peedee belemnite,</a> which was sufficiently high that when used as a reference standard, most everything else gives a negative value.</p></div>		</li>
