			<div class="markdown"><p>Well satellites aren't going to burst into flames or anything, but the positioning would be different than predicted which means that accuracy would get progressively worse and worse. It probably wouldn't fail catastrophically, but it also wouldn't be very useful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And when they triangulate the solution, they dont use three satellites (which is all you would need in a perfect, unrealistic situation), usually more like 4-7. Every signal, even when accounting for time dialation and even using multiple frequencies (there are 2 frequencies transmitted) there is uncertainty, which is known, and so they take redundant measures to increase confidence in solution.</p>
<p>And if we didnt account for time dialation in all liklihood we would need a lot more satellites in orbit to get close to the same precision. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the military would have noticed this and compensated with software long before GPS become a consumer product. If the drift is fixable by knowing relativity, it would be fixable by noting the rate of drift and compensating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where you define &quot;broken&quot;. It would be possible to calibrate a GPS system without relativity, if you knew your location in the first place - but the accuracy would rapidly decay.</p>
<p>So, imagine you start a road trip from Chicago to Portland, OR. You calibrate your GPS in Chicago. By the time you get to Iowa, the GPS thinks you're driving a kilometer or two off of I-80's pavement. When you cross into Omaha, NE it's off by around 6 km. </p>
<p>I would call that &quot;fail completely&quot; for the purposes of in-car navigation. If you have some other application that requires less accuracy, then it might not be &quot;completely broken&quot;, but would still require recalibration on a daily or even twice daily basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just and engineer, and all I know is you've gotten two bad answers here, or at least two bad answers from people who know about as much as I do, but they didn't say as much.</p>
<p>GPS satellites say I am &quot;here&quot; and this is what time it is exactly, you figure out where you are. They would work great the first day, and then they would get progressively worse, as their clock went bad. I am sure that GPS satellites have some calibration process they go through periodically, which they would do more often if we knew they were constantly getting &quot;wronger&quot;. </p>
<p>The idea that GPS without knowledge of relativity wouldn't be useful is wrong. </p>
<p>The idea that a GPS device needs to be calibrated to a location is wrong, it just reads and interpolates from a signal from 3 or 4 satellites out of dozens. It wouldn't get more wrong as you moved across the country but still work in Chicago.</p>
<p>I'm sure someone will come along to clean this up and answer your question in detail.</p>
<p><strong>edit: Some quick work in wolfram indicates that time dilation due to the velocity of the satellite is far less than a million or billionth of a second. For a calibrated GPS satellite, the immediate error introduced by the velocity is going going to be on the scale of a meter or less.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/oXI0Sza" target="_blank">Here's the calculation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/HEP/QuarkNet/time.html" target="_blank">Here's the formula</a></p>
<p>t = t0/(1-v\^2/c\^2)\^1/2</p>
<p>Just to throw numbers around, I used 7,600 m/s and mistakenly used 2000m for distance to altitude. 2000m should have been 2000km, but that still isn't enough to affect the answer.</p>
<p>**edit2: As pointed out by /u/matthoback, my math is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/matthoback" target="_blank">wrong</a> Over the course of a day, the satellite would need to dial it's clock back by a few microseconds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The main source of time dilation for GPS satellites is not the relative velocity to the ground, but the fact that they are higher in the Earth's gravity well. The velocity slows the clock by 7 microseconds/day and the height speeds it up by 45 microseconds/day. This equates to a total drift of about 10 kilometers/day.</p>

<p>Well, that is a bit of a stretch.  Things would be constantly going wrong and you would get answers that were hundreds of meters off.  I suppose some progress could be made by just fudging the numbers based on experience.  Without relativity, however, no one would really know what they were doing.  I'll leave it to someone else to comment if it's even possible to &quot;correct&quot; your way to a working GPS without knowledge of relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't say 'I am here', they say 'It is now X time'.</p>
<p>You then measure the delay between many satellites to see how far you are from each and basically triangulate your position that way. There's more involving phase analysis and symbol interferometry, and they do atmospheric compensation in an interesting way, but if you have enough satellites you can just math your way to a location.</p>
<p>Correction: For advanced receivers, they do keep a calendar of the satellites inclination and try to use this to improve accuracy. Not needed, but it can definitely improve lock time (I see satellite x, so y and z should be around now, which puts me in the north hemisphere). This is even better with a-gps where cell-phones use cell-tower locations and a bootstrap almanac to get very fast locks, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_GPS" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_GPS</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to be pedantic, GPS works by multilateration, not triangulation :). We don't know the time of flight, only the broadcast time and difference in reception times between transmitters. </p></div>		</li>
