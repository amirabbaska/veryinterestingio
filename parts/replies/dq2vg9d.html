			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask you a follow up?</p>
<p>So is it conceivable that certain people or certain families (inherited traits) gain the ability to form LT memories earlier in their development than others or earlier than the norm/average?</p>
<p>If so by how much, and what is the &quot;norm&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The genetic basis of encoding (or consolidation of) LT memories is not yet known explicitly. But we do know that one of the prime genes that contributes to memory consolidation (ST memories to LT memories) is CREB (cAMP responsive element binding protein). There have been no GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies) research that could link (on a purely correlational basis) a memory consolidation advantage to a particular subset of sample (potentially who could be prodigies with <em>“beneficial”</em> mutations in CREB or any other candidate gene). We do not know what is the <em>“norm/average”</em> for this consolidation to occur as we at this point of time cannot reliably ascertain a fully developed (or terminally developed) brain structure (as synaptic pruning continues into our 20s). The answer to the question, <em>“If this advantageous trait could be heritable?”</em>, is yet to be answered as we do not know which gene would be actually responsible for this trait; so we need to find it (or them) out first and then follow it (or them) up with GWAS studies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The infants begin to recognize their parents (or <em>“learn and remember their parents”</em> as I would phrase it) due to classical conditioning of the Short term memories that get consolidated (converted to Long term memories) over time. The proximity of family members is a consistent phenomenon in the immediate local environment of a growing infant that requires <em>“less effort”</em> to consolidate and therefore stays <em>”forever”</em>. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Does it? Do infants who lose their parents at a very young age still remember their faces?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>infantile amnesia applies to long term <em>episodic</em> memory, but other forms of memory are indeed retained from the very beginning: you learn to talk / walk / use a spoon / recognize your parents / etc etc etc, but you don't 'episodically' remember any of it.</p>
<p>so the LTP angle is not a very satisfying answer to this question. long term memory clearly exists for infants, and long term episodic memory kicks in pretty early considering that, as you say, frontal lobe development is still in very early stages. episodic memory must take time to develop, like other cognitive functions, but not too much time.</p>
<p>i.e. the answer is at a much higher network/organizational level than LTP. (but also, like you say, nobody knows the answer at the moment).</p></div>		</li>
