			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone asked this earlier but you seem more qualified to answer it. When I use mouthwash that kills bacteria would that destroy the outer layer of the cell wall in my mouth? Does the fast regeneration regenerate the cell wall and the good bacteria and not the bad bacteria? Maybe you could shed light on this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you mean the outer layer of skin, not cell wall (as in the outer layer of plant cells), you are not destroying them with mouthwash, or not enough to make a difference. </p>
<p>Antiseptic mouthwashes use alcohol to kill bacteria, and humans have the benefit of thick and toughened tissues to protect weaker deep tissue - for example, if you spill vodka on your arm, it doesn’t hurt. Bacteria are very small and don’t have thick tissues, so their membranes are destroyed. </p>
<p>As far as the regeneration, we can’t regenerate our good bacteria the way we can our own cells, but the bacteria who live there are <em>really</em> good at colonizing the mouth. The filmy plaque that you brush off your teeth and rinse off with mouthwash keeps coming back everyday as bacteria recolonize. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also dentist. No mouth wash on the market kills by alcohol, very common misconception. If you're assuming listerine the alcohol concentration isn't that high. It's used to act as a solvent for the oils like thymol,menthol, eucalyptol. Thus why it burns when you swish that and not vodka. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will do my best to answer this. So the skin is made up of layers and the inside of your mouth is no exception. (Although your gums are far more keratinized to resist trauma from food but I digress) The top layers are all dead and form a barrier. </p>
<p>Imagine if you used a bunch of dead bodies as a wall and then a bunch of half dead and dying bodies to reinforce that wall. </p>
<p>Our bodies are resistant to damage and are waterproof due to this nature of our epidermis and mucosa (mucosa = mouth skin)  </p>
<p>Bacteria are not so lucky. I won’t go into the details of cell walls and bacterial types but they are much more intimately connected to their environment and do not tolerate changes that well. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, most mouthwashes use either alcohol or triclosan. The ones that you feel a burning sensation uses alcohol, you should avoid them. And as someone said earlier, we have lots of bacteria in our mouth, but they live in balance, so they don’t make you sick. If you use mouthwashes everyday, you can disrupt this balance and select strains of certain bacteria that will multiply and may make you sick. Or the lack of bacteria may allow fungi to multiply and grow excessively, like C. albicans, that will give you candidiasis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are topical treatments available over the counter to relieve pain but so far no cure. They also have these speacialized lasers that some dentists have that can take care of the pain from the ulcer immediately by cauterizing the nerves. (Painlessly I might add)</p></div>		</li>
