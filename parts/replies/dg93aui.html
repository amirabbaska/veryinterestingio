			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this question, its a really important one. The short answer is that it concerns me a great deal. I think it would be inevitable that there would be different access to this technology for people with different income levels, and also for people in different regions of the world. Some have wondered whether this could lead us down a path in which two distinct forms (or species) of humans evolve, but I think this would only occur if there were something preventing the &quot;designer&quot; people from mating with the regular people, and its not obvious to me why that would be the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a certain extent, yes. But of course that is nothing new. What is new is the ability of people to find romantic partners from outside of our immediate family/social group/town. I see online dating as impacting our ongoing evolution by altering not only our ability to find romantic partners from different regions or social groups but also by altering the cues we use when choosing a mate (see link to video in my blurb above)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine that for a good while into this process it would be very difficult to differentiate as most of the changes that could be made already exist in decent portions of the general population. Mating within that circle would probably mostly occur within wealthy communities (who can already technically alter appearance and health monetarily) same as today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this will be taken the wrong way, and I dont mean to come off as callous as I am.  But what is the ultimate problem with this?  Why would it be a bad thing for, lets say, 1000 years from now, everyone left is a result of selective genetic engineering and breeding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the already decreasing upward mobility of the lower class could in a few generations be completely eliminated by the popularity of this method, creating over- and under- subspecies of humans...</p>
<p>these Over Men would effectively rule the Under Men with impunity... Nietzsche had an interesting thesis on this... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How likely do you think it is that this sort of procedure would develop into a salable product? I am very skeptical. The genetics of traits as readily observable as height are so complex. I am reading The Blank Slate right now, and this passage about genes and the mind popped into my head:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People sometimes fear that if the genes affect the mind at all they must determine it in every detail. That is wrong, for two reasons. The first is that most effects of genes are probabilistic. If one identical twin has a trait, there is usually no more than an even chance that the other will have it, despite their having a complete genome in common. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that, when we can trace single traits of the mind to genes, they are often caused by many genes with small effects. And even then, those effects are often modulated by other genes. </p>
<p>So, I have a hard time imagining this technology passing the risk/return threshold that you'd need for a winning sales pitch, so to speak. It seems like there is way too much built-in uncertainty, both in terms of delivering the promised effect, and minimizing the risk of unintended side effects (imho messing with a person's genes before they're born is pretty much the ne plus ultra of inviting unintended consequences). People in 2017 freak out about genetically modifying the plants that we eat. </p>
<p>I think this is true for &quot;designer babies&quot; in general, but I think it's especially true of the conception of designer babies as an actual product marketed to the rich. I can't envision even sniffing clearance from the regulatory regime of any developed country. </p>
<p>Plus, I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that rich/successful/powerful people hold their own genes, as well as the genes of their partner, in fairly high regard. So, you have a product that is extraordinarily difficult to develop (and arguably impossible to clinically trial); the status quo that it must surpass is pretty, pretty good; and the desirability of that status quo actually <em>increases</em> the deeper you get into the target market. </p>
<p>I'm sure that research will continue and all that jazz, but actually commoditizing the designer baby, to me, seems like a bridge too far. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the technology would likely become cheaper and therefore more accessible. If it became truly widespread/common then it could have a species-level impact. But again I don't see it causing a split into two distinct classes or species unless the modifications include making designer people genetically/sexually incompatible with regular people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a silly concern. What matters is how healthy people are absolutely, not relatively. When all life on the planet ends, it is, according to your reasoning a great state of being, because it's perfect equality.</p></div>		</li>
