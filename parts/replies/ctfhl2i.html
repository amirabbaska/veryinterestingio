			<div class="markdown"><p>An FM signal is complex.. We use it to receive things like music.  Hence it gets degraded easily by noise and needs lots of power.</p>
<p>I know a guy who does Morse halfway around the globe on a couple of watts.  CW is very resilient as it's the simplest kind of transmission there is... Just stop/start.</p>
<p>The data from new horizons is going to be closer to CW in complexity so it can be heard against the background crap.</p>
<p>All SETI is looking for is something nonrandom, which is much easier to find than a specific signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about &quot;complexity,&quot; it's about wavelength. How far a given signal can travel is as much about its wavelength as it is power. </p>
<p>And btw, what do you mean by &quot;complexity&quot; anyway? An FM signal isn't any different from an AM signal or any other EM signal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply that interference affects it a lot more.  If all you're after is the presence or absence of a signal you can cope with a lot of noise before that information is lost.  It's similar to the way digital signals travel better (the lower the data rate the easier it is to reconstruct the original signal).</p>
<p>Wavelength isn't that relevant other than for propagation.  HF will bounce off the ionosphere so can go a lot further.  VHF won't, so it's limited to line of sight unless you find a handy satellite to bounce it off (or the moon, but that requires stupid amounts of power).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More people should know this about the Kepler mission, there's a lot of misunderstanding about its goal with people thinking this is <em>the</em> mission looking for nearby Earth-like planets and then getting a skewed idea about the possibilities of habitable worlds nearby.  We have to wait for TESS to do a survey of the nearby stars starting in 2017 and then the follow up examination of candidate worlds by the JWST in 2018.</p>
<p>It's exciting because we already know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_terrestrial_exoplanet_candidates" target="_blank">26 exoplanets within 50ly with 10 of them possibly in the habitable zone of their stars</a>.  Once we have a dedicated survey of the nearby stars I think we'll see a massive jump in the confirmed nearby exoplanets if the Kepler data is anything to go by.</p></div>		</li>
