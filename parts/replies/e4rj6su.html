			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick summation: all molecules are vibrating with energy, and occasionally one of them breaks free of the clump it's stuck in to be free: this is evaporation (liquid &gt; gas) and it happens at any temperature.</p>
<p>Additionally, this can happen to solids. They're vibrating less, but still have energy. This is sublimation (solid &gt; gas) and you can see it with 'dry ice', where the solid CO2 sublimates directly into that awesome fog without melting or dripping at all. </p>
<p>Also additionally, you can experiment and find this for yourself at your own home: an ice cube placed in your freezer will eventually evaporate, despite never ever melting.</p>
<p>In summary: water boils at 100C, but it evaporates at all temperatures.</p></div>		</li>
