			<p>Almost, but not quite.  The issue with early GaN films wasn't size, but the challenges of heteroepitaxy on a 'foreign' substrate like sapphire.  Tremendous lattice mismatch of GaN with sapphire led to highly defective films, and even led to cracking and roughening.  This, in addition to the difficulties of p-type doping with Mg, held back (Al,In)GaN-based thin film device development for years.  <br><br>Nakamura and Akasaki's early work lowered microstructural defect density &quot;just enough&quot; (still over a billion dislocations per square cm!) to demonstrate early blue and green LEDs.  To this day, the vast majority of (Al,In)GaN LED films are deposited on sapphire, SiC, and Si substrates.  Native GaN substrates are expensive, and mostly only used for the violet laser diodes in BluRay.<br><br>Source: engineer who's worked on GaN crystal growth for almost 20 yrs.</p>		</li>
