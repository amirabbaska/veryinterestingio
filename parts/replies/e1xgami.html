			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried to simplify it, but I'm not a very good writer.  But, this is a key concept of why making a perfectly efficient desalization isn't a solution to our water problems.</p>
<p>You write a better ELI5 version of what I said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, it doesn't take an author to reduce the concept you're trying to convey to something like &quot;it takes a large amount of energy to convert seawater into freshwater, and there's no way to efficiently reduce the net amount of energy required to convert seawater into freshwater&quot;.</p>
<p>I don't think your response even answers the question though because while reducing the net amount of energy to convert seawater into freshwater would be pretty difficult, methods such as reverse osmosis make the transition from seawater to freshwater cheaper by having a membrane provide the majority of the net energy it would take to convert seawater to freshwater.</p>
<p>Using your marble analogy, sorting the marbles would be easier if you had a &quot;blue magnet&quot; that would grab all of the blue marbles when you hovered the magnet over the random collection of marbles, and likewise for having other &quot;color magnets&quot; for other colors. It would still take energy to sort them, but it would take significantly less energy <strong>on your behalf</strong> to sort them.</p></div>		</li>
