			<div class="markdown"><p>When there is only one time dimension, you can only go in one direction. It's very difficult to &quot;turn around&quot; because your past self is &quot;in the way&quot;. The only way to do it is to &quot;break something&quot; (wormholes, warp drives, etc).</p>
<p>Think about it like a highway. With one time dimension, there are no turn-offs, and you can't go backwards in time without making an illegal U-turn and smashing through the median strip. With two time dimensions, it's like you're in a big open lot, and all you have to do is make a left at tomorrow and you're at yesterday.  So everything is constantly traveling back and forth in time and it's impossible to predict what will happen next, because there's way to tell what <em>just</em> happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense and all, but does that mean it's theoretically possible for something to always be traveling &quot;on the other side of the median&quot;, like an object that moves consistently backwards through time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which pathology in particular? CTCs? Spacetimes with more than 1 temporal dimension? Partial differential equations with ill-posed initial value problems?</p>
<p>These topics span several branches of graduate-level math: general relativity, differential geometry, analysis, etc. So there really isn't one particular resource. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9702052.pdf" target="_blank">This paper</a> is a good overview of why a Lorentz signature of (1,3) is so special.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. How do you set up and solve an initial value problem with more than one temporal dimension? And why does that produce non-predictability in a way that generalizing to an extra spatial dimension does not? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a course on coursera entitled introduction to general relativity (or something like that) which will give you a lot of info. It's very mathematical though. Other than that any text with a similar title will do the trick. Depends heavily on what your background is.  I'm told PBS spacetime is good, and based on the one episode I've seen that seems true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. PBS spacetime is a little ELI5 for me, but /r/Midtek gave some great resource recommendations in his reply too.</p>
<p>Edit: PBS spacetime is a terrific ELI5 resource, though, and they fight to keep the content accurate without losing the lay-viewer!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once played with an idea of cellular automata with 2 dimensions of time and 1 spatial dimension.</p>
<p>Space-time of such automata is 3-dimensional, so it can be relatively easily displayed on the screen. Here is a <a href="http://dmishin.github.io/t2dca/2dca.html" target="_blank">WebGL app to do it</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="http://dmishin.blogspot.ru/2014/06/cellular-automata-with-2-temporal.html" target="_blank">lenghty blog post with my thoughts about it</a> (putting here not for self-promotion, but for pictures), but in short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automata with 2 time dimensions can be thought as pairs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property" target="_blank">commuting</a> regular cellular automata</li>
<li>Commutativity is quite limiting, so automata with 2 time dimensions display less interesting behavior.</li>
