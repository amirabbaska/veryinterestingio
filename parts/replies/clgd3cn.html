			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much the best answer here, but I think I disagree with your analysis on mattress warranty. I've seen Serta replace mattresses over a year into use, so I wouldn't say you would always know a few days in. I haven't the foggiest on how they decide what is wear and tear vs defect, or if they just replace it to make the problem go away, but they do. So with that knowledge, the point of a mattress protector is so that they won't claim that the product was abused judging by the staining on the mattress. Plus there's that old claim about mattresses gaining several pounds worth of shed people gunk over the course of its life. I don't know if that's actually true, but it's what I was trained to say and it seems plausible. And that's yucky, so yeah, I have a mattress protector on my tempur knockoff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Manufacturing defects are generally cracks or breaks in fixtures in the box spring, a broken coil, or a dip in the mattress of a certain depth (which I don't recall exactly I think it was something like an inch and a half.) These generally will manifest pretty quickly. My experience with warranty replacements is that if the mattress is still structurally sound with just some compression of the padding package they wouldn't have us replace it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the thing. &quot;Stains&quot; are meant to mean someone soiled themselves on the bed, but also includes food/drink stains. A lot of sales reps will make it out like if you drop a pen point first into the surface that tiny bit of ink will void the warranty. That is no exaggeration, a coworker used that exact pitch multiples times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have one manufacturer that would void for an ink stain. That's crazy. Thanks for your reply. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of what you said is true, but the statement about buying an entry level style and adding your own comfort layers being cheaper is complete bollocks. Mattress pads, regardless of material, are all cheaply made, shift around the bed, and namely just aren't as comfortable as something that's made to be incorporated into the bed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The recommendation was leaning towards economy. Those padding packages are strictly comfort based, and I would always recommend someone get something they will be comfortable sleeping on.... however, sometimes you will get mattresses identical in construction (same coil count, coil type, same box) that have a huge disparity in cost. An example, when I sold beds, we had three Stearns and Fosters. One came in &quot;extra firm&quot; one was &quot;plush&quot; one was pillowtop. The queen sets were sticker-priced at $899.99, 1099.99 and 1499.99. That's $600 more for what is basically three inches of fiberfill and sci-fi pads and foam. They were identical in every way except for what separated you from the coils. The Beautyrests I sold later were even more sharply divided, with an entry-level &quot;firm&quot; stickered at $799 with    a &quot;world-class&quot; equivalent with no pillowtop stickered above 1500. The TL:DR padding packages are selling points, but do nothing for you that a smart investment at Bed Bath and Beyond could not also do.</p></div>		</li>
