<p>Like give her five toys four of which she knows the name of and ask for the fifth by name (which she doesn't know) and she'll still grab the right one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents just got a purebred border collie puppy. I'm not a dog person, but that dog is amazingly cute and amazingly smart. All he does is sit over the AC vent, until you ask him to do something and he does it. When I visited, my mom spilled his toys all over the floor in the other room, and told him 'clean up!', and he perked his ears, peeked around to the other room, saw his toys everywhere and freaking picked em up and put them in his toys basket. I couldn't believe it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our border collie can recognize certain phrases and key words associated with when someone is leaving so he can go get their car ready. You can also try to say those phrases and key words just to screw with them and he can tell that you're not serious no matter how close your inflection is to the real deal because you didn't do the rest of the getting ready steps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was watching a video about an experiment to see if dogs have some sort of ability to tell when their owners are getting home. During the experiment, the dogs would be left at home while the owner was taken 5 miles away and could only return (by taxi so the dog wouldn't recognize his vehicle sound) when he gets notified by a pager at a random time. Turns out the dogs overwhelmingly started waiting at the window for their owners after the owner got the pager alert, but before they got in the taxi. The dogs would start waiting when their owners intentions changed to going home. (They account for when the dog just goes to the window to bark at things passing by. It suggests that dogs (all mammals actually) have some sort of &quot;telepathic&quot; connection. The stronger the bond, the stronger the connection.</p>
<p>I don't know wether or not to believe it, it was a YouTube video after all. However they did present seemingly legit research but idk. I'm sure if it was proven it'd be more mainstream popular, so I remain skeptical. It is an interesting thought though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly have no idea if my dog understands me or not, but I can say, &quot;Come on, finish your food.&quot; And he'll get right back to eating. Sometimes I have to say it multiple times for him to finish. I never taught him this but he does it anyways. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You could ask her &quot;Where's <em>person</em>?&quot; and if that person was in the room, she would run over to them. Else she would run around the house looking for them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's adorable.  Mine is a border collie mix.  When Piper isn't around and I ask, he'll go to his leash instead.  He also knows how to play dead when I shoot finger guns at him (and does so very dramatically), hop like a bunny, and sit pretty.  He's a good boy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our old dog, not even a very bright one, had a playground friend who died. We had to stop talking about it in front of him, because his ears and tail went up when he heard her name (&quot;Gigi&quot;), and he'd stand up hoping he would finally get to see her again. Dogs understand names. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend Will has not visited in years. Will would play with our dog Sammy as a pup, and Sammy loved it. I can ask Sammy who's at the door and he walks to the door. I can ask, is it Mommy or the baby, or the mail man and he gets excited but if I ask is it Will he goes off the rails. After many years, this dog still looks for his long lost friend. Will doesn't believe it, but it's true...he's broke the dog's heart by not coming by. </p></div>		</li>
