			<div class="markdown"><p>I did generalize &quot;homeless&quot; to mean &quot;so poor to not be able to pay rent&quot;. I'm sorry, I guess.</p>
<p>Also I'm absolutely sure some of them have more money than I do, as I have none. Poor student's life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this was mentioned somewhere else but since you mentioned you were are poor student it worth bringing up that one of the only debts that are immune to bankruptcy are student loans.  Regardless of anyone's financial situation, they will have to pay it back.</p>
<p>Not to get political or anything but this one one of the reasons that there has been a lot of regulation in the higher education market the last few years.  I mean I could go into the details but needless to say, since most people who take students loans are young they end up putting themselves in a big financial hole almost immediately upon entering the working world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not, strictly speaking, correct. It is difficult to have student loans discharged in bankruptcy but if the court determines that repaying them would impose an undue hardship and prevent a minimal standard of living and other conditions are met they can be partially or fully discharged. It's not likely and difficult to satisfy but they are not 100% immune. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say that, but I get a decent salary and yet I owe Â£100k mortvage so I expect I technically have less money than you by quite a way.</p>
<p>Of course I do own a portion of a house for that so if you count property value etc it doesn't look as bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also &quot;broke&quot; doesn't equal &quot;bankrupt.&quot; Broke means having no money. People who file bankruptcy are so deeply in debt that they don't see any way they can ever pay back their debtors, so they agree to give up everything they have of value and ability to borrow money in the future, in exchange for having their debts go away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I agree.</p>
<p>Your anecdotal example of one person proves that the majority of the homeless are secret millionaires.</p>
<p>There have been many, many studies that show that the homeless on the street actually are very rich. I've read many statistical studies that show 95.34% of the homeless have an average of $1.45 million in assets, most of it in cash.  All of us should aspire to be homeless.</p></div>		</li>
