			<div class="markdown"><p>Just enjoy the ride and accept the inevitability of change.  Your body will get older and you will die at some point.  Those things are okay.  Death in particular is nothing especially frightening; I mean the universe existed for billions of years before you were born.  Did you find that period unpleasant?  Being dead will likely be exactly like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are people who specialize in exactly that question. Unlike most doctors who focus on fixing things that have gone wrong (which is awesome and I love them for it), there are some people who work on preventing the various processes of aging. </p>
<p>Check out Ray Kurzweil and Dr Aubrey de Grey. </p>
<p>They're work isn't exactly what I'd call close to fixing aging. But it's nice to know there's people out there who are focused on that question. And, if nothing else, by looking them up you'll get a good sense of what the state of the art is. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the tl;dr on preventing aging is: &quot;We're pretty sure technology, and especially artificial intelligence, is about to get radically more powerful and that'll pull our collective asses out of the fire.&quot; Not exactly what I'd call a bulletproof scientific prediction. But that's what we got. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wellllll, <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/47264/title/Opinion--Aging--Just-Another-Disease/" target="_blank">that may change soon</a>.</p>
<p>There are some that believe the human race may have already reached &quot;escape velocity.&quot;  IE: if your daughter or nephew or whatever is 5 years old now, when they're 60, we will have the tech to reliably extend their life to 100, when they're 100, we can extend to 120 etc etc.  It sounds far fetched today, but look at how much technology has progressed in the last 50 years.  Would it be so strange if our success in treating some of the deadliest cancers and heart issues today is 5 times better in 50 years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is very likely that we will extend life span further over the coming decades, the question is how long life span will be extended. But even if we would extend it for thousands of years, death would still be inevitable. Even if your organs function more or less indefinitely, accidents happen. Let's make it even more extreme, let's say that we extend life span for hundreds of thousands of years and somehow avoid fatal accidents. Even then, the Earth won't be here forever. Nor will the Universe be hospitable forever. No matter how far we extend life, death is inevitable. And on that cheerful note, hope you're having a nice day! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds plausible.  But we've probably got at least several thousand years to tackle those problems too.  Maybe with some help from your friendly AI who can think 1000 times faster than a human.  Possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dying from accidents - androids, consciousness backups, clones.</li>
<li>Earth dies - Crack the technology to travel to and inhabit other planets.</li>
<li>Sun dies - Crack the technology to travel to other solar systems.</li>
<li>Universe dies - Crack the technology to travel to different universes.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't know what the future holds, and who knows if there might be future technology that can extend the limits of the human lifespan (e.g. regenerative medicine, new organs, etc).</p>
<p>However, I've seen a few centenarians and they're really not like most patients who come into the doctor's office.  They don't have high blood pressure, they don't get diabetes, they don't get cancer.  For some reason, they just live 99% of their life fairly healthy.  Modern medicine doesn't do a lot for them...maybe lowers their cholesterol a bit so they don't suffer a premature heart attack...but they just truck along fairly independently.  And then suddenly they don't.  The body just gives out and they're dead within months/years.  This is especially true with supercentenarians.</p>
<p>Modern medicine is helping more and more people live to 80 and 90.  But 100 and 110 and beyond is an entirely different animal.  The oldest woman who ever lived had 122 years and died in 1997; and no one else since has even touched that record.  Maybe it's the Hayflick limit, but I think there might be an extreme limit to the human lifespan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am much more at peace with the idea of dying a thousand years from now than 50 years from now. It's a case of... I want to see so many amazing things to the point that I feel I can go, &quot;...Alright, let's see what next, even if what's next is the complete cessation of me&quot;</p>
<p>I am trying to fix that by exploring more and trying more things, but... I don't imagine it is a worry that will leave me for a long time yet</p></div>		</li>
