			<div class="markdown"><p>Film and tv mixer here. This is a little incomplete.
It also has to do with the nature of where the content is being shown. Film mixes are loud / dynamic because theatres systems can handle the dynamic range well. A flat screen tv with tiny speakers doesn’t do a good job of translating that information. The downmix 5.1 to stereo is usually pretty good. Remember big budget films are for the theatre.
There is lots more to talk about here. But I’m going to bed. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That disparity between action and dialogue is a result of high dynamic range. You see this a lot in orchestral pieces because you want the soft parts to the soft and the loud parts to be LOUD. I'm movies It's basically because the sound is meant to fill a large area so there can be a larger dynamic range due to the inverse square law cutting the punch of the HF and allowing those low frequency sounds to rumble the audience. Fletcher Munson curves are a way of looking at how the ear hears sounds and determine how loud something is to someone. Not necessarily how loud it is in DB. That's important because the Inverse Square law is even more obvious in a small space when those same frequencies can be amplified by resonant frequencies of the room. At home you don't get the benefit of larger spaces and those mid to high frequency sounds are amplified by the space you are in and causes those sympathetic frequencies to overpower everything else and because your ear is able to hear some frequencies better than others, that means turning it up to hear the movie means the mix is worse based on the how close you are to the speaker, which frequencies your home resonates at, which frequencies are most amplified due to resonance, and which frequencies are louder to the human ear. </p>
<p>So you turn up the volume to hear the dialogue but the sound of the gun makes your house vibrate which makes the sound of the gun louder and the sound of the gun has a lot of frequencies that your ear hears louder and your closer to the speaker on your right so it's even LOUDER so you turn it down so it doesn't hurt your ears and can't hear anything they say.</p>
<p>I went to school for this and finally have something meaningful to say. <a href="

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dynamic Range is the term for this issue, and it's the range between the quietest and loudest sounds.</p>
<p>If you're watching on a TV through TV speakers, or want to watch something an relatively quiet volumes, you need a narrow range. So if you set the volume so that dialog is at the right level, when explosions/gunshots/screaming etc kick in, they're only a bit louder.</p>
<p>Some TV and nearly all AV Receivers or Amps will have a couple of Dynamic Range options. &quot;Midnight&quot; is the typical name of the mode with the narrowest range.  In my experience, enabling Midnight mode helps a bit, but it's really down to the original mix. </p>
<p>If you're watching movies on your PC, media players like VLC will have much greater control over dynamic range.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why don't they do what they do now with theaters, but run like some algorithm on the film audio that will normalize it and make it at least a little bit closer for DVD? Obviously I like having the volume variance through movies, I just don't like having to turn it up 30 clicks on casual conversation scenes then turn it back down 30 as soon as the conversation turns to slightly loud talking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my soundbar has an equalizer option which tries to make it less loud and less quiet overall.  I don't notice too much anymore, but a friend that comes over notices it immediately and hates it.  It works for me because I live in an apartment and can't be too noisy, and he owns a house and can be as loud as he wants (read extremely loud).</p></div>		</li>
