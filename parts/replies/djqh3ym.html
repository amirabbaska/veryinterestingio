It happens to my hats when I get them wet too cool me down, I also wash them with soap everyday to keep them fresh and clean and like an hour later they smell like wet dog. And this will happen with brand new unworn clothes if they get wet and aren't hung up to dry, it's from mildew and bacteria forming in the fabric, You will see if You do this with a white shirt there will be a blackish green stain along certain parts of the clothes.
Google why wet clothes that get left wet smell bad not why clothes come out of the dryer smelling bad, op was asking why clothes that are left damp too long smell bad.</p></div>		</li>

leftover soap in your machine and on your clothes
LPT: use less soap, you need about 1/4 of what manufacturer tells you</p></div>		</li>
