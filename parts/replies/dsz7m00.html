			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of life as a series of tasks an organism has to achieve - get nutrients, transport nutrients, excrete wastes, etc. Organs are simply a means to achieve these tasks, and so we can see variation across living things. Microorganisms don't necessarily have hearts or other organs in the same sense that we do, but many do have structures analogous to these organs. take the heart for example, it's main purpose is to pump blood. In organisms without hearts, we still see movement of blood/body fluid. Sometimes, the structure analagous to a heart is as simple as a blood vessel lined with muscle - small contractions push blood around the body (Earthworms for example). </p></div>		</li>

<p>They do have organelles, though, which function as 'single cell organs'</p></div>		</li>

<p>Both pictures in the OP are multicellular organisms, with organs.</p></div>		</li>
