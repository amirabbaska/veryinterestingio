Thanks for being here and please correct any mistakes I have made! (If you can be bothered reading them).
We both know that as an anaesthetist I know little about the intricacies of obstetrics and gynaecology!</p></div>		</li>

<p>the uterus needs to contract (it is essentially a big muscle) to stop these vessels pumping all that blood out of the body</p>

<p>surgical options which I'm not going to detail here</p>

<p>Anecdotal example, since this exact thing happened to my wife. One of them is called a Uterine Arterial Embolization, or UAE. Basically they ran a tube through the artery in her leg into the area around her uterus and clotted/sealed it up. Then they stick what is essentially a big water balloon into her uterus to keep it tight, wait some amount of time (in her case about a day) then decrease water pressure / take it out and make sure it doesn't bleed again.</p>
<p>She needed 5-6 units of blood and almost died.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're describing 2 things here. One is the embolisation procedure which is pretty rare. The other is an intrauterine balloon. As you say the balloon is inflated to help put pressure on those big vessels and stop the bleeding. We use them quite a lot.</p>
<p>Hope your wife is OK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually can find evidence of amniotic fluid in the maternal bloodstream in lots of women but they don't all get amniotic fluid embolism. Why that is we don't really know.</p>
<p>There are a lot more causes of maternal death, OP was asking about bleeding. The main causes vary quite a lot depending where in the world you are but worldwide it's bleeding, infection and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia.</p></div>		</li>
