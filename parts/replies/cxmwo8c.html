			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly right, changes in the gravity across our body are simply far too small for us to feel anything. However, even across the entire Earth the difference in local gravity caused by the moon is rather small, being on the order of 1*10^(-7)<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth" target="_blank">g</a>, or 10 million times less than Earth's own gravity! At first it may appear surprising that such a small effect can cause the sizable tides we observe. The trick is to realize that these differences can essentially add up over large bodies of water (or another deformable fluid).</p>
<p>You can think of it this way: even though the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Field_tidal.svg/1000px-Field_tidal.svg.png" target="_blank">tidal forces</a> acting on any small bit of fluid are quite small, because each bit of stuff pushes against the surrounding fluid, the small initial difference in gravity effectively becomes amplified. Over large enough volumes this process will result in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KN5bOrM.jpg" target="_blank">sizable bulges</a> in the fluid. In other words, the visible effect of tides doesn't just come from the direct pulling caused by the moon's gravity, but also by the squeezing and pushing caused by <em>all</em> of the fluid. This is why tides can be so substantial in large bodies of water like oceans, but almost imperceptible in smaller ones like lakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing people don’t realize—and that the standard diagrams don’t indicate—is that tides aren’t just bulges that circle the earth in sync with the moon (like they would be if the earth were perfectly flat and covered in water). Rather, tides are determined by the shapes of the seas and their resonant frequencies, with the moon and sun acting as relatively tiny periodic driving forces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this.  I was puzzled by tides myself until I got to grad school and sat down and figured out exactly what was going on.  The simple graphics you see in school are somewhat misleading when thinking about what's going on in real life.</p>
<p>It's like holding a pan full of water.  Give it a periodic shake and you'll start to get water sloshing around inside the pan, just like the tides slosh around circularly in ocean basins.  And you may get water splashing up extra high in the corners of the pan as the waves get focused, much like some areas of the ocean can have particularly high tidal variation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And also, one has to remember that the water is only raised a few meters at most over a distance of some 385 million meters. So it's really a tiny, tiny bulge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because the earth is falling towards the moon as the moon orbits around it.</p>
<p>This isn't plainly apparent but in terms of the net forces involved it's easier to visualise as such</p>
<p>The furthest side has the weakest gravity acted upon it so it's inertia likes to stay still. the closest side the strongest.</p>
<p>So what's happening is as the earth &quot;falls towards the moon&quot; or rather as the moon goes around the earth the water on the farthest  side sits still and the earth moves away from it (as it's a solid) thus the water on the furthest side appears to be moving upwards away from the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Imagine a balloon. You hold it and pull on one side. whilst holding the other. The centre contracts together whilst the opposite ends stretch outwards. Only your finger pulling it is causing the stretching but because the other end is being clamped in place it deforms the balloon like the image above.</p>
<p>Think of the moon as the finger pulling, and the earth's water as the balloons surface. Only it's inertia that is holding the balloon in place at the furthest point and not you finger clamping it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Field_tidal.svg/1024px-Field_tidal.svg.png" target="_blank">Here's a picture</a> of the tidal forces on a body with a satellite.</p>
<p>Now, the important thing about this diagram is that it shows the <em>differential</em> forces on the surface of the Earth. The moon's gravity is pulling on all of the Earth, but it pulls on the nearer side more than it pulls on the far side. So <em>relative to the center of the earth</em>, there's an outward force on the far side of the planet. Essentially the moon is &quot;pulling&quot; the planet more than it's pulling the water on the far side, so water levels rise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main affect this has is that it very slightly reshapes the Earth over the course of a day, by like a centimeter. This has a very small effect on the Earth's gravitational field. It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_tide" target="_blank">Earth Tide.</a></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3839482?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">this paper</a>, it can indeed cause earthquakes. I did not know that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't entirely correct, the cause isn't the force in line with earth-moon, it's the perpendicular component of the gravitational force on the water at all OTHER points on the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. And it is not relevant that the moons Gravity is stronger on the near side, it is because it is directed upwards not down. If you had a precise scale you would see that you weigh less with the moon overhead vs below you ( opposite side of earth)</p></div>		</li>
