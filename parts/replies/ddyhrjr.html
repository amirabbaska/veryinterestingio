			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of our brain like a bunch of bridges. Sometimes those bridges collapse. Our brain works by the associated activation of neurons. Things that have to do with &quot;A&quot; like Apples and Airplanes trigger a similar cluster of neurons. Sadly that is about all we know. The exact mechanisms that create and reconcile memory is hard to figure out. Some think of it like a filing cabinet, others a computer. </p>
<p>The thing that we know is that memories are not infallible. They change and they are forgotten. Often you forget about the small, bad things that are associated with some of your fondest memories. Sometimes just the opposite. You can forget things because those bridges used for that memory changed and are being used by others. In the end, memory is hard to predict.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I experienced this quite accurately yesterday; I had bumped into a good comment in a Trump related thread that I wanted to share with a friend, and began searching for it hours later. I only had a vague memory of the thread the comment was posted in (I had read several Trump posts in a row in the morning), and rummaged a bunch of posts in r/news, r/worldnews and whatnot but couldn't find it for the life of me. I was 100% certain that it was in English and it was posted on some big subreddit. </p>
<p>Well, I then accidentally ran into the coveted comment a bit later  in a post on a Finnish subreddit. It'd been there all along; nope, not on any major English-speaking subreddit. </p>
<p>Good job, brain - you couldn't even remember the <em>language</em> of the comment right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the different types of memory that we have (e.g., visual appearance, spellings of the word, pronunciation of the word) are separate forms of memory and are retrieved by different processes that are separate from each other. Psychologists made this important discovery when studying the tip of the tongue phenomenon: that when it occurs people will often know what it looks like or what the definition is but the retrieval of its pronunciation and also often spelling requires more thought. That would not be possible if all of those memories came from the same place because you have some of the memories but not quite all of them retrieved at the same time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of what you said, I have often used a trick to remember things on the tip of my tongue. If I can't remember the name of something, I keep that &quot;feeling&quot; you spoke of strong in my mind while I slowly go through each letter of the alphabet. Certain letters will give more feedback. Usually the first letter of the word or name I'm looking for. But more uncommon letters will still give feedback in my head even if they aren't the first letter. Say I couldn't remember someone named Liz. When I got to Z I would get some serious feedback. Oftentimes doing this is able to fire enough connections in my mind to remember the word or name!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That can work, but it's also more likely to have you chase the wrong path(that is to say chase &quot;Liz&quot; over &quot;Lisa&quot; because there's some strange stress or something), by far the most reliable is also the one people know most of, forget you're trying to remember it, then start again.</p>
<p>If you're using the bridge example in the first case a bridge is blocked so your brain took a detour and wound up in a dead end stuck unable to work out how to continue because your brain is so focused on just getting across the water that it doesn't want to turn back and try a different route when it's already so close, while in the revisit your brain remembers the last path was a dead end and takes another route with more success this time.</p>
<p>With some practice it's actually possible to do this by deliberately overloading your short term memory to &quot;forget&quot; and then restarting the thought process, although this does mean you get a second or two of you zoning out while it happens, so it's not perfect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy crap, this happened to me a few hours ago. I could remember an automobile transit event in Australia similar to Dakar but in the 50-70's era; I knew it started with &quot;R&quot;; knew it was a brand name event; knew that brand was for auto-lubricant type products; could visualize the black and white news reel footage of cars smashing thru bull-dust and doing on-the-fly repairs... but someone else had to provide the name... Redex Trials ! Was like, ahh snap... WTF brain?</p></div>		</li>
