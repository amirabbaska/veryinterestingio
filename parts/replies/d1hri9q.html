			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly not among salarymen. Though I'm willing to bet they're not the demographic that drives Japanese longevity rate upwards. Working extremely long hours and then going to party until late night can't be good for health. There's a reason why the Japanese have a word <em>karoshi</em>, &quot;death from work&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese longevity is mostly from old Japanese people taking good care of themselves. They have a good healthcare system and people get their checkups regularly, they keep everything nice and clean and play it safe, and the Japanese government has pushed things like exercise and salt reduction very hard onto the older generation and elderly, while in America most lifestyle awareness campaigns just worry about the kids. Getting the elderly to do radio exercises every morning is going to improve your life expectancy rate much more than getting kids to play some flag football for a couple years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that means the assumption that Indonesians die of other things before they're diagnosed with lung cancer doesn't hold true for the Japanese at least. Isn't there a French Paradox too? The French smoke more than Americans and have a more fatty, high-carb diet than many other countries but still have a lower rate of cardiovascular disease. </p>
<p>I recall reading a conspiracy theory that the atomic bomb tests in the US somehow irradiated tobacco crops. That's obviously insane but a pretty interesting idea nonetheless. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never specifically heard of a French Paradox. But I have observed that Europeans seem more likely to smoke (particularly Italians), they eat large portions at meals, and they consume much more alcohol (lunch and dinner). Why are American's the butt of all the jokes about health? </p>
<p>I do realize that my observations were limited and not reflective of all or most Europeans. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Because a large amount of your population is unhealthy, worse than most of these European countries. This is despite spending more than any other country on health. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in Japan not too long ago.  They still permit smoking in restaurants. What completely blew my mind is this: we were sitting next to people who were literally chain smoking, lighting up their next cigarette with the previous one. We did not smell a thing. If I didn't see it myself, I would have never believed there was someone smoking 5 ft away from me.</p>
<p>That has to count for something...</p></div>		</li>
