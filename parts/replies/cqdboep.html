			<div class="markdown"><p>...But.... wait what? Doesn't the &quot;probabilistic nature of electron distribution&quot; speak to the possible POSITION of the electrons at any given time? This would have nothing to do with the density of atom as far as I can tell. </p>
<p>mass of matter / volume of overlap of all electron clouds = density of the atom, right? It doesn't matter where the electrons are within that volume, just that they have exist and have mass. </p>
<p>Otherwise, if what I'm saying is not what you meant, then wouldn't you be suggesting that electrons aren't actually particles but are... clouds? This would be news to me and I'd ask you to explain. I thought electron cloud just referred to the possible space that the actual electron particles could be in for a given atom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons in atoms don't really exist as particles or waves but a bit of both.</p>
<p>Hey are something that it is very difficult to conceptualise. We talk about electron clouds which represents the space the electron, if we consider it to be a particle, could be found. But when considering how atoms and molecules interact it is better to think of the electrons as being everywhere in that electron cloud at once.</p>
<p>When we consider a pi orbital in benzene say, we treat the whole doughnut shapes above and below to be where the negative charge is, we don't just think that there are 6 point charges floating around in that space.</p>
<p>The weird thing is that we CAN observe the electron as a particle. There are special cameras that can pin point its location. If we do it multiple times then we find it in lots of different locations. Which means it must have moved, moving in a fixed volume must require some kind of acceleration, this is impossible for an electron, it would lose all its energy. That means instead of moving it was everywhere, it only had a location as a particle when it was observed.</p>
<p>If this is hard to grasp don't worry. Feynman said that anyone who claims to understand quantum physics, doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess the issue is that you cannot talk of a &quot;particle&quot; when its location is inherently fuzzy. In fact we indeed reason in terms of clouds when we do chemistry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, truly. This is all somewhat humorous to me. </p>
<p>I recently started doing some general tutoring for a student on the side and one of the classes she's taking is &quot;Physical Science&quot;. We got to the chapter on atoms and the textbook was relying on Bohr's model of an atom. I remember thinking, &quot;Here I am teaching this, but I know it isn't considered correct anymore. I wonder how far off it actually is.&quot;</p>
<p>I suppose I found my answer... VERY OFF! And the textbook was published in 2004! </p>
<p>I either have to wonder who is making these textbooks, or I have to wonder if we've reached a point where the going theories in the science has become so complex that we have to fall back to outdated models to even begin to explain the concept to young students, even if the models are severely flawed.</p>
<p>The whole thing seems somewhat ridiculous to me. I'm literally teaching a child lies and that's just a microcosm of what is going on in classrooms around the country. Isn't that mad? The book should probably be retitled &quot;The History of Physical Science&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this doesn't really correlate with our common-sense notion of &quot;emptiness.&quot;</p>
<p>Consider the amorphous carbon -&gt; diamond transition. When you crush carbon, it forms the diamond crystal structure. The amount of mass hasn't really changed, the atoms are just closer together. So would you call the amorphous carbon &quot;emptier&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't every object &quot;fuzzy&quot; to some extent? of course any macroscopic objects will have very well defined position, but I thought they still had infinitesimally small fuzziness to them.</p>
<p>So I am technically a probability function that fills the universe...no? </p>
<p>Universe is full of me. Feels good man. </p></div>		</li>
