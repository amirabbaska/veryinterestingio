<p>This irks me to no end. It's such a frustrating barrier to breach when teaching electronics. I know the rule-of-thumb is &quot;it's the wrong way round&quot;, but there is always that in-between stage that everyone gets confused about which is the right way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>15 years in the engineering field and this still messes me up. I can hook up anything just fine, but trying to really understand galvanic series of metals, anodic corrosion, magnetic fields, and battery compositions, I just can't keep it straight! Thankfully I'm a mechanical engineer so I don't really have to know it. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you had to know it, you would. It is one of the things that is hard to remember, but when you regularly work with it it becomes rather trivial to distinguish. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this:</p>
<p>I've posted this elsewhere, but here's an additional interesting fact: it turns out that the fact that we call electrons and protons &quot;electric&quot; charges, instead of magnetic ones, is also partially due to convention. In other words, when we say that magnetic charges &quot;don't exist,&quot; that's not quite technically correct:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#Duality_transformation" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#Duality_transformation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#Duality_transformation</a></a></p>
<p>Allow me to explain:</p>
<p>Most of us are familiar with the fact that electrons having &quot;negative&quot; electric charge and protons having &quot;positive&quot; electric charge is merely a matter of convention. If we suddenly decided that the opposite should be true, that electrons should be positive and protons should be negative, and at the same time also changed the definitions of electric and magnetic fields so that E -&gt; -E and B -&gt; -B, that is, we also put a minus sign on all of the electromagnetic fields, then all of the minus signs end up cancelling out, and all of the physical predictions of electromagnetism (the motions of charges, etc) remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Now, if we work with a slightly modified version of Maxwell's Equations which allows for the possibility of magnetic charges (in other words, we don't automatically assume div B = 0), then this more general version of Maxwell's Equations actually has an even broader symmetry - it is possible to relabel electric charges as magnetic charges, and vice versa. For example, I can decide that electrons and protons are not electric charges, they are in fact magnetic charges, and so long as I make the corresponding change E -&gt; B and B -&gt; -E, then all of the changes once again cancel out, and all of the physical predictions are the same! This duality symmetry means that in fact, whether or not we refer to the electromagnetic particles we are familiar with as &quot;electric&quot; or &quot;magnetic&quot; charges is partially convention.</p>
<p>So then what is the correct statement about the experimental status of the search for magnetic monopoles? What is in fact true, and is <strong>not</strong> a matter of convention, is that every charged particle we have ever discovered has the same <strong>ratio</strong> of magnetic to electric charge. To make things simpler, we have chosen this ratio to be zero, thus accepting the convention that all charged particles have zero magnetic charge.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about this, Jackson's textbook on Electromagnetism has a treatment of the subject, and I believe his textbook is the source listed for the Wikipedia article I linked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure which question you answered (the two questions in the title would have opposite answers). But here's the clarification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there any underlying reason we say protons are positive and electrons are negative?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would it work if we just switched both in all our equations?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty much, yes.</p>
<p>To elaborate: If we considered protons as negative and electrons as positive, the physics wouldn't change. Though we may have to modify signs in equations here and there. Specifically conventional current and physical current would now both flow in the same direction (i.e., from positive to negative), therefore certain signs will have to be flipped in many equations.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong>: As an aside, why do we have two kinds of currents, conventional and physical, which have opposite directions? Honestly, a mistake that should've been fixed long time ago (latest by the 19th century) but scientists and engineers never got around to fixing it. (There are plenty of similar issues in many STEM areas and is one of my pet peeves. Therefore, in my opinion, when people find STEM classes hard, scientists/engineers/mathematicians themselves are partly to blame).</p></div>		</li>
