			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the issue with ELI5 is that the people here often have serious misunderstandings about the topic, and as a result their answers are more &quot;mindfucky&quot; or &quot;cool&quot; while being easier to understand after a quick skim. Those posts get upvoted more and it just perpetuates these misconceptions. It's honestly really frustrating to come across a thread that you know a lot about (not talking about this one, mind you) and seeing the top answers all be wrong or very incomplete.</p></div>		</li>
