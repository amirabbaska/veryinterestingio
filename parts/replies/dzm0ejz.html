			<div class="markdown"><p>Speech therapist adding on: the surgery to remove vocal nodules is also very risky for singers. There's a high likelihood that the surgery will cause irreversible scar tissue buildup on your vocal folds that will permanently change the sound of your voice. Also even if the surgery was successful, if the artist continues singing, the nodules will likely come back if they are singing the same songs in the same way. Prevention and non surgical treatment is definitely preferred! (Side note Adele is extremely lucky but probably screwing herself over)</p></div>		</li>
