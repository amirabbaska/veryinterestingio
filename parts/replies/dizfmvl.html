			<div class="markdown"><p>The worst was when I was waiting for the single person bathroom at work and this lady came out and walked quickly past me, avoiding eye contact. </p>
<p>I wasn't prepared for the stench. She must have had some funky shit going on down below because that bathroom smelled rancid. Like rotting flesh.</p>
<p>I had to hold my shirt over my nose and try not to breathe while taking my piss. I tried to wash my hands but in the split second from letting go of my shirt that pugent scent hit my nostrils and made me nearly pass out gagging. </p>
<p>That smell was stuck in my nose for a good 30 minutes afterwards. I kept gagging trying to explain this traumatizing event to my coworkers. </p>
<p>It was literally the worst smell I have ever smelled and I can't imagine a worse smell even existing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this is also why odors (and taste) are so intertwined with memories. The next time you smell the same odor, or perhaps even think about it, your brain gives a wave of nausea to keep you from considering ingesting something like that again. </p>
<p>For instance, I shudder and gag every time I think of menthol mint schnapps after a bad experience in high school 15 years ago. My brain does not want to be poisoned again!</p></div>		</li>
