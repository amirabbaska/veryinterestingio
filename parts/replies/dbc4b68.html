Though, i've been quite impressed on that front as it seems to pick up when I go to sleep with reasonable accuracy despite having been laid reading making little movement for a while (Charge 2 - does having a HR monitor on it affect it compared to other models possibly?)</p>
<p>Doesn't distinguish the awake periods quite so well though - mostly just classes it as restlessness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sounds like your fit bit is not working so well? My cheapy knock off says I sleep from bed time to wake time. Looked at it most mornings when I first got it and was impressed it knew when I woke up with in 8 minutes of what was right. As for sleep during slow periods in my day- never has it said that. As for the deep sleep and rem- I ignore that- not really caring if its right or wrong- does me no good to know at any rate.</p></div>		</li>
