			<div class="markdown"><p>As a contractor, cigarette smoke can be remediated, curry cannot. Period. There is no amount of paint or cleaning that can remove curry smell from a house. Drywall must be ripped out, all flooring must be removed. </p>
<p>If the house you want to buy smells like curry, find another house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would help. It is a very strong odor and penetrates the gypsum. I have put kitchens in garages for families who cook a lot of curry, which is the best way to keep the smell contained. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I've also noticed that cooking things in general smells really good in the kitchen, but really bad just a little bit outside the kitchen</p></div>		</li>
