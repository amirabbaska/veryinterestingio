			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. That explains the stories I heard about victims of severe beatings by rubber clubs (to leave no visible bruises) dying from kidney failure. I thought they were being beaten on the kidney area (in the small of their back), but the potassium level and toxic protein in blood make the location of beatings irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to research it for the same morbid curiosity.  I was just wondering why someone would die without bleeding out or sustaining critical head trauma or internal injuries.  Turns out, not so unlikely.  Also why a person with a massive bruise isn't just &quot;well, that leg hurts a lot&quot; but otherwise healthy.  The whole body is in some trouble and may be &quot;sick&quot; from a bruise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This- and many forms of torture, including burns- may further injure or kill by causing rhabdomyolysis (&quot;rhabdo&quot;). This is where proteins from damaged muscle tissue leak into the bloodstream.</p>

<p>This is probably the only correct answer in this thread. Either the hyperkalemia will kill him in the short term, or the renal failure over a few days.</p>
<p>One correction to your post, there can be early hyperkalemia that's not from renal failure, but comes from from damaged muscle cells leaking potassium.</p></div>		</li>
