			<div class="markdown"><p>I can also burp on command by &quot;swallowing air&quot; as you said but (at least for me) this swallowing action is actually not the same mouth muscle action as swallowing nothing. I learned to burp-swallow air as a kid and have done it lots over the years and this action is now very easy for me, but I just recently figured out how to swallow nothing as hiccup cure and it is much harder and takes conscious effort that burp- swallowing does not anymore. </p>
<p>So anyways, I guess what Im saying is that what you are doing is similar but not the same as what OP is asking about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm misunderstanding the OP. The &quot;rapidly swallowing&quot; is what makes me think of burp swallowing. Is this more about the ability to open the throat allowing a more straight shot past the epiglottis?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the main difference is the difference between swallowing air, which is easy to do rapidly (at least if your practiced at it), and swallowing literally nothing, which is a lot harder. So the best way i can think of to explain this is when you burp swallow you open your jaw with you mouth closed, creating a pocket of air which then you force swallow and it immediately comes back up as a burp. But try to keep your jaw in a closed posistion and swallow, like you would if you had too much saliva in your mouth. The first time you do it you probably succesfully swallow any excess saliva, but if you try to continue to do this with out allowing any saliva to build up it becomes increasingly more difficult with each swallow. Give it a shot! I think if you try it youll feel the difference as well. </p>
<p>I think what OP is then asking here is why is it that rapidly swallowing litterally nothing, not even air, is so much harder than rapidly swallowing anything else.  </p></div>		</li>
