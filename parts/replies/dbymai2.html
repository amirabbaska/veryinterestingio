			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm fond of the idea that it's your brain sorting, rearranging, and filing the events, sensations, and memories of the day.  Dreams are sort of like a story that would emerge if you had to construct a narrative based on the books you pulled and moved from your bookshelf to make room for new books.</p>
<p>Obviously there is a lot more going on (stress, hormonal and chemical changes, etc), but it's an idea that has always made sense to me.</p>
<p>The problem with that is that things that &quot;make sense&quot; are not always true or correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unpopular opinion, but I think the mods should ban ELI5 questions about dreams. Make it a sidebar rule or something. We just don't know enough about dreams and it's tiring to see a question about dreams hit the front page every week, where the answer is always &quot;we don't know&quot; or &quot;we <em>think</em> that&quot; or something similar. I don't learn anything new and that's why I'm subbed here.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's necessarily unpopular at all. Dreams are so beyond the realm of known science that it simply can't be accomplished within the constructs of ELI5. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd think, but a lot of the top comments were making comments as if it was scientific fact when really they're talking about hypotheses or philosophical pontifications </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because people are going to this place to look for simplified scientific explanations.</p>
<p>I'm actually starting to get annoyed by this.</p>
<p>If this isn't the intent of this subreddit, can I go somewhere else to see science explained for a layman?</p></div>		</li>
