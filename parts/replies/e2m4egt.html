			<div class="markdown"><p>Very much. This comes up often in chemical resistance.</p>
<p>For instance, exterior paints (like on your house siding), people use mildew cleaner (containing bleach) to remove the mildew. Bleach is obviously a strong oxidizing agent. Depending on the paint system (acrylic, alkyd, etc) and the pigment type, it needs to withstand this oxidation. So again, more durable pigments will be used in these exterior applications that have much better chemical resistance. A Pigment Violet 19 will oxidize very quickly and turn white under bleach attack. Pigment Red 122 will last longer. Pigment Red 202 is mostly unaffected. These three pigments all have the same basic structure, with V19 being unsubstituted (no functional groups on the quinacridone), Red 122 is dimethyl, and Red 202 is dichloro. These functional groups change the color of the pigment, but all increase chemical resistance and light resistance.</p>
<p>Oxidation resistance is determined by the pigments structure. Some are inherently more resistant that others. Again, going back to the theme of conjugation and lots of ringed structures that can handle this attack and free radicals better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad this was finally addressed. Everyone else is so focused on ionizing radiation and radical mechanisms they've completely overlooked the fact that intense sub-UV light will create heat so chemical/oxidative decomposition of pigments will also be accelerated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!  This is so cool to learn. I painted my house with high-grade paint 18 years ago.  It was a grey-blue and instead of turning a dull gray over time, it turns to a mostly-blue.  I was quite curious how or why, and although you obviously cannot/did not address the specific pigments in play here, your answer gave me enough understanding to feel satisfied.  Perhaps some red pigment used converted to blue.  It happens in the first 3 or 4 years (where I live it's sunny ~250 days/year) and then is very stable until it needs a new coat 10 or 12 years later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a grey blue there was likely three pigments involved. Inorganic titanium dioxide (white), carbon black (black), and phthalocyanine blue. </p>
<p>All three are extremely durable. The blue is likely shifting very blue which seems add but it happens. 12 years is not uncommon for these pigments. You also probably bought a high end paint which has a high end resin system which matters most. Good on you. It really pays dividends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most organic compounds are white. They reflect all light wavelengths. These pigments reflect specific wavelengths which is how we see what color they are. </p>
<p>As they're broken down into smaller and smaller organic compounds, chances are, they're white or the pigment is actually removed from the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most substances will not have a distinct colour and be colourless. The molecules it degrades to lose the initial pigment's unique trait of having colour and revert to regular molecules.</p></div>		</li>
