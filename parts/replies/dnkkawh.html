			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither, Heathrow Airport Holdings is entirely private, and has been for ~30 years.</p>
<p>Most of the &quot;British <em>whatever</em>&quot; companies (Airways, Gas, Telecom, Airports Authority, Rail) are in private ownership, or have been split into chunks and the chunks are in private ownership (apart from the subsidized parts, like Network Rail)</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher fucked us over nicely on that one, the miserable bitch: she and her government sold off basically everything for knock down prices to their friends, and now we get worse services than the rest of Europe, and pay more for the privilege.</p>
<p>My favourite part is that British Rail is now mostly run by the Dutch, German, and French national rail companies, making them a profit they can use to subsidize their own services.... because the concept of &quot;Run it properly and keep the fucking profits&quot; apparently doesn't make sense to our dipshit conservative governments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree. Our rail service is an absolute joke. The only good thing for me is how fantastic the London underground is. It's at its brink, but F*** me it's fantastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's now called heathrow airport holdings, but I do believe it was birthed from the privatisation of the airports that happened in the 70s/80s</p></div>		</li>
