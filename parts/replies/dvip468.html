			<div class="markdown"><p>When I've had a bad gallbladder (and when it was misdiagnosed as Pancreatitis) as well as kidney stone it feels &quot;dull&quot;.  Despite it being an awful pain (8.5 or 9 out of 10) it still feels more like being hut with a hammer.  Is that because of the relative lack of internal nerve endings?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have an answer but can second the experience. I had my gallbladder removed last year and it was partially necrotic. </p>
<p>The pain was dull and intense but was <em>different</em> from sharp pains like cuts.  Felt more like deep dull pain combined with pressure that felt like bear hug from a vice press. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer but you lose points for making me feel like an ignoramus for only kind of understanding an apparently oversimplified version. </p>
<p>You get the points back for including an actual reference. </p></div>		</li>
