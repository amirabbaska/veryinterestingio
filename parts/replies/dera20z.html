			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically this is a wrong use of the words &quot;renewable energy&quot;. Renewable energy can mean anything, it's not necessarily just solar or wind. </p>
<p>Also as far as I know, batteries make it non-renewable, because we spend specific resources to produce them, and can't get these resources back. So in essence instead of feeding the system with coal we're now feeding it with batteries. This is unlike wind turbines for example, because these can be almost completely recycled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh... You know batteries don't produce the energy, right? They just store it temporarily. They're also rechargeable. And of course the infrastructure requires resources to build, that's the same as any power generation method. That doesn't mean the energy isn't renewable though.</p>
<p>Also I never said solar and wind are the only source of renewable energy, they're just the most common and at the moment most viable ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you just explain the concept of a battery? I'm not attacking you or anything but I thought this was common knowledge? I'm only asking because I've seen a lot of people explain batteries when talking about this subject and it's starting to worry me that the general population might not know what a battery does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We all know what a battery does; I was explaining why we need to store the energy. People who aren't familiar with power generation might not be aware of the limitations of renewable energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also generators have an optimal speed where their fuel efficiency is maximised.  If you have a big power buffer on there you can run them at peak efficiency most of the time.</p></div>		</li>
