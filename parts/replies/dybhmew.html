			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats in particular can fall asleep almost instantly after laying down. They have one of the most optimized sleep cycles, where they sleep in short bursts throughout the day, so that they don't leave themselves vulnerable for a long stretch of time, and also every 5-10 minutes of rest they get is actually useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My cat must be aware that he's at zero risk of getting eaten by a predator, because sleep is all he does. Seriously, he's not interested in any of the toys we buy him, and he'll eat catnip and then just go to sleep afterward. If he isn't using the litter box or eating, he's sleeping (or sitting in the middle of the living room and meowing loudly to let us know that his food dish has fallen below an acceptable level).</p></div>		</li>
