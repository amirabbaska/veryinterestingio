<p>2) You'll have to migrate at some point anyway. Legacy systems are legacy for a reason. Security, efficiency, 3rd party stuff, availability. Hell, even if I wanted to run a server farm with only pre-2000s hardware, I'd probably have some serious issues as soon as something breaks, because that stuff doesn't get manufactured anymore. No amount of goodwill will make a pile of old Athlon CPUs pop out of thin air.</p>
<p>To be fair, most companies only start caring about security AFTER they are breached and lose vast sums of money on it, so you're not alone. I know a company that had servers running old OS, which was (relatively) alright up until WannaCry came along and there was no patch to secure those computers against it. On the other hand, computers running a new OS with still ongoing support didn't get infected at all for the most part, because the patch was deployed in a timely manner and those systems did have anti-malware. Thus, everything reliant on those servers was on full halt for several days, while everything that wasn't reliant on the servers was running just fine within hours for the most part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At some point, spare parts start to cost ridiculous amounts. 512mB DRAM from circa 2004 will cost you way more than 16gb DDR3 today. At some point, it just becomes unmanageable; you are using fileformats and protocols that are not so compatible; USB was one such divider that pre USB just will not work where as if it has USB, you can most often get that thing back to alive. Memory is one, if it supports DDR3, you are already winning cause the cost of replacing RAM is smallest. </p></div>		</li>
