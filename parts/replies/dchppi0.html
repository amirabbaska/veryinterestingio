			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't tell you if it had a trunk unless you already knew about trunks.  You'd know it had something big on its face that wasn't bony and was probably fleshy and flexible, but you wouldn't know if it was something like <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Egz2f5_Ip3U/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">a star nosed mole</a> had or if it had <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2632/3944370409_b9fe889953_b.jpg" target="_blank">a long trunk like an elephant</a> or a <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e2/a6/7b/e2a67b12a1bc732f76774596acf174be.jpg" target="_blank">short one like tapir</a>, a big <a href="http://elelur.com/data_images/mammals/saiga-antelope/saiga-antelope-07.jpg" target="_blank">flexible nose like a Saiga antelope</a>, or something else all together. </p>
<p>We would be able to estimate the mass from the anchor points on the bone and, perhaps, something about how strong or flexible or active it was, but differentiating between something like an elephant's trunk that can grasp and an enormous pig nose that's used to snuffle through the ground and dig things up would be nearly impossible without a <em>lot</em> of extra clues. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elephants have their trunks mostly because their necks aren't long enough to put their heads to the ground.  You could predict their diet from their teeth etc., and then see that the elephant was going to have trouble getting at plants on the ground. Then you would see points for a bunch of muscle attachments on the front of the thing's face, and from there you would be able to predict the appendage.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>theres a lot of questions when it comes to the trunk shape, there is an extinct elephant called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platybelodon" target="_blank">platybelodon</a> and they aren't sure what its trunk looked like so they just sort of made it up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fully-fledged trunk requires more muscular attachment than a fleshy snout. This is why some have argued that the <a href="http://www0.museociviltaromana.it/content/download/4913/63006/file/652_655.pdf" target="_blank">deinotheres</a> (link downloads paper directly) had the latter instead of the former (because of insufficient attachment area).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably, but it would also depend on how it was used and what for.  If the pig-like snout was used for flipping over heavy rocks and pushing into rotten logs it might be hard to tell it apart from a longer one that was more of a big drinking straw.  </p>
<p>Of course, modem elephants have trunks that are not only big, but immensely strong as well.</p></div>		</li>
