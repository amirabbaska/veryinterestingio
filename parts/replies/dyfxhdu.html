			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where pretrial prep with your prosecutor is essential. Won’t solve all the problems, but it can avoid a lot of the issue where you wish they’d ask a certain question. Of course in reality your Prosecutors may not give you that option if their case load doesn’t allow them that kind of time to prep with witnesses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still amazed at how many DA's subpoena examiners and never reply to requests for a pretrial meeting.  I know they're busy but a quick &quot;What do you expect to get from my testimony?&quot; would probably be the first thing on my mind if I were in their seat but it will continue to be one of the great mysteries of my career.</p>
<p>Then again I did sit on the stand for an entire week with the defense asking variations of &quot;Why didn't you go back to the scene and pull additional video footage&quot; for 8 hours a day 4 days straight.  When I asked the DA why there wasn't an objection to a question that had been asked and answered the response was &quot;He looks like an asshole to the jury by badgering you over something you've already explained, he's losing the case all by himself&quot;.  Well thanks for the lifeline there chief good to know your game plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it can be challenged, but can't a witness volunteer information if they think it's vital/critically relevant, like your example?</p>
<p>I understand either prosecution or defense counsel might be able to challenge unsolicited statements, but isn't that option still there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A witness can, a forensic examiner can only testify to the facts, evidence, procedures used in the lab, and their training.  There are exceptions but they're uncommon.</p>
<p>ex. I have 10 pictures of cats on a computer, one of which is a lion.</p>
<p>Def: &quot;According to your report there are 10 pictures of cats on this computer, is that correct&quot;?</p>
<p>me: &quot;That is correct&quot;</p>
<p>Def: &quot;Did the lion kill my client's dog&quot;</p>
<p>me: &quot;I cannot answer that question, the evidence I examined did not pertain to the death of the deceased dog.&quot;</p>
<p>Def: &quot;Could a lion kill my client's dog&quot;</p>
<p>Pros: &quot;Objection your honor, it is not Examiner XYZ's area of specialty and any answer would be speculative conjecture&quot;.</p>
<p>Judge: &quot;Sustained.&quot;</p>
<p>And that's pretty much how testimony goes.  I could have very well found an email that said &quot;I'm going to feed that dog to my pet lion&quot; but if nobody asks about it I can't forward that information to the jury.   </p></div>		</li>
