<p>Black neighborhoods were separate from most white neighborhoods (or at the very least, they were designated on a street by street basis). So, &quot;Should we put all the Japanese in a camp?&quot; doesn't sound too bad as long as it's not in your backyard.</p>
<p>Today's equivalent is something like Guantanamo Bay; those that support it don't have to live with the reality of such a place on a day-by-day basis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In some states racial intermarriage was still officially a crime in the early 1970's, you could theoretically go to jail for it. That is only 45 years ago or less. Living relatives of ours were a part of that and the hate is still there, you don't completely end those types of deep seated prejudices in a generation. </p>
<p>Especially not when the government encourages it to distract you from internal problems caused by very white very rich people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also had many internment camps for <em>Germans,</em> not just Japanese.  Nobody seems to remember that.  Probably because this undercuts the idea that race was the all-encompassing, or even the dominant or determining factor in forming the camps.</p>
<p>Though I'm sure at the time many people cared <em>less</em> about the Japanese camps than the German ones for that reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or because the German internment was significantly less than the Japanese (36% German),  despite those of German ancestry being a greater proportion of the population at the time.   Kind of like how we focus on African slavery in the US, while not really going into Native American slavery.  Hell, you bring up the Germans, but not the Italians beung deported and locked up.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because people forget the Italians were part of the axis , and their numbers were quite small compared with both German and Japanese groups being 'locked up'.</p>
<p>I also don't get what point you're making here - you complain about me mentioning Germans, because a smaller fraction of them were interned, yet demand I mention Italians whose proportions were smaller still.  And the existence of an additional group (the Italians) further emphasizes my point that the decision was based on national security threats over race.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it would take a long time to argue, but I would also posit that the potential loyalty of Japanese to their homeland and especially their the Japanese emperor was considered much greater than loyalty of American-Germans to Hitler.  Hitler was a cult of personality, but never 'God'.  And that cult, the Nazi movement, was built up over a very short number of years.  Which means exposure to it was limited for 1st generation immigrants from Germany that had emigrated before the early 1930's, and any 2nd generation German-Americans that were educated in Germany while living with relatives.</p>
<p>General 'Fatherland' loyalty and support for Hitler's general ideas, was certainly still possible. And judged quite probable given the internment camps, obviously. But fanatical, zealous support for Hitler himself seemed much less likely compared with the instituted Japanese culture of their emperor being 'the divine one'.</p>
<p>Ultimately we're still arguing differences in degree, not kind.  Japanese were interned. A large plurality of Germans were interned.  Apparently Italians were interned as well, which further adds to the mix.  (I care only about the internment, as being deported only makes sense if they were Italian citizens, not American citizens, and I see nothing wrong with deporting citizens of an enemy country.  It's certainly nicer (and riskier) than locking them up.)</p></div>		</li>
