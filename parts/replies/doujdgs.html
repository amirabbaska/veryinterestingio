			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what the colony is fouraging - it does not get transformed into something else, it is still the substance they bring into the nest and feed each other with. For a lot of species of ants that is honeydew from &quot;milking&quot; aphids, as is described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid#Ant_mutualism" target="_blank">here</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nectar i believe? It's definitely not fat. Ant love sugary stuff, and some ant will farm smaller insect(iirc aphids, and some case some caterpillar) that secrete sugary liquid for them to harvest, so in this case Honeypot Ant, based on their name i believe it's flower nectar(or honey).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ants are amazing! Some  have dedicated warrior castes - huge ants with mouths that only work for killing - their sisters need to chew their food for them. Some tend to fungus gardens and herd domesticated caterpillars. They live in huge underground cities. They weave colonies in the tree leaves. They shoot acid. And of course, they go to war with, and enslave, other ant colonies.</p>
<p>Like the Zerg indeed!!!!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what fascinates me the most about ants (and they're absolutely fascinating creatures all around), they have goddamn agriculture! We all knew ant farms are a thing, but ant farmers are legit as well.</p></div>		</li>
