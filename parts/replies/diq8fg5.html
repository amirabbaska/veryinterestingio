			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's just as renewable as regular wood. In fact coppicing was commonly used to provide wood for the production of charcoal. I imagine that the tree would still require thorough fertilizing since it would quickly burn through nutrient in the soil.</p>
<p>It's no more efficient than chopping down a regular tree for wood except you don't have to walk as far and you can get especially straight posts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it be a bit more efficient since the whole root system is still there? As in the coppiced tree wouldn't have to invest energy into its base? </p></div>		</li>
