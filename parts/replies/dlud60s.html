			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I assumed it was because I was only getting the yellow part of the spectrum as the sun's rays get dispersed, but this was REALLY yellow. As if I were seeing the whole world through those old Ambervision lenses or a pair of shooting glasses.</p>
<p>What I'm curious about is why do we get that wavelength so heavy after a thunderstorm and not every evening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking it's because the blue sky is blocked, giving only the yellow wavelengths from the side, and some of those reflecting back down from the clouds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, this makes sense. The sky directly above was blocked, thus the part of the sky that would reflect the blue wavelengths would not be seen. You can see it in the pic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw the green sky at night once during a Hurricane and I thought the world must be ending. I was pretty high at the time tho. I had never thought I would see the sky that color. It was awesome</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from tornado alley and before tornados, the sky and everything is a very distinct green color, regardless of the time of day.  This only happens with tornado-producing storm cells.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Green skies are an indicator of severe weather, which could mean hail... And in the states, hail means conditions are favourable for a tornado... So most people link green and tornado...</p>
<p>Edit: green skies = extreme, but not always hail or tornado.</p></div>		</li>
