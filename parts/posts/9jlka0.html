		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm consolidating a couple of points others have made:</p>
<p>1) the anchor isn't always needed to keep a large ship in place. The chain is so large that the weight of the chain, when stretched out across the water between the the ship's hawse pipe (the opening on the bow the anchor chain passes through to the water) and the anchor creates a heavy center of mass between those two points for gravity to work on it. Even on a smooth hard bottom the force of gravity pulls that chain down and quite literally pins down the ship in most conditions. A section of chain near the anchor actually does rest flat on the floor of the ocean when this happens. <em>edit</em></p>
<p>2) If an anchor properly digs into a muddy or sandy bottom, it did so by a horizontal tension. This is created by letting out more anchor chain than would be needed to drop the anchor straight down beneath the ship, and doing so is standard procedure even though getting the anchor to &quot;dig&quot; isn't always necessary as explained above. When ready to weigh anchor, the ship's crew starts winding up the anchor, slowly pulling the ship towards the spot where the anchor rests directly below it again. Once the chain tends vertically again, the anchor will literally have tilted back to vertical as well, essentially digging itself back out. Think of the way a fish hook might be taken out of something by turning it to a different angle. Then the anchor can be pulled all the way up. </p>
<p>Rocky bottoms are generally avoided if possible to avoid doing damage to reefs and to avoid lodging an expensive anchor into a rock and not being able to retrieve it.
Additionally, large ships never anchor in water deeper than their anchor chain allows them; it's much easier to just drift if you must stop actively moving around and the water is too deep for anchoring. </p>
<p>Edit: previously misstated that <em>no</em> anchor chain rests in the bottom; this is false, generally there is a section of chain that sits on the seabed with the anchor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m going to skip sea anchors/drogues altogether, which are used to keep vessels pointing into weather while at sea. </p>
<p>For smaller vessels:</p>
<p>When you drop an anchor and its rode (chain/rope/cable or combinations of them), it’ll hit the bottom and settle. You want to let out enough, so as the vessel is pulled back, the angle of the rode vs the bottom is small enough that the forces are as horizontal as possible, so the anchor digs into the seabed. </p>
<p>When the rode is chain, it will help keep this angle, because it’s heavy and it wants to lay on the bottom.  This will keep the anchor dug in as much as possible, but heavy weather can cause the anchor to drag along the bottom, so you’re basically plowing the seabed. </p>
<p>For weighing anchor, as you pick up the rode you are increasing the angle of the rode to the point to where it’s pretty much vertical to the seabed. Pulling further will break the drag between the bottom and the anchor, and voilà... anchor’s loose. Note: try not to snag your anchor on rock, etc. You might have to dive for it. </p>
<p>For larger vessels:</p>
<p>Process is the same, but anchors on large (read tankers, container ships, Navy, etc.) ships are extremely heavy, and the anchor MIGHT NOT dig in, even if designed to. Basically the vessel in this case will be held in place by a heavy hunk of iron laying on the bottom, and the forces of the vessel pulling on the combo of anchor/chain aren’t enough to move the anchor, so the vessel stays in place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of small boat experience. </p>
<p>Chain is not to weigh the boat down from moving. An anchor needs to lay flat on the bottom. Most anchors are shaped like a hoe for plowing. The more you pull on it , horizontally, the more the anchor goes into the ground. Making it harder and harder to move. If you don’t use chain then the rope will float and begin pulling up the anchor.</p>
<p>I have no idea how big anchors on cruise ships work. As their shape is completely different than inland anchors. </p>
<p>Also. There are different anchors for each application.
Rock - uses kinda like a grappling hook looking thing that has bendy hooks. That way when it hooks a rock, they can still release it.
Mud/sand - several different styles. The hoe I was talking about. There’s also a bell looking one.
Poles - some people will just shove a pole in the ground and tie a loop to it. Obviously shallow water. </p>
<p>Source - I’ve been boating longer than I could drive a car. Family owned a marina growing up. Been around more boats than most sailors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
