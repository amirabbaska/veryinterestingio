		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As of the past 3 weeks or so I have been in an unhealthy rut of not eating more than once a day. Even the food I do eat would not be considered a balanced meal in the slightest. With working and going to college I became irresponsible with my eating habits, eating out mostly due to the convenience factor and low-cost. However I have been noticing that I get way more sleep at odd hours, (14 hours on off days) and it has become a nuisance when it comes to waking up for class on time. I'm wondering if a sub-par diet has any relation to sleeping more and imbalance of my circadian rhythm? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both of those things—poor appetite and extra sleeping—are also signs of depression. It's something to at least be aware of. </p>
<p>I know that for myself, when I find myself in that position it is usually a sign that I am drifting down into a depression. What's more, not eating well and not sleeping &quot;right&quot; both tend to aggravate depression, causing a pretty vicious cycle.   </p>
<p>If you think this could be the case, look into different avenues of help. Depression is no joke.<br />
Be well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bad diets can definitely have an effect on your sleep schedule. I was in the same position as you in November, I didn't understand why I was sleeping all the time or why, after a full night's sleep, I was waking up exhausted. As I worked irregular hours I would never eat proper meals or eat well at all. The lack of healthy food in my diet was essentially starving my body of iron, leading to constant fatigue. The best thing you can do is try to eat more red meat (I.e. Steak) or get more dark, leafy greens in your diet (ideal would be kale, but spinach is also great!). Try to get more protein in your diet as well, so maybe take a bag of mixed nuts as a snack if you're on the go. It's difficult changing your diet, especially if you're busy, but you'll start to feel much better for it pretty much immediately, and it can help get your sleep schedule back on track too! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>maybe your body is not receiving enough nutrients, which are required to do both physical and mental activities. so, if this is correct, you may be sleeping more because you are not consuming enough food to keep your body energized. just a guess. try eating smaller, healthy snacks throughout the day. this will allow you to consume nutrients conveniently. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like me in College. I excercised minimum 30 minutes of cardio every other day and I started sleeping less and having more energy. I still have my ups and downs but for the most part I can get it down to 6-10 hours a night... I had the same problem you had about sleeping 14 hours a day and my sleep schedule consuming me, making it difficult to get to class on time.</p>
<p>Get several alarm clocks. Not several on your phone, but like, one on each side of the room, one that turns a light on, one that plays a song you hate (etc etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would suggest ...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hydrate, straight water.  2L is enough</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 grams of sodium / potassium ( try lo salt  or regular salt in water will help)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>daily multivitamin * optional</p>
</li>
<li>magnesium gylcinate in powder form ( way cheaper ) and have that mixed in water when you wake up and before bed.   </li>
</ul>
<p>Sleep is important but even more important is quality deep REM sleep. This will get your electrolytes taken care help your sleeping be deeper so you will naturally wake up 6-8 hours once your body fully recharges. </p>
<p>It is also best to eat once big meal rather than snack, look up intermittent fasting.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
