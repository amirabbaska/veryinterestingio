		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although we've attributed the self-righting nature of bikes to gyroscopic and trail effects for centuries, more recent investigations show that a majority of this nature is due to the fact that the front steering assembly has a lower center of gravity than the rest of the bike, causing it to fall faster, dictate the direction, and put the wheels back under the center of gravity.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure someone can explain this way better. But when you're riding on a bike you make mini corrections when steering to shift the center of balance which can't be done while the bike is still. Similar to balancing a broom on your palm by shifting it around before it falls.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This video about a reverse bicycle (one designed so that when you move the handlebars to the left, the front wheel turns to the right) includes a great explanation of how it works, and how a reverse bike is totally impossible to ride at first. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you tilt on a bike, the front wheel turns into the fall. </p>
<p>When moving, the spinning front wheel is a gyroscope. So if you start falling to the left, the wheel will turn to the left and a gyroscopic torque will twist the bike back over to the right.<br />
<del>The bike will also accelerate to the left as the direction of it's velocity changes, adding to the self-righting affect.</del> I need to think more about this bit, but I'm basically trying to describe what you feel when you're playing 'corners' in the back of a car. All parts of the bike have that same feeling pushing them to the right, but the bottom of the wheels has friction against the road keeping it in place. This flips the bicycle.</p>
<p>When you're still you might as well be trying to balance on a plywood cutout.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's due to rotational inertia and angular momentum of the wheels. If you've ever done the popular bike wheel experiment, where you spin a bike wheel and tilt it, you'll feel a torque on your arms trying to force it back into the vertical position. That is due to the rotational inertia from the wheel.</p>
<p>You can see the experiment that shows these forces in action here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnS2d24HCK0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnS2d24HCK0</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
