		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water wonâ€™t get hotter than the boiling point of 212f (100c). Try frying anything at that temperature and see how soggy it gets. Oils all have smoke points which range from ~350f to 500f. Hot enough to boil the water out of anything and make the outside crispy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because oil is not water, ELI5 incoming:
In cooking, frying is referred to as a dry-cooking method. Dry cooking means: you make the food have less liquids than before, in the end resulting into crisp food like say chips/crackers.
However, when you boil you put MORE water in the food and spreading the pieces of that said food all over the container of water if it is soft. In the end you have soggy food.
Plus what all the other guys say about oil being able to maintain a lot higher temperatures escalating the dehydration of the food you fry.
Enjoy your fried chicken mate :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process that makes browns food and makes it crispy is a series of reactions between sugars and amino acids known as the Maillard reaction. This reaction takes place at around 140-160 degrees Celcius (280-330) in Fahrenheit which is well above the temperature of boiling water, oil can easily reach temperatures above that and thus allow the reactions to proceed. Temperatures below that treshold will only break down the structure of the food and result in it getting mushy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically water boils at too low of a temperature for the Maillard reaction.  The Maillard reaction of amino acids and sugars results in things like browning of steaks, coffee roasting, darkening of breads and other baked goods, browning of french fires, roasting of peanuts, etc, so it is very important for cooking.</p>
<p>That reaction occurs at around 300F degrees, which is too hot for boiled water (212F Degrees) but easily within the range of oils.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
