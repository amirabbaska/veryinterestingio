		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well there's the correspondence principle which basically says that if you scale the physics to &quot;everyday life&quot; measures you should get Newtonian Physics back. However that's not a strict mathematical derivation of the fact, that's common sense (and woe is he who trusts it). The proof is in the form of a statistical (thermodynamical) analysis which shows that for large objects quantum mechanics tends towards classical mechanics.</p>
<p>Having that said, the fact that there is sound for example (or perhaps better: quantized electrical conductivity) shows that quantum effects can still be seen at these scales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The behaviour of some systems is chaotic, which means that even very small changes to the starting conditions may lead to big differences in outcome. </p>
<p>Unfortunately Heisenberg's uncertainty principle means that we can't measure all the parameters we'd need accurately. This means that, even with infinitely fast, infinitely accurate computers, our predictions could still be wrong, because we lack the required input data (and fundamentally cannot acquire it). </p>
<p>The best we could do in principle would be to Monte-Carlo simulate a lot of start cases that are within the measurement error and look at the range of possible outcomes. </p>
<p>In practice, we don't have infinitely fast / accurate computers, nor do we have the ability to measure millions of particles to the Heisenberg uncertainty limit, so we are much worse off than that theoretical best case. </p>
<p>Fortunately, many systems are not chaotic, which means that roughly-right inputs give roughly-right outputs. That's why we can predict many physical phenomena (just not all). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there's a reasonably well understood thing called quantum decoherence which rather precisely describes how &quot;quantumness&quot; tends to be lost to the environment over time due to inevitable interactions between the system you are interested in and the rest of the universe, particularly the immediate environment. Very small numbers of quantum particles are easier to isolate from their environment whereas larger numbers of particles presumably are more difficult to &quot;contain&quot; thereby losing their coherence i.e their quantumness more readily. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the contrary, I'd say that there is a rule, or principle of physics, that the laws of particle physics do scale up to macroscopic systems. That doesn't mean that we are able to compute the behavior of macroscopic systems from the Standard Model, just that if we were able to do so, and it didn't match the actual behavior of those systems, we would assume that there is an error in the Standard Model.</p>
<p>That could be wrong—it wouldn't be the first time that a seemingly sacrosanct principle of physics was overturned—but everyone works under the assumption that it's true as long as there's no evidence that it isn't.</p>
<p>We actually have a fairly good understanding of how macroscopic classical behavior arises from quantum rules. Quantum probability averages out to classical probability in incoherent systems (systems where the phases of the quantum amplitudes are random). The technical reason for this is that if you add two quantum amplitudes, a+b=c, the law of cosines says that |a|² + |b|² + 2|a||b| cos φ = |c|², where φ is the relative phase of a and b. If φ is random, the expected (average) value of cos φ is zero, so you get |a|² + |b|² = |c|² on average, which is the classical rule. Macroscopic systems inevitably become incoherent through interaction with the environment, via blackbody radiation if nothing else. This is why macroscopic quantum phenomena like superfluidity require very cold temperatures—warmer objects emit too much blackbody radiation. High temperature superconductivity is not well understood, but there must be a kind of natural insulation of certain parts of the superconducting medium from others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
