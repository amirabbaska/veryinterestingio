		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally juries have two choices, Guilty or not guilty. There is an assumption that for you to be presented to the courts that an incident has taken place and it is generally taken that the jury needs to get <strong>beyond reasonable doubt</strong> of your guilt. </p>
<p>There is no general definition of beyond reasonable doubt, because what is reasonable is different from one person to the next.</p>
<p>For example, you're found in a room with a baseball bat and a broken vase. We are trying ascertaining whether you are guilty of breaking the vase. </p>
<ul>
<li>Evidence is presented that you were in the room, witnesses say they saw you go in the room. They heard the bat swing, they heard the vase crash to the floor and smash.  </li>
</ul>
<p>From this information, you could reasonably be found guilty, you had the means (baseball bat) and opportunity (you were in the room). To Joe Average, you hit or knocked the vase over when swinging the bat. At this stage, with this infomation, it could be reasonable to find you Guilty.</p>
<p>You defence team comes along and add further information including:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Your cat was also in the room and she is very scared of baseball bats swinging through the air, she tends to scramble when scared and it was the cat that knocked over the vase. Witnesses are able to confirm that the cat was present.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now in my mind, as the jury, I think you are guilty. And without the presentation of the defence I would find you guilty. But because of the evidence that the cat was in the room, I can't be completely sure that it wasn't the cat. Now because I now have reasonable doubt and I now can't move beyond that, I need to find you not guilty. I still think you did it, I don't think you are innocent. For all I know you either hit the vase or caused the cat to knock over the vase, so I don't think you are innocent so i find you 'Not Guilty', because I can't move beyond what's reasonable and find you guilty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's precisely because you're presumed innocent until proven guilty that you're found not guilty.</p>
<p>The burden of proof is on the prosecutor to prove you're guilty. If they fail to prove you're guilty, it doesn't mean you're innocent. It means <strong>they could not prove you did it</strong> which means you're not guilty. </p>
<p>Let's pretend there's a oreo cookie jar in a room with 2 children Tom &amp; Bob. Tom always does the right thing and doesn't like ores. Bob always lies and loves oreos. Let's pretend Bob ate the cookies while nobody was watching. If you came back into the room, you suspect Bob did it. Tom says Bob did it. Bob says Tom did it. It was probably Bob but you can't prove it. It's unlikely but possible that Tom lied (reasonable doubt). Since it's innocent until proven guilty, Bob would be found not guilty. He's not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but he's also not innocent. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food for thought:</p>
<p>in Latin, guilty can be translated &quot;nocens&quot;
and not guilty is: &quot;innocens&quot;</p>
<p>The expression you are mentioning comes a French dude, Jean Lemoine, and he suggested: &quot;item quilibet praesumitur innocens nisi probetur nocens&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone is presumed innocent if not approved to be guilty&quot;</p>
<p>you see the problem there, the latin word &quot;innocens&quot; made it into English. The other, &quot;nocens&quot; not so much. English has its own version with &quot;guilt&quot; from Old English &quot;gylt&quot;</p>
<p>In German, neither word made it. So, &quot;innocens&quot; is just &quot;unschuldig&quot; (literally: not guilty) and &quot;nocens&quot; would be &quot;schuldig&quot; (guilty). So, if you translate the same expression from Latin into German, and then from German into English, it would be &quot;Not guilty until proven guilty&quot;</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, your question is just an English thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you're technically not trying to prove your innocence. They are trying to prove your guilt.</p>
<p>You still might not be innocent but guilt hasn't been proven.</p>
<p>So the verdict is in relation to whether or not the prosecution has managed to prove guilt or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The spirt of the phrase &quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot; is more &quot;You should be considered to be innocent until proven guilty&quot;</p>
<p>The trial is not to prove that you are innocent, it's to prove whether you are guilty or not guilty. Being proven &quot;not guilty&quot; is not saying you've been proven innocent (even though you should be <em>considered</em> so) just that there is not enough evidence to prove guilt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
