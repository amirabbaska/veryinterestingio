		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>While I'm a layperson (biochemistry undergraduate student currently) I've thought of how prevalent mental disorders (seem) to be in humans. I've wondered if this is due to how complex our brains are, having to provide for rational thought, reasoning, intricate language etc. </p>
<p>Essentially my back of the napkin theory is that our brains are so unimaginably complex, there has to be some mess ups along the way leading to mental disorders. Furthermore, I wonder if that other animals with brains not as complex as ours experience mental disorders less severely or not as often.</p>
<p>Is there any science discussing this and the prevalence of mental disorders in relation to brain complexity?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mental disorders definitely exist in &quot;lesser&quot; animals, and in some cases is quite well-studied. Notably, mice with anxiety disorders are viewed as a valuable model organism for the study of mental disorders in humans, and so some strains of mice are often bred to be more susceptible to anxiety disorders for use in this purpose.</p>
<p>While observing mental disorders in the wild is difficult by nature, and it is not clear whether such animals are capable of surviving in the wild on their own, there is a significant body of observational research done on mental disorders in captivity. Usually this occurs in animals which are brought into captivity due to trauma, but unfortunately it sometimes occurs in animals which are kept under poor conditions. Self-harming behavior, such as birds that groom themselves to the point of injury, are particularly well studied.</p>
<p>Of course, studying this under natural conditions is difficult, so it is hard to say if mental disorders are more or less prevalent in humans relative to animals, are if human mental disorders are more complex and/or severe. But mental disorders apparently similar to human mental disorders definitely occur in animals.</p>
<p>I learned about this in class, and can't seem to find our original reading, but for some further reading on similar subjects:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many animals experience <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_SpBX5jqxyEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=mental+illness+in+captive+animals&amp;ots=ljMT9IFjND&amp;sig=9Xs0r0vByI7re199tHE7oXjPUQo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">mental disorders</a> and abnormal behavior. In the wild, the prevalence is unknown, perhaps very low. However, in captive animals, there are numerous documented instances of extremely deviant, dysfunctional, dangerous, and distressed behaviors. For anyone who hasn't taken abnormal psychology, those are the 4 d's that define what  &quot;abnormal&quot; behaviors are, thus showing a spectrum from normal/ healthy to abnormal/ill.</p>
<p>I read an excellent book called &quot;Animal Madness&quot; that describes human and animal mental illness across time. We used to do incredibly inhumane things with intelligent animals such as elephants, apes, and parrots. Locking them up in small concrete cages with no mates, no enrichment, no natural sunlight, nothing. They would often go insane. Self mutilation, stereotyped, repetitive actions, killing human handlers, I mean the list goes on and on. Many animals are social animals and, much like humans in solitary confinement, go crazy from lack of interaction and stimulation.</p>
<p>I'm really into bird behavior and parrots are notorious for neurotic, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159109002561" target="_blank">abnormal behaviors</a>. In the wild, most of the behaviors have never been documented, but under-stimulated parrots will pluck their own feathers out, mutilate their skin, scream, and pace relentlessly. They'll rock and do very <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432803001153" target="_blank">stereotypic</a> behaviors, much like individuals with autism or people who abuse meth.</p>
<p>I suggest reading about the history of captive animals and zoos. Animal Madness is a very good read, but it can be absolutely sickening. Human exceptionalism has made us deny how truly intelligent many other creatures are for a long time. It has caused a great amount of suffering. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think another important facet to think about here is that as humans we set our own criteria for what a mental disorder is.</p>
<p>Let us just grant the premise that any disorder in a human could also occur in a dog (or insert your favorite animal here).</p>
<p>Even if you made that assumption, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mental_disorders" target="_blank">sheer number of disorders</a> that are uniquely human (in regards to a human interacting with the rest of human society) would suggest that there isn't a great comparison to be made. There is an inherent bias towards human specific disorders.</p>
<p>Someone who steals may be considered to have a mental disorder but would a dog who steals also be considered to have one? What about a person who occasionally pees on the carpet? What would a dog with a gambling addiction look like?</p>
<p>I would argue that at this current point in time not only can we not <strong>truly</strong> define what a mental disorder is (e.g homosexuality used to be considered a disorder into the 70's) but much of what we consider a disorder/illness is based on the rules of society (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44249/" target="_blank">which vary across the globe</a>). Given the somewhat limited understanding of many diseases (we still don't even known the underlying molecular mechanism of schizophrenia!), it would be hard to answer this question without encroaching on the arena of philosophy and ethics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
