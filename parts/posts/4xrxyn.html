<p>While I'm a layperson (biochemistry undergraduate student currently) I've thought of how prevalent mental disorders (seem) to be in humans. I've wondered if this is due to how complex our brains are, having to provide for rational thought, reasoning, intricate language etc. </p>
<p>Essentially my back of the napkin theory is that our brains are so unimaginably complex, there has to be some mess ups along the way leading to mental disorders. Furthermore, I wonder if that other animals with brains not as complex as ours experience mental disorders less severely or not as often.</p>
<p>Is there any science discussing this and the prevalence of mental disorders in relation to brain complexity?</p></div></div>
