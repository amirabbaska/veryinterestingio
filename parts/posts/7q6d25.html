		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine life can physically traverse the canal and locks. </p>
<p>However, the Panama Canal connects two salt water bodies together with roughly 40 miles of freshwater.</p>
<p>So, while the fish could physically traverse the locks and canal, it is unlikely that they would survive the 40 miles of freshwater travel needed to pass through the canal.</p>
<p>There have been multiple studies as this question is not uncommon, but I believe it is still not known of any marine life that has successfully passed the entire canal from one ocean to the next.</p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> I should clarify I was speaking to larger marine life. /u/datums brings up a very good point for smaller marine life. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7q6d25/eli5how_has_the_panama_canal_effected_fish_and/dsmrgpa/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7q6d25/eli5how_has_the_panama_canal_effected_fish_and/dsmrgpa/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sorry, couldn’t help myself.  But the freshwater issue is what I’ve always understood to be the impediment when I asked the same question years ago to some engineer friends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The canal doesn't actually &quot;connect&quot; each body of water.  Think of the canal as river that splits - half of it goes east, and the other half goes west.  Boats go up river, reach a high point, then go down river in their journey from each side. </p>

<p>Panama City, FL, picked up its name from residents who began referring to the area (then called St. Andrews) as the new Panama City when a large fruit company was considering it as a port city at which to relocate from New Orleans. Tampa ended up getting the bid, but the name stuck. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
