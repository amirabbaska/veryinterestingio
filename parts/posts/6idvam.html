<p>also yes ants don't have eyes i know that now. i just meant something small that does have eyes.</p>
<p>Edit 2: ok ants DO have eyes.</p>
<p>also why am i on the front page for asking if elephants can see ants? this is the best day ever!</p>
<p>FINAL EDIT: somebody gave me gold, and this has become the third top post ever on askscience... that is not how i was expecting this to go. thank you all!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>in terms of optics and photoreceptor density, which are the principal factors in a creature's visual resolution (&quot;details per degree of visual angle&quot;), there probably isn't much real difference between the <em>angular</em> visual resolution of e.g. a jumping spider and a house cat - both can see, at best, about ~10 details per degree. so if you shrank a cat down to spider size (or vice versa), they'd both have similar limits to the smallest things they could see.</p>
<p>but since they're different sizes, the sizes of the things they can see will also scale; since the eye is getting smaller, its <del><em>near point</em></del> (i think i meant 'depth of field' here) is getting proportionally shorter. so if a jumping spider's eye is a thousand times smaller than a cat's eye, it can potentially resolve details that are a thousand times smaller than what a cat's can resolve. a cat can never get optically close enough to a grain of sand to make it a degree wide, so that it could see 'ten details' on its surface, while this optical distance is easily available to the spider.</p>
<p>the caveat to this general scalability of vision is in the &quot;noisiness&quot; of light, i.e. factors like diffraction (limitation in how small of a point can be focused) or chromatic aberration (the difference in focal distance for different light wavelengths) - for a big eye with a big pupil, this noisiness is insignificant, but for a spider's eye it is getting significant, since all of us are looking at more-or-less the same light bandwidth. jumping spiders, for example, deal with this by having retinas at different focal depths to try to account for chromatic aberration.</p>
<p>but this stuff gets complicated, especially considering that the range in optical quality and photoreceptor density across species washes out most of these limitations. i think you could safely suppose that, in the range of terrestrial creature sizes, vision basically scales with size.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> the important thing is that things scale, but my concepts are confused re &quot;near point&quot; etc, see /u/craigdubyah for better/more detailed info---</p>
<p><em>edit edit</em> sorry i didn't keep up with this, was busy all day; but let me excuse the rough edges of my answer by saying it was a lot of well-informed hand waving and of course i didn't try to go into detail about diffraction and lens power and etc etc; i just wanted to get the basic gist across that vision should more-or-less scale with the size of the eye, receptor sampling being equal (as in the cat/spider comparison). field of view, pupil sizes, etc, all very important but another time and place, ok?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really.</p>
<p>Eyes are very complex, and you can only make them so small. If we reduce vision to it's basics, we get rods and cones that are light-sensitive and are relaying that information (I see light!) to the brain. You can only pack so many of these in on an atomic scale.</p>
<p>It's kinda like how cameras kept getting higher and higher megapixel counts. Eventually the individual sensors get so small that you can't fit any more of them in, so you need to put them on a larger sensor area, which makes the lens bigger, which makes the camera bigger. </p>
<p>Eventually scale will always get you.</p>
<p>Now, the flip side: how do we see very small things? Either we use lenses to make them appear larger (spread the light out over a larger area, so that our relatively-widely spaced sensors can see the difference between 2 areas), or we cram a ton of sensors into a smaller area.</p>
<p>Again, lenses are the limitation. Which is why bugs have big eyes. </p>
<p>Another interesting side of the lens equation is light quantity! Smaller lenses don't allow as much light through, so you have to do more with what little you get. More <em>sensitivity</em> to light becomes more important with smaller-scale lenses, at the cost of less resolution. </p>
<p>And another thing to consider: Multiple images. If you take 10 pictures of an area and merge them all together, you get higher detail, which allows you to see the details better.</p>
<p>Bugs have lots of eyes. ;)</p>
<p>That all being said, no they don't see microscopically well. Small things are still small things, and small eyes won't see them without some kick-ass glasses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so in terms of physical optics, and not taking into account the limits of biology, a smaller aperture means less resolution. There are simply not as many photons coming in to tell you about the world, and there are limits to how far a given aperture size can zoom in before diffraction starts to make things blurry.</p>
<p>Optically speaking, an ant would have lower limits on its visual acuity than an elephant.</p>
<p>Biologically speaking, since we can't focus at arbitrarily close distances, ants would be able to see small things better, and elephants could probably only see ants in small groups, the same way we can see groups of blood cells, but not individual ones.</p>
<p>The pinhole effect mentioned elsewhere is only relevant to the lens of the eye, it's the aperture that determines maximum angular resolution, and the retina that determines how much of that resolution a creature can make use of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://webecoist.momtastic.com/2009/01/14/animal-vision-color-detection-and-color-blindness/" target="_blank">Different animals have remarkably different types of vision.</a> Ants and most other insects have compound eyes. So bug vision and human vision are apples and oranges. Visual sharpness is a function of focus and resolution. Resolution is limited by a) the number of receptor cells used to draw an image and b) the color of light/radiation being perceived.</p>
<p>There's a physical limit to how small a microscopic thing that can be drawn with the 390-700nm visible light range, so it's not like tiny eyeballs could see viruses. Ants clearly see antennae and hairs on their nearby sisters, but it's not clear that ants can see our eyeballs at distance or a Paramecium in a water drop.</p>
<p>The sharpest visual acuity in human-like eyes is found in eagles and other raptor birds, as sharp as 20/5 or 20/4 as we can measure it. Eagles don't have large eyeballs, even for birds, but they have exceptionally dense receptor cells. It's estimate they could resolve ants from atop a 10-story building. I would see a palm-sized tile in the sidewalk; eagles would see tiny dots painted on it, and that some of them were moving.</p>
<p>I've read anecdotally that elephants aren't &quot;afraid of mice&quot;, but that they probably see mice as blurry, unfamiliar movement near their feet. If cantaloupes are clear and mice are blurry, then ants are probably &quot;microscopic&quot; to elephants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leaving out actual biological examples and speaking strictly in terms of the physics of what would happen if you shrunk or grew a human eye, kind of. </p>
<p>If you took a normal human eye and shrunk it down, the iris would shrink with it. This is equivalent to having a camera with a tiny aperture. If you have glasses, try taking them off, making a really tiny hole with your fingers and looking through it - you'll see clearer. This is also why squinting helps you see - you're looking through the tiny holes in your eyelashes. This makes both near <em>and</em> far clearer - what photographers call &quot;increased depth of field&quot;. The tradeoff is brightness - make the hole too small and not enough light gets in. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you grew an eye, the iris would get larger, eventually it would be a gaping hole and the eye wouldn't be very functional at all. With a quarter sized iris I would guess you could still tell things like the direction of the sun and such, but not much more. </p>
<p>The size of the lense, on the other hand, makes no difference. It's the shape of the lense that determines whether the eye sees near or far, not the size. </p>
