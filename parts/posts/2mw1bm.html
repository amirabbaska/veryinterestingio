		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes you will, and you don't need <em>incredibly</em> high gravity for that. Just precise measurement tools. Normal Earth gravity is enough. You can actually observe how time goes ever so slightly faster on the Moon, or on GPS satellites. Though with the GPS satellites the effect is offset somewhat by time dilation due to special relativity, the overall speed up is still positive: a GPS satellite clock goes faster than an Earth bound clock by 45 microseconds a day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our satellites in orbit of our own planet experience time dilation that needs to be corrected for. Typically only massive gravitational forces would result in such obviously measurable dilation. It you were in the process of entering a black hole, the dilation would be so immense that to outside observers everything would appear gradually more stationary as it grew closer to the event horizon. I suppose if you placed a clock on a planet with super high gravity and visually observed it from a huge distance, it would appear to tick more slowly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Conversely, if you were on a space ship, orbiting a planet that was very near a black hole, and 2 of the three occupants left that ship to go down to the planet, leaving one remaining observer with a telescope to watch the 2 explorers, would the observer see them moving in super slow motion? </p>
<p>As in, the time spent on the planet would amount to a couple of hours for the explorers, but would translate to around 23 years for the observer that stayed on the ship. What would that observer see through his telescope during that 23 year span?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
