		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may be due to the practical limitations of precipitation-hardened aluminum alloys. That temperature (or 450 Â°F) is commonly used as a reference point above which the precipitates become unstable and can redissolve. That creates an intrinsically weaker microstrucure, reducing the alloy's hardness and tensile strength. There is some discussion of this in the introduction to basic aluminum-silicon alloy technology in <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030106070.pdf" target="_blank">this 2003 Conference paper</a>.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>AMT here.  Cylinder head temperature is largely based on how well the cylinder head dissipates the heat generated by combustion inside the cylinder. 232deg. Celsius is a fairly constant combustion temperature recorded by cylinder head temperature probes.  If a cylinder is recording higher than this it is usually a sign that you should check for pre-ignition (which is when the fuel air mix inside the cylinder ignites off of an overheated portion of the metal as opposed to the spark plug) or that you have an issue with the fuel injection system, intake manifold, etc.  </p>
<p>Source : AMT, Airframe and Powerplant license.  Many rebuilds and troubleshoots on aircraft reciprocating engines. </p>
<p>Edit: worth mentioning that the answers posted in regard to the thermal durability of aluminum and metals are also correct too.  Repeated overheating of a cylinder head leads to failure of the valve system and structural damage that can render an aircraft Powerplant un-airworthy</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, petroleum engineer here so I have a slightly different theory on this. I'm not exactly sure it's about any certain metal or alloy, heat dissipation, or anything else anyone has mentioned so far (not my area, so I can't speak for sure on those). But I think it's about the greases and lubricants used.</p>
<p>Back in the 50's, Standard oil company developed a new high temperature grease. They thickened silicone oil with aryl-urea to make it. It was able to withstand temps of 450 deg. F. (232 C) for long periods of time without breakdown of the grease. It became the standard and widely used in aviation after that.</p>
<p>American Oil,  Du Pont, Royal, Dow Corning, Exxon...they all make a high temp grease today with that as the upper operating range. It's kind of the de facto go to grease for ball bearings used in high temperature areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Adherence to the R-985 Specific and General Operating Instructions (Vol 1) is essential, in particular:</p>
<p>While ground testing engine, do not exceed 232 degrees Celsius cylinder head temperature. Temperatures above 200 degrees C should be confined to the minimum possible duration.</p>
<p>Excessive cylinder pressures and cylinder temperatures usually result in detonation, pre-ignition and loss of engine power.  This can lead to failure of cylinder base studs, flange cracks and/or separation of the cylinder head from the barrel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think detonation is the big one. High ICP and high CHT could result in detonation. Jet fuel auto-ignites at around 210 C. CHT measures the residual temperature from combustion. The cylinder itself shouldn't be igniting the fuel during cruise or ground operations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally something I can actually add to concerning my degree. The temperature is usually at the starting point of a tempering embrittlement. If the steel was not designed (using correct heat treatments) to operate at higher temperatures, embrittlement of the structure will occur. This reduces the tensile strength and can cause failure over a certain period. Instant failure is very unlikely. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
