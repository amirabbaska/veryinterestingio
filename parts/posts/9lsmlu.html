<p>Basically there’s regions where rain is unlikely to form due to global air currents as hot air at the equator rises and then falls beyond this zone</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These regions are in a band of latitudes known as the sub-tropics. There is a large circulation of air know as the Hadley cell, in which air rises near the equator and descends in the sub-tropics. When air descends in altitude, the pressure increases and the relative humidity goes down, making the air drier. This also helps explain dry regions of Mexico and Australia. Clouds and rain are very unlikely to form in these regions because of this constant supply of dry air. This also happens over the sub-tropical ocean regions, causing less rain there.</p>
<p>A somewhat similar process happens when air goes up and over a mountain range, which results in  lots of rain on the front side and a rain shadow (very little rain) on the back side. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The 5.9-kiloyear event was one of the most intense aridification events during the Holocene. It occurred around 3900 BC (5900 years Before Present), ending the Neolithic Subpluvial. </p>
<p>The Neolithic Subpluvial was the most recent of a number of periods of &quot;Wet Sahara&quot; or &quot;Green Sahara&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The things about weather patterns are true, but it also should be noted it wasn't always desert. The Sahara used to be jungle, which is how our ancestors were able to move through it to get to the fertile Crescent. However an ice age hit, more water was locked up in polar ice, and so areas that were vulnerable to desertification did so</p>
<p>Edit: thanks to all of you for finding a source. I really shouldn't put something out on reddit that late at night without a source. Cheers! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
