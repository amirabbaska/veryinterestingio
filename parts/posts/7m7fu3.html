		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an extremely difficult to answer question in a manner for a 5 year old to understand because it requires a basic biochemistry background to understand but here it goes:</p>
<p>In starvation mode your body is conserving energy. It takes a little energy to digest food and get things going. To make this energy your need the elements potassium, phosphorous and magnesium (how and why is beyond the scope of this question)</p>
<p>Since you have starved, your body's supply of potassium, magnesium and phosphorous are low and are supplying energy to the necessary functions of your body for survival. When you eat, the demand for energy increases to the point where your body cannot produce the necessary energy to digest the food (you lack the 3 key elements in sufficient quantities). Your blood levels of potassium, magnesium and phosphorous go into dangerously low levels that cause cardiac arrest, irreversible neurological problems (because your body's reserves of those elements gets immediately depleted while your gut tries to make the digestive acids, bile, energy for movement through the GI tract).  This is <strong>&quot;refeeding syndrome&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Hope this helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tried that. Fasted for 11 days, and went too fast to glorious meat meals! But the day after I started puke and poop from diarrhea like never before. I got to the point I thought whats the point of drinking if it just go right through the system to vomit and puke? I started to get dehydrated and dizzy, and the worst stomach pains you can imagine! So I got to the hospital to get intravenous hydration and some pills to help disgestion. I got better after one day, but never been in worse pain! So start careful eating after starvation or fasting! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s called “refeeding syndrome”</p>
<p>When you’ve been starving/deprived for a long time, your body shuts down everything it can get away with. Growth, reproduction, anything that can go offline or run at bare minimum will start to do so. Remember that physical processes (including digestion) demand energy and nutrients to do, which a starving body can’t spare. Everything has to go towards the absolute essentials, keeping the heart and brain going.</p>
<p>If you were starving and were suddenly given a lot of food (especially rich food) <em>your body wouldn’t know what to do with it</em>. You’re still in starvation survival mode, so non-essentials like digestion are basically ignored. If they function at all, it’s bare minimum. All the food overloads this barely functioning system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is due to the Refeeding Syndrome. When a person is starved, the body switches from sugar to fats and protein as fuel. Also, many minerals and electrolytes are being used up, even if it appear to be of normal levels in blood. Insulin (a hormone to control sugar levels in blood) levels are also suppressed because there's very little sugar. </p>
<p>Then, when you feed the starved person with a lot of food, the insulin level rises, to help use the sugar that is now available. This also cause the body to start regenerating the fats and proteins that was used up earlier. </p>
<p>Those processes requires a lot of the minerals and electrolytes that are already depleted. The cells' fuel, called ATP, is also affected as the processes above and ATP both competes for the same thing (phosphate), which is a bad thing. </p>
<p>Also, as minerals and electrolytes are pulled into the cells, the levels remaining in the blood plunges. This can have impact on how the heart functions and affect its normal beating, and also increases the risk of dying. </p>
<p>Thus, never give a starved person normal quantities of food, or their body cannot handle it and start causing harm. You don't want the body to immediately start making the proteins and fats before the electrolytes and minerals level returns to normal (for the body as a whole, not just for the blood). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Refeeding syndrome” </p>
<p>This is why people who suffer from severe anorexia often must go into psych rehabs with specialized ED treatments. Not everyone will require a tube but the amount of doctors and nutritionists it takes to make sure just one patient is getting the right intake of carbs, calories, nutrients, proteins, and especially water intake is seriously important. </p>
<p>Doing an internship now for my dueling undergrad in social work and pre med in a geriatric continuation of care. The nutritionist is a boss and she doesn’t mess around. I’ve seen her go on rants about what will or will not happen to the patients body should they continue xyz and it’s admirable. Food choice is one of the most personal things we do for ourselves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
