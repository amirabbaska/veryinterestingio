		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sneezes are a protective response to alert you to less than ideal breathing conditions and remove irritants/allergens from your nose. They’re triggered by the presence of irritants, but only a certain concentration, which is mediated by multiple nerve endings that generate “spikes” when they’re irritated. Once the number of spikes passes a certain threshold, you sneeze. </p>
<p>Sometimes your nose will be irritated to the point of feeling like you have to sneeze, but there isn’t quite enough to push you over the threshold. So you “get stuck.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For all my life, I've suffered from allergies and would frequently have really horrible sneezing fits. I envied people who could just sneeze once or twice and be done with it. That was so foreign to me. If I allowed myself to sneeze once, I was committing myself to at least 15 or 20 intense sneezes, one right on top of the other.</p>
<p>It was exactly like this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vtkDKUuXBU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vtkDKUuXBU</a></p>
<p>Sometimes it was so intense, I couldn't catch my breath. The worst part was that when sneezing like this, you desperately need to swallow because you're salivating. But swallowing would only intensify the sneeze reflex. So I'd often feel like I was choking. It was so bad I'd hardly ever allow myself to sneeze in public. I just got used to biting my tongue and making weird faces. I'd fend it off at all costs. I often had them while sleeping, since I couldn't prevent them.</p>
<p>It got worse in my 20s, because I'd broken my nose in high school and suffered a deviated septum. And over time, all my right-side sinuses became severely blocked up. By the time I was in my late 30s, I was miserable.</p>
<p>Anyway, a couple years ago I finally got my nose straightened and my sinuses cleaned out (FESS), and immediately after began getting allergy shots.</p>
<p>I now know what it feels like to only sneeze once. Only now, after that first sneeze, I get &quot;stuck&quot; in that almost-sneezing zone for about 10 minutes and it's incredibly frustrating and unsatisfying. I just keep throwing my head back like I'm going to sneeze and it never comes. I look even more ridiculous. I almost wish I could go back.</p>
<p>Bodies are weird, man.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia: </p>
<p>&quot;Sneezing typically occurs when foreign particles or sufficient external stimulants pass through the nasal hairs to reach the nasal mucosa. This triggers the release of histamines, which irritate the nerve cells in the nose, resulting in signals being sent to the brain to initiate the sneeze through the trigeminal nerve network. The brain then relates this initial signal, activates the pharyngeal and tracheal muscles and creates a large opening of the nasal and oral cavities, resulting in a powerful release of air and bioparticles. The powerful nature of a sneeze is attributed to its involvement of numerous organs of the upper body – it is a reflexive response involving the face, throat, and chest muscles. Sneezing is also triggered by sinus nerve stimulation caused by nasal congestion and allergies.&quot;</p>
<p>So your &quot;half-sneeze&quot;, or whatever it's official name is, is what likely happens when something in your nose triggers the urge to sneeze, but not the complex mechanics involved in the actual process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the inside of your nose gets a tickle, a message is sent to a special part of your brain called the sneeze center. The guy manning the sneeze center then sends a message to all the muscles that have to work together to create the amazingly complicated process that we call the sneeze.</p>
<p>Some of the muscles involved are the abdominal (belly) muscles, the chest muscles, the diaphragm (the large muscle beneath your lungs that makes you breathe), the muscles that control your vocal cords, and muscles in the back of your throat.</p>
<p>Don't forget the eyelid muscles! Did you know that you always close your eyes when you sneeze?</p>
<p>It is the job of the sneeze center to make all these muscles work together, in just the right order, to send that irritation flying out of your nose. </p>
<p>So what happens when a sneeze get's stuck? The guy at the sneeze center is on a coffee break.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
