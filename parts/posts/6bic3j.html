		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In North America at least, there are unbelievable quantities of Ford, GM, Chrysler vehicles and dealerships everywhere. I just read from the BBC that Ford is slashing 10% of its 200,000 global workforce (HALF of which is in the US) to boost profits and &quot;drive profitable growth&quot;. </p>
<p>The article also says Ford's share price has dropped 40% since 2014. I remember <del>they went bankrupt during the financial crisis and had to be bailed out</del> (edit - this isn't true at all, it was GM and Chrysler only, whoops! They did receive a line of credit from the government though), then hit record profits afterward. How are they in such deep shit again? </p>
<p>How do you explain what appears to be massive domestic and international success while seemingly always closing plants and acting like a company in peril (which cannot be good for share prices)?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since at least the early 90s, companies have been using &quot;slumping sales&quot; as a reason to lay off employees in the USA (especially), but also other countries.  Of course, the actual reason for this is automation, but saying you are laying off thousands of Americans to save money doesn't help your brand, so the press release blames slumping sales.</p>
<p>Recently, Coca Cola said they were laying off employees because people were drinking less sugary drinks, despite Coca Cola actually having increasing sales, because &quot;sugary drinks&quot; doesn't include their other markets like energy drinks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36376966" target="_blank">Foxconn Replaces 60,000 employees with Robots</a>  Foxconn is the manufacturer of Apple iPhones and many other electronics you or a family member own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/02/06/special-report-automation-puts-jobs-peril/96464788/" target="_blank">USA Today, Automation is the Greatest Threat to the Economy</a>  </p>
<p>This is also a reason that things like Universal Basic Income or shortening the work week are brought up.   When a very small percentage of the population is needed to manufacture the entire world's demand of goods, you can really only fix the problem a few ways:</p>
<p>1) Accept the problem, eliminating the middle class, and having the vast majority of the population live in poverty.  Of course this means less people buying things and is a long-term terrible result for even the wealthy.</p>
<p>2) Decrease labor hours for everyone.  If the work week was decreased to 4 days, with over-time for salary employees, many jobs would be created.  </p>
<p>3) Universal Basic Income or other &quot;wealth redistribution&quot; plans. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It has been predicted that current generation of Auto-sales are going to take extremely deep slump in coming years and currently all companies have talked about how they have seen peak auto-sales and its just down hill from here.  </p>
<p>One of the main reasons being Millennials seeing owning a entire car to go around as uncool, as pollution is harming environment . Millennials are preferring saving that money and instead uber or take local transportation regularly.     </p>
<p>The only growing interest shown for new car purchase has been Electric car or something like auto-driving car which is going to be next big thing and all car manufacturers are preparing for that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
