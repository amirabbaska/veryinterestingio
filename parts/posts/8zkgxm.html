		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that by cauldron, you may mean crucible.</p>
<p>From Google: Modern crucibles may be small laboratory utensils for conducting high-temperature chemical reactions and analyses or large industrial vessels for melting and calcining metal and ore; they may be made of clay, graphite, porcelain, or a relatively infusible metal</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really you just use a material that is solid enough at the intended temperature.</p>
<p>So something like titanium, platinum, rhodium, tungsten or a whole mess of alloys have melting points above what you need, (although the specific properties of each material makes its usability as a crucible vary and I haven't considered those in that list, just put down names I know have a higher melting point)</p>
<p>Usually, however, they'reade of ceramics since those generally have good properties to use as a crucible (sturdy, relatively light weight, high melting point [and more importantly, they don't become pliable until very close to their melting point unlike many other materials]) and of you use the right one, they can be more ductile making them resistant to shattering if something hits them (which is an important trait in a bucket filled with half a tonne of boiling metal suspended in the air)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
