		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've gotten some good answers that address the point but some common rebuttals and misconceptions are being put forth. I'll try to talk about the most common &quot;parasite&quot; rebuttal in attempting to say that viruses themselves are alive.</p>
<p>When the idea of viruses not being alive is brought up the most common rebuttal is that other parasites, like malaria, also need a host of sorts. Even humans can’t live without the earth, but we are still “alive”. Without a host or a planet both will die, and the same can be said of a virus. And, if you are like most people and scientists, you will likely say that a virus and the discrete infectious particles that encode for more viral particles are one and the same. Not everyone thinks this way, but it is by far the most common perspective.</p>
<p>With that being said, take a human, a malaria cell, and a virus particle and stuff them into an impenetrable box. By cutting off their contact from all environmental forces, they will invariably die, if they ever were alive. However, what is important is what happens before they die and how this behavior might be different from before they are put into the box.</p>
<p>The human in a box is still alive the instant he is placed there. He might yell, scream, bang on the wall, and so on. For the time being he is alive until he runs out of air, or, if the box is big enough, dehydrates and dies. These are the obvious &quot;macro&quot; signs we associate with life. But that's not what we mean when we say that &quot;cells&quot; are alive or that &quot;viruses&quot; aren't.</p>
<p>For the malaria it is no longer in a red-blood cell. However the instant I place it in the box it can still process the energy stores it made--just like the human. It still undergoes metabolism, creating new proteins, breaking down others, synthesizing lipids for its cell membrane and intracellular compartments. It still unwinds the DNA it contains, transcribes a template, and uses that to make a protein. It might even divide, depending on the state it was when it went into the box. [Edit: These are the &quot;micro&quot; or most fundamental signs of life we can ascribe to a cell.] Eventually, though, it will die just like the human.</p>
<p>In both of the above cases the human and the malaria still exhibit behaviors classically associated with life even after being placed into the box. They both invariably die, but the point here is that there are two distinct times for these organisms qualitatively.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to the virus. Before placed it in the box it was doing nothing--just sitting there, inert. Viruses do this until they bump into a cell or the cell bumps into them. Here in this box it will never come into contact with a cell. It sits there forever, inert, just as before with no reprieve. There is no energy production or energy manipulation. There is no protein synthesis. There is only the vibrating of its atoms and the random movement of its molecules in their aqueous environment inside the core. The virus remains like this until it eventually degrades, the same way ultrapasteurized milk degrades. Not degraded by life, but by the fundamental protein, lipid, and nucleic acid bonds eventually just...breaking. It is the same degradation a rock undergoes being exposed to flowing rapids for eons. It is the same degradation that causes pigment over time to bleach. Entropy wins, as usual, but there was never a fight along the way. There was never, at any point, something that for the time being still fought for order.</p>
<p>In essence, the virus was already dead. Or, better stated, never alive to begin with. Viruses are parasites to the limit such that they no longer can be thought of as living. Or, coming from the other direction, they are extremely complicated and selfish genetic elements.</p>
<p>They are &quot;shadows of life&quot; and most likely derived from a living organism or reductively evolved themselves.</p>
<p>Edit: Check out <a href="http://naturedocumentaries.org/3972/hidden-life-cell-bbc/" target="_blank">this video</a> that's very layman friendly. It's a BBQ documentary about an hour long that covers the lifecycle of Adenovirus, in this case the common cold. You can really see how ancient viruses are based on the many defense mechanisms our cells and bodies have gained to fight them off. At times it's a bit dramatic and not quite &quot;accurate&quot; with how things work on that level (e.g. with some personification), but on the whole it's very educational and can really help illustrate the point I was making above with a specific viral example. The typo stays.</p>
<p>Edit: As I implied a bit in the beginning this is not the only view of viruses out there. If you're really curious you can check out <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2837877/" target="_blank">Dr. Forterre's</a> writing on the matter. In this case, the 'virus' is not the discrete particles outside of a cell but rather the infected cell itself. It's quite an interesting and unique idea and the article itself talks at great length about the many exceptions that biology offers up in general and also specifically those many viral exceptions and edge cases.</p>
<p>Edit3: Alternatively, if you would like to really see what this metabolism is like and see what we truly mean by describing these &quot;micro&quot; signs of life, check out this 8 minute video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBmLsPeuv6k" target="_blank">by Harvard</a> that centers on the cellular activity of a white blood cell leaving a vein to fight an infection. It requires dynamic response to a changing environment and can serve as a good contrasting element to what viruses are incapable of doing <em>on their own</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is sort of on the edge of life and wether it is included or not depends on how we define life.</p>
<p>It show that our way of categorizing things like that does not always work for natural phenomena which often show a more gradual transition between one state and another rather than a simply yes/no thing.</p>
<p>Viruses are right there in between dead and alive. They can only really &quot;live&quot; with the help of host cells they infect, but with their help they can actually fulfill most of the criteria people use to measure if something is alive.</p>
<p>Of course if you include viruses you only really transfer the problem of where to draw a line further out.</p>
<p>You have things like prions which are sort of like viruses only much more simply and much less alive. They don't even have any DNA/RNA. But it seems that they definitely can reproduce inside a host and research suggest that they can sort of mutate, evolve and adapt through natural selection.</p>
<p>You have to draw the line somewhere and no matter where you draw it, it will be imperfect because there will be things on both sides of the line that aren't too different from one another.</p>
<p>Drawing the line to keep viruses on the dead side of the dead/alive divide makes sense. We just have to keep in mind that the whole are is rather fuzzy and that it is more of a gradual shift as you move across it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually depends on the definition of life that is being considered. There are actually several.</p>
<p>The definition most often referenced (the &quot;biological definition of life&quot;) requires an organism to be able to carry out metabolic processes on its own - that is, via its own cellular machinery - in order to be considered living.</p>
<p>Viruses cannot metabolize and reproduce on their own, and instead must rely on the cellular machinery of its host in order to carry out functions that other organisms can perform &quot;independently.&quot;</p>
<p>I put that last term in quotes, because, like many things in biology, gray areas start to blur the lines between these neat little divisions we like to draw in nature. When we start to consider other obligate parasites, this definition becomes problematic, as they may be reduced to such a high degree (both in terms of cellular machinery/function and genome size/organization) that they too begin to push the boundary of what we consider to be living based on the classical definition(s).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually no agreed upon definition of life in Biology, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life#Biology" target="_blank">wikipage</a> for this. However, when people are talking about how a virus is not considered life, they usually come with their Biology textbook definition of life, which is sort of as followed; </p>
<p>Life should contain at least most of the following characteristics; </p>
<ul>
<li>homeostasis; [hard to ELI5] cells should be able to maintain a different environment than the outside environment </li>
<li>Organization; more or less that it should look like how we know life looks like, consisting of cell(s), DNA/RNA [a weak point to be honest]</li>
<li>Metabolism; produce energy for itself either by eating or sunlight and using this energy.</li>
<li>Growth; producing more energy than using it</li>
<li>Respons to stimuli; react to something, say a human to a red light</li>
<li>Reproduction; the ability to create 'children' or copies (as microbes do) </li>
</ul>
<p>In general it is said that all these traits should be within the organism to be able to call it life. So because a virus does not have its own metabolism and it cannot reproduce without help of a host it is sometimes considered to be not life. Biologists are - I think - kind of split on the matter. Still Virology is a subject within Biology. Also this is not the only problem with the definition above. There are some people that argue that for example fire contains most of the traits above (except for the organization). So a relatively new idea is to go with a new definition of life; life is able to undergo evolution. </p>
<p>Now in my opinion this is the strongest definition of life. Evolution is seen in everything that is living and not in lifeless objects. One of the consequences of this theory is that the virus would thus actually be considered life, since it is undergoing evolution. Again, there is no agreement between biologists, but I see this becoming the new definition in the future, since (again my opinion) there is not really any argument against it, other than being too familiar with the previous definition. </p>
<p><strong>tl:dr</strong> It depends on who you ask, some say a virus is not living because it does not reproduce and create its own energy, others would say a virus is life because it evolves. </p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> Woops, see it has gotten a bit more of attention than I thought and some people are upset by my 'amateur' answer. I wanted to put it simple since; ELI5. You can agree or dissagree with the evolution notion, this happens within the field of Biology as well. For disclaimers, I am not an evolutionary biologist, although I did follow a lot of courses within the subject. Nor am I a micro-biologist, (some courses). The growth thing; yes I understand the confusion, I should have put; use energy for production of biomass (or have a surplus of energy used for biomass production). Honest mistake, but I'll leave it. </p>
<p>As for the evolution part; yes I mean evolution by means of natural selection. Again it is ELI5 .. Sorry if you think I was misleading people, I am not. Sorry if it was not elaborate enough, but this is my response. If you want a more elaborate discussion maybe try askscience instead (because it is a really interesting discussion). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A virus isn't and is considered a living thing. It's sort of a limbo on where it's placed. </p>
<p>It's considered living because it has it's own DNA (or RNA in some cases) to be able to make copies of itself. All living things have a code that makes them what they are. </p>
<p>It's also considered non living because all it has inside is DNA/RNA. It doesn't eat anything for energy, it doesn't copy its DNA/RNA like a normal cell does. A virus is just a protein capsule with its code inside. It does nothing. </p>
<p>Not like a normal cell, like a bacteria or an amoeba, which has all that stuff aside from the DNA. All that extra stuff lets the cell copy that DNA and divide into two cells. </p>
<p>Edit: I'm a Biotec Engineer. Viruses are just awesome and fascinating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
