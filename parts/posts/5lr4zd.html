		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this morning as I was the first to walk back into my freezing office after the holiday, I was reminded of an argument I used to have with my roommate when I lived in a drafty old house in upstate New York.  We would both leave the house for one to two weeks every Christmas, turning the thermostat down to something like 5C while we were away, and when we returned we would have to run the furnace full blast for about three days to get the house up to 22C again.  I would always suggest that it would be better leave the thermostat on something in the middle while were gone, like 15C, but he thought it was a waste of energy.  I argued that it took just as much energy to run the furnace continually for those three days when we returned than it did to maintain a modest temperature while we were away.  In reality, I have no idea, but I just hated those three days of feeling cold.</p>
<p>Obviously, this depends on lots of factors, like how cold it is outside and how long we are gone.  But in general, ignoring issues like pipes freezing, does it use more energy to maintain a moderate temperature for a long time and then heat it up for a short time, or to let something cool way down and then heat it up all the way?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of heat lost by an object to the environment is proportional to the temperature difference between the environment and the object.</p>
<p>So if the object is at 20C, while the environment is at freezing (0C), then the rate of heat loss will be twice as high than if the object was at 10C.</p>
<p>If you keep heating the house while you're away, you keep the temperature higher and the total heat loss during your away time will be higher. Whereas if you turn the thermostat down very low, the rate of heat loss will gradually slow down as the house becomes colder and colder.</p>
<p>The total amount of energy you consume during this absence and the reheating that follows will be equal to the amount lost. In the case where you keep heating your house, this energy loss will be higher than in the case where you don't heat your house at every point in time (except for the initial period where the temperature drops from the starting point to your &quot;something in the middle&quot; value, in which case the energy loss is equal in both cases).</p>
<p>So from basic physics, it will be more efficient to turn the heater down as much as possible (without risk of freezing pipes) and heat it back up upon return. To overcome the discomfort of returning to a cold home, consider a smart thermostat that can be programmed to reach the desired temperature when you return (and will start to heat before you get back). Some can even &quot;learn&quot; how long it takes to heat up your house specifically with repeated use, so that they start at the exact right time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the furnace off, in a climate where the temperature is below that of the building, heat will be lost to the environment. This loss of heat stops when both temperatures are equal. When heat is turned back on, the only heat that will be needed is equal to the heat originally stored by the structure. The heat loss would be greater if the building were warmer, so no, turn off furnace to stop fuel consumption is the more efficient strategy. Of course, it will take a long time to reheat and so you will feel colder than normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer depends on how long you are gone, how well insulated your house is, and what type of heating system you have.</p>
<p>For your specific case, with being in a drafty old house and gone for two weeks and with a large basement heater, it is almost certainly better to lower the thermostat while gone.</p>
<p>The house is going to constantly leak heat that the heater needs to pump back in. The rate of leaking will be determined by how well insulated your house is (not well in your case), and the temperature difference between your house and the outside air. The more leaking there is, the less you want to waste energy heating up your house. The longer you are gone, the more important this leak rate becomes.</p>
<p>Next up is how efficiently you can heat up to replace the leaking. To heat a house is more than just heating the air. The floors and walls and furniture also need to be heated up if you let the house cool down over a long period of time. If you have a very efficient heater, it is probably best to keep all those solid things at a reasonable temperature when gone for a day or two. If you have a very inefficient heater, then you will be burning energy just to keep something warm that doesn't need to be warm.</p>
<p>Basically, think about how often your heater is running on a normal basis then compare that to how long it takes to heat back up after being off for awhile. A heater in very cold places like NY might run for 15 minutes then turn off for 30 minutes. That becomes 32 cycles per day. If you are gone for 7 days, you have saved 224 cycles (56 hours of &quot;on&quot; time). Now, when you come back it takes 3 days at 100% &quot;on&quot; time, which is 72 hours. Maybe that isn't the most efficient way. But for 2 weeks you are saving 112 hours vs 72.</p>
<p>However, I'm doubting your heater is running 100% &quot;on&quot; for 3 days. That sounds like an exaggeration to make a point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been having a related argument with the operations manager at the non-profit I work with. We have a district heating system with a dual fuel (cordwood and limited electric) boiler. It supplies hot water to 7 houses, delivered through insulated underground pipes.</p>
<p>I argue that the boiler should be kept at least 160F, as that will make the radiators in the houses significantly more efficient. When the houses are satisfied they stop drawing water from the loop, thus making it easier to maintain that temperature. He, on the other hand, is happy to let the temperature drop to sometimes below 100F, which means that all the houses are pretty much continually drawing on the boiler to stay warm.</p>
<p>It's a tough nut to crack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It it is really that drafty start plugging holes.  Even with minimal insulation sealing up the house gets you a long way down the road to an efficient house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
