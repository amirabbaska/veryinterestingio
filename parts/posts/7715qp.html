		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is a depressant.  This means that it's inhibiting other systems in your body that keep various things in check.</p>
<p>How this works out for an individual depends on the current homeostasis their body has, and what parts of that are based on active suppression.</p>
<p>So someone who depends on continual supreme mental control to keep themselves from becoming outwardly angry will fly off the handle when drunk, whereas someone who makes healthy life choices and avoids putting themselves in situations where they would become frustrated/angry will likely just get sleepy when drunk.  Everyone else falls somewhere in between.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people don’t have an actual understanding of what anger is, what function it serves, or even why they are angry. They simply feel and “know” when they are angry.</p>
<p>In humans, the emotion of “anger” is a byproduct of unmet expectations and is typically fueled by a poor ability to predict undesired outcomes and/or accept responsibility for them.</p>
<p>Evolutionarily speaking, we tend to express this emotion and frustration as a feedback mechanism in hopes that we can affect future outcomes or potentially keep them from repeating.</p>
<p>I will present two extremes:</p>
<p>Some people go through life angry at everything. Nothing ever seems to go according to plan. Everything that goes wrong is someone else’s fault. Life just isn’t going the way it should. There is a general mismatch between how reality and cause and effect work compared to the person’s expectations. When drinking, this person’s ability to think things through calmly and logically becomes even less capable. Additionally, their overall ability to suppress their emotions is inhibited by the depressive effects of the alcohol. A person in this scenario is likely to be an angry drunk, lashing out at imaginary demons and even their loved ones who they may be blaming for their current position in life. The last thing an angry drunk does is accept responsibility for why things are wrong. Even when they do accept responsibility, they fail to accept their own flawed nature (and are then angry at themselves).</p>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum, there are people who are well centered and take life in stride. They understand that sometimes life is predictable, and sometimes it isn’t. They understand that cause and effect is a thing. They understand that the reason they might be having a hard time and in a predicament is because they made a series of choices along the way. If they poke a bear, they don’t get angry at the bear when it bites them. When their toddler touches a hot stove, they don’t get angry at the toddler, because they understand that toddlers do stupid things because they are toddlers. This type of person is typically slow to anger across the board, because of their overall mindset and worldview. When they drink, the depressive affects of the alcohol tend to make them sleepy, or might heighten their other emotional states (such as crying and laughing).</p>
<p>P.S. Full disclaimer: This is just my current understanding of how it all works, based on my own personal observations and years of introspection. I might be completely wrong?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol lowers inhibitions and impulse control.  Some people, when their inhibitions are down, will just want to dance, or be more of a bon vivant. But others have a lot of inner anger and resentment. Alcohol reduces your ability to process multiple sources of outside information (like the information needed to properly drive). But to a person that already has trouble dealing with the world - such as having an inflated ego so that they see themselves as a colossus, but the outside world sees them as average - there becomes an even bigger breakdown in the information they receive, the processing of that information, and actual reality. So a minor accident - bumping into someone - becomes a major assault in their eyes.  Their inhibitions are down, so instead of thinking about the consequences of starting a fight, they just do it.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To some degree yes. But since the <em>average</em> person has at least a little anger inside, it's not quite that simple. Some people still won't act out even when drunk, while others lose all perspective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is a amplifier of emotions as well. You're chattier, your happier, everything is great can turn into someone bumping into you hard, not apologising, and then you can get supremely angry and do things you would never have done had you been sober. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
