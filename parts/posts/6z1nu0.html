		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one knows for sure, but there are some theorys that are more likely than others.  The one that seems most sensible to me has to do with the infant being prone face down.</p>
<p>An infant does not have the strength yet to completely lift her head and turn it if she can't breath.  This may happen when a baby is placed face-down to go to sleep.  It's super difficult to prove if someone has died from suffocation when there has been no violent incident.  That makes it that much harder to diagnose.</p>
<p>There are no doubt other causes as well.  Basically SIDS is just a term for any mysterious death of an infant that can't be explained.  Babies are vulnerable and we may never know what every infant death is from.  Babies just die sometimes and it has always been that way.  SIDS is not a new phenomena, its just a new term.  We can try to eliminate some reasons for infant mortality as they become obvious to medicine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<hr />
<p>We usually hear the term &quot;SIDS&quot; when discussing safe sleeping habits with our labor and delivery nurses before we take our babies home and from our child's pediatricians. There's a lot of fear and anxiety surrounding Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and a lot of misinformation.</p>
<p>What is SIDS?</p>
<pre><code>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death, usually during sleep, of a seemingly healthy baby less than a year old. SIDS is sometimes known as crib death because the infants often die in their cribs.

Source: MayoClinic</code></pre>
<p>SIDS is not the cause of every sudden infant death. Each year in the United States, thousands of babies die suddenly and unexpectedly. These deaths are called SUID, which stands for “Sudden Unexpected Infant Death.”</p>
<p>SUID includes all unexpected deaths: those without a clear cause, such as SIDS, and those from a known cause, such as suffocation. One-half of all SUID cases are SIDS. Many unexpected infant deaths are accidents, but a disease or something done on purpose can also cause a baby to die suddenly and unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“Sleep-related causes of infant death” are those linked to how or where a baby sleeps or slept. These deaths are due to accidental causes, such as suffocation, entrapment, or strangulation. Entrapment is when the baby gets trapped between two objects, such as a mattress and a wall, and can’t breathe. Strangulation is when something presses on or wraps around the baby’s neck, blocking the baby’s airway. These deaths are not SIDS.</p>
<p>Other things that SIDS is not:</p>
<pre><code>SIDS is not the same as suffocation and is not caused by suffocation.
SIDS is not caused by vaccines, immunizations, or shots.
SIDS is not contagious.
SIDS is not the result of neglect or child abuse.
SIDS is not caused by cribs.
SIDS is not caused by vomiting or choking.
SIDS is not completely preventable, but there are ways to reduce the risk.</code></pre>
<p>How can I reduce the risk of SIDS?
There's no way to prevent SIDS, but there are ways to reduce your child's risk.</p>
<pre><code>Always place your baby on his or her back to sleep, for naps and at night, to reduce the risk of SIDS.
Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib, covered by a fitted sheet.
Keep soft objects, toys, crib bumpers, and loose bedding out of your baby's sleep area to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of infant death. (Disclaimer: this is a blanket statement, use your best judgement to decide when your baby is ready to have a thin blanket or stuffed animal in their sleep space.)
Keeping your home or child's room at a comfortable temperature has been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS.
Consider using a pacifier for naps and bedtime.
Room sharing (not bedsharing) for the first 6 months of your baby's life.
Breastfeeding (about 60% less likely to die from SIDS than infants who didn't receive any breast milk).
Avoid products marketed as reducing the risk of SIDS.</code></pre>
<p>The FDA has never cleared or approved a baby product to prevent or reduce the risk of SIDS, but a lot of baby products have unproven claims to prevent or reduce the risk of SIDS, such as:</p>
<pre><code>heart rate and breathing monitors
mattresses
crib tents
pillows
crib bedding, including bumpers and blankets, and infant positions.</code></pre>
<p>This is not to say to avoid all of these things all together, but to avoid items that have false claims of preventing or reducing the SIDS risk with the expectation that it WILL reduce or prevent SIDS. Most baby items (such as mattresses) have to meet certain safety standards defined by the CPSC.</p>
<p>For example: Infant positioners can be recommended by a pediatrician for a number of reasons but should be used under the guidance of a pediatrician based on circumstance.</p>
<p>Can I use a home heart or breathing monitors to reduce the risk of SIDS?
I'm sure I'm not the only parent who has hovered over my newborn wondering, &quot;Is he breathing?&quot; According to Dr. David King, a pediatric researcher at the University of Sheffield, there's no research to suggest that the information provided by these new devices provides a reliable indicator of danger, or indeed any reliable information about your child. &quot;It's not registered as a medical device.&quot; His findings were published in The British Medical Journal - April 2014.</p>
<p>Home heart rate or breathing monitors can't reduce the risk of SIDS in a healthy child and having additional items/wires in your baby's crib can actually increase the risk of strangulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The procedures proved to reduce the rate of SIDS include placing an infant near the bottom of a cot, on their back, no pillow at all, and if using a blanket, have it made so it is tucked in securely at the bottom of the cot and rises only just high enough to reach the baby's upper chest as they lay with their feet almost touching the end of the cot.</p>
<p>Also: ban cigarette smoke from the house.  No indoor smoking.</p>
<p>Lastly, breastfeeding helps.   The combination of these three techniques dropped the incidence of SIDS by 83% in Australia between 1985 to 2005.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is: we don't know; this is also the reason why it does not have a better name. In fact SIDS is defined as any deaths of an infant where the cause cannot be determined.</p>
<p>There are some theories what might be the cause and there seem to be risk factors (sleeping on the belly) that increase the likeliness of a child dying in that fashion, but in the end we just don't know yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, the exact cause is not known. Several studies have noted that there appears to be abnormalities in the brain stems of infants who died with no known cause that suggests they may have issues with arousing during distress while sleeping. Normally if an infant's breathing in obstructed while sleeping (ex. If they have sleep apnea or a pillow is to close too their face), they will wake up and gasp for air, move their head, etc. to reset their breathing. It's possible these babies with abnormalities may not be able to wake themselves up to correct the situation. This may explain risk factors such as sleeping on stomachs and breathing in cigarette smoke. </p>
<p>This article mentions several studies that corroborate this theory: <a href="http://www.parentingscience.com/what-is-SIDS.html" target="_blank">http://www.parentingscience.com/what-is-SIDS.html</a>  </p>
