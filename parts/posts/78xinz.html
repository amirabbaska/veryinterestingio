		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question made me curious and a quick search yielded the study linked below, which looked at exactly this question.^1 The researchers found that the answer depends both on the variant of the exercise as well as the stage of the exercise. For example, in a traditional push-up the number is about 69% in the up position (at the top of the movement) and 75% in the down position (bottom of the movement).</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that the study also looked at a &quot;modified push-up.&quot; This modification <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2PagQIv.png" target="_blank">as shown here</a> is essentially just an <del>lazier</del> easier version of the exercise where the knees stay on the floor.  Surprisingly (to me at least), even in this simpler version you still lift quite a bit of your body mass (54% in the up position and 62% in the down position).</p>
<p>edit: I corrected &quot;going up/down&quot; to &quot;up/down position&quot; to reflect the fact the body was kept stationary when the force was recorded in this study.</p>

Double the maximum value the scale lists and divide that by your total weight (and multiple by 100) to calculate the percentage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I wonder if it works in reverse? If you want to improve push ups by bench pressing. Say you are 250 lb at 75% that's 187.5 lb. Could you then work on a set with say 190 lb over period Of time and increase your stamina for push ups push up effectively</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m curious about this too. What about the different ways of doing push-ups and push-ups that focus on other muscles. Or a wide spread push-up compared to one in line with your shoulders. Would it be the same or would the weight change. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just for fun to check the people giving you numbers, you can put your feet on a scale (easier since they're less wide apart) and ask a buddy to read off the number at the top and the bottom. Hold still at the top, get the number, then hold still at the bottom and get the number. The difference between your weight and the weight on your feet is the weight on your hands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
