		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm of the mind that the term &quot;the speed of light in a medium&quot; should be forever abolished.  Light does not travel at all through a medium.  Rather, an EM wave incident on the boundary between the vacuum and a material INDUCES A POLARIZATION WAVE in the material.  It is this polarization wave that is making the journey through the material, not the original light.</p>
<p>What is meant by polarization? Atoms have a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charge electrons.  Their net charge is zero and if left alone the average position or &quot;center&quot; of their negative charge and the center of their positive charge lie on top of one another/are at the same point (the center of the nucleus) even though the electrons and nucleus are in spatially separate places.  However an electric field pulls negative charges one way and positive charges the other, and thus when an electric field is applied to an atom, the centers of its negative charge and positive charge are slightly pushed apart from one another and the atom acquires a net dipole moment (a dipole is a positive charge q and an equal in magnitude negative charge -q that are slightly displaced in position from one another resulting in a net electric field even though one has charge neutrality overall).  This dipole moment produces its own field which acts against the applied field.  This whole action is called polarization and how a material is polarized for a given applied field is a material dependent property depending on what is made out of and the crystal structure it adopts.</p>
<p>So the true object is a composite excitation that is the net &quot;thing&quot; that comes out of this competition from the applied electric field (by this we mean the incident vacuum EM wave) and the polarization response of the material.  An EM wave never travels anything but the speed of light, but this net composite object has a material dependent character and can make its way across the material at a slower speed than the inciting EM wave.</p>
<p>Also, just a few final comments.  If anyone ever told you light is slowed in a material because it makes a pinball path, that is utter BS.  One can understand this pretty readily as, if that were true, the path of light would be random when leaving the material, rather than refracted by a clear, material dependent, angle theta.  If someone told you that it's gobbled up by atoms and then re-emitted randomly and this produces a pinball path, that's even more wrong.  If that were the case then clearly &quot;the speed of light in a medium&quot; would depend on the capture and emission times and decay times of electron states of atoms, it doesn't.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>does it take a longer path through the medium, also increasing the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible to derive Snell's law, the law saying how much incident light curves due to refraction, by simply finding the path of least time given the &quot;speed of light&quot; in each medium (again, I don't like this term).</p>
<p>EDIT: For those with the appropriate background, Feynman's lecture on this is pretty great:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a question to tack onto this. What I've read about light and the speed of light etc has made me reach a certain conclusion that I'm not sure is right. Was wondering if someone could clarify. </p>
<p>My understanding is that time is a dimension. We are all traveling through time at the speed of light. When we move too quickly in space (relative to things), it slows down our passage through time because we are moving perpendicular through time, which slows down our passage through time. </p>
<p>Light does not pass through time (which doesn't make sense to me, but I read that somewhere) which is why it is always moving through space at the speed of light. </p>
<p>How wrong is everything I just wrote? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
