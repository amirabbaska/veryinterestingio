		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, we are Dmitri Pavlichin (postdoc fellow) and Tsachy Weissman (professor of electrical engineering) from Stanford University. The two of us study data compression algorithms, and we think it's time to come up with a new compression scheme-one that's vastly more efficient, faster, and better tailored to work with the unique characteristics of genomic data.</p>
<p>Typically, a DNA sequencing machine that's processing the entire genome of a human will generate tens to hundreds of gigabytes of data. When stored, the cumulative data of millions of genomes will occupy dozens of exabytes.</p>
<p>Researchers are now developing special-purpose tools to compress all of this genomic data. One approach is what's called reference-based compression, which starts with one human genome sequence and describes all other sequences in terms of that original one. While a lot of genomic compression options are emerging, none has yet become a standard.</p>
<p>You can read more in this article we wrote for IEEE Spectrum: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-desperate-quest-for-genomic-compression-algorithms" target="_blank">https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-desperate-quest-for-genomic-compression-algorithms</a></p>
<p>In a strange twist of fate, Tsachy also created the fictional Weismann score for the HBO show &quot;Silicon Valley.&quot; Dmitri took over Tsachy's consulting duties for season 4 and contributed whiteboards, sketches, and technical documents to the show.</p>
<p>For more on that experience, see this 2014 article: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/computing/software/a-madefortv-compression-algorithm" target="_blank">https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/computing/software/a-madefortv-compression-algorithm</a></p>
<p>We'll be here at 2 PM PT (5 PM ET, 22 UT)!</p></div></div>

<li>
<p>What specifically differentiates genomic data vs typical data? More specifically, is genomic data not ergodic?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What similarities does reference based compression share with Slepian-Wolf (or Wyner-Ziv) coding? </p>
</li>
<li>Since there has been a large push towards machine learning, could you elaborate on the role you foresee information theory playing in the future machine learning?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>But what about all the SNPs, duplications, etc in intronic regions? Exons are well conserved and probably conducive to reference-based compression, however, introns in my view seem not, yet they play a big role in transcriptional control and are not nearly annotated as well as the exons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
