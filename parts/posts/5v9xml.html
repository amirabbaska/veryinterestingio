<p>&quot;Maybe a little, but protective effects of antidepressants are much more pronounced&quot; <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0193953X16300132" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>&quot;yes, especially in the first 9 days of starting treatment&quot; <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/199120" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>&quot;No significant results found in adults, but for children the risk doubled (also included aggression alongside suicidality)&quot; <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i65.short" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>This is by no means a complete overview, I hope others can suggest more sources so you have a more complete reading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In nursing school, we learned that anti-depressants, such as SSRIs,  are dangerous within the first 90 days of use because patients who are intent on causing self-harm now have the energy to do so. Basically, we were told to keep a closer eye on those who have recently started taking their meds because if they were truly suicidal then that's when it would happen. I believe after continuous use they become effective. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a psychiatrist and suicidologist, unfortunately I am on my mobile and cannot provide citations easily.  </p>
<p>The short answer on the whole population level is not significantly, but the longer answer is rather complicated. </p>
<p>First of all, very few people with depression is by suicide.  Overall, the rate of suicide in the Western world is generally 11 per 100000 per year. Having depression increases your risk of suicide by 3 to 5 times.  Therefore, we can translate those rates into 33 to 55 per 100000 per year.  Being depressed includes suicidal thinking as part of the illness, but it is not a common outcome to die by suicide.</p>
<p>Second, there are multiple risk factors for suicide. Depression is but one.  Family history, substance use, social circumstances, marital status, stress at work, resilience, etc... These are all factors of suicide risk, and are not changed.</p>
<p>Third, having depression doesn't mean you have taken antidepressants.  There is still a strong anti medication stigma put out there, and many people with depression are not compliant to their treatments (therapy or medication).  I sit on a coroner review panel in my province and review suicide analysis regularly.  A small percentage of depressed people who died by suicide (which is a subgroup of those who died by suicide) actually have detectable levels of antidepressants in their blood on autopsy.</p>
<p>Fourth, the effect size of antidepressants is good (0.45 to 0.8), but is not large enough to significantly statistically alter population levels of suicide.</p>
<p>Overall, the risk of suicidality on antidepressants (0.87% people get suicidal thoughts in the first two weeks under the age of 24, but let me tell you that the evidence for this is way shakier than most are aware) is much less than the risk of suicidality with depression and NOT on antidepressants, and the &quot;number needed to treat&quot; to effectively treat a depression is about 5 to 9.</p>
<p>On individual studies, taking an SSRI significantly increases the length of time one goes without suicidal thinking, and is an effective treatment for depression (equal to therapy and superior when both are combined), and I would guess likely does reduce suicidality overall in the group of those who take them.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people keep mentioning that depressed people starting medication have increased rates of suicidality (maybe now due to having energy for actions - I believe a claim made by industry). However, it is important to remember that healthy adults also have this trend. It is possible that anti-depressants just have this side effect. Anti-depressents are still considered one of the most effective treatments with people who have severe depression. But I would think of this side effect as something unfortunate that could happen with medication for a serious disease.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The citation that they especially helped in the first 9 days can't be true because it takes 3-6 weeks fur the medication to reach therapeutic doses in the body. There may have been a mood boost that came because the person was motivated and had started tasking a positive action to deal with they're depression.
What this doesn't address are the suicides caused by antidepressants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
