		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A checking account:</p>
<ul>
<li>usually accrues no interest</li>
<li>can used to pay bills via checks, debit card transactions, and ATM withdrawals</li>
<li>usually has no limit on the number of transactions that can be done</li>
</ul>
<p>A savings account:</p>
<ul>
<li>accrues interest (though not much these days)</li>
<li>typically limits the kind and number of transactions that can be done with it</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically a checking account is where money for your day to day payments flows through, while a savings account is where you keep your savings. Even if the interest is insignificant, a savings account can be a useful tool for financial planning, to designate that money as &quot;savings, don't touch unless there is an emergency&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, when you put money into a checking account, the bank has to keep 10% (unless it is small bank, then the number is smaller) in reserve, and it can lend out the rest to people seeking loans (as long as it meets other conditions not relevant here).  If you put money into a savings account, the bank can lend out all of it without keeping any in reserve (as long as it meets other conditions not relevant here).</p>
<p>So, the bank can lend out more of the savings deposits than the checking deposits, which makes savings deposits worth more to them.</p>
<p>Because the regulators impose these differences in regulation between the two account, they don't want banks to create something which is called a savings account but acts like a checking account.  So they have regulation D, which forces banks to limit saving account, such a &quot;6 transactions per month&quot; limit.</p>
<p>Is it important?  Well, it is important to them.  It probably isn't so important to you, except that you can get higher interest rates on savings than on checkings if you are willing to put up with the limits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A checking account is like your toy chest. If you want a toy. You can get it out of the chest whenever you want, but if you don’t put your toys in there first you aren’t getting anything. A savings account is where your dad keeps the toys that you don’t play with every day in storage in the attic. If you want a toy your Dad will go up there every once and a while, but so help me god if you want that toy every day you’re gettin a spanking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
