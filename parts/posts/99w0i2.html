		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cheesemaking is a very controlled process. Clean, filtered milk from healthy animals is pasteurized (or sometimes not, for raw milk cheeses, but we'll come back to that), which kills off most bacteria and yeast. Then the milk is cultured, usually with a powdered culture, which introduces bacteria and molds that will then predominate (due to the pasteurization process, which killed off most everything else). The new bacteria essentially has free reign to colonize the milk. </p>
<p>The rest of the process is where things can potentially go wrong. Tools used to stir the milk or cut the curd have to be sterilized or they can introduce undesirable bacteria. The molds used to shape the cheese also have to be sterilized. Blue cheese has an interesting process wherein the cheese is aged briefly, then the wheels of cheese are &quot;needled,&quot; or punctured all over with a very thin, long metal tool which allows oxygen to penetrate to the interior of the cheese, which the blue mold (Penicillium roqueforti) needs to develop properly.</p>
<p>In my experience (and, from talking with other cheesemakers I know this to be at least somewhat common), blue mold tends to contaminate other cheeses more than other molds tend to contaminate blue cheese. Where I worked, we had a &quot;cave&quot; that we aged all the cheeses in together, using a system of baffles, fans, and humidifiers to control the airflow and humidity to try to prevent cross-contamination, but it happens nonetheless. We had pretty good luck with our blue cheeses and rarely had cross-contamination issues (to be clear, any cheeses contaminated with blue mold would be safe to eat but not very palatable, and certainly not what we were going for; we did once have a few wheels of cloth-wrapped cheddar that were contaminated with blue mold, and they were absolutely delicious!). But I know cheesemakers who tried to make blue cheese once and could never quite get rid of the blue mold in their caves.</p>
<p>It is certainly possible for blue cheese to go &quot;bad,&quot; but usually not in an unsafe way, just from a palatability standpoint. Pasteurized milk cheeses are quite safe. Raw milk cheeses are allowed in the US, but they have to be aged for 6 months before they are sold. This aging time allows for any harmful bacteria that may have been introduced to show itself, and the cheese can be discarded. In some cases, unwanted yeasts can colonize the cheese, leading to a slimy, pinkish substance that tastes bitter. Again, not harmful but not desirable. In short, it is possible but fairly rare for other, undesirable molds to colonize blue cheese. The blue mold outcompetes most other molds, since it has a running start.</p>
<p>I loved how with blue cheese you never quite knew what the cheese was going to look like until you cut into it. When you first cut into a wheel of blue cheese, the interior is yellowish, not blue. Once the oxygen hits the mold, though, it turns blue. Pretty cool stuff. And tasty too.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a perfect, or at least a range of mold that is good for the cheese (for human taste). Also only some kind of molds are tasty and safe for us. Some other are not tasty and dangerous.Yes, if the cheese maker is letting too much mold growing in the cheese, it will spoil. The cave, temperature, moisture, everything is under control.</p>
<p>Cheese making is a science, they have to do frequent <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cheese+coring" target="_blank">cheese coring</a> to check the mold growing. I remember finding one core hole in my Roquefort one day.</p>

<p>Edit: Guys, I have never said *Sacre bleu* in my life, nor heard another French saying it. The first time I heard this was in the USA. Where is this one coming from? Fellow French Canadians maybe?  A movie?   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to /u/Beru73, I think it's worth noting that the mold is artificially added to the cheese.</p>
<p>The mold also acts as a cover against 'malicious' mold. I think there was an AMA some years ago which covered how mold is a shield against other mold. In short, other mold is unable to penetrate the existing mold thus preserving the actual cheese and desired mold inside the cheese.</p>
<p>When the mold cheese is made, <del>they often stick holes in the block of cheese and add mold</del>. There's a huge difference in how the mold appears inside the cheese whether its industrially made or handmade. </p>
<p>EDIT: They add the bacteria/mold to the milk according to this cheese expert: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXB74CONsE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXB74CONsE</a> </p>
