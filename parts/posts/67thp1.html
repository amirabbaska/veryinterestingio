		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that all tree stems eventually die; trees MUST grow to survive, so a tree will inevitably grow itself into a precarious situation, either outstripping its nutrient or water supplies, or growing to big to support its size. The longest living single stem trees are bristlecone pines, which another poster covered in this thread, but in a nutshell, those trees will eventually die because they get too big for their environment to support. </p>
<p>If we count root systems as trees (I do as a forester), then the oldest living tree is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_\(tree\)" target="_blank">Pando</a>, which is essentially a single large root system that creates numerous genetically identical stems. But even this tree is considered to be in decline. At some point, it is likely that this tree will lose its vigour (either through a disease or insect attack) and die. </p>
<p>Without outside interference, there isn't really a good answer for how long a tree like Pando could live. Trees do not age the same way animals do. Root propagating species like aspen seem capable of repairing genetic damage. Furthermore, trees do not appear to get cancer and the cancer like defects (galls and burls) do not have a long term impact on tree health. </p>
<p>So in a nutshell; a pine or redwood cannot live forever. A root propagating species like aspen <em>might</em>. </p>
<p>Edit: Apparently I forgot that redwoods can root propagate! Make me wonder if there is a really old root system in California somewhere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I am not mistaken scientist made mention on a documentary (can't remember which) that of the group of the largest redwoods, some where no longer growing in height but were in fact growing in girth and that little (didn't say none) water came up from the ground but a large amount came from fog or residual in the air.<br />
Also being from Santa Cruz, CA I was told as a child that redwoods could sense danger such as fire, flood, and probably man and it would drop seeds or sporens (something like that) and that is why you see 4 to 7 new growth trees around stumps. stuff I was told as a kid is it bull? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is nothing on earth that can live forever. Just like every other living thing, the process of cell replication that happens in plants does damage to the replicated DNA stands. Over time, the repair mechanisms stop functioning as well, errors creep in and the plant as a whole begins to show signs of age. Plants just have different rates of cellular growth, and sometimes more efficient cellular mechanisms. </p>
<p>Like Dolly the sheep, the DNA eventually degrades to a point where it simply can't replicate properly anymore. With Dolly, the DNA was already old and worn, so even though it was chronologically young at a cellular level, at a DNA level it was already old. </p>
<p>Still, several thousand years is an imposing time on this planet, given that the average lifespan of most mammals is rarely more than 20. </p>
<p>Tl;Dr - No, nothing lives forever. Not even the universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have another question about trees. If they were to grow in perfect conditions with no winds or anything that might disrupt them, would they grow symmetrically?
