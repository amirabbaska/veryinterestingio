		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested in  <strong>Near Death Experiences</strong>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/35/14432.full.pdf" target="_blank">This PNAS study</a> (on mice, not humans) may explain the phenomenon.</p>
<p>In summary: There are 4 stages of dying. CAS stands for Cardiac Arrest Stage.  </p>
<ul>
<li>CAS 1 - Final heart beat to Final pulse of blood containing oxygen  </li>
<li>CAS 2 - Final oxygen containing pulse to &quot;Delta blip&quot; (short burst of Delta waves on EEG)  </li>
<li>CAS 3 - Delta blip to EEG recordings below 10 microvolts  </li>
<li>CAS 4 - Low voltage (&lt; 10uV) to no electrical activity  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
What's interesting is that in CAS 3, there was an increase in synchronized gamma waves, indicating </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a highly aroused brain, and collectively, the data suggest that the mammalian brain has the potential for high levels of internal information processing during clinical death. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gamma waves are EEG waves that are associated with wakefulness and conscious attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The return of these neural correlates of conscious brain activity after cardiac arrest at levels exceeding the waking state provides strong evidence for the potential of heightened cognitive processing in the near-death state</p>
</blockquote>
<p>tl;dr: Near Death Experiences may result from a burst of coordinated gamma waves which occurs after the blood is deoxygenated</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My observation is that there is steady deterioration of EEG prior to actual arrest, probably representing progressive decompensation and worsening cerebral perfusion even with a normal pulse, with flattening that occurs seconds to minutes or longer before arrest. I have not observed any gamma synchrony myself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>To summarize, just before death, it was expected that the brain would wind down and slowly stop, but the brain surges with activity. This study was <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/08/12/in-dying-brains-signs-of-heightened-consciousness/" target="_blank">done on mice</a> and also on <a href="https://www.seeker.com/brain-waves-surge-moments-before-death-1764727850.html" target="_blank">terminally ill humans</a>. Similar results were found in both cases. (The story about mice includes some crap about &quot;heightened consciousness&quot; but that is clickbaity, newspaper-selling bullshit.) You start to die, your brain goes haywire for a bit possibly due to a failure of whatever regulates your brain activity, and then it calms down and you pass away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
