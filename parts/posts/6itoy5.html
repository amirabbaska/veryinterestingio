		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they're very dim. It typically takes a strong light right next to them that only emits &quot;blacklight&quot; for these stamps and paint to show up. They show up, faintly, in sunlight but they're practically invisible because they're washed out by the other wavelengths of light. </p>
<p>If you wore UV-filtered glasses in sunlight, you could see them in plain sunlight. For example, they sell glasses like these for golfers to help them find their golf balls. By filtering out most regular wavelengths of sunlight, they make golf balls light up in contrast to everything else, much like some white shirts light up brightly in UV light.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UV ink works by fluorescing/glowing in a visible wavelength when hit by UV light (invisible to the human eye). </p>
<p>You're not seeing the UV light, you're seeing light produced by a reaction in the ink to the UV light. </p>
<p>The maximum fluorescing is very dim, so you can really only see it when ambient visible light is dimmer than the visible light produced by the fluorescing. </p>
<p>The visible sunlight is much, much brighter than the glow produced by the ink when hit by the UV in sunlight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it does glow with the sun... just that the reflection is way better than the uv paint...</p>
<p>also, that's why clothes washing soap have a component that gives some light under uv &quot; to be more bright and white&quot;... that's why white clothes glow on uv... </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
