<p>Edit: u/PatrickShatner wanted to know: Are caterpillars aware of this transformation? Do they ever have the opportunity to be aware of themselves liquifying and reforming?  Also for me: can they turn it on or off or is it strictly a hormonal response triggered by external/internal factors? </p>
<p>Edit 2: how did butterflies and caterpillars get their names and why do they have nothing to do with each other? Thanks to all the bug enthusiasts out there!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many good answers so far but I will add that sometimes they do in fact just end up tiny as adults if they do not get enough food or improper nutrition. I import 40,000+ butterflies a year in the chrysalis and can tell you that every year we see a few that are probably 75% smaller than they should be. </p>
<p>I have personally raised an Atlas moth, the largest moth in the world, on palm fronds which are basically nutritionally void (it's mom picked the food, not me). It should have been the size of a dinner plate as an adult. Instead it was about 3 inches across. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two hormones governing moulting and metamorphosis in insects. Ecdysone is a fat soluble hormone and increases towards the end of each instar (it accumulates in body fat). Once a threshold is crossed, a moult is triggered. Ecdysone levels drop immediately after the moult, then slowly build up again towards the next peak.</p>
<p>Juvenile hormone (JH) shows declining expression with age. It tells the body what the next stage should be at the ecdysone peak when moulting is triggered. In a caterpillar, once JH levels drop below a predefined threshold, the next ecdysone peak initiates the pupal stage. If the caterpillar is underfed, this ecdysone peak (and hence the next moult) is delayed until sufficient energy reserves are available. </p>
<p>Tl;dr - Metamorphosis is delayed till the caterpillar has enough stored energy available</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caterpillars can and do fail to pupate. Have a look at this site:</p>

<p>Stress can cause them to pupate early, when they're not ready, and they'll simply die in the middle of pupating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dads a high school biology teacher who had a student who gave him a caterpillar. My dad tried to refuse him but ended up with it anyways and told the student he better feed it cause he sure as hell wasnt gonna take care of it. Long story short, the caterpillar didn't eat enough and ended up with only four legs. </p>
<p>Only reason I found out about this story was because ironically, that student ended up being MY high school biology teacher. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
