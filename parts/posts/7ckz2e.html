		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Any electromagnetic wave of any frequency will refract passing through any medium. The refractive index (how much the wave is slowed down compared to vacuum, basically) of any material is going to depend on frequency, but it will be slowed down some amount at all frequencies. Passing between media with different refractive indices will cause the path of the wave to &quot;bend&quot;, just like you see with light in water. It can also change gradually, causing a &quot;curve,&quot; which can happen in air since the RI is affected by temperature and pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All EM (light, radio waves, etc) can be modeled with the same equations and have the same behavior with respect to their frequency. Since refraction was already covered nicely by /u/Marlsfarp I'll elaborate on other behavior: radio waves are absorbed and reflected exactly like visible light too: when an electron in the path of an EM wave can move freely at the frequency of the wave, it's reflected. When an electron can be pushed to a new potential energy equal to the energy of the wave , the EM wave can be absorbed. In the same way light reflects from conductive aluminum, microwaves are reflected by chicken wire, and short wave radio is reflected by the ionosphere. In the same way visible light is absorbed by opaque matter (electrons moving to higher orbitals), radio waves are absorbed by antennae (electrons moving to a higher energy level in the receiving circuit). Interestingly, transparency isn't really related to density. If there are no electrons (or technically any degree of freedom in the EM field) that can equal the energy of the photon, the photon simply continues to propagate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just thought I'd add that radiowaves are a type of light, just with such a long wavelength (generally from 1 metre to several kilometres) that humans cannot see it without some device like a radiotelescope. thus is has the same properties as visible light Its just like infra-red and ultra violet in that its a kind of light that doesnt fall within the visible spectrum</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Refraction is an electromagnetic wave changing angle upon propagating into a different medium. Reflection is a wave &quot;bouncing&quot; off a medium at an inverted angle (simply put: if signal hits flat surface at 45°, reflection is 135°). The rate of refraction/reflection is based on type of medium and frequency of wave. Higher frequency has shorter wavelength and will not propagate as well through denser mediums. Also, wave absorption occurs which will diminish the overall energy being propagated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
