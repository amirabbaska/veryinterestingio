So my question is, am I crazy in thinking that Congressional elections are more important, and have more of an impact on policies, than the presidential election? If I'm not wrong, then why does the media/general public give little to no attention to them?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all of the responses! I suppose the obvious answer is because it's national and congressional elections are local. Thinking about it, it falls more on the local media than the national media. But as u/Weenie-Hut-General stated, the information is out there, voters just don't tend to look for it. There are many factors at stake, and I appreciate the discussion this topic as sparked. Thanks guys!</p></div></div>
