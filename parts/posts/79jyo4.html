<p>There is a center of the observable universe, but that is the position of the observer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe can be imagined as a sphere (like a balloon). The question of it's center has come up before, and that's when talking about how the universe expands. Observations showed that everything was expanding away from our exact position. In reality, it looks like that from every point in the universe. This can be imagined by thinking of the expanding universe as an inflating balloon. We exist on its surface. You can't really say where the &quot;center&quot; of the surface of a balloon is, every point is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No it doesn’t.
Galaxy clusters sometimes have a large dominant elliptical galaxy at its center, and clusters of galaxies in a super cluster can be influenced by the larger clusters of the system, but after that scale, there doesn’t appear to be any dominant gravitational force and everything outside of that super cluster is red shifted</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer (at least as far as we currently know) is: No.</p>
<p>The slightly longer answer is: There is no &quot;center&quot; of the universe, because ALL points in the universe are the center. So no, there can be no 'center of mass.' Reason for this is that (..again, as far as we know..) the universe resembles the surface-area of an ever-expanding balloon. It's not a perfect analogy, but it's the closest I've found that does the subject justice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
