These articles also noted that scientists believe conditions preceding an eruption could occur over as little as a few decades instead of over centuries as was previously thought. What are the expected values of gas emissions, seismic activities, deformation rates etc.. that would lead volcanologists to conclude that a major eruption of Yellowstone would be eminent within 10 to 20 years or less? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing i want to do is debunk something that is often repeated about Yellowstone and that is that it has some kind of regular eruption schedule. It's last 3 supereruptions were 0.63, 1.3 and 2.1 million years ago. So we have two inter-eruptive periods,  one of 0.67 and one of 0.8 million years.  Two data points is not a useful tend and there's at least a 130,000 year difference between them.  To put that in context anthropology puts the migration of modern humans out of Africa at something between 60-130,000 years ago.  So these aren't small variations in time.  Furthermore a super eruption completely reconfigures the volcanic edifice and plumbing system,  so there is no reason to expect that one supereruption will behave the same way as a previous one.  Anyone telling you about cyclicity or due dates on large volcanoes is severely misinformed.</p>
<p>Ok,  so onto how we monitor and forecast.  Supervolcanoes are problematic in that we've never seen one erupt, so we have to go on geological evidence of past eruptions,  then a lot of applied rock physics. For a super eruption to go off the first thing is that we need over a thousand cubic kilometres of eruptable magma in the reservoir.  Eruptable is an important distinction. Lots of magma can get isolated off into unconnected mushes and parts of the plumbing.  Or can intrude as dykes which relatively rapidly cool down.  We can use seismic arrays to image plumbing systems (think ultrasound imaging - similar process,  different frequency) and estimate melt volumes,  but the resolution of these is still very low.  So we can track roughly how much melt is available.  </p>
<p>Next is inflation of the volcano.  More magma underneath means the surface bulges more.  Given the the Yellowstone magma reservoir is something like 80km across this is a significant and easy thing to track (we can track surface motions of less than a millimeter with comparative ease).</p>
<p>So there's plenty we can look at.  The issue is one of context.  We've only known about supervolcanoes for a couple of decades or so.  Our monitoring of them has been similarly short and often patchy.  So understanding them is a bit like throwing a Dr in a room with a patient, and  giving them 1 minute with nothing but a thermometer and reflex hammer to diagnose their complete medical requirements and estimate their life expectancy. These volcanoes simply do not work on human timescales.  Peaks and troughs in their activity are perfectly normal.  Perhaps even more importantly these thing erupt all the time! Its just that <em>most of their eruptions</em> are not super eruptions. So increases in seismic activity are not signs of imminent super eruption (Or even,  necessarily,  minor eruption). </p>
<p>So we can be pretty confident that Yellowstone is not in immediate threat of super eruption; it's not close to what appears to be inflated enough to drive a super eruption.  And by immediate I mean in the next 10-20,000 years.  That said we have no idea what the magma recharge rate is at the moment or how it varies over time.  As i say - these things just do not operate on human timescales.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/superiorpanda has said with Mount Saint Helens there was clear growth, caused by volcanic material rising to the earths surface, on the northeast side of the cone. This is well worth looking up online as it really is extremely clear. The same thing is occurring at Yellowstone, only much more subtly. Lakes within the national park have drastically different shorelines than they did five years ago (due to the bulging of earths surface from volcanic material), as well as this the gaseous activity at many of the parks hot springs has risen significantly. This is caused by sulphur, as well as other gases, being released from sub-surface material as it reaches the earths surface. Finally an indicator that is is widely used around the world is the detection of pre-curser earthquakes - of which many have been detected in and around Yellowstone. These types of tremor tend to be much less powerful and destruction than their seismic counterpart, roughly 3-5 on the Richter scale.</p>
<p>These three indicator clearly show that Yellowstone has seen an increase in volcanic activity over the past 20 or so years. This however is not a relevant time scale to geologists. Yellowstone has historically erupted roughly every 560,000 years - give or take 1,000 - 15,000. It has currently been, off the top of my head, 530,000 years since it's last eruption and so realistically I'm not sure it would be likely to erupt in our life time.</p>

Basically the height change daily. But tbh I have no idea if that was just a media &quot;fact&quot; or something scientist use, I imagine they would but it may not be a determining factor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I can remember, generally you know a volcano is becoming more active through earthquake swarms and physical appearance. Depending on how large the volcano Is, earthquakes will become increasingly frequent and roughly at the depth of the magma chamber underneath. This indicates that the magma is increasing causing the earth to move so it can find new cracks to fill before it actually erupts. This also causes the volcano to change shape and rise by feet to meters or develop an explosive dome where magma is building up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
