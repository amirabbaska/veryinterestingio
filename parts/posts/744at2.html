		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The second one.  It's a shorthand for &quot;if something bad had happened, I would have heard about it by now, so things must be ok.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a rule I live by at work.  My boss and I work remotely and our jobs only really overlap when there are problems.  If things are going smoothly, we'll often barely talk for a week or so.  So no news is good news at work - if she's calling, something's usually gone wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Example: I give blood.  Once blood is donated, it gets sent off to testing.  If the blood tests HIV+ or any other anomaly, the blood donation company will call you and tell you the bad news.  If everything is fine, they won't call.</p>
<p>In this case, no news is good news. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every parent with kids in daycare can relate this sentence. If I were at work and got a call from daycare, it is usually like “your kid is sick, please come and pick him up”. It freaks me out when I see daycare calling or left a message. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Nobody has called to tell you she died yet, so it's safe to assume she's alive. Not having news indicates everything is probably ok. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
