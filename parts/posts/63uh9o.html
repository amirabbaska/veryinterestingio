By detecting several of these different pulsars, you can map out your position in three dimensional space. We also know the Sun's position relative to various pulsars, in fact this is on the <a href="https://thethoughtstash.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/pioneer-plaque1.png" target="_blank">map that's on the Voyager probe</a>. So if you know where you are and where you want to go, you can aim in that direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Seriously though, /u/iorgfeflkd's answer is a good one in general, but only if you can bring a detailed &quot;map&quot; with you. If you can bring a reference then by identifying the location of certain objects you can easily identify across galactic distances (like pulsars) then you can locate Earth in 3D space pretty straightforwardly.</p>
<p>But your question seems to be more &quot;how would someone find their way to Earth if they just had their memory to go on?&quot; Which is a different and more complicated problem.</p>
<p>First off is the easy stuff, like knowing that Earth isn't near the core or near the edges, that eliminates a big chunk of the galaxy as search space. Then you have other things, like having the Andromeda galaxy and the Magellenic Clouds being visible in the sky. That eliminates a lot of potential stars that would otherwise have the Milky Way in between those objects and obscure them from view.</p>
<p>Then you have some &quot;trivia&quot; which you might be able to use if for some reason you could remember it. For example, the mass. If you have some alien star catalog you could figure out what the equivalent of 2e30 kg would be and look just for stars of that type. Solitary stars (non binary or trinary stars) and then if you got lucky you might be able to search that catalog for systems with Earth's planetary menagerie.</p>
<p>If that sort of thing isn't an option then you're going to have to fallback on other techniques. Generally you'll look for notable stars and nebulae that are near Earth to find the neighborhood and then find the star system that would end up matching the same stars in the sky as Earth. You might be able to track down the Orion nebula, the Pleiades, Betelgeuse, and Sirius, for example. And between those you should be able to get <em>really</em> close to Earth. Once you can find Sirius (a bright white star only about 2x as massive as the Sun with a white dwarf companion) then you can basically just look at the nearby stars and find which one is the Sun. You can also try looking for the alpha centauri system, which is a triple star system near Sirius with two closely orbiting stars and one more distant dwarf star. The closer you get to Earth the more the constellations will start looking similar to what you're familiar with, so that's a big help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given no prior knowledge, it's impossible. But if you let the traveller have some familiarity with the galaxy, then it's possible to find your way to Earth using only your human eyes. I've played enough with 3D stellar maps in VR to have worked out a reproducible procedure...</p>
<p>From the outset, you'd need to have an awareness of the spiral structure of the galaxy, and know which arm the Sun is in and roughly how far out from the center it is. </p>
<p>Within a few thousand light years, the Hyades is an extremely recognizable signpost. From there, the Pleiades is easy to spot. Given those two points of reference, plus the vector toward the center of the galaxy, one can recall a rough vector toward the Sun. Moving along this vector, you'll know you're close when you see Orion take shape. You fine tune it by aligning the stars in the hand holding the bow, as they are nearest the Sun.</p>
<p>From that close, you should be able to spot Alpha Centauri and the Sun as they are a close pair. Within the system, motion parallax should reveal each of the planets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll be honest I was expecting some Farscape spoilers. I'm only halfway into season 4 and been trying to figure out this same thing... if you fell into a wormhole unprepared, how would you find your way back? As a computer programmer I'd probably approach it like constellation pattern matching, by setting up a 3D model of stars and sampling visual perspectives until something starts to fit, and use those to reduce the problem space. Assuming one is in the Milky Way, and you remember roughly where the Sun is relative to some other features, it probably wouldn't take too long.</p>
<p>If you're not in the Milky Way... hope there are pretty aliens around?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, you would probably want to already be familiar with your Milky Way pulsars and triangulate off of those. </p>
<p>However it'd probably be even easier to pin down at least the general area if not exact location, using just one external galaxy (they are pretty distinctive structures, in addition to probably looking relatively similar regardless of where you are in the Milky Way) you can recognize and then the angle between that galaxy and Sagittarius A. Maybe some distance estimates from your current position to Sgr. A would help, I don't really know though.</p>
<p>This of course would require either a database of galaxies or a good memory of at least a few distinct nearby galaxies above and below the plane of the milky way (less likely to be obscured by dust), in addition to knowing what the angle to those objects is from earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
