		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a variety of reasons why we give multiple doses of vaccines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Vaccines and immune systems can miss each other</em> - Sometimes your immune system isn't great at the time of vaccination so you end up not developing immunity. MMR is  good example of this and why (in a population perspective) multiple doses are given to ensure you have the highest chance of developing immunity, luckily this can sometimes achieve lifelong immunity. Multiple doses can also achieve an even more robust immunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pathogens evolve</em> - this is the assumed reason pertussis for example needs an occasional booster. There are lots of theories why we don't get lifelong immunity, the one I think is the most plausible is that in times before vaccines a natural infection conferred immunity (you know, <strong>if</strong> you didn't die) and then the persistent presence in the population ensured you were continually exposed and got a natural booster. </p>
</li>
<li><em>Some pathogens mutate very fast</em> - influenza is a great example of viruses that are extremely difficult to design vaccines for. Their genome is basically a bookcase and the vaccine targets say a chapter in a book. Influenza can easily swap out pages, chapters, books, even whole shelves. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some vaccines are less immunogenic than others and create less of a response. Even with a proper initial response, memory B cells die eventually, unless you get reexposed to either the virus/bacteria or another vaccination shot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>U/phealthy has a good start, my short addition to this is going to be about TDAP. </p>
<p>TDAP is a vaccine against three pathogens, the &quot;T&quot; is for tetanus. </p>
<p>Specifically for tetanus toxin. The vaccine is designed to induce a b cell response to the toxin, as tetanus toxin is neutralized when bound by antibody. </p>
<p>The vaccine induces a b cell response that wanes over time, years, it wanes because cells die. The vaccine makes you go from one cell that is just sitting around waiting for their day to shine, to hundreds of thousands of clones from that one cell, each one BETTER than the last (somatic hypermutation). After the vaccine leaves your system, the immune response wanes from thousands to hundreds or dozens of cells. These cells generally don't grow anymore, unless they see their nemesis again. </p>
<p>That's what the booster does, it takes the old, tired Batman, and reminds him the reason why he still fights, so he clones himself! More Batmans! </p>
<p>So the amount of antibody falls, you get your booster, and it goes back up. </p>
<p>(Apologies for the silly, I'm a little tired)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
