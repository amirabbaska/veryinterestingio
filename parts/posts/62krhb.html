		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Greg Matloff, Ph.D., is a recognized expert on <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/mach/space/warp-speed-won-t-get-us-stars-just-might-n724396" target="_blank">interstellar travel</a>. He lives with his wife, artist C Bangs, in Brooklyn, New York. Greg teaches physics and astronomy at the City University of New York, has consulted for NASA, is the author or co-author of 12 books and more that 130 scientific papers and serves as an advisor to Yuri Milner's Project Breakthrough Starshot. Although he has contributed to studies of extra-solar planet detection, Earth atmosphere chemistry, Earth defense from asteroid impacts and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, his main research interest is the solar photon sail. Greg feels that the human future and that of our planet's biosphere will be shaped by our ability to utilize solar system resources for terrestrial benefit. He has recently contributed to the scientific investigation of the possibility that the universe is conscious.  See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z-taXIIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">google scholar</a> for his publications, or at <a href="http://www.gregmatloff.com/" target="_blank">www.gregmatloff.com</a> and <a href="http://www.conscious-stars.com/" target="_blank">www.conscious-stars.com</a>. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>How do you keep radiation from killing everyone in a generation ship? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What idea's do you have for preventing high velocity space debris from destroying a ship?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean this to be snarky in any way, just looking for an honest response: </p>
<p>Do you ever feel that your research is futile or meaningless because you'll likely never see it applied until many many years after your death? I know that to many researchers, seeing the fruits of their labor is a greatly rewarding experience, and many engineers and scientists treat projects like &quot;their children.&quot; In a sense, you'll never get to see your children born. How do you deal with that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
