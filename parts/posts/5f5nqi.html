		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you are evolved to eat food, not just suck on it and get flavor. Putting something flavorful starts the digestive process and you not eating something confuses the body. Thus it gives you the urge to eat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the actual flavor that gives you pleasure. Your body is hardwired to chew. It's starts when the teeth come in, and you never grow out of it. You actually get an imperceptible &quot;buzz&quot; from the entire eating process, and this includes the chewing. It's why people enjoy crunchy foods, like potato chips. Some people chew ice, chew pens/pencils/miscellaneous items. Some people grind their teeth in their sleep, so it an unconscious impulse. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
