		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The waves are constantly reflecting off of things. As birds, traffic, people, clouds, etc. move around between the tower and you, the strength of those waves will change. Not an issue when you're in an area with a strong enough signal because it is reaching your antenna from many different directions, but if you're right on the edge of a useable signal someone walking into the room between you and the tower can potentially deaden the signal enough to matter.</p>
<p>Related fun fact, some crazy kids at MIT figured out how to leverage this behavior to let you <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/fadel/wivi/" target="_blank">see through walls with a wifi signal!</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you are at a party and are trying to listen in on a conversation across the room.  If those voices were the only sounds in the room, you could prob'ly hear it.  But they aren't.  Other people who are closer will sound louder.  And, they aren't talking at a constant drone.  There are pauses when they stop, and their voices might be come louder when they are trying to emphasize something or laughing.  With the constant change in volume around you, you might be able to catch bits and pieces of that one conversation across the room, but mostly it will be drowned out.</p>
<p>Your cell phone and the tower you are connected to aren't the only radio waves hitting your antenna.  There are other phones and other towers.  There maybe WIFI routers and laptops.  There are actual radio and TV towers broadcasting.  Sure, these are at different wavelengths, but there is still interference.  There are even radio waves coming in from the sun...  That's why radio stations can be heard from farther away at night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Not to be confused with the same terminology used in biology, as in mobile networks cellphone coverage varies as the towers attempt to cope with spikes in traffic. Here's one paper on the topic that I found quickly: <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1676721" target="_blank">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1676721</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ATT uses a process called breathing on their cell towers. When there is a high amount of users on one tower they reduce the overall signal strength of that tower to boot user to other nearby towers. With more people spread out over more towers overall user experience goes up and bandwidth requirements at towers go down. If you are stationary and not near another tower you could see your signal drop off completely. Working for an electric company this was ATT explanation as to why or communications would drop out at different locations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on what type of service (gsm, cdma, lte, etc) there is a function of cellular service called hysteresis that &quot;keeps&quot; a device on a tower that may not be optimal.  After a short period of time, the phone may move to a different tower that may or may not provide better service.  To understand why this happens, you need to realize that cellular services are designed to save money and to them, data is $$$.  The act of transferring a customer from one BTS to another costs them such money.  If your phone sees two Towers with a RSSI (signal strength) that is very similar, like to the point of turning the handset one way or another would decide which tower is better, the hysteresis system will stick you on the original tower to save the cell company money/data.  After the hysteresis timer runs out, the original tower's faux RSSI boost goes away and your handset gets to evaluate what tower may possibly be a better provider at the time. Another situation where this is used would be driving down the highway, where you may have one directional tower that serves a large length of the road but you have very short periods where you pass areas with a very strong but temporary signal.  It does not serve the cellular company to have your handset jump to every strong tower it sees immediatelyou so the system keeps you on the original tower.  Also, some of the services also add an additional faux RSSI boost to further &quot;herd&quot; handsets to towers that they prefer customers use.  It's all a numbers and RF engineering game.</p>
<p>This is a very confusing system but it's a large part of why your phone may be sitting in place and your service status may change intermittently.  </p>
<p>Lastly, on some of the newer services like cdma and lte, there is a function called &quot;cell breathing&quot; where a tower will boost its power and effectively it's range in lower usage periods.  This is done because during higher use periods, the smaller the range, the less likely the service is to be overloaded if it serves less devices.   Additionally the tower will use less Juice which saves $$$ once again.  This is usually seen on country roads where during the day, you may have a dead spot but at night, it's only a weak or smaller dead spot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
