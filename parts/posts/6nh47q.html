		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long story short, your body doesn't know how to read the 'blueprint' of your finger anymore and can't grow a new one. Your genes hold the blueprints, but they require the help of some molecules known as morphogens to actually shape your body. This happens during embrionic development. Morphogens either cause or prevent certain types of growth in certain parts of your body, causing it to become the shape you are familiar with. </p>
<p>Now, this is all fine and dandy if you are an embryo, but imagine if we had these morphogens in our bodies active as an adult. We would be continuously growing random parts of our body. This is actually one of the pathways that cause cancer. Cancer is bad, therefore our bodies suppress these morphogens after we don't need them. The problem with this is that while we still have a blueprint (genes), we fired the architect (morphogens) who know how to read the blueprint. You can patch up holes without a blueprint but you can't build a new balcony if the one you had fell apart.</p>
<p>As for why we can patch up holes, well it depends on the tissue. Scar tissue isn't the same as normal tissue, it's more a mix of collagen just holding everything together. Kinda like pouring concrete. Your bones are always balanced between dissolving and growing to begin with, so more focus on the growing part means two shattered fragments can eventually become one. Kinda like mortar holding two bricks together. This all is directionless and doesn't need a blueprint, so it can be considered DIY. No need for an architect here.</p>
<p>Edit : Wow, this blew up. Went back to sleep after typing this out and came back to this. RIP inbox lol. Thanks for the gold!</p>
<p>Edit 2 : since a lot of people are asking, let me explain a little about why i think therapeutic application of morphogens isn't exactly viable. Please note that i am not an expert on this subject and i'm just trying to keep things simple.</p>
<p>If you've ever done <em>origami</em>, or paper-folding craft, you'll know that the paper needs to be folded in a specific order. If you try to do it out of order, a corner you need to fold won't be there; it doesn't exist yet. Morphogens are similar to each individual step of folding the paper. As you need a specific corner of paper to fold, morphogens require a specific type of cell in a specific layout to interact with. Because the starting point is different in an embryo and in an adult, the results will also likely be different. And different can mean bad things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll give you a good personal example (I realize it'll get buried, but maybe you read it). I've had a mother of all hematomas (bruises) on my leg in a motorcycle accident, the bruise &quot;choked&quot; itself, the skin died, and in the end the doctor cut off a palm-sized portion of my skin. Nothing deep, he barely made it to the fat layer.</p>
<p>So logically, after the wound got clean and uninfected (nice pink tissue they call &quot;granulation tissue', ripe for healing), you would expect my body to grow some skin over it, and call it a day. But nope - doctors said the skin will take at least a year to grow back. Why?</p>
<p>Because the healing mechanisms are dumb. They start building new skin from the edges (epithelialization). The bared skin edge knows it has to build new skin next to it, and that's all. The meat in the middle doesn't know shit, it just grows temporary new granular meat - I guess if I was a caveman, it would either infect and kill me, or maybe just turn into a giant lump of scar tissue over months (with multiple infections and shit), with epitelization catching up from the sides.</p>
<p>That's why they had to trick my body - they took a paper-thin piece of skin from another part of my body, and fixed it over the wound. The new piece &quot;knew&quot; that it should build new skin, AKA make more of itself (epithelialize), and got to work all over the wound simultaneously, a thing the body would never do. They even cut a bunch of holes in it, so that the &quot;new skin&quot; would have a lot of &quot;seeding spots&quot; that start demanding to grow new skin. In the end, this pathetic paper-thin gauze of a skin grew the entire depth of normal skin from itself (at least 5x the depth it had).</p>
<p>That's how it works - only damage control crews are there. As other posters said, the architect and the engineer both left for good.</p>
<p>UPD: People asked for pics, <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/vUVTj" target="_blank">here they are - NSFW MALE LEG</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some lower vertebrates such as the Axolotl (a kind of salamander) possess amazing regenerative abilities. They are capable of regrowing jaw, limbs, spine, tails etc with perfect fidelity &amp; no scar tissue. Interestingly, these animals are also highly resistant to cancer, which suggests that when, in the course of our own evolution, we became more cancer prone, our bodies responded by limiting our regenerative abilities. This is believed to have happened because cells that are involved in regeneration do so because they dedifferentiate (become less specialized &amp; more generalized) upon injury and re-enter the cell cycle (begin to divide). A cell undergoing such a drastic change &amp; multiplying is a perfect recipe for cancer if the process goes wrong or gets out of control. Interestingly, aside from our skin, our livers have amazing regenerative ability.

<p>You body pumps glue through your blood in case there's a leak. The glue will go into the gaps and clog holes and bind things in place with scar tissue. </p>
<p>The glue doesn't know the original or intended shape of the thing it's fixing. </p>
<p>If you smash your hand, and all the fingers are out of place, and let it &quot;heal&quot; like that, then your hand will continue to be &quot;all messed up&quot;.   The fingers won't re-align. </p>
<p>That said, other animals DO have a smart enough system that the cells know how to regenerate into the proper form.   But that's not the system humans use. The glue thing is useful for quickly closing grievous wounds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. Fingers may be a bad example, since those can -- in part -- grow back in humans who accidentally lop them off. In reality, it's the fingertips, but bone, nail, flesh and all can all grow back: <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/06/10/190385484/chopped-how-amputated-fingertips-sometimes-grow-back" target="_blank">http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/06/10/190385484/chopped-how-amputated-fingertips-sometimes-grow-back</a></p>
<p>This is possible so long as some bit of nail remains in the partially amputated digit, due to the fact that beneath the bed of the nail, a small reservoir of stem-cells exists: <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/how-nails-regenerate-lost-fingertips-1.13192" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/news/how-nails-regenerate-lost-fingertips-1.13192</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
