Mental practice is very beneficial however it has to be accompanied with actual practice and going through those motions. Mental practice on its own will not be sufficient. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is yes, and it's the basis for a whole field of brain-computer interface training schemes: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3837244/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3837244/</a> - this article notes that motor cortex activation increased during motor imagery after training, but not in untrained controls. There should be plenty of other relevant literature in that paper's references.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To a certain extent large scale electrical brain rhythms that are disrupted by action are also disrupted by &quot;motor imagery&quot; (search on that term if you want the literature), e.g. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811905025140" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811905025140</a></p>
<p>There's even some evidence that we can get better at motor actions by mentally practicing! e.g. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452205011541" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452205011541</a></p>
<p>Mirror neurons are sometimes a useful model, but there's a lot to indicate that they're a bit too convenient e.g. <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn.2009.21189" target="_blank">http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn.2009.21189</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There's a research group doing fMRI scans of people in persistent vegetative states. They ask them personal questions and have them think of playing tennis to respond &quot;yes&quot; and think of walking through their homes to respond &quot;no&quot;. The former activates motor regions of the brain, while the latter activates memory processing regions (hippocampus). Through this technique, they've been able to identity signs of consciousness in people thought to be totally brain dead. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2330" target="_blank">Here is a review article about that work</a>. It's pay-walled, but if you don't have access, just google fMRI persistent vegetative state tennis, and you'll find lots of pop science press about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
