		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's different ways that our brains control what we do, very roughly we could break them up as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instincts - stuff we're born knowing how to do</li>
<li>Learning - stuff we figure out through repeated exposure</li>
<li>Conscious control - we can choose to override some actions</li>
</ul>
<p>So for example pulling your hand back from a hot stove is instinct, walking is learned, and you can choose to walk backwards (which requires thinking about to happen).</p>
<p>Breathing is something that can and does fall in to any of the categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone's born knowing how to breath</li>
<li>If we practice breathing (say for swimming or yoga) we can learn to do it differently sometimes</li>
<li>We can choose to stop breathing, for example if we smell something bad</li>
</ul>
<p>In stressful situations, especially ones we haven't practiced alot, we're paying a lot of attention to everything we do and consciously trying to avoid doing anything incorrectly. We can go overboard trying to control everything and control our breathing by just holding it during tense moments. If it's a situation we've practiced then our breathing will probably be fine, and even if we hold our breath a long time our instincts will eventually kick in.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> our brains aren't a single unified system always working in a rational way, a lot of behavior is a bunch of <a href="http://www.definitionmining.com/2016/11/learning-and-intelligence-typical.html" target="_blank">different systems trying to figure out what's best.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This intrigues me. I've been married for 18 years. My husband has a CPAP (EDIT: a C-flex CPAP) machine to sleep, and has had one for about 17 of those years. He's done sleep studies and been to doctors, and apparently it's his brain. When he sleeps, it just forgets to breathe. As a result, he would stop breathing for up to a minute at night and semi-wake up (not fully, as he wasn't aware he was doing it) with a gasp, breathe a few times, rinse and repeat. When he got his CPAP, he woke the next morning absolutely amazed, as he had no idea how badly he'd been sleeping. </p>
<p>Recently, I noticed he does this during the day too. It's always been there, but I'd become so used to it, I stopped noticing. When he's semi or fully reclined AND distracted (playing on the computer, reading, watching tv) his breathing gets really weird, just like before he had his machine. He'll stop breathing a few seconds; inhale....hold breath.... exhale long. It's almost maddening when I start noticing it. I asked him why that happens and he said, &quot;I don't know. It's just hard to breath in that position.&quot;  </p>
<p>I only just now realized, writing this, that it's the distraction in common. If he's laying in bed and we're talking, I don't seem to notice the weird breathing. HOWEVER, at the same time, I don't seem to recall the weird breathing when he's sitting upright at the table and reading either. </p>
<p>I'm not sure how this helps OP, but it does seem to go along with the idea that when distracted (or asleep), it's possible the brain just forgets in some people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do this. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_sleep_apnea" target="_blank">central apnea</a>.</p>
<p>I've ADD and growing up in the 80s, there was a lot of concern among parents at the time about the drugs used to treat ADD. My parents refused to treat me and I was a very early adopter of computers (I got my first at the age of 5) and we lived in the country away from anyone to play with. So I was likely one of the pioneers when it comes to reinforcing my ADD with technology. </p>
<p>According to my shrink it's common to learn coping mechanisms for ADD that are a bit counter intuitive. Because I have trouble focusing and I'm easily distracted, I learned to be able to &quot;hyper focus&quot; on tasks. Meaning, I kind of go into a zen-like state where I literally ignore all outside stimuli. This results in situations where I'll be doing something (like typing this message) and if my wife is asking me what I want for dinner I'll not hear her. She'll eventually come up to me, tap me on the shoulder and the shock of getting yanked back to reality is so jarring I'll jump &quot;WHAT?!?!&quot; etc... Now that I'm older I can decide to take my own medication, learn to deal with my focus issues but 40 years of coping mechanisms are hard to unlearn.</p>
<p>But, getting back to your question, this focus issue includes breathing. When I hyper focus like this, I often start breathing <em>very</em> shallowly, sometimes stopping all together. I'm doing it somewhat unconsciously. For example, while I'm typing this I have to remember to breath when I get to a period. (breath) I recently had some fairly major surgery and they had me hooked up to all the monitoring equipment... every time they brought in some paperwork for me to sign, while reading it I'd set off all their alarms because it wouldn't register me breathing anymore. If I did not slow down like that, I would have had trouble reading the document. The ADD just wont let me concentrate that long on something. </p>
<p>TL;DR: It's like a meditation I do when concentrating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In military Chem warfare training you're taught that when you hear &quot;gas gas gas&quot; you stop breathing (not hold your breath because people tend to take a deep inhale before holding, and if there's gas around, that's bad) and get your mask out. Except I was getting my mask out for a yearly fit check. For no reason I stopped breathing as I pulled it from the carrier and fumbled with the straps (it is stowed different for long term storage vs. an imminent chemical death situation) and by the time I got it on I was lightheaded and couldn't catch my breath through the restriction of the filter. I almost fell over. Very embarrassing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely sure they know precisely why. I have catathrenia, which is a form of sleep apnea where I hold my breath for long durations during sleep and then when I can't any more I let it out in a slow groan. As it gets further on in my life I find this reaching into my waking hours. When working out, staring into space, or concentrating on something, I sometimes realize i've been holding my breath for a minute or more. If I try, however, I can never hold my breath for as long as I do when catathrenia kicks in. Outside a CPAP machine that basically breathes for you, they have no cure for these sorts of apneas. Marijuana has been shown to relax the body and lessen the frequency and severity of apneas, but otherwise they just can't figure it out as far as I know.</p>
<p>But if somebody does know, I'll be trolling this thread hoping for more info.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
