		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is kind of quirky way to ask the question.  I would phrase it as &quot;Why is the government more willing to help get me a 100K for a student loan than 100K loan to start a business?&quot;  That is because the government does not provide loans to individuals, just guarantees to lender on behalf of private borrowers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slower Escalation</strong> A typical business is going to need most or all of that 100K upfront, while a college student will get it over time.  Because it takes time, if you are not fit for the degree you are more likely to drop out before you ever get remotely close to the 100 K amount. </li>
<li><strong>Student Loans are Self Sorting</strong>  Racking up 100K in student loans is not easy.  To get that much in debt you likely went to an excellent school, you are close to graduating from college, or you are working on a post graduate degree.  You would not be in that school or graduate program unless you were already a well above average person.  If youare asking for 100K in student loans, I know you have already jumped through a lot of evaluation and passed it to reach the point that you can ask for it.  </li>
<li><strong>Business Loans Require a LOT of Customization</strong>  As someone who worked as credit analyst of small businesses at a community bank, I can tell you that a small time business loan involves a lot of custom agreements and custom evaluation.  So for every business loan the lender is going to have evaluate it and assure to the government that it will be repaid for the loan to promote the economy as intended.</li>
<li><strong>College Education has Great Returns</strong> On average a 4 year degree earned at age 22 has something the realm of a 12% return.  That is more than enough to cover the interest on a loan.  Additionally College Education has a host of non-monetary benefits to them and society.  College educated people tend to have better health, better child rearing, and more stable income.  That means that government has to spend less on medicare, less on crime, and less on welfare programs.  So a college education pays for itself, increases taxes, and reduces government expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Public Assistance is not necessary to insure the creation of a market.</strong>  For a loan to be worthwhile to make it has to be repaid.  And for a lender to borrow, they have to prove that they can repay a loan.  If you could prove to the government you could repay your business loan, you could prove to a bank that you could repay your business loan.  The government has no role in this market.  But what sucks about education is that while it has great a rate of return for the recipient and society, for it to be worthwhile you have make the loan to people who have been adults for just a few months or years.  These people have no way of proving that they have a good plan for how they will use the funds. Plus part of the process of going to college is figuring out what you are good at.  </li>
<li><strong>Business Loans do not have a clear link to a better society</strong>  In general there is no guarantee of external benefits (benefits that go to someone else) from a business like with college education.  This is why when the government does guarantee loans it is because it perceives a way to benefit society as whole with them.  Like for example, home loans allow people to buy homes.  These homes provide people with equity and more stability.  This reduces their burden on welfare programs and makes them more invested in their communities (in theory).  The agenda of a government loan program is make sure more loans of a beneficial type are provided more than the market would normally want to provide.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>EDIT 1:  Some people have correctly pointed out that some government agencies do make loans directly and that is how they do it since I taught a class on this subject.  </p>
<p>But they are only technically correct (the best kind of correct).  Most of these agencies will bundle the loans into a ABS or similar security and sell it in the private market.  At the end of the day the government is not the ultimate lender, just a conduit that provides a guarantee.  From a economic point of view, it doesn't really matter where the guarantee comes in the funding stream, just that it happens.  The effect is the same.  The government is guaranteeing your loan to the ultimate lender.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, a college education is seen as more beneficial to society in general, regardless of whether or not you end up getting a career in your field. Knowledge is good! There's also the fact that the vast majority of businesses fail within the first few years - and it takes a ton of knowledge (usually learned in school) to successfully run a business, not to mention a solid plan, good market research, a service or product people both need and want to buy, and a bit of luck.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you take out a 100k student loan, even if you don't get a career in your field there's a high likelihood you'll be able to pay back at least some of the loan. If you get paid 100k to start a small business and that business dies after a year, all of a sudden you have nothing to show for it at all and possibly will declare bankruptcy, costing the government even more money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A student loan is a double investment to government. There is interest paid back on the loan and you are more employable in the workforce and will have a greater economic benefit to the country. For the US this applies world wide as their tax laws apply to citizens anywhere.</p>
<p>A business is riskier. The government is more likely to give money to a business than a bank, but it's more likely given as grants than loans and it's still not easy. Most businesses fail in the first few years and they need the 100k usually during start up. Student loans are given out on a per semester basis, spreading it out over years. So a student who drops out after a year will have had less investment from the gov't than a full graduate, the longer you're in school, the more employable you are. A business that fails will have a far larger debt burden due to startup costs and will no longer be contributing to the economy.</p>
<p>Finally you have elections. You'll get far more votes from parents and newly voting students by helping them out than refusing. Which is why it's hard to declare bankruptcy from a student loan, because there needed to be more security in the programs so the election promised could be kept.</p>
<p>Canada had a situation in 2000 where the banks used to handle student loans with gov't guaranteeing them, but they would no longer agree to that risk. Knowing that ending or substantially changing the student loan program would be political suicide, the gov't took over the program entirely which allowed them to completely eliminate the ability to discharge a student loan through bankruptcy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Student loans, by law, are extremely difficult to discharge because of financial difficulty, and generally have a positive return on investment.   A buisness loan is a gamble with little guarantee, and is not under strong federal protection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bankruptcy lawyer here. The answer has been stated herein by others, but it bears repeating. Federally backed student loans are an explicit exception to discharge within the Bankruptcy Code. The Brunner Test has developed to determine whether undue hardship exists that should justify the discharge of other student loans, but these are typically privately held student loans, not federally backed. On the other hand, go set up an LLC, borrow a bunch of cash, personally guarantee it, default on the note, liquidate the business and give all proceeds to the lender, then file a chapter 7 and you are off and down the road to start your next venture. The treatment in bankruptcy is where the answer lies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
