The polar vortex isolates the Antarctic atmosphere in winter, and the extreme cold allows the formation of high altitude ice clouds, and the ice provides a platform for the damaging chlorine molecules to deplete ozone. An atmospheric scientist could provide a more comprehensive answer, but that's the basics of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From NOAA:
The severe depletion of the Antarctic ozone layer known as the “ozone hole” occurs because of the special atmospheric and chemical conditions that exist there and nowhere else on the globe. The very low winter temperatures in the Antarctic stratosphere cause polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) to form. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CFC pollution is global, by the time it gets into the stratosphere it's been mixed into the atmosphere fairly thoroughly.</p>
<p>Also, the ozone hole isn't a permanent phenomenon, it's seasonal. It occurs because during local polar winter there is no UV reaching the stratosphere. UV light breaks up CFCs and releases chlorine free radicals, which destroys ozone, UV light also produces ozone. During the extended darkness of polar winter neither of these processes occur, and CFC levels build up. Then during local spring UV light starts hitting the stratosphere and there's a race between ozone production and ozone destruction. A race that has been won by ozone destruction in recent years due to high levels of atmospheric CFCs. There's enough UV to release chlorine free radicals (which catalytically destroy ozone) but not enough to create sufficient ozone to replace what has been destroyed. These conditions persist through the local spring for several weeks until CFC levels start to decline from this process and as increasing light levels lead to greater ozone production.</p>
<p>Additionally, this process is more significant in Antarctica because there is a stronger polar vortex there, leading to the creation of more polar stratospheric clouds. Such clouds facilitate the reactions of CFC ozone depletion and are much less common around the North pole.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> ozone holes are seasonal and occur around the poles, the Southern ozone hole is more significant because the presence of Antarctica leads to conditions more suitable for ozone depletion (more stable polar vortex, increased presence of unique polar stratospheric clouds that facilitate ozone depletion reactions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In fact there is (or was) an Ozone hole over the Arctic too. It just wasn't as severe and was not observed until after it had been seen in the Antarctic. It wasn't as large because the atmosphere doesn't get nearly as cold high above the arctic as it does over Antarctica. Despite being mostly covered in ice, the arctic ocean keeps the atmosphere over the arctic quite a bit warmer than (relatively) than the high atmosphere over the antarctic. The particles that the fluorochlorocarbons condense on over the antarctic don't form in quite the same density as they do over the antarctic. Also, there are a lot more bases on antarctica that are staffed year round than there are manned locations in the extreme high arctic. It's moving ice up there, not land. As a result, there was no one up there to be looking in the time when the ozone hole was forming. After the Antarctic hole was discovered, the Arctic hole was also found to be there, albeit smaller and not always there. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While CFCs are widely recognized to be the primary cause of global ozone depletion, the antarctic hole has been a challenge for scientists to explain. Clearly, the special weather conditions are part of the picture, but transport (meant in the mass transport sense, not the buses and boats sense) of chlorine sources was hard to explain. That's why the Mt. Erebus theory makes so much <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231015304246" target="_blank">sense.</a></p>
<p>In summary, a volcano in Antarctica has been continuously erupting, emitting large amounts of chlorine (and other relevant gases). It's quite reasonable to think that it has been the reason why the antarctic hole has been so much bigger than the arctic one. This does NOT, however, mean that it accounts for global ozone depletion. That is just anti-science denialism, along the lines of &quot;Global warming is a hoax&quot; thinking. The world is complex, and some people insist on finding simple answers to everything. The Mt. Erebus theory does not contradict established atmospheric chemistry findings regarding CFCs and ozone depletion (or carbon emissions and global warming). If you think it does, that just means you don't understand things very well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
