		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The time frame matters here. In the very short term (hours) thirst is easier to ignore than hunger, and I'll get to that below. In the longer term, dehydration has a much bigger impact: if you don't have any fluid or any water, you will die of dehydration (~3 days) much faster than you will die of starvation (~3 weeks).  </p>
<p>In the short term, why can we ignore our thirst cravings? The answer is, we don't know! From wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the true neuroscience of this conscious craving is not fully clear. In general, the end-result is towards behavior of drinking for hydration, but this can to some degree be resisted, such as in voluntary fluid restriction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thirst is complicated. It has to do with how much fluid you have in your body total, and also, how concentrated with salts is that fluid. A lot of body systems are involved (excretory, endocrine, cardiopulmonary, etc). Here is some speculation: I suspect that those systems are trying to work together to find a balance that works for the organism as a whole, so maybe no one system fully takes over -compelling you to drink- until you're quite dehydrated. </p>
<p>Hunger is slightly less complicated. It has to do with the cells of your body getting the nutrients they need. Each cell is like a car that needs fuel, and that fuel comes from food. When they don't have easy access to nutrients, they have to rely on less optimal means of operation. Your body's response to that is like, &quot;Eat something, ya jackass&quot;. The digestive system releases a chemical called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghrelin" target="_blank">ghrelin</a>, which causes your stomach to contract, aka &quot;hunger pain&quot; as a reminder to eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only at first....all things being equal and starting at once, eventually hunger subsides in advanced malnutrition. Starvation can take weeks. </p>
<p>Dehydration doesn't start with a bang like hunger..but it creeps up slowly and hits harder. First, you are just thirsty. Then, <em>really</em> thirsty. And it gets desperate. Your head begins to ache, your heart begins to palpatate, you may get nausea or diarrhea (which makes things worse, faster). Then your cognitive abilities slip. The headache becomes agonizing. Your pee goes from normal to orange to brown, then stops. Your kidneys begin to hurt. Your mouth goes dry, your tounge swells..it all becomes agonizing. Really, a horrible way to die. And all that ONLY takes 48 hours. Sometimes less in the right conditions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thirst is mediated by the renin angiotensin system, one of the most important biochemical systems we have to regulate fluid volume in the body. Hunger is part of a system that activates your sympathetic nervous system to access stored nutrients in fat and glycogen. Primary mediators of this is norepinephrine and epinephrine, which are known to cause anxiety at high doses. I would think the anxiety from your sympathetic response makes it more difficult to ignore hunger vs the RAS system which is pretty good at managing fluid levels at homeostasis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't, at least not for me. I fasted for two weeks once and had no trouble ignoring hunger after the second day. The equivalent for drinking (not two weeks of course, but maybe 1-2 days without water from any source) is horrific.</p>
<p>If you're thinking of times you ate but didn't drink, remember most food has lots of water in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
