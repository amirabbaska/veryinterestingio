		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason we find it strange to hear our voices recorded and played back is because we hear a combination  of our voice as soundwaves propagated through the air and vibration through our bones whereas everyone else just hears your voice as the sound propagated through air alone. Your ear converts vibrations into electrical signals sent to the brain it will translate information sent through vibrations in air or travelling though your bones.</p>
<p>We can hear very quiet sounds but often ambient noise will drown/mask it. There are rooms called anechoic chambers designed to be sound proof and have no reflective surfaces inside so no noise you make will return to you. They are not perfect but pretty close from what I have been told and have been told if you were to stand in one as you become used to the room you start to hear all sorts of things going on inside your body such as heart beat as they are the only noise being made. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually quite the opposite. Your body is making a hell of a lot of noise (rest your head on someone's stomach some time), which your brain filters out. A disorder of the inner ear called superior canal dehiscence syndrome causes people to hear these sounds - including the sound of their eyeballs moving. </p>
<p>Noises that aren't made internally (like tapping your teeth) pass through the solid matter in your head and manually stimulate the ossicles - which your brain can't filter out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound travels remarkably well through solid or semi-solid materials. Since your mouth and throat are very close to your timpanic membrane (eardrum), the sound waves are picked up even if they are very, very quiet. </p>
<p>As a test - put your ear on one end of a long desk, and get someone to lightly tap the other end. You will be able to hear it. Sound travels fairly well through air, very well through liquids, and extremely well through solids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is only heard when a compression wave in air enters your eardrum and oscillates it, causing the vibration of a chain of tiny bones to send the vibrations to your cochlea, further vibrating the fluid there, finally causing the movement of tiny hairs which our brain interprets as 'sound', with different hairs allowing the perception of different frequencies. One of the reasons young children can hear sounds adults cant, is that you lose some of these hairs over time as you get older and your hearing gets worse or damaged by listening to too loud music. </p>
<p>Anything else which causes your eardrum to oscillate will be heard as 'sound'. Things which make compression waves that you can hear also tend to vibrate when you hit the solid mass that made the compression wave in the first place. When you click your teeth for example your creating a vibration which travels up to your eardrum , oscillating it and your brain interprets that as 'hearing' your teeth click, even though you quite rightly pointed out there was no sound wave. No, but there was a vibration, and you literally hear by making tiny bones vibrate, not by just sensing compression, or 'sound waves' but the vibration those 'sound waves' cause.</p>
<p>Different mediums than air have different acoustic properties, water works very well for transmitting sounds, and over long distances, one of the reasons whales can talk to each other over kilometres. </p>
<p>Rhino's also stomp the ground to send mini shockwaves through the solid earth to be felt/heard miles away too. Air is actually a bad transmitter for sound, but we have evolved to hear in this environment, and all we need to hear is the rustling of some branches to indicate the potential for a predator, and of course understand sounds as language which builds on our social capabilities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should read up on Bone anchored hearing aids(BAHA). They work buy putting sounds through the skull. It will answer this question and it is pretty interesting. My cousin has one and it came with a little attachment that allows him to put it on your skull and you can hear through it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
