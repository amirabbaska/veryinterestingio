		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure we get a few popular games like rock band and guitar hero, but most rhythm games seem to be made in japan. For example, DDR, Sound Voltex, Mai Mai, Taiko, beatmania, In The Groove, and many more all originated in japan, and are so hard to find in arcades in the U.S. The only one you're likely to see is DDR, but not much else. Why do these games seem to be more popular in the east than the west?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arcade culture is a big deal in Japan. One of the reasons is Japanese kids go to arcades to socialise a lot more than American kids do. Japanese arcades are sometimes 10 story buildings, filled with games of every type. Usually there's at least one entire floor devoted to dance/rhythm games. People that live in Japanese cities tend to have small apartments, so, it's hard to have all your friends over to play games, they go play at the arcades. Dance/rhythm games are a social thing and the Japanese take it very seriously whereas in a lot of other developed countries, arcades have died out, yes they still exist but nothing like the scale of what you find in Tokyo. I've been lucky enough to visit quite a few countries, Arcades in Tokyo are amazing. They even let you smoke and drink. Japan is awesome. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Arcades, and rhythm games are specifically brought up and talked about. It's actually a pretty interesting topic, and the 3D video/exploration is neat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
