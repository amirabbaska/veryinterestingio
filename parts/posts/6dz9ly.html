		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not in their chemical composition but in their physical composition. Bathroom usually means ceramic tile and porcelain and kitchen usually means linoleum, stainless steel, and veneer cabinetry. </p>
<p>Ceramics are hard. In fact they are some of the hardest materials found in most homes short of glass, silica, or diamond. So a bathroom cleaner will usually contain a softer but abrasive agent to help scrub dirt and grime off of tiles but without scratching them. Because tile and porcelain are so hard, you can use some pretty abrasive stuff without fear of scratching them. However if you use them on plastics, linoleum, or veneers they can scratch and gouge them. </p>
<p>Some of the most abrasive cleaners will have warnings about which surfaces they can be used on. Their abrasive qualities however make quick work of hard water stains and soap scum such as in a shower or toilet. You wouldn't want to use them on a stainless steel sink though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are differences depending on what surface the chemical has to clean, and how dirty it is likely to be. A toilet cleaner will need to be porcelain-friendly and high-strength. A countertop cleaner will need to be friendly to most materials and not be terribly strong or scented </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They might be different. There type of dirt in the different environments. The kitchen often have a lot of grease and requires cleaning agents that can dissolve fat. Bathrooms on the other hand will have more salts which have come with the water and gets excreted when the water slows down. So you need different kinds of solvents to get rid of the salts. You also need to take care when using a cleaner in the kitchen as trace elements might more easily end up in the food. So you have to use chemicals that is safe to consume and not alter the taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I checked the bottle of the bathroom and kitchen cleaner we had a while back. I think I wanted to clean some tiles and wasn't sure which would be best. The main chemical in them was the same, but in slightly different concentrations.</p>
<p>Also, I think 'kitchen' cleaners are more likely to have a fruity flavour to them such and lemon. But bathroom stuff tends to have more outdoorsy/nature smells such as sea breeze or whatever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemist here! They're probably <em>mostly</em> the same but with a few different ingredients based on the stain they're meant to clean. Kitchen cleaners are also probably are probably less toxic than bathroom cleaners due to it being a food preparation area. That's less important in a bathroom. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
