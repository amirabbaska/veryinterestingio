		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you shave against the grain the razor tugs at the hair in addition to slicing through it, pulling it a bit farther out of the follicle.  This makes it much easier to get ingrown hairs and irritation on the skin.</p>
<p>Edit to elaborate on everyone else's experiences by adding my own:  Using Mach 3s and all that newer stuff I always broke out on my neck.  Switching to a safety razor(a big part of this is also finding the right blade brand for you skin, Feather was way too sharp for me and caused razor burn, I ended up going with Derby), using a badger hair brush and shaving soap and making my own lather, shaving while showering and your hair is moist and skin is warm from the steam, and rinsing with ice cold water after the shave are what I found work the best.  Hard to nail down exactly what helped the most cause I switched to doing all that at the same time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/medical/graphics/coldwater.jpg" target="_blank">Cold Water</a> ;P (I honestly think rinsing with cold water for at least 15 seconds before putting on after shave is the most important part in avoiding irritation and ingrown hairs.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly a problem with people of ethnic background, because our hair tends to be more curly. That's the biggest source of the problem. </p>
<p>When you shave with the grain, you slice the hair in such a way that the end is relatively flat. Think of an unsharpened brand new pencil. When you shave against the grain, you slice an angle into the hair and make it sharp. </p>
<p>Now, if your hair tends to be thin and straight, this isn't much of a problem. The area will inflame a bit immediately after shaving, but the hair still grows straight out of the follicle. If your hair naturally curls, though, we have an issue. There's a chance that your spear-shaped hair will get caught in the inflamed skin. </p>
<p>If that happens, it's easy for the hair to loop around or otherwise stop growing out of the follicle. Congratulations! You've irritated your skin to produce a razor bump or graduated past that to an ingrown hair! </p>
<p>The best method I've found, which works for all humans regardless of ethnicity, is to use a safety razor and shaving cream. Shave very lightly in the direction of the grain only. This cuts the hair off flat and flush with the skin. Immediately follow with shave balm or after shave and lotion. </p>
<p>Hope this answers your question thoroughly. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With vs against the grain is really dependant on what kind of facial hair you have, skin sensitivity, and also how you prepare to shave. </p>
<p>The best shave will always be in a hot steamy shower after you've already washed everything and gotten your face/wet/steamy/hot. Softening up the hairs and just making everything easier to work with.  Go to an old school barber shop and the hot towel on the face thing was done for a reason :) </p>
<p>Shaving a few days growth?  1st pass with the grain to get the bulk, 2nd pass against the grain to get it baby smooth. </p>
<p>I like saving money but those disposeable single use bic safety razors are shit and no matter how slow or careful, I get cut to hell with them.  Currenly use a Schick Hydro 5 (little cheaper than the gillette stuff) and does an awesome job.   Even tried those dorco razors (dollar shave club) and found them to be of inferior quality. </p>
<p>Speed shaves in front of the mirror while you are running late, will never be as smooth or irritation free when you are in a rush, more irritation as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
