I'd only assume that they universities are very selective of their students and that the criteria to get in would be equally as selective. But, when looking at the top universities in the world, it seems to indicate that the western universities are better. And also, universities such as Harvard, Oxford and the like seem to be the best universities in the world. </p></div></div>
