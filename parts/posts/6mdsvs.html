		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The popular answer is the evolutionary one--that emotions have helped us survive. When we lived in the wild--with monkeys and mastodons and tigers--we needed emotions in order to react quickly to dangerous stimuli. If faced with a tiger, it's better to be rocked with a fear so strong it triggers a rush of blood than to sit around and theorize about the threat. We developed an emotional system because it could induce quick responses to danger.</p>
<p>Other emotions work the same. Humans are rather clever animals. We've managed to teach ourselves how to express ideas through written words, as well as emotions through art and music. Think about that for a minute. Through our art and music, the emotion felt by an artist may be encoded through color, shadow and harmony to be decoded and experienced by an observer or listener. That is arguably one of humanity's greatest accomplishments. </p>
<p>And yet, despite the apparent ease with which artists or musicians can create a work that unlocks emotions in the audience, <strong>we have no idea how it does such an amazing thing. We do know that emotions may be expressed in art -- and that humans can readily recognize them.</strong></p>
<p>As with music -  Jordan Peterson explained this pretty well in one of his lectures.</p>
<p>We want meaning in our lives. Life is a balance between order and chaos and we don't take too well to chaos but it can be overcome and made into order, making us feel accomplished and life meaningful. Music mimics this process. It's highly ordered and miraculous. He claims even the most nihilistic of us like music because of this reason. It generates meaning. People on psychedelics often say they really understand and can see the structure of music way differently than the normal waking state. Haven't done them though so can't comment.</p>
<p>More details :</p>
<p>Music is processed by the auditory system in the brain, just like verbal information (speaking). The auditory system is connected to the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for emotion processing. Music can, just like verbal information, activate the entire limbic system and thus stimulate an emotional response if it's suitable for the situation (context processing is also important in stimulating an emotional response).</p>
<p>The same goes to other sensory perceptions - vision can also stimulate an emotional response, for example art paintings. Smell is unique in the sense (pun unintended) that smell information travels directly to its cortex in the brain, unlike the other sensory information that first passes through a relay station (the thalamus), and is tightly connected to the hippocampus (responsible for memory formation, context and emotion processing). Smell can thus trigger very profound memory recall to specific situations</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read an interesting dissertation a while back about this effect in music.  The idea was that music impacts us on a lot of different levels at once.  On the physical level, studies have shown that your heartbeat responds to the beat of music, which in turn influences your mood/excitation.  On the social level, we are taught from a very young age to interpret certain sounds certain ways.  For example, many Americans interpret music in minor keys as &quot;sad.&quot;  There is also the associations that our brain makes - we hear a particular tinkling run of notes, and that tinkling sound is associated by our brain with water falling.  Then you add in personal experiences, and the result is synaesthetic (which means experiencing one sense triggers memories of others).</p>
<p>So I hear a song with a slow beat (slows my heart, relaxes me), in a major key (socialization = happy!), where the melody reminds me of moving water (like the waves at the beach), and my brain takes all that together and connects me to a wonderful memory of building a sandcastle with my niece at the beach.</p>
<p>I can't speak to other forms of art/literature, but I suspect there's similar results.  The dissertation was &quot;Indra's Note:  An Investigation into Musical Awareness&quot; by Randall Pabich</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well remember that all art, music, and literature, is made by <em>people</em>. People who wanted to <em>express</em> something through one of these mediums. Express something like a feeling, or thought, or idea, something that they could not convey in simple words, as they were confronted with a strange gap between the limited range of everyday communication, and the seemingly intangible nature of the thing inside of them, waiting to be shared.</p>
<p>So they try to bridge this gap. They try to create paths, links, associations, from the '<em>thing</em>', the little bit of reality within, to something created outside, which mirrors that feeling inside. The artist, hoping to be able to re-create the feeling - or something analogous to the audience - tries to keep in mind that this path can't be too unique to him or her. It needs to be a path that could take many to a similar place within them, even if they're all different people.</p>
<p>Artists create art because they are moved. What makes them great artists, is not conveying just what they moved, but recreating the way that they became moved at all, through the basis of our mind which is the senses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the comments here are from a scientific perspective. I'd like to add a philosophical perspective to the conversation. </p>
<p>Extraordinary art (in general) resonates with us when it points to some deep truth about the nature of our reality as humans. Whether that is the truth of suffering or our hope for the alleviation of that suffering, art reminds us of what it means to be human by tapping into that which we all desire, fear, love, or hate. Goya's <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Goya_Dog.jpg" target="_blank">Dog</a>, for example, immediately conveys a sense of isolation and fear that we have all experienced. Sometimes we are not as connected with that part of our inner life, so seeing the image punctures the dam we've built up, and the emotions pour out. </p>
<p>Or see this explanation of <a href="http://www.classicfm.com/composers/mahler/guides/symphony-no-2-genius/" target="_blank">Mahler's 2nd Symphony</a>. If you pay attention to the symphony, it's almost impossible not to be moved, since we all fear death. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLV_hs_2KQ&amp;t=63s" target="_blank">&quot;The best moments in reading are when you come across something - a thought, a feeling, a way of looking at things - that you'd thought special, particular to you. And here it is, set down by someone else, a person you've never met, maybe even someone long dead. And it's as if a hand has come out, and taken yours.&quot;</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
