		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some salts do absorb water and change their crystal structure, for example calcium sulphate hemihydrate (plaster of Paris) becomes calcium sulphate dihydrate (Gypsum). But NaCl will not, though you can crystallise the dihydrate from a cold solution. Generally the original structure in these transformations is broken down, then the new structure forms, rather than a transition from one to the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean when you dissolve them in water? </p>
<p>When a salt dissoves in water, the Na is attracted to the negative oxygen while Cl is attracted to the hydrogen in turn splitting the salt into Na+ and Cl-. Because of this the salt no longer has a crystalline structure so it doesn't have lattice constant.</p>
<p>edit Oxygen has a partial negative charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, but in typical real life practice, it can be ignored.</p>
<p>As painful said, NaCl is very soluble in water, so in most cases it'll just fully dissolve, so we'll ignore those cases. Solvent environments can roughly be modeled as force fields with a given, in this case attractive, force for every atom in the lattice. The deeper in the lattice an atom is, the lower the force it experiences from the solvent is. Basically, the closer to the solvent an atom is, the more force it experiences, and the farther it deviates from the ideal vacuum lattice constants you tend to see in tables.</p>
<p>Now, that earlier paragraph ignores dissolution. For this system, the dissolved state is lower energy than the lattice state, so atoms that dissolve tend to stay dissolved (sort of anyway, there's still a lot of dissolution and lattice formation because that's just how the world works). The atoms that dissolve are the atoms that have sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy for the dissolution reaction, and that energy ends up being a combination of the atom's placement in the lattice and the amount of kinetic energy that particular atom &quot;innately&quot; has. The distribution of &quot;innate&quot; energy in the lattice is well modeled by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and the placement in the lattice and how that affects energy was described in earlier paragraphs. Basically, the high energy atoms near the surface are the ones that dissolve. The other atoms will stay in the lattice.</p>
<p>And again, in practice this effect is tiny and can usually be ignored. Especially when you're not dealing with nanoparticles because the smaller the particle, the more surface states there are, and the more surface states there are, the more the solvent matters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
