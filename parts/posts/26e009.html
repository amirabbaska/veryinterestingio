		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it will.  And you don't have to worry about compensating for the movement of Mars.  Your flashlight has roughly a 5-degree half-angle cone for a beam (10 degrees across the full cone). Mars moves around the solar system slower than Earth. Earth moves at about 1 degree per day (this is where 360 degrees in a circle comes from). Mars moves about half that. </p>
<p>So you don't have to worry about pointing it too precisely, since you're using a flashlight, not a laser. </p>
<p>The distance to mars changes a lot, but let's say on average it is 230,000,000 km from earth (This number is about the distance from mars to the sun).  </p>
<p>The area of Mars' disc is about 36 million km^2 (based on a diameter of 6779 km). </p>
<p>The diameter of the flashlight's disc at mars is 230,000,000 km <em> the sine of 5  degrees </em> 2 (since the full cone is 10 degrees). This is roughly:
230,000,000 <em> 5/57 </em> 2 (using a small angle approximation for Sine and saying that 180/pi = 57, a number which I like to call the Heinz constant for no particularly useful reason.  This gives about 40 million km in diameter. The area of this disc then becomes 1.3 x10^15 square kilometers.</p>
<p>Ok, now we're going to make a particularly bad assumption- that the energy of the beam is spread evenly across the beam's cone. </p>
<p>And then now we can say that the percentage of beam power making it to mars (after making it out of Earth's atmosphere) is the same as the ratio of the area of mars to the size of the flashlight's disc at that same distance. So here we go:</p>
<p>Pmars / PleavingEarth = 36 x10^6 / 1.3 x10^15  </p>
<p>We crunch this number and find out that:
Pmars / PleavingEarth =  27 x 10^-9, also known as 2.7 x 10^-8   Note that this is unitless- there's no more distance or area numbers here. It is just a ratio. </p>
<p>So, what is the power leaving Earth?  Let's assume abright flashlight- a 10-Watt incandescent bulb. I think roughly half of this just creates heat. The other half creates visible light. So we have 5 watts of visible light leaving the flashlight. Half of this (I really think it is closer to 2/3, but whatever) gets stopped by our atmosphere. So we have 2.5 watts forming this enormous disc pointed at Mars. </p>
<p>Then we just calculate the power at Mars = 2.5 Watts * 2.7 x 10^-8 </p>
<p>= 6.7 x 10^-8 Watts arriving at Mars. </p>
<p>So that's in terms of Power. Now, we care about Photons. So we find (either by doing math or letting other people do the math for us that the energy of a green photon is 4*10^-19 Joules. Green is an ok color to use, since our atmosphere is pretty transparent to green, though it is more transparent to yellow. You know this is the case because when you look up at the sun at mid-day, it looks yellow. Source: my drawings from kindergarten. </p>
<p>Then, we just divide the energy arriving at mars by the energy of single photons. </p>
<p>Photons per second = Power / energy per photon</p>
<p>Photons per second =  6.7 x 10^-8 (Joules/sec) / 4*10^-19 Joules</p>
<p>Photons / second = 1.7 * 10^11 </p>
<p>So there would be around 170,000,000,000 photons per second arriving at Mars. </p>
<p>Now to actually see how bright this is... if someone had a photodetector the size of a really big telescope, like the Keck telescope, pointed at your location on Earth, with a perfect photodetector, how often would they see a photon on average?</p>
<p>Well, the diameter of the telescope is 10 meters. The area is then 78.5 square meters, or 78.5x10^-6 square kilometers, aka 7.9 ^-5 square km. </p>
<p>We take the ratio of the area of the telescope to the area of the planet and then multiply that by the incoming photon rate. </p>
<p>Photon Rate Telescope = 1.7 <em> 10^11 photons per second </em> 7.9 ^-5 km^2 / 36 x10^6 km^2</p>
<p>Crunching numbers,  Photon Rate Telescope =  0.37 *10^0 = 0.4 photons per second. </p>
<p>So this says that if you shined a big consumer flashlight at Mars and had a Keck telescope at mars with a photon counter on it pointed at where the person with the flashlight was standing, there would be a photon from that flashlight arrive about every 2.5 seconds. </p>
<p>Yay. </p>
<p>Also, I'll work on my Randall impersonation later. I don't really draw. </p>
<p>EDIT: Just for folks who are not overcome with awe and would like to know how to do analyses of this type, this has a name. It is called a Fermi Analysis. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem</a>  Best of luck! Nothing is so big and scary that it can't be thought about rationally. </p>
<p>EDIT 2: I've been told in the comments that the conversion of electrical energy to light energy is about 5%. This seems believable. I assumed 50% in the analysis above, which is not realistic for an incandescent bulb.  So if we were to assume an LED flashlight in the example above, the numbers are probably close to right. This is an unrealistically big flashlight though.  If, however, you want to redo this with an incandescent bulb, just divide the final photon flux by 10 (the ratio of 5% and 50%). This means one photon on the telescope every 25 seconds. </p>
<p>Also, Thanks for the gold, but I only use throwaways to keep from spending much time on reddit, so this account is about to be deleted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both EM waves (eg. light) and gravitation propagate to infinity. So, yes, a tiny amount of light reaches it. It will reach Andromeda galaxy too. It will reach anything within observable universe.</p>
<p>But there's one thing which bothers me. The intensity drops with the square of distance. At the same time, according to QM, light is quantized. Wouldn't that mean that at a certain distance the energy of the beam will fall bellow the energy of a single quanta (photon)? What happens then? Wouldn't that mean that there IS a limit of the propagation of EM waves? As the distance increases, the energy drops, drups, drops... but it cannot do that indefinitely. Theres Planck constant, right?</p>
<p>What am I not understanding? Pls help!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
