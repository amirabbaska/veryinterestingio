<p>A lot of the old era of obvious polygons actually came down to both low polygon counts AND extremely primitive shading. Often, triangles were single color, with no textures, with no dynamic lighting. This made the seams between triangles incredibly obvious.</p>
<p>We've only had to increase the polygon count a little, most of the improvement has come from the shading side.</p>
<p>Here's a pic of a wheel of cheese from skyrim, look at the right side:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the cases there are just more triangles in circular shapes, so you don't notice it especially from far away. Closer you get to the shape then its more obvious that there are triangles.
But, if the game really cared and there wouldnt be many need for perfect circles, game can raytrace them and this will result in perfect circular shapes. This is commonly used if you render some planets like moon in the sky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>No, they don't. They are just cheating it so good that it becomes hard to notice.</p>
<p>On old graphics cards, with built-in rendering pipeline, you could only really control vertices. This meant, if you wanted high-quality circle, you had to use lots of vertices.</p>
<p>On modern graphic cards, pixel shaders of modular pipelines allows you to control each pixel. This means that even if you have low-polygon model, you can &quot;change&quot; individual pixels to get closer to the ideal circle. This is still not ideal circle, but it makes it much harder to tell apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
