		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first let me say I am so excited to find this page, I’ve been looking for something like this for a long time.</p>
<p>So the universe started x number of years ago (13.6 billion?) and so that is the limit of what we would be able to see. Ultra deep field I believe saw up to around 13.2? Billion light years away (essentially 13.2 billion years into the past).</p>
<p>And I believe it would have been the same story if it was pointed at a completely different part of the sky. And also would be the same if someone way out there had one pointing at us.</p>
<p>Which would make not only everywhere the center, but everywhere also the edge (of the observable universe).</p>
<p>So my question/confusion comes in, because doesn’t that mean that the universe was that big that long ago?</p>
<p>Or even more, what if (theoretically) you leap frogged the telescopes, and we saw 13 billion light years away (13 billion years into the past) and then put a telescope there pointing in the same direction, and so on?</p>
<p>I feel like I’m making an incorrect assumption somewhere.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the current understanding is that the universe is infinite, and expanding at an accelerating rate. This might be counter-intuitive, but it's best to think of it as &quot;everything is always getting further away from everything else&quot; rather than as a bubble with a fixed edge that's expanding into... something.</p>
<p>This means that when we look into the past, everything was closer to each other, but the universe was still infinite in size. We aren't seeing &quot;ourselves&quot; in the past, if that's what you're getting at. We're seeing a distant part of the universe in the past - a part that used to be closer, but now is further away.</p>
<p>As a side note, this expansion means we can actually see objects that are more than 13.6 billion light years away. If you look at something billions of light years away, then it takes light billions of light years to reach us. But the whole time, the universe is still expanding, and the galaxies are getting further and further from us while the light is travelling to us. So even though the light can't have travelled more than 13.6 billion light years, it could have travelled from an object that is now more than 13.6 billion light years away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. These distance values are misleading, they don't really correspond to any distance.</p>
<p>If we look at light that was emitted 13.2 billion years ago then we see objects that were maybe 2 billion light years away from us back then. The universe was still expanding rapidly, so initially the distance between this light and us increased. It reached a maximum of about 5 billion light years until the expansion slowed down enough for the light to catch up - and today it arrives here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and we saw 13 billion light years away (13 billion years into the past) and then put a telescope there pointing in the same direction, and so on?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If someone 13 billion light years away from us today has a telescope they can see beyond the edge of our observable universe - but they can't instantly transmit this information to us. If they send us pictures we'll be able to receive them in the very distant future. Barely, a bit more distant and we don't get them any more no matter how long we wait (~15 billion light years). This also means the range of things where we can see their past is still increasing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine first that the universe was not expanding.  Just a giant sphere, say... 100 billion light years in diameter, instantly at the moment of creation.  Now imagine by coincidence you were at the center of that sphere right at the start, and you looked up.  What would you see?</p>
<p>Well first, nothing, because the light from even the closest star to us (the sun) takes 8 minutes to get here.  It would just be blackness.  8 minutes later, you would suddenly see the sun.  Within a few years, you’d see the stars closest to us within a few light years.  After 13.2 billion years, you’d see every star and galaxy within 13.2 billion light years of us.</p>
<p>In the example where the universe is 100 billion light years wide, there’s still 43.4 billion light years of stuff out there in every direction!  But you can’t see them yet because their light hasn’t had time to get to you.  The longer you wait, the further you can see.  Your “observable universe,” as we call it, is only 13.2 billion light years wide, but getting bigger every second.</p>
<p>Ah, but the universe isn’t static.  It’s expanding.  And we’re not at the center.  Similar to how the raisins in bread dough see every other raisin getting further from them as it expands while baking, space is stretching away in every direction no matter where you stand.  A star that may have been, say... 5 billion light years away when it’s light started shining has slipped away and is now 20 billion light years away from you physically by the time it’s first light arrives.  That means you can technically see <em>farther</em> than the actual number of years that have passed since the beginning.</p>
<p>As such, even though the universe is about 14 billion years old, our observable universe has stretched about 4x in that time, and we can see the light from things that are actually about 46.5 billion light years from us now.  There’s probably a TON more out there, but we have no way of seeing or measuring how much.</p>
<p>But there’s another quirk.  The things furthest from you, you see how they looked 14 billion years <em>ago,</em> because you’re seeing the first light they ever put out, when they were younger.  You’re seeing back in time.  That means closer and closer to the time of the Big Bang.  If it happened 14 billion years ago, that means anything you can see that far away, you’re basically seeing the Big Bang itself.  And we can!  Out beyond that distance, all we can see is the opaque, glowing sheet of pure radiation that immediately followed the Big Bang, before the universe cooled enough that light could travel freely and space turned transparent and black.  And it looks <a href="https://img.purch.com/w/660/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA0NC81MDYvb3JpZ2luYWwvMjAxNC10a3AtYXN0cm8tZXhwbGFpbmVkLmpwZw==" target="_blank">like this.</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the language around all topics regarding the &quot;universe&quot; needs to change.  I think the hardest thing for people to understand is the idea of expansion.  The old &quot;if the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into?&quot; question becomes difficult to discuss in a field where concepts such as multiverses exist.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The lessening in density explanation does help. And it blew my mind a little bit thinking about the Big Bang happened everywhere.</p>
