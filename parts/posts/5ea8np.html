		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take-off and landing are the most dangerous part of any airplane ride.</p>
<p>As such, precautions are taken so that if the worst case scenario happens and something goes wrong during take-off/landing, we minimise the damage. Being upright and locked into place, means the seats are better at absorbing shocks and people can brace for impact. Trays and loose items are stowed so they can't turn into projectiles. Having your seats upright also means that if they do need to evacuate, everybody has enough room to get out of their seat. Evacuations have to happen quick and efficiently, and that can't be done if someone else's reclined seat means you have trouble getting up from yours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This question gets asked often here on Reddit, the above is the correct answer. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a related note, I've suspected that the reason why electronic devices are not to be used during take off and landing isn't because they might interfere with the electronics of the plane itself, it's because the flight crew wants you to be paying attention to instructions rather than being distracted by your music or your spreadsheet. More than once I've stowed (back in the 90s and the early 00s) my portable CD player in my carry on luggage, and when I retrieved it, I found out it had been running during the take off. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has done this, and I've never heard of any plane crash because of someone's computer, smart phone or iPod being left on.</p>
<p>EDIT... until the Samsung Galaxy 7 issue, of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's the way the seats are tested. Aircraft interiors have to withstand 9 g's forward crash load and restrain everythiing and not come apart. And everything that goes into an aircraft interior is either tested or analyzed for 9 g's. But seats especially new designs get tested. It's pretty amazing to see the slow motion video of the tests. They put them on a sled speed up the sled  and then ram the sled into something immovable. All the seats have crash test dummies and let me tell you those dummies are all over the place. They stay restrained but they really get jerked around. So anyway that's how they get tested seats upright. So that's how you have to land.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
