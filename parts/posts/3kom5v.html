		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is no exact number. It depends on the individual. It would also depend on what it is about sleep deprivation  that actually kills you. We know from research on rats that when rats are deprived of sleep,they get ravenously hungry and constantly eat but keeping losing weight until they die. So maybe your initial weight and metabolic rate affects this.</p>
<p>In this case, involving a high school student named Randy Gardner, Randy was being observed by a well known sleep researcher, William Dement, and his health was constantly being monitored. If there was a great risk to his health, I'm sure the study would have been stopped.</p>
<p>By the way,this is the longest official record of someone remaining awake without the use of stimulants. I don't know if anyone has stayed awake longer while using drugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was in the army, I decided to follow my fathers side of the family and go into the Special Forces. After I made it through SFAS, I went to phase 1 on the Q course. Before this, I had never known how sleep deprivation would affect me. We would go mission after mission and just when I thought we would get some sleep at a patrol base, down came another op order and we'd start again. This would go on for 4 days, then we'd return to a FFU and sleep 8 hours and eat whatever MREs we had left over. We'd then go out and do it all over again. That pattern went on for over a month. Some were talking about hallucinations and I thought they were just making shit up. Then after 3 or 4 weeks, it started happening to me. It wasn't like the tripping balls kind of hallucinations. It was more like the way dreams morph and change, but while we were awake. </p>
<p>I remember my first one happened while I was at an LP/OP just outside of a draw my team had went into to set up a patrol base. It was like 5 am and the sun was just starting to come up. I looked around and there was a clown looking at me. Funny thing was, it just seemed totally normal to me to see this fucking brightly colored clown in the middle of the woods. Then as I watched, it just morphed into a tree stump. Just like a dream, things get weird, then normal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I went through Hell Week of Navy Seal training were you go about 5-6 days with almost no sleep.   They actually let you sleep I think twice, for an hour or so each time...not to give you rest but to give you the torture of being woken from that much needed rest by sirens and machine gun fire (blanks).</p>
<p>The main symptoms were some hallucinations and difficulty thinking.  After the fourth or so day if we sat down and closed our eyes even for a second we'd instantly fall asleep.</p>
<p>When done they make you sleep under mandatory watch for a while....I was one of the odd / unusual cases who actually did not fall asleep.  Everyone was given a pizza and more than half the guys did not want thiers -- they gave them back.</p>
<p>So for some reason not only could I not sleep but I was hungry when no one else was -- I ended up staying awake an hour or two and eating like 9 small pizzas (seriously).</p>
<p>I remmemebred this guy slowly talking to me saying &quot;You need to go to sleep&quot;.  I finally went to bed, slept about 13 hours and after that was back to a normal schedule.</p>
<p>(I made it through the week but you also need to do BUDs and smthing called STT as well as jump school at Fort Benning to be an actual SEAL, I didn't complete those things so didn't serve as a SEAL) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I stayed awake for 105 hours. There is a surprising amount of clarity after about 36 hours, as if everything becomes like a pin-point, very focused. I would say the most difficult thing to deal with is the auditory and visual hallucinations. I think I could have gone much longer, but I began to not trust my environment, since it wasn't very controlled. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
