		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As just stated, Safety is first, so comfort and familiar environment can last a long time until the person feels they can attain that same safety elsewhere.  When it comes to tasks however,  purpose and passion come in.  To be useful or valuable, the brain wants to do something meaningful, creative, successful, etc., which usually means a variety.  Some people do find their favorite passion and do the same thing for 20 years, but that’s rare to find.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maslow’s hierarchy of needs comes to mind.  Safety is the very first (base of the triangle), so maybe seeking the familiarity of Home is related to that.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are looking at it from the same angle...sure it's the same, but it's not.</p>
<p>Having or staying in the same home provides a certain amount of comfort or a safe place to go. But doing the same thing over and over can become monotonous and mind numbing. Humans (and animals to a lesser extent) need to do things that engage the brain. That's why puzzles, games, treat balls for dogs, etc are needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we, like all animals, like to keep things simple and easy. Imagine moving to a new house every day; wouldn't you forget where the bathrooms are? you would have to learn how to operate a new stove or have a new location for your trash can. It makes everything a lot harder. Having the same orientation of items around the house makes more sense in our minds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
