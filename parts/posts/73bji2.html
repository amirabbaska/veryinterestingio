		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two ways: the first is by measuring the voltage. Batteries slowly decrease in voltage as they discharge. So, by knowing the voltage, you have a rough estimate of how much energy is remaining. The second is a coulomb counter. By measuring how fast energy is leaving every second, and adding it to a running total, you can get a very precise measure of how much electricity is in the battery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It uses a fuel gauge which often measures multiple things including current, voltage and impedance. Voltage decreases over time for batteries (voltage sag) and you can also use a current shunt to see the amount of current that flows out of the battery and compare it to the actual battery capacity to see how much of it has been discharged. Additionally, the internal impedance of the battery increases as it discharges which can also be measured. Finally it also calibrates the amount of charge the battery contains in software every time you fully charged it and discharge it and can account for changes in voltage and current due to temperature</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phone keeps track of many variables, and then makes a careful math in order to estimate the percentage of charge left. </p>
<p>Imagine that you have a cup which it's volume you cant measure beforehand, and you have a straw to drink from it. By different measures you're able to tell how much water you're drinking per hour, and you'll definitely notice when the cup is empty, then you fill it up again and repeat. So  eventually you can calculate the total  volume of the cup with some accuracy. </p>
<p>The battery uses voltage, current, voltage drop per minute, probably even temperature in order to accurately estimate your percentage and even how long it'll take for your charge to be used (estimating by yout historic of usage). </p>
<p>Something that most people don't know is that all batteries change their capacity by each cycle of use, so your 3000mAh battery will eventually become a 1500mAh battery with age and use. (of it doesnt fail beforehand) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
