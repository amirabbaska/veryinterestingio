		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several things at play:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Infrastructure. In order for your phone to get data, it needs to be able to contact a cell tower. Cell towers have limited ranges, and therefore you need many of them. Then the cell towers need to connect to the internet (likely through several intermediaries). In short, it takes a lot of money to get all the pieces into their places. Even after all of that...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technological Limits. There is no technology currently powerful enough to be able to quickly and efficiently handle all data requests within the U.S. or comparable countries/areas. Investments here are costly and risky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return on Investment. If you spent a lot of money on all of the above, you'd like to see a handsome return. To do this, you have two options: 1. Make the bandwidth unlimited (which would strain your systems) or 2. Divide up the &quot;data plans&quot; with caps. If you go with option one, you will necessarily need to increase your prices. If you increase your prices, however, less people will be willing and able to afford the service. Additionally, you'd be subject to more service outages due to higher data demands, which would lead customers away from you. If you divide it up with caps, you can reach more segments (i.e. poorer people can still buy your data if it's capped at 1GB, for example), your network strain is reduced, and you can reach a more steady equilibrium that turns a profit. </p>
</li>
<li>Regulation. Radio waves are regulated, and you're only allowed to use certain frequencies. Frequencies can't just be stuffed to the brim, or you'll run into interference and other issues. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>To make you pay way more for way less.</strong></p>
<p>Data caps are restrictions on the total amount of data transferred, usually confined within the billing period. There exists no technical justification for them. They are 100% arbitrary.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Muh spectrum though?</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Spectrum is limited, both on cable and mobile networks, more on the latter. This means the total effective bandwidth on any network is limited, and as a result, the bandwidth for users. Quite logical. </p>
<p>A common myth is that this would justify data caps. It does not. Spectrum doesn't limit the total amount of data you can download. Only the <em>rate</em> or speed at which you can download. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Muh congestion though?</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Another common myth is the one about congestion. People try to justify data caps because otherwise, due to overselling (the ISP selling more bandwidth than they can offer since not everyone uses the network 24/7), congestion would occur because too many people would download too much at once. </p>
<p>However, congestion means saturating the network bandwidth, so that by itself is more a spectrum issue than a data issue - data caps do not prevent congestion at all. It's still possible for people to log on at the same time and overload the network. Data caps instead serve to prohibit users from connecting to the internet. </p>
<p>Congestion is also already solved by dynamic bandwidth adjustment, which is a fancy way of saying the ISP temporarily (on the scale of seconds to minutes) reduces the bandwidth for some users to prevent congestion. So, it doesn't occur anymore - the worst thing that could happen is a temporary slower internet. You don't notice this with normal usage.</p>
<p>Data caps, on the other hand, prevent usage of internet altogether. I mean, this is not a difficult comparison: 'Slow' Internet versus no Internet. Easy choice right?</p>
<p>Someone will inevitably argue against this, then I'll present a simple calculation to destroy them. The fact is that you're able to get far, far more data (hundreds of times more data) without data caps with congestion, than with data caps without congestion. And as for the latter - even on capped connections, congestion still occurs. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>M-muh money?</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Well yeah, that's the point. The ISP wants more money. That's why they do it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>But they have to earn back the costs for maintenance and such!</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes... so? Doesn't justify data caps. It would justify either increasing the price of connections - which is already high enough anyway, it's a total lie that they don't have enough money - or to reduce bandwidth. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>If everyone has unlimited data, something something Netflix something something congestion!</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>See the big rant about congestion above. And if the network couldn't ultimately handle an increase in, say, streaming - the solution is not to make users pay more or to make them less able to use the Internet. The solution is to improve the network to enable users to stream that much. </p>
<p>Shitty analogy time: If there are congestions on highways, does that justify forbidding people from driving 6 days per week? (Fun fact: 1/7th is still way more than you'll get with data caps, so it's not an extreme example. It's a mild one.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>[Insert argument in favor of data caps]</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>[Insert rebuttal of argument that is probably not justifying data caps at all.]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good points talking about how it's due to infrastructure and the cost of maintaining their systems and how they have to pay for the spectrum and all that, and while ideally that would be the cause of data limits it's not. ISPs make an insane amount of profit, and a few years ago the government gave the largest ones money to improve their infrastructure (which they didn't do a very satisfactory job of).</p>
<p>So if that isn't the cause then what is? Money. They want to make more money. If they set limits they can charge more for larger plans and charge overage fees. At least in the US it all comes down to making more money by screwing the customer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
