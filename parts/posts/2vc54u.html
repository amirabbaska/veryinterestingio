He never spouts the usual hoax stuff about shadows and waving flags, but rather he is convinced we didn't possess powerful enough computing technology in 1969 to a) land on the moon,  b) launch back off of the moon and re-dock with the lunar orbiter, or c) land safely back on Earth.  One of his favorite arguments is, &quot;Have you been to Florida to see those pieces of junk? No way we got anywhere <em>near</em> the moon with that.&quot;</p>
<p>Problem is, I can't find a lot of specific de-bunking arguments discussing the computational power of the machines involved. How can I, in polite enough terms that I won't lose my job, and citing specifics, explain to him he's wrong?</p></div></div>
