But as you drive closer and closer, your body starts to really ramp up, DRAMATICALLY, the amount you need to use the bathroom? Sometimes barely making it home, when just minutes before you were managing the situation fairly well. Why is that? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's entirely neurological. It's like Pavlov's experiment with dogs. </p>
<p>Our brains don't make every sensation conscious. If it did, we would be overwhelmed by sensory input. </p>
<p>As our bladder becomes more full, the stretch activates our brain to want to pee.</p>
<p>Our brain has adapted over time to activate that response based on our memory to choose the best time to bring it to our consciousness.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the answer is that our brain makes a lot of decisions that don't make it to our consciousness. </p>
<p>Breathing is a good example. You don't typically decide to breathe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
