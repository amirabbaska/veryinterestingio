		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The light (i.e., the electromagnetic wave) <em>is</em> the E- and B-fields. So the answer to your question is trivially &quot;no&quot;; something cannot travel faster than itself.</p>
<p>But perhaps you mean to ask whether a source of light can travel faster than the speed of that light <em>in that medium</em>. So, for instance, can an underwater light source travel faster than <em>the speed of light in water</em>. Yes. That's perfectly fine. That particular question is commonly asked and a common example of this phenomenon (called <em>Cherenkov radiation</em>) is seen in the typical blue-ish glow of underwater nuclear reactors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electromagnetic wave, like any other wave, has a phase velocity and a group velocity. Of course, EM waves only act on large (Classical) objects according their group velocity, which corresponds to a photon's velocity expectation value. While the group velocity of an EM wave has to propagate at the speed of light, the phase velocity is free to exceed that value. For example, X-rays dispersing through certain materials can indicate superluminal phase velocities, but the group velocity never exceeds the speed of light. This is called anomalous dispersion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
