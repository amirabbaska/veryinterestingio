		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally the cost of these placements is grossly inflated anyway. When I've placed an ad that doesn't run it gets interrupted / cut off, I've usually received compensation in terms of additional media placements, added value and perhaps credits towards my next campaign. Something like super bowl is different though because it's a one-off annual event and not like you can run it again next week in the same spot so I'd guess they have a ton of precautions in place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the exact agreement between the company and the tv station, if the tv station broke the contract then the company can sue the tv station and ask for its money back, if they can't find any other agreement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Sometimes this is attributed to local networks running their own commercials over the national commercials and the timing is slightly off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A company I used to work for once bought ad space on a popular morning TV program for a one off ad. The host of the show actually mocked the product which was being advertised. She even said &quot;Wow! What a great product!!!&quot; in an extremely sarcastic tone. I thought that it was pretty funny but the company directors obviously didn't. I wonder what actions they ended up taking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
