		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allergies and illness are two entirely separate things and the reason is different in each case. </p>
<p>The congestion in your nose/lungs during an illness is merely a side of effect of your immune system attempting to rid your body of the virus/bacteria as quickly as possible. Immune cells are flooding the area to &quot;attack&quot; the &quot;enemy&quot; and the extra mucous is a way of expelling the debris from the fight. This is the immune system functioning correctly. </p>
<p>Allergies, on the other hand, are a malfunction of the immune system. In this case, they've misidentified a substance as being dangerous, when it actually isn't. The severity of the reaction depends on how much your immune system overreacts. In the case of a sniffly nose, your body thinks the substance is a minor threat and attempts to keep it out/expel it with a little extra mucous. In the case of a severe allergy, resulting in asphyxiation, the body is WAY, WAY overreacting. It's basically decided that you've just eaten/breathed horrible poison which could kill you in minutes. The swelling/closure of airways is a last resort, desperate measure to keep as much of that stuff out as possible. If you can't breath, you can't breath in or eat any more &quot;poison.&quot; Yes, within a short time, you could die from lack of air, but if the substance was truly as dangerous as your body thinks, keeping the poison out until you can get away from it could also save your life. Imagine two people in a room full of very toxic gas. The person whose immune system mostly closes up their airways will breath in a lot less poison and live longer than the person whose immune system does nothing and lets them breathe normally. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>increased mucus production is the body's way of attempting to expel the allergen/virus/bacteria by washing it into the stomach or out the nose/mouth, the latter contributing to the spread of infections</p>
<p>like a too-high fever, this is prioritizing removal of the invader over <em>everything</em> else, though you are actually unlikely to asphyxiate on mucus, since you dont produce enough. uncomfortable and annoying, yes, major problem, not so much.</p>
<p>sometimes nasal congestion is from sinus infections, where the infection plugs up the sinuses, which creates the pressure/pain you feel behind and around your eyes and nose. </p>
<p>infections IN the lungs can prevent that mucus from leaving, and draw off fluid from the blood or the surroundings, which can lead to fatal breathing problems (see tuberculosis)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physician here. There is a tremendous amount of misinformation in this thread.</p>
<p>Allergies represent an incorrect response by the body, identifying a harmless substance as harmful. So harmful that it is deadly, and activating a rapid and potent immune response.</p>
<p>This immune response is not particularly well-coordinated, and numerous &quot;inflammatory mediators&quot; are released. These inflammatory mediators have various effects, and one of the most significant is vasodilation (increasing the diameter of your blood vessels). Increasing the diameter of these vessels in areas of the body where there is not much space for the vessels <em>to increase into, like the airway</em>, causes airway constriction, asphyxiation, and without treatment, death.</p>
<p>What is the only treatment for anaphylactic shock known to reduce mortality? <strong>Epinephrine, also called Adrenaline</strong>.</p>
<p>How does it work? By causing vasoconstriction (decreasing the diameter of blood vessels) thereby preventing airway constriction. There are of course other important effects, such as helping to maintain blood pressure, but the first thing that will kill a patient with a severe allergic reaction is the compromised airway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick point: sometimes our reaction is for the benefit of the v√≠rus, not our own. Virus evolve too, and those which cause us to spread it efficiently (sneezing, dhiarrea, mucus) would prevail -- even if they kill us (the host) in the process. The virus may be triggering an over reaction, taking a healthy process beyond its healthy level, for its own reproductive success. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
