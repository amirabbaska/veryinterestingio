		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there's a couple of different reasons why we perceive cold water quenches our thirst more, but the honest answer is it's a trick and it doesn't.</p>
<p>To start the cold temperature softens sharp flavors because it dulls our taste buds a little bit.  Sweets become a little less sweet when cold, and tart flavors do the same.  Because of this the flavor isn't as overpowering (compare room temp soda to soda on ice) and it seems more refreshing.</p>
<p>Next the act of drinking is actually a pretty big part of the reason too.  If you had IV fluid, and I drank the same amount of water, I would feel more refreshed because I actually drank the water.  My tongue, mouth, and throat all sent a message to my brain saying &quot;oh snap that was nice&quot;.  Combine this with the fact that cold fluids are more palatable like I mentioned above, and your brain will get more of those signals.</p>
<p>The last part is also the reason why room temperature liquid is the way to go though.  When you drink cold liquid, especially that's been chilled with ice, your body really notices the drastic temperature change, and sends the full/refreshed signal faster. </p>
<p>The thing is though, your body has to warm that liquid to help it digest and break down and that takes calories or energy.  This is why room temperature water will actually allow you to drink more, and require less work to digest.</p>
<p>Tl:dr- Your body tricks you into thinking it is, but it's really all in your head...</p>
<p>Edit:. Everyone is focusing in on the fact I said cold water is heated in the body.  But you're focusing on the wrong paragraph.  Cold water fills you faster because your body reacts to the temperature difference.  The heating is unimportant except for the fact that room temp water is more efficient to drink as you can drink more.</p>
<p>Look at it this way- If you were dehydrated with the flu and the doctor tells you to drink a lot of water, you are better off drinking room temp water over cold water.  The reason is simply because you can drink more of the room temperature water before your body says &quot;ok that's enough&quot;.  It has nothing to do with the 8 calories needed to bring the water upto body temp. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For all the people arguing that warm quenches thirst better, I will take a guess that OP means on a hot day, cold water feels better. And the reason for that is simply because the coldness of the water brings down your body temperature faster and relieves you faster after physical exertion and heat production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, lots of answers but one solution I haven't seen yet is that fresh, running water tends to be colder than warm water. The colder the water, the less likely parasites are in it, so we simply evolved to enjoy drinking colder water as a survival mechanism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
