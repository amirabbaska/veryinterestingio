<p>I'm no astronomy expert at all, therefore sorry if I say something too stupid here. :)</p>
<p>As far as I know the elements are formed in the universe by fusion (up to iron) and other super events (like supernovas) for elements above iron. </p>
<p>My doubt is, if atoms of an element (gold for example) are formed randomly in the universe, how come here on Earth they are always together in chunks (nuggets) and always in some specific locations (where they concentrate the mining)?</p>
<p>I've learned that Star formations produce a gaseous proto-planetary disk around the young star. All this &quot;dust&quot; collide and stick together throughout the years, gradually growing to form planets. </p>
<p>So, if this is the case, how come atoms from the same element come together? Do they attract each other? Is it due to they similar weight?</p>
<p>Thank you all!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geologist here.  The problem of ore formation is very well studied by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore_genesis" target="_blank">people who want to mine the ore</a>.  :-)</p>
<p>At its most abstract, the answer is that the Earth (and any planet) has a lot of natural processes, chemical and physical, that move stuff around or change what form it's in (how the atoms are bonded to each other to make compounds like rocks, gold nuggets, and us).  When these processes tend to concentrate a particular type of thing in one place, and continue for long enough to build up a lot of that thing, then you get large concentrations. When those concentrations are worth mining, we call them &quot;ore&quot;.</p>
<p>Concrete example: the ocean is full of salt.  The salinity of the whole ocean is fairly uniform, so the salt is spread out over the whole planet.  If an area of a continent becomes covered with ocean, then cut off from it again, you end up with a large inland sea which is salty but has no connection to the ocean, like the Caspian Sea or Aral Sea.    If this is in a dry area, the water it will start to evaporate until eventually the whole sea is gone; this is what is currently happening in the Great Salt Lake and Dead Sea.  The salt can't evaporate, so you end up with a salt flat.</p>
<p>Presto, you've just gone from &quot;salt spread out all over the world&quot; to &quot;a big pile of salt concentrated in one place where there normally isn't any.&quot;</p>
<p>To elaborate on this example: Ocean water has several different minerals dissolved in it, so let's look at two of them, halite (table salt) and gypsum (used in plaster and drywall).  Both are soluble in water, but halite is far more soluble than gypsum.  So if you start with a sea full of water with a bit of gypsum and halite in it, then remove the water by evaporating it, you concentrate the salts in the remaining water until they start precipitating out.  Since gypsum is less soluble, it precipitates before the halite does, so on the bottom of the lake you get a layer of fairly pure gypsum, then as the rest of the water evaporates, you get a layer of fairly pure halite on top of the first layer.  You've gone from &quot;halite and gypsum dissolved and mixed up together&quot; to &quot;separate layers of halite and gypsum&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanogenic_massive_sulfide_ore_deposit" target="_blank">Certain types of metal deposits</a> can form by similar principles, a change in the environment making different things soluble at different times.  Others form in different ways.  All of them have in common that some process is moving stuff from one environment and tending to concentrate it in a different one.</p>
<p>Even the structure of planets are governed by this sort of thing: When Earth first formed, it was molten (or at least more molten than it is now, which is not very much) and so all the heavy elements like iron and gold tended to sink to the center of the Earth and form the core.  But there are some heavy elements, like lead and uranium, that are way more common on the surface of the earth than you would expect from just sorting by density.  Turns out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldschmidt_classification" target="_blank">these elements really prefer making chemical bonds with all the light stuff that floats to the top</a> like oxygen and silicon (the stuff that rocks are made of) instead of the iron and nickel and the other heavy stuff sinking to the core.  If you dump a blob of molten lead and a blob of molten iron in a crucible together, eventually they'll unmix like oil and water.</p>
<p>This principle is used in making steel as well; if you have a crucible of molten impure iron, you can purify it by dumping in a mixture of materials called &quot;flux&quot; which, among other things, tends to form chemical bonds with the impurities in the iron.  Flux materials tend to be light, so after bonding to impurities the resulting mixture is still lighter than iron, so it floats to the top of the molten iron and gets skimmed off, leaving pure iron behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer from a recalcitrant geologist currently mascarding as an Engineer. </p>
<p>Gold is a very unreactive and relatively heavy metal that means by default it tends to sit there and is actually in really low concentrations in a lot of rocks and sediments. Those are the important points and it's easiest to think of it concentrating like distilation on a really long time scale. Predominantly in nature because it tends not to react it stays in a relatively pure form, this means it tends not to disperse in a lot of different ores that form from different mechanisms and can be mobilised in different ways. With gold you essentially find it in high concentrations only where specific processes have worked in concert to cram a lot of it into one place from a larger mass of low concentration gold bearing rock(typically batholiths of things like granite). </p>
<p>Now I'm not go into the in depth process and reason why concentrations of something's are different throughout the whole earth. That's a huge answer, and I don't think that's quite the answer you are looking for. But generally for highest concentrations it happens from two methods that often are, but not always in concert. First the concentration of many metals varies throughout the planet, but is more abundant in deeper layers, which is why minerals and igneous geology go together. When these deep rocks come up for a visit you get things like intrusions of magma that produce on interaction with ground water  a lot of high energy fluid that is capable of mobilising otherwise pretty immobile metals. This tends to have a concentrating effect on certain metals that may either be in higher concentration in the magma or just in the bedrock. That water will exploit or create fractures where the high temperature fluids will start picking up and depositing veins of metal rich ore and in the case of gold usually bands of quartzite with a lot of gold and other heavy metals. This leads to the type of gold hard rock miners go after, and gold miners will also call source rock or geothermal gold. This is expensive to mine as while a vein is massively gold rich per tonne you will have to dig out some of the hardest rock on the planet to get to it and use very expensive and environmentally risky processes to separate it.</p>
<p>Following on from that you have placer deposits. These are derived from erosion and deposition and water does the first step of pulling the gold out along with any other unreactive objects like precious stones. As gold bearing rocks are eroded the gold will be carried away and the hydraulic action will seperate it from anything its bound up in. As its unreactive it will stay in its pure form generally in whatever size chunl it formed in or smaller. Because it's heavy it will tend to drop out of the water column well before other things so you find it most commonly in rivers, basins and estuaries. </p>
<p>Combining the two, erosion in areas with lots of areas of high concentration ie veins full of chunky gold makes it easy to find in rivers as bigger particles of gold settle out quick whereas super fine gold may actually dissapear out to sea. In these rivers you find gold in high concentrations and can mine it, you largely use wash plants to do that which work the same way as the river did, just massively more efficient. That being said you are talking relatively about concentration, even in good pay you are talking sometimes grams per yard of soil so for a as little as a few hundred ounces you might have to dig a pit a couple of football fields wide and 10+m deep depending on how long ago the gold was laid down in the river. It's a bulk business and very energy intensive and generally the efficiency of your equipment determines what you can mine and where. A good bit of gold now is actually produced from waste material from early less efficient extraction processes that back then weren't worth the cost to go back for. You also get ocean dredging, these guys do inshore waters and are chasing often the super fine gold making it out close to the sea and occasionally stumbling on rich areas where currents have concentrated it or the change in water levels let's them get to areas that were previously more upstream.</p>
<p>Slightly longer answer than I intended as a late night distraction on the phone and a few geological generalisations.  But it shows the jist, TLDR water + igneous rocks = concentrated gold. For more info a good high school or undergrad textbook will cover it in detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to hear more anout this myself. My understanding of gold vein formation is that they solidify when the hot solution of water carrying them through cracks in the earth's surface experiences rapid depressurization, which vaporizes the water. It follows that any minerals would fall out of the solution at that point. I don't understand the process that would concentrate the gold in these particular solutions to begin with, though. I imagine they more or less form solids because &quot;like dissolves like&quot; and metal bonding forces between valence electrons. But that last part is speculation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
