		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster" target="_blank">Business cluster</a>.
See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster#The_Silicon_Valley_case" target="_blank">Silicon Valley case</a> for example. Hollywood would be another example.
Lots of businesses within the same industry settle in a geographic concentration. This makes it attractive for startups or venture capitalists to locate themselves there as well.</p>
<p>With much companies on a relatively dense area, it's attractive for people who are searching jobs in this specific field to move there. </p>
<p>These clusters are often connected with universities, service providers, etc. specified on the given industry, which makes business relationships and stuff like that incredibly easier due to regional proximity and some kind of symbiosis between them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here that describe a &quot;business cluster&quot; are correct.  Once a type of business gets started in one place, it can be self-perpetuating as the people, infrastructure, and other factors (e.g., venture capital) move or are created there.  If you're Mark Zuckerberg and you're starting (or expanding) Facebook, it's a no-brainer to do it in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>For Silicon Valley, it comes down to, in large part, the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley" target="_blank">William Shockley</a> grew up in Palo Alto.  When he left Bell Labs to found Shockley Semiconductor, he did it in Mountain View to be close to his ailing mother.  Shockley Semiconductor spawned Fairchild Semiconductor, which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/26/the-first-trillion-dollar-startup/" target="_blank">spawned Intel and many others</a>...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm in Chicago, and I'm in r+d.  I recieved job offers for more money in small towns, and did not accept them.  In a small town if you decide you don't like your job/employer in a specialized area, you have basically sell a house, potentially end a relationship, etc and move somewhere else.  In a tech center, you just get a different job and maybe commute an extra few minutes.  </p>
<p>It's not just Cali though, raleigh(sic?) And Austin have huge tech industries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A similar thing happens in Formula 1 racing. Most of the teams are based in the south-east of England (Ferrari are the notable exception, but then they are Ferrari). It means that all of the talent is based in the same place and it's easier to find the people you want. Employees don't have to up sticks and move when they go for a new job.</p>
<p>The Toyota teams lack of success was put down, in part, to the fact that they were based in Cologne when all the best engineers were based in England. They also hired the wrong Schumacher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've thought about this for quite some time, since I'm in tech as well. Here's my rough analysis:</p>
<p>-The Gold Rush in Northern California/Bay Area in 1848 created a culture of opportunity (and entrepreneurship in some respects). This is important as this separates why you have Silicon Valley in Cali vs anywhere else (i.e. near MIT/Harvard, etc.).</p>
<p>-Two pivotal education systems were established in the surrounding area: UC Berkeley (1868) and Stanford (1885).</p>
<p>-Two Stanford alums set up Hewlett Packard, an electronics hardware startup and the first real tech company, in 1939 near Stanford. This spawned what's now called 'Silicon Valley'.</p>
<p>-In the Silicon Valley area, academia and research for computing blew up in 1950s-1970s. Commercial applications and hardware for computing blew up in the 1970s-1990s. Venture capital for computing blew up in the 1980s-1990s. Thus an ecosystem was created and fostered. Stanford and Cal were the breeding grounds for much this innovation.</p>
<p>-It's only natural that software go with hardware, thus software hit stride in the 1990s. These software companies wanted to be close to the money (venture capitalists) and talent (engineers), so they set up shop all around Palo Alto/Stanford.</p>
<p>-Traditional hardware companies resided in Sunnyvale/San Jose area (south Bay Area). Skewed older demographic. Suburbia. Families.</p>
<p>-In the 2000s-2010s software companies flourished (read Marc Andreessen's WSJ guest post on &quot;Why Software is Eating the World&quot;). Employees of software companies skewed younger.</p>
<p>-More tech companies — software and otherwise — started setting up shop in San Francisco. Why? 1.) younger demographic (i.e. engineering talent) prefers San Francisco's urban environment over Palo Alto/South Bays suburban environment, especially from a lifestyle POV, 2.) to be equidistant between Stanford and UC Berkeley (UCB held 2nd place vs Stanford when it come to innovation), 3.) San Francisco's mayor gave tax breaks to big companies (Twitter, Zynga, etc.) to be in San Francisco, 4.) huge tech company called Palantir took up and monopolized all the available real estate (not kidding) in Palo Alto/Stanford area, thus driving tech companies and venture capitalists to move to San Francisco, 5.) if building a consumer focused app or tech startup, you want to be where the action is, a densely populated area like San Francisco, 6.) serendipity (in the context of hiring talent, raising money, etc.) tends to happen in a more densely populated area like San Francisco.</p>
<p>That's my $0.02.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
