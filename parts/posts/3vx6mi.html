		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how close they are too. </p>
<p>Wounds close mechanically as well as having regrowth. If you take a little biopsy from your skin, first off you have a scab, and you also have stem cells in reservoirs of stem cells around the wound that start to proliferate and these daughter cells migrate towards the centre of the wound where they meet, stop migrating and start to thicken up. <a href="http://e.xposu.re/wp-content/gallery/microscopy/dynamic/SUM_dark-bi3-1.jpg-nggid03264-ngg0dyn-480x960x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a picture where the green is skin (Keratin5) and red are stem cells, and the wound is to the right, so the skin you can see already starting to point to the wound centre. This wound is 4 days old. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomas-/17220613278/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a wound that is totally healed. The scab is the big weird thing on top. </p>
<p>However, at the same time fibroblasts orientate towards the wound centre and start to muscularly contract the wound closed. A 1.5mm wound is basically invisible once the wound contraction is finished, a 3mm wound is less than half that size after a few days. </p>
<p>And so several small wounds in a close location would not optimally contract and might heal slower. </p>
<p><strong>additionally</strong></p>
<p>Wounds need blood flow, and that can be effected with multiple wounds. If you have wounds that are local, and interfere with blood flow, they can become chronic wounds. Wounds that affect skin in a complete circle around the arm or leg can be like that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>not necessarily. If one had three paper cuts of small size on different parts of their body they'd all heal at the same rate.<br />
When learning about tissue healing, we are generally taught that there are three phases: Inflammatory response, Proliferation, Maturation/remodeling.
In the inflammatory response phase, your immune system activates to fight off infection, when the wound is sufficiently &quot;sterilized&quot; the Proliferation phase begins. In this, the granulocytes start collecting near the wound area and new tissue is laid down in a messy &quot;spaghetti-like&quot; structure.
In the maturation remodeling phase, the tissue is stretched and aligned along the lines of pull of the tissue and the tissue normalizes.
That's a brief overview.
The type of damage also plays a role. Incisions (straight edged cuts in skin) heal faster than lacerations (jagged edged cuts in skin, like tears). also the deeper the cut is, the longer it takes to heal cause tissues heal from deep to superficial layers. thats it in a sort of nutshell. If you have more questions feel free to ask!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that a lot of people are skipping over is where the wounds are located. Different areas of the body, including the skin, receive different amounts of blood flow and the cells have varying levels of proliferation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Similar question: What determines differences in healing rates person to person.</p>
<p>ex: my body takes the same time to heal a small papercut <em>cringe</em> as it does for my friends body to heal a large cut.</p>
<p>Why is this? is it nutrient flow, or more efficient inflammation processes?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
