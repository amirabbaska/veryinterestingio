		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After years of dealing with an illness, I can say that it's the buildup of gases in the stomach that aren't being pushed down by more food. Chewing gum and burping is a quick fix. If you haven't eaten in a whole day or two, your blood sugar really levels out and you don't feel the urge to constantly consume at regular intervals anymore. During this period, the blood sugar is pretty low, and you start to feel dizzy and confused on top of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your stomach is always producing low levels of digestive juices. If there’s nothing for them to work on due to not eating, the juices build up, and can start to work on he insides of your stomach instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
