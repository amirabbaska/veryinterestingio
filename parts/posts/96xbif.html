		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.  If the bowl is submerged, then as much water as can drain through it is already <em>going</em> to do so, because that's how the flush works: it raises the water level in the bowl above the upper half of the U-bend, and so the water syphons away.  Submerging the bowl does the same thing; running the flush just adds more water that it needs to get rid of, unless the sewers are also completely flooded, in which case the toilet simply won't flush at all, and you've just dumped more water into the room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A toilet flush lets water from a tank into your toilet bowl. Once the water is in the toilet bowl, it flushes because of gravity pushing down on the water in the bowl - there is no sucking / vacuuming caused by the handle push. Once the water level is higher than the bend in the toilet, there is enough pressure from the water to push past that bend. It empties completely due to siphoning once the flush starts, which is when the empty space left by the water getting sucked down is filled by more water from the bowl.</p>
<p>So if your toilet bowl is below the flood line, and there is empty space for it to drain into, it will drain whether you push down the flush handle or not. If it's not draining, it's because it's full on the other side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is drainage and runoff pipes in a lot of cities that redirect rain water and sewage to wherever it goes. When you get rain that is too heavy, these pipes cant move the water fast enough and it can back up to the point where water collects on the surface. Flushing the toilet would send water into these backed up pipes, where it would have nowhere to go but back to the surface. Nope, it isn't going to help. If these sewage systems are totally seperate from the runoff systems, then it might help a little, but the amount of water you would be moving would be nothing compared to the ampunt ofnwater needed to submerge your entire toilet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
