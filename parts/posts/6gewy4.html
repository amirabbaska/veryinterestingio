		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rain clouds are supersaturated, meaning they contain more water than the air can actually hold. The &quot;extra&quot; water falls to the ground as rain. This means there's more water which absorbs more light in a rain cloud than a normal cloud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rain clouds tend to be more densely packed with water, as well as bigger, so less light from the sun can get through. Less light means a darker gray. If you're ever in a plane flying over a rain cloud, they look just like any other cloud at that point because you have the same amount of light on your side (above them). </p>
<p>They just keep that light from going through to be seen by people below. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
