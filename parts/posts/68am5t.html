		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When something burns hotly, it burns cleanly. When you take away the flame, it has enough embers and residual heat to continue smoldering, but without the heat of the flame the result is incomplete combustion resulting in smoke and soot. </p>
<p>Details: </p>
<p>What is smoke? It's soot, and carbon compounds, tar, aerosols, un burned fuel, and other components of incomplete combustion. When a fire burns brightly and hotly, it efficiently combines oxygen with carbon to make carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, and with hydrogen to make water vapor. </p>
<p>If all of the hydrocarbons and organic material being burned are done so cleanly, then there is very little smoke and instead an almost pure reaction resulting in carbon dioxide and  water which are odorless and transparent gases. IE not smoke. </p>
<p>When a flame is extinguished but there is still a lot of latent heat, the process of burning is snuffed out resulting in incomplete transformation into the water and carbon dioxide, leading to incomplete compounds which create the soot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smoke is fine particulate matter suspended in a gaseous stream. Air currents can stir up these fine particles just as easily as outgassing from a fire. Every drop of water stirs it up.</p>
<p>Fire requires 3 pieces to exist: heat, oxygen, &amp; fuel. Water reduces the heat of the fire. Halogen removes the oxygen. The fire may be reduced in its ability to reignite but the fine particles of ash already produced can still become airborne, hence smoke long after the fire is out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know that this expands to other fires, but candles seem to only produce smoke when they've just been put out because that &quot;smoke&quot; is actually evaporating wax that is most of the fuel. There are videos of someone blowing out a candle then holding a lit match in the &quot;smoke&quot; above the candle to relight it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A candle is a good example of why this happens. </p>
<p>The liquid fuel gets drawn up into the wick, gets hot, vaporizes, and if there is fire, it burns, turning most of the fuel into invisible gas.</p>
<p>The wick is really hot though, so if you blow out the fire, it still makes the liquid fuel evaporate, but it doesn't burn, it just cools off in air and forms smoke particles.</p>
<p>The same thing happens for other things that burn. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking like putting water on it to put it out,  it's a lot of steam from the water. Otherwise a fire is a chemical reaction. The heat breaks it down into other chemicals. Always H2O and CO2, and then whatever else the material is made out of. Which is why when you use a lighter or BBQ you don't get a lot, if any smoke. The fuel is made of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. If it has, say zinc, that isn't a part of CO2 or H2O, so you are seeing the zinc. But also in early and late stages, the fire is not enough to keep up the full reaction, so that smoke is actually the tree it self. Very fine particles, the sap being turned to gas, etc. Firm that reason the smoke is very dangerous. Not only is it flammable, but since it's all spread out it has a higher surface area, and is even more so flamable. Almost to the point if explosion. You can see this in flower mill, or sawdust catching fire. Or the mythbusters episode when they blew up coffee creamer. Or in the case of a fire/smoke a flash over or back draft. Watch a video on YouTube of that and you can see the smoke itself is burning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
