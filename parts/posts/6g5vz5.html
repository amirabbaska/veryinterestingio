		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying can be both an evolutionary advantage and disadvantage. If babies can signal to their parents that they need attention, that is good. </p>
<p>But if crying inadvertently attracts predators or warns off prey, that is bad. So whether babies crying is, on the whole, an advantage, depends a lot on the particular niche a species occupies in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Humans are kind of outliers in that human babies are just spectacularly helpless compared to the young of other species. However, humans are also apex predators, and are pretty smart and could figure out how to leave the babies at home during the hunt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying babies while great for communicating when they are otherwise encapable, attract predators. However humans are pack hunting apex predators who reside in groups. It's simply too risky for an animal to attempt to enter a human village to snatch a baby unless it's really desperate, because the likelihood of said animal being speared/stoned/burned/bludgeoned/beaten to death either on the spot, or a few days later is too high. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Strictly scientifically speaking, birth is a stressful process for infants so babies cry when they are born. It's a good thing they cry because cortisol, a stress hormone, that is released promotes lung maturation in infants. </p>
<p>Later on, after birth, crying is probably a multi-factorial phenomenon. Mese_cam covers the evolutionary aspect well. As far as survival goes, crying is supposed to &quot;bring out&quot; the nurturing character in a mother so that the mom or if the mom is no longer around, someone else will care for the infant. Similar to why puppies smell so good! They make you want to cuddle and care for them to promote their survival. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some other animal babies vocalize quite often; for example, young birds beg for food and call if they are in distress. </p>
<p>Perhaps crying alerts the parents that the baby is in need, urging them to take care of the baby. </p>
<p>This may or may not be involved in psychology. Crying stresses out or annoys the parents, so they give the baby what it wants. Once the baby gets what it needs, the parents are rewarded with quiet, which encourages them to take better care of their child. This is an example of negative reinforcement, in which someone becomes more likely to repeat a behavior (caring for child) because performing that behavior reduces something negative (crying).</p>
<p>As others have said, humans are high in the food chain, so the benefits associated with crying (good parental care) outweigh potential drawbacks (attracting predators).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
