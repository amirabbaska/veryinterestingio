		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Bell 230 and the 212 are mediums that have two blades.</p>
<p>Both those were replaced by 4-bladed versions (the 430 and the 412).</p>
<p>There are many factors that determine the number of blades. But in general, the trend you see in looking at the results of many development programs is this: smaller, cheaper, and slower helicopters have the fewest blades. Bigger, faster, and more expensive ones have more blades.</p>
<p>Notice that the 412 (4 blades) has a max speed about 20 kt faster than the 212 (2 blades).</p>
<p>In general you can say the following:</p>
<p>For hover, low disk loading is most efficient. That means longer blades and therefore fewer blades.</p>
<p>But for speed, more blades are better. The blades turn slower and the tip speed is slower, allowing higher airspeed before the advancing blade tips approach supersonic.</p>
<p>This is illustrated by the 212/412 helicopters.</p>
<p>-The 212 has two blades with a diameter of 48 feet and max weight of 11,200 lb. 100% rotor revs are 324 rpm.</p>
<p>-The 412 has 4 blades with diameter 46 feet and max weight of 11,900 lb. 100% rotor speed is also 324 rpm.</p>
<p>Disk loading
212 = 6.19 lb/ft^2
412 = 7.16 lb/ft^2</p>
<p>Tip Speed
212 = 813 ft/s
412 = 779 ft/s</p>
<p>Vmax
212 = 120 kts
412 = 140 kts</p>
<p>So the 212 has lower disk loading, it should perform better in hover (I don't have data on that). The 412 has lower tip speed and higher airspeed.</p>
<p>Edit: re-wrote it with some numbers to illustrate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sound. Listen to the Bell 204/Bell 205 (the classic Vietnam helicopter). It has two blades, and it makes a very heavy, booming &quot;chop-chop-chop&quot; sound that is very rough on the ears. More rotor blades make a more &quot;brrrrrr&quot; sound. As helicopters are often used in urban areas, sound levels are a serious concern. For example, you don't want to plop down an ambulance heli at a hospital when it's makes the windows &quot;pump&quot; with the noise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rotor diameter. More blades means shorter blades. This means that it uses less space, which is useful in many situations. Edit: This also means a shorter tail boom is possible. For example, compare the Bell 205 with the Bo105 and look at how much shorter the tail boom is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed 1. Longer blade will have higher tip velocity, and if the tip goes supersonic, bad things happen, which means that with longer blades, you need to have slower rotation, which means less efficiency. As the forward going blade is traveling at tip speed plus the forward speed, this limitation is the main limitation to the speed of the helicopter.</p>
</li>
<li>Speed 2. Longer blades will have higher tip velocity. On a helicopter, the forward going blade will always move faster than the one going backward, and the higher the tip velocity, the larger the difference. This means that you'll get more lift on the side where the blade moves forwards, and if you go too fast, this can become a problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also advantages of fewer blades.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's a simpler construction, which is important on cheap helis or if you really want to mass produce them. It also simplifies maintenance, which is important in some military situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two blades takes less space in the hangar.</p>
</li>
<li>Rotor blades are expensive. Once again, a factor on cheap helis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall trend, on anything but the smallest helis, is towards more rotor blades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, that is not true.  The first Sikorsky military helos in the US were a three blade design, while the popular civilian Bell 47 had two.</p>
<p>The lift you get is based on the total length of the blades and their velocity.  However, the more blades you have, the closer together they are, and the more they interfere.  The most efficient configuration is 2 very long blades, but it takes up more space and it more demanding on the blades.</p>
<p>Early helicopters were limited, because piston engines had poor weight to power ratios, leading to more 2 and 3 blade designs.  Once turbine engines were introduced, they produced enough power per pound that more compact designs became feasible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many modern helicopters still have 2 blades. At least in Canada.</p>
<p>Small helicopters have 4 or 3 blades, but I've never personally seen a medium helicopter with more than 2 blades.</p>

<li>more blades -&gt; less power</li>
<li>less blades -&gt;more vibration</li>
<li>less blades -&gt;more power</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this, a broadly general statement suggests that since new choppers have more powerful engines, the next thing to do is make the ride more comfortable and reduce vibration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
