		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if my understanding of this article is correct:
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/science/25qna.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/science/25qna.html</a>
(I hope nytimes is an acceptable source, even if not academic)</p>
<p>In the linked article, John D. Kubiatowicz, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley says that for a kindle with 4 Gigabyte memory, this would mean a rough increase in weight of 10^–18 grams.</p>
<p>For your situation of a 60GB phone, this would mean
(60Gb/4Gb) * (10^-18 grams) = 1.5 × 10^-17 grams.  So certainly less than what you would be able to feel.</p>
<p>While I originally thought this would be because the storage would use extra electrons, the article/Prof. Kubiatowicz say otherwise:</p>
<p>&quot;Although the total number of electrons in the memory does not change as the stored data changes,” Dr. Kubiatowicz said, the trapped ones have a higher energy than the untrapped ones. A conservative estimate of the difference would be 10^–15 joules per bit.</p>
<p>&quot;As the equation E=mc2 makes clear, this energy is equivalent to mass and will have weight.&quot;</p>
<p>It is my understanding that most/all mobile phones use flash memory for storage so the linked article about flash memory in Kindles would be applicable here.  Please let me know (or just delete this outright) if I am mistaken.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most comments here are assuming that &quot;empty&quot; space on the phone is occupied by 0 bits, and that new data will switch some to 1. In reality, there's no guarantee that those bits are 0, since most operating systems have clever bookkeeping to allow regions of memory to be marked as empty without having to overwrite that entire section with 0 bits.</p>
<p>Your meta question appears to be: does data have mass? And the answer to that question, and in my mind one of the cool things about data, is that it does not. </p>
<p>A knit quilt with intricate, colorful patterns weighs the same as a gray, featureless one. A book filled with random scribblings weighs the same as an equivalent dictionary. We're a species that evolved to match patterns; data is just patterns: human-interpretable arrangements of things. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With NAND, the opposite would be true.  Flash erases to 1 and writes 0. When you erase a NAND cell, the hardware fills the cell with that highest possible amount of voltage. Writing a page then reduces that voltage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no clear meaning for a &quot;full&quot; or &quot;empty&quot; phone from an Information Science point of view. The least weighing combination of 1s and 0s could stand for a fully filled storage, simply because that might be the exact information that you want to save. Similarly, the highest weighing combination can be interpreted as empty, as the software dealing with storage information doesn't really bother what state the physical storage is in, it just calls it unused and therefore empty. So this is somewhat about perspectives and what you call full and empty. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a comp science perspective, IF there is a difference in weight between a bit having a value of 1 and a value of 0, the answer is it depends.</p>
<p>The thing about digital storage is the data is not erased when you delete a file, it's only removed form the &quot;index&quot; so to speak. If you have a 60GB file which is just straight 1s for all of its bits, and you delete it, they don't become 0, they stay at 1 but your file system will set the memory addresses as available for new files to be written to. In the same vein you could have a 60GB file filled with straight 0s. That's why when you delete a file there are file recovery tools that can scan your drive and recover them, as long as you haven't overwritten the data with a new file, it's 1s and 0s all are there and can be read.</p>
<p>It doesn't end there, some chips use inverse logic, where a high (voltage) state means a logic 0 and low state is a logic 1. This is the case for NAND flash memories which most if not all modern smartphones use for their internal storage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
