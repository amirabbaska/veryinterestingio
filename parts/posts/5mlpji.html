<p>The &quot;Physical Estimation and Attraction Scale&quot; (PEAS) comes up with a ton of hits on scholarly archives yet I've been unable to find an actual damn copy of the scale. Where should I be looking?</p>
<p>Also, curious as to your knowledge of similar studies.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just Googled this for you and I can't find it online, but if you have access to an academic library, they could either get it through their online subscriptions, or possibly special order it for you. The PEAS was published here:</p>

activity. <em>Research Quarterly</em>, 45, 93-103. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, from what I can gather, this scale simply is a measure of the degree to which respondents rate themselves as physically fit and &quot;attracted to&quot; physical fitness activities, so it's not surprising that this would be a fairly good predictor of getting through a physically tough challenge like Navy Special Operations training.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
