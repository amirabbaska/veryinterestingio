		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are knocked out, choked out, or faint, do you effectively fall asleep or is that state of unconscious in some way different from sleep? I was pondering this as I could not fall asleep and wondered if you could induce regular sleep through oxygen deprivation or something. Not something I would seriously consider trying, but something I was curious about.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not the same. Sleep is a complex neurological state that we've only recently begun to understand where, while there is no alert consciousness, the brain is still cycling through a series of neurological activity (the chief of which, at least as far as day to day relevance goes, is memory reorginization and conversion of the day's memories and information to patterns more reliable for retrieval) as well as monitoring for extreme inputs from sensory capabilities (ie loud sounds or sudden body movements will awaken the sleeper). </p>
<p>Loss of consciousness from lack of oxygen or through the use of psychoactive substances is a different mechanism that involves actually shutting down gross neuronal activity. In the case of oxygen deprivation, you're literally starving the brain of oxygen, forcing it to shut down processes in a survival-dependent manner. Brains take a lot of energy, but someone in a hypoxic environment can still survive if there is enough oxygen to maintain cardiac and respiratory function (though how long and at what cost are definitely things to consider). </p>
<p>Your entire brain goes through neurological rhythms while asleep. If you're inducing loss of consciousness, the resources necessary for those rhythms to occur are being cut off. </p>
<p>I'm not the biggest fan of brains-as-computers analogies, but I'll make a simple one here: You can shut down a computer by yanking the cord out of the wall, or by shutting it down through the OS. It's off either way, but one of those ways can cause the computer to malfunction depending on the state it was in when the shutdown occurred, and how often that method of shutdown is employed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that when you are properly asleep, you can be woken up by external stimuli.  Different people have different tolerances for how strong of a stimulus is required, but given enough stimulus, <em>everyone</em> that is only sleeping will awaken.  This isn't true for people who have become unconscious due to trauma, anesthesia, lack of oxygen, etc.  They won't wake up just because you blast an air horn in their ear or slap them in the face.  So it must be a different state than sleep because different conditions are required for consciousness to be regained.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Furthermore, knocking someone out doesn't only mean suspending them for a few minutes. Doing so might have serious health implications, contrary to what movies want you to believe, where actors 'take a nap' after being hit in the head and never have a concussion or anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite what movies and TV would have you believe, being knocked unconscious for anything more than a few minutes is not trivial. It is usually a sign of severe injury. </p>
<p>Keeping a person unconscious for surgery without killing them is actually rather hard. Which is why anesthesiologist is a specially trained doctor just for that task. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question reminded me of the Spike Milligan story about a troop ship that ran into heavy weather one night while the soldiers were asleep in hammocks.  The seas were so rough that many were knocked unconscious.  He wondered whether they first had to be woken up so they could be unconscious, then revived, or revived first so they could be asleep, then woken up!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
