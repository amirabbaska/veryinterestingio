		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As everyone else has already pointed out the amount of electricity that solar cells the size of a car roof produce compares poorly to the amount of electricity a normal electric car consumes.</p>
<p>Having a solar cell on the roof of your electric car will only increase its range by a tiny and negligible amount and trying to recharge a parked solar car with solar cells will take very long.</p>
<p>However there are electric vehicles that can be powered by their Solar cells. They compete in race like the <a href="http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/" target="_blank">World Solar Challenge</a> and look like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fcj0Vhz.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lrUGs66.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>They are extremely light and aerodynamic and consume a lot less power than your street legal electric car are covered all over in solar panels.</p>
<p>Improving solar cells to the point where they are efficient enough to power a normal electric car seems not feasible from a technological standpoint and you can't build electric cars to consume so littler electricity either as they would be neither safe nor comfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because an electric car simply does not have the surface area to produce sufficient electricity.  </p>
<p>Take the Prius, for example, which has a solar panel option to power its fans.  That car roof-sized solar panel <a href="http://www.boronextrication.com/2011/08/13/prius-solar-panel-roof-option/" target="_blank">has an output of 60 watts</a>.  Now, a Nissan Leaf <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf" target="_blank">has a 24 kWh battery pack, and an EPA-rated range of 75 miles</a>.  This means that a Leaf would require 320 watt-hours to travel a single mile.  </p>
<p>At nominal output, a car roof-sized solar panel would therefore take 5.3 hours just to produce enough energy to take the electric car a single mile.  As you can see, that's just not enough energy output to make it worthwhile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've done this. I built a solar bed cover for my 52 Ford F-1. <a href="http://imgur.com/NzPgp4d" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/NzPgp4d</a></p>
<p>Works good, but the total power generated on such a small area is rather small. A kWh a day or two at most. </p>
<p>If your goal is to drive off the sun everyday you'll be disappointed. If your goal is to save on power bills to drive an EV you wont see much difference (unless you only drive a few miles a day, that's completely possible). </p>
<p>But if your goal is to keep a battery from becoming over-discharged from prolonged periods of inactivity, or to shelter the contents of your pickup bed from the elements, or to make a statement about the flexibility of fuel sources for an electric vehicle, or to get people thinking about solar power in general then a solar panel on a vehicle is a perfectly good idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question pops up at least once a month (isn't there a search feature? :/) Here's what I wrote last time:</p>
<p>Solar panels are expensive, so if you're going to invest in them you want to get the best bang for your buck. Simply put, you'll get a lot more bang for your buck if you install solar panels on the roof of your house (or other fixed, grid-connected location) than you would if you installed them on the roof of your car.</p>
<p>Installed on a house, panels can be optimally positioned and angled to make the most of each day's sunlight. On a car, not so much - what if you park in a garage or under a tree?</p>
<p>On a house, you can connect your panels to the grid and receive credit for electricity you generate during the day, then use that credit to charge your car at night. Each kWh of solar production might even be worth 2 or more kWh used to charge your car, since electricity is worth more during the day than it is when you charge your car overnight. On your car, your solar production could completely go to waste if, for example, your battery's already full.</p>
<p>On your house, you can minimize your $/watt by choosing from a multitude of commodity panels and other hardware and high-volume installation companies. On a car, integrating solar would require high engineering and labor costs that will translate into a much higher purchase price.</p>
<p>As an example, take the Prius solar panel that /u/disembodied_voice alluded to. That was available <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090714213950AA9P4TP" target="_blank">as a $3600 option.</a> That option included a navigation system as well as the solar system, so let's assume the solar was worth half of that, or $1800. That translates to <strong>$30/Watt!</strong> For comparison, the high-end range of home solar installations is about $5/Watt, after all labor and materials and before tax credits. So for your $1800, you could have a gimmicky 60W panel on your car that's so dinky that all it can do is power some ventilation fans and contribute nothing to driving for the 5-10 years you own it, or you could install 360W on your roof, producing about 600 on-peak kWh per year, translating to 1200 off-peak kWh to charge your car, or about 3600 miles of driving each year, for an expected 30 year lifetime, or <strong>over 100,000 solar-powered miles!</strong> </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
