		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are used to how they see themselves in the mirror. I think a lot of people, in fact, <em>dislike</em> how they look from another's person's perspective. I know I do.</p>
<p>In order to increase user comfort, and especially on apps like Snapchat and Instagram, where looks are very important, developers mirror the image so that the user sees what they would in a mirror.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: on iPhones, the live preview of your camera in selfie mode is flipped so that it behaves like a mirror and you’re better able to easily handle it (we are taught from a young age to understand what a mirror does and how it behaves). However.... as soon as you take the photo, the image saved to your phone’s memory is unflipped, because otherwise when someone else looks at the photo, they’d realize it didn’t look like you because our faces are not perfectly symmetrical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Selfie cameras flip the picture so our brains interpret the image as a <em>mirror image.</em> In a rear facing camera, the image is not flipped. However, you are facing the opposite direction as the camera, making you perceive it as a mirror image.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's so that as you're taking the picture, things move the way you expect them to. If it didn't flip the front camera, you'd have a much harder time moving the camera/yourself into the position you want. Similarly, if they did flip the rear camera, you'd have a hard time moving correctly!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
