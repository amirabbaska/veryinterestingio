		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because 0 decibels is not the same as 0 sound. Decibels are a logarithmic scale. Every time you increase the decibel value by 6, you double the sound pressure level. This means that 0 db cannot represent absolute silence. If you double 0, you still get zero. Negative infinity would be no sound at all, whereas zero is a sound that is incredibly quiet.</p>
<p>The zero point was chosen to be something quiet enough that humans cannot differentiate it from silence. But cannot actually represent zero sound, as zero because logarithms can't do that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very good answers so far. Let me attempt to add a couple of things.  </p>
<p>Let’s break out a couple of items. First it isn’t super relevant that the chamber is anechoic. But to explain all of this, anechoic means without echo. In ELI5, the walls absorb sound. This is to take better acoustic measurements. For example if you are using a microphone to measure a speaker,  to get the purest measurement of the speaker, you don’t want sound waves bouncing off the walls. Quiet and anechoic often but not always go together. </p>
<p>The rating for the room is -9dB(a). To understand this we need to understand the -9, the dB, and the (a) </p>
<p>First the dB. This is a logarithmic ratio between two values. Fun fact. The B is a Bell named after Alexander Graham Bell of the telephone fame. The d is for Deci, 1/10th</p>
<p>A missing item is dBSPL. Here the SPL is sound pressure level, this defines one of the two ratios, in this case 20 micro Pascals. So you can just say, for example 94 dBSPL and understand what the value is (you don’t need the second number from the dB ratio). </p>
<p>Now here is where we get back to the (a). humans can hear a range of frequencies, from bass (kick drum)  to treble (very shrill sounds). To talk about the total sound pressure over the range of human hearing, a specification tells us how much each bin of the frequency spectrum “counts for” towards a single number. There are several different methods, but know that the (a) is called A weighting. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-weighting#/media/File%3AAcoustic_weighting_curves_(1).svg" target="_blank">helpful Wikipedia </a> this Wikipedia image shows the most popular ratings. </p>
<p>tl;dr a long time ago folks picked some sound level as a reference point. Sound measurements are expressed in ratios via logarithm.  If something is quieter (lower) than this chosen reference level, the number is negative. Only in a perfect vacuum would there be “zero sound” as sound needs something to propitiate through. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Decibels are a logarithmic unit. This means they are defined as the logarithm of something positive (in this case the power I believe), and thus can be any value, positive or negative. -10dB corresponds to a tenth of the power of 0db.</p>
<p>It's the same reason as why we can have negative pH acids, as pH is a logarithmic unit too. (edit) actually now I think of it, pH is the <strong>negative</strong> logarithm of a quantity, but the analogy still holds as pH can be negative or positive because logarithms can be positive or negative (respectively)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about an earthquake, the ground is always moving a tiny tiny bit; so close to stable but not quite. Granted, we can't detect the usual movement, but with the machines used when the Richter scale was created, we could get so low that it was ok to set the lowest point measurable as zero. Nowadays, we can detect even lower: we can detect a -2, which is a few dozen matches going off.</p>
<p>The same applies to audio. When we created the decibel scale we couldn't distinguish any difference below 0. Now we have technology that can.</p>
<p>Sidenote: I once tried going into an anechoic chamber: I have tinnitus, it made me want to cry after mere moments. I do not like the quiet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
