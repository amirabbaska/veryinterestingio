		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egg yolks are incredible emulsifiers; they help fat-based and water-based substances form finer blends. If you took a (pasteurized) raw egg yolk and added to it your salad dressing of oil and vinegar, you'd find that the the whole thing would form a creamy suspension that would stay together for a while. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the egg white are basically water and protein, which as /u/mb34i said can do some pretty impressive tricks. The bonus is that the fat in the yolks, and the water in the whites already have an emulsifier in the yolk; the egg is a complete kit to emulsify itself and anything else. An omelette, or scrambled eggs, is just such an emulsion, cooked. On its own, the white can also be whipped up into a tight froth and used to add air and volume to something that would otherwise not be raised, such as meringue, souffle, or mousse. </p>
<p>When you add all of those things and use them in different combinations, you have the reason for eggs popularity in cuisine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eggs have proteins and other nutrients, and are somewhat neutral-tasting.  But what makes them useful is that the proteins in the egg white unfold and bind to each other when heated, congealing from liquid to a jelly-like solid.  Thus, adding egg whites to a recipe is like adding a non-toxic (and actually quite nutritious) glue that will hold together whatever the other ingredients are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not so much a direct answer to your question, more of an expansion of just how useful eggs are in the kitchen. </p>
<p>You know that funny hat chefs wear, the tall one with all those pleats in it? Traditionally in France, the hat is called a toque and it has fifty pleats one is awarded the right to wear one when having demonstrated the mastery of the use of an egg; fifty unique uses of an egg.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egg whites specifically are pretty unique in that it's largely made up of protein, but it's not all bunched up and stiff. When you heat it, the water evaporates and the proteins stiffen up. That's why you use eggs so often in baking; it's like the glue that keeps baked goods together.</p>
<p>The yolks, however, are mostly fat, so it's usually used when you are looking for more flavors or for an egg wash to make baked goods shiny.</p>
<p>And of course there are many recipes that call for eggs just for the sake of having them; many people like the taste and texture. I personally don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
