<p>If you go a few miles off shore, the smell isn't there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're smelling the salt water getting into the air. Whether by crashing up against things or through waves forming and then dissipating, the salt water gets into the air and that is the distinct smell.</p>
<p>I'd imagine other things, like the sand, contribute to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You smell all of the components that make up the sea - the salt in the water getting churned around and sprayed about, the plants and animal matter that is in the water and all the other factors that make up a smell.</p>
<p>This is no different to the way that a jungle will have a different smell again, as will a desert area and everywhere else - the different environments will favour different combinations of plants, animals, air movement and many other factors that make up different smells.</p>
<p>I guess the ocean is just a fairly obvious change, as we can rapidly go from an inland environment to the ocean and note the difference, whereas a lot of changes are gradual as the landscape changes and not as noticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
