		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mmm, very interesting question.</p>
<p>Let's take &quot;extinction level event&quot; to mean a mass extinction like the big 5. </p>
<p>The closest analogue to this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Thermal_Maximum" target="_blank">PETM</a>, the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum. This was an event about 50 million years ago that had a short term increase in global temperatures of about 5 degrees C. The best evidence suggests that it was caused by a cascade of methane, leading to global warming and sea level rise that is larger than what we are looking at today. </p>
<p>This is the best candidate for a historic arctic methane event, and if there were others we might know. So we know that it is possible, but very rare to have this kind of event. We can't tell how long it took, but we know from beginning to end the event was under 10,000 years, but that's just because it's tough to measure short time periods in the geologic record. It could have been much shorter, especially on the release end. </p>
<p>The next question is -- did the PETM cause a mass extinction? The answer is that no, it did not. The Paleocene/Eocene is associated with a faunal changeover but not a mass extinction. However, this doesn't mean that there wasn't a smaller extinction associated with the PETM! Almost all transitions between geologic periods are defined by changes in fauna of moderate size, and especially in some groups we'd expect to be hit hard by a change in ocean chemistry and temperature like benthic foraminifera. However, even these &quot;hard hit&quot; groups didn't really show mass extinction levels of turnover. Alternative is that rates of evolution were higher for many groups, so their old forms disappear from the fossil record while their descendents simply look different -- a &quot;pseudo-extinction&quot;. It seems very likely that the methane release was the cause of this worldwide shift in biota. </p>
<p>The next part of answering &quot;can there be...&quot; is to think about if the PETM is the worst possible event that could happen... if we could show it's likely that an event could be much worse, we might decide the answer to your question is &quot;very likely so&quot;. </p>
<p>The world today is different than it was in Paleocene time. First off, we have massive continental ice shelfs-- there was no continental ice shelfs then. Sudden increase in global temperature interacting with continental ice might cause cascading events that lead to a much worse event. Next, If much larger quantities of methane were locked up in the sea floor, you could potententially have a much larger temperature excursion, including one that would cause a mass extinction. I don't think anyone really knows enough about methane to say if this is plausible or likely. So, we certainly can't exclude the possibility that an arctic methane event could cause a mass extinction. However, it also doesn't seem that likely. We are, after all, talking about a single event from 50 million years ago. The conditions for a massive release clearly aren't common. </p>
<p>To summarize, methane hydrate release seems to have caused a &quot;small&quot; extinction about 50 million years ago, in a very short period of time. While that event didn't cause a truely large extinction, there are reasons to think that event wasn't as bad it could be. We can not exclude arctic methane release as a potential cause of a major extinction, if everything lined up right... but it also doesn't seem very likely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might be worth your time to look into the clathrate gun hypothesis, which is essentially a self perpetuating positive feedback loop that is the methane released from within the seabed and thawing permafrost heats up global atmospheric and sea temperatures which spurs more methane release, etc etc. The hypothesis was originally that once it really starts, it would cause radical climate change within a human lifetime--potentially triggering mass extinction. However, it's largely agreed today that's unlikely. Still an interesting thing to read up on!</p>

<p>This in turn could cause a Heinrich event (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_event" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_event</a>) and nobody really knows what that would lead to, but it is not outside of reason to assume it would lead into a extinction-like event.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't studied glaciology or anything specific to methane levels in ice, but here's some info to put a perspective on the impact of methane.</p>
<p>Methane can be interesting. So imagine all of the CO2 that we put in the atmosphere, which is a contributor of warming. Well, methane has 100x the heat trapping ability of CO2, so the amount of methane required, while still a large amount, is much smaller than what CO2 would be. Another property of methane is that it has a short lifespan. Excess Methane release into the atmosphere will cycle through in only about 10 years. So, the amount of methane needed to cause a dramatic event is quite large, but is definitely possible comparing to other gases and, with its short lifespan, will cause very dramatic shifts in climate, which would certainly significantly impact any species that have a low tolerance for change.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr: A large release of methane would cause dramatic shifts in climate that could wipe out species with low tolerance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
