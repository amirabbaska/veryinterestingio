		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047653" target="_blank">There was a study that has shown dogs are capable of social referencing in the same way humans are.</a> That is when we discover something new, we're influenced by those around us on how to behave towards it.</p>
<p>Through social referencing, dogs take cues from us when learning how to behave towards the cute mini humans. They see the care, attention and security we provide to children. This influences them to behave in the same way.</p>
<p>It doesn't tell the whole story, but I think it definitely plays a role initially.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Secondary question: if such a study exists, was there any analysis on whether it was specifically human young that canines treat differently, or all species young? </p>
<p>I've read a lot about the eons long relationship between humans and canines, so I wonder if that had an impact on their actions toward infants. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
