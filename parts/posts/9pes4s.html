I've never heard of this. Is this at all correct?</p>
<p>I was under the impression it's simply because the solar system started as a rotating field of dust so of course as the planets and sun formed that direction of rotation would be maintained and any object orbiting in the opposite direction would simply be destroyed via collisions. This is the same reason why all the planets are on the same plane.  This has been confirmed by simulations. But I've never heard of the sun pulling the planets in a particular direction due to its rotation. Does the rotation of an object affect its gravitational pull at all? I was under the impression the direction of gravity was always just a straight shot to the center of mass, regardless of rotation.</p></div></div>

<p>Also, your impression is correct - the planets all rotate in (roughly) the same direction because that was the angular momentum of the original molecular cloud from which the whole Solar System formed.</p>
<p>Now, if we want to be very pedantic, there is also technically the incredibly subtle effect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging" target="_blank">frame dragging</a>: Rotating massive objects have an relativistic effect on the space-time around them, causing a very slight extra torque to orbiting bodies. This is so small that, in spite of being first proposed in 1918 as a consequence of general relativity, we still haven't had solid convincing proof that it actually exists. There are some very rough calculations done in 2011 from the data produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_B" target="_blank">Gravity Probe B</a> that suggest frame dragging does indeed occur, but the margin of error is still quite large.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not exactly wrong. The spin of the sun doesn’t cause the planets to spin in that direction, but the two should pretty much always go in the same direction. It’s a simple mistake of A causes B and C, but being stated as B causes C. A in this situation is that the spin of objects in a solar system should approximately match the average angular velocity of the solar system as a whole. The larger the body the more likely, stars and planets included.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure why objects spin the way they do but every object caught in gravitational pull spins at
90* to the rotation of the object upon its axis.
That’s why Saturn has rings instead of a cloud of rotating debris</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
