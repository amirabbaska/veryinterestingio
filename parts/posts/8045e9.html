		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ironically, the response is not from the adrenaline response, but an overly active vagal response. Some people are wired in such a way that when they are exposed to something frightening or overly stimulating (ie. sight of blood, fear, strong emotions), they have an initial adrenaline surge, but the body attempts to counteract this by stimulating the vagal nerve. In those who are overly &quot;vagal&quot;, this causes activation of the parasympathetic nervous system which slows the heart rate, drops the blood pressure, and causes people to turn pale, sweaty, and even faint. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies basically have two &quot;modes&quot; a calm mode and an excited mode. The calm mode is when we're sitting down or eating. The excited mode is when we're excersising and moving a lot. The way our blood is distributed through our body is different for each mode.</p>
<p>There's this thing called the fight or flight reaction that changes our body from the calm mode to the excited mode when we're afraid or angry. This comes from back when we lived in the wild. When we encounter a predator we'll either want to beat it upir run away, so we don't get eaten. And we need to go into the excited mode to do that the best we can.</p>
<p>So what happens in excited mode? Less blood goes to our hands, feet and face. More blood goes to the big muscles in our arms and legs. The heart also starts pumping much faster.You don't need a lot of precise movement in these cases, just as much force as possible. </p>
<p>So why does this happen when we're scared? It should be clear now. Fear is something that activates the fight or flight reaction. Our bodies become excited and the blood goes from our face to our arms and legs. We're getting ready to run away from what we're afraid of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
