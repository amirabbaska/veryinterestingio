		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Organizations like BMI and ASCAP collect information on performances of musical works from radio stations and elsewhere and collects fees from them. They then pass along the fees (minus their fee) to the artist. That way, the artist doesn't need to do the work to find out when their works are being performed (though they can report performances to the organizations).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you want to use a song, on the radio or in a movie or in a commercial or ..., you have to acquire the rights to do that.  Clearance companies make it easier (but not easy) to get these terms agreed to.  If the agreement requires you to state how many times you played it, then you have to keep track and report every month (or whatever term is agreed to).  The contract includes payments, and you make the payments to the publisher.  The publisher gets to keep some of the money, and pays the rest to the artist monthly, quarterly, or yearly depending on the amount.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different companies (collection agencies) all around the world who music using organisations pay money to. If you're a company playing the radio you'll pay a little and what you listen to wont be tracked closely, if you're a big venue you'll have to pay a lot and provide an exact set list.</p>
<p>The writer and performer of the song are two different things (although can be the same person). Generally a publisher represents the writer and will effectively contact the collection agency and say &quot;hey, that dude who signed a contract with me had his x songs played at y venue&quot;, and they say &quot;oh yeah, so he did, here's some money!&quot; And the publisher gives an agreed amount to the writer. The performer also gets some via the record label.</p>
<p>If a song is played in a foreign country, the collection agencies have international agreements in place to share their info and pass money along (taking a small cut on the way). So the artist will see money even from foreign radio play they might not be aware of.</p>
<p>TL:DR lots of companies are paid to collect the money and give it out to who deserves it.</p>
<p>Source: did my degree in it and started my own publishing company once upon a time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was on the radio, many years ago, we had a pad where we had to write down what song we played.  We mailed that out every month to a company, which sorted out who owned what.  It was pretty annoying. The station paid a fee for the service.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
