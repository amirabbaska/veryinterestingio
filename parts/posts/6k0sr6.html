		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really know what dark matter is.</p>
<p>The prevailing hypothesis is that it's some kind of particle that only interacts gravitationally (well, for the most part). If that's the case, then yes, black holes should definitely be able to swallow that stuff up.</p>
<p>Under that same assumption, it should be noted that dark matter will probably not form an accretion disk, nor would it care about an existing accretion disk. So dark matter particles would just describe conic curves around the black hole. If the curves happen to intersect the event horizon, the particles will be captured. Otherwise no capture will occur. (with some corrections to those trajectories due to general relativity)</p>
<hr />
<p>If it turns out that dark matter is not particulate stuff, then all of the above does not apply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We're guessing there's matter because it definitely is gravity.  But could the gravity just be a warp in space-time and not caused by any real matter?  </p>
<p>If so, then maybe no, maybe it doesn't get eaten by black holes.  </p>
<p>It might just be gravity bleeding into our universe from some other dimension or something.</p>
<p>Who knows?  All we know is that there's this gravity but we don't know if it's from matter or what.</p>
<p>Neil Tyson says not to call it dark matter.  He says to call it dark gravity.  </p>
<p>I agree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity bends spacetime, so everything that exists inside spacetime is influenced by gravity. Dark matter exists in spacetime so it must interact with a black hole. If it were to drift right past a black hole, it would be equivalent to saying it exists in a separate spacetime which is not physically possible as far as I know. Why would dark matter exist in our spacetime but then ignore bends in spacetime created by a black hole?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
