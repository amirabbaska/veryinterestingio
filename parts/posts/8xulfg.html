		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not like they were created and never changed... All materials come from a source. There is a cost to harnessing that source. Standard markups for logistics. Competition keeps prices for similar products in check. After that it's literally all supply and demand. Nothing different than why does a gallon of milk cost $3.50?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would say it is set by the same simple rules of supply and demand. I my current case CA, Los angels is covered in weed shops so I won't pay more than 5/gram for marijuana. However in college on Ohio I would pay 60-80 for 3.5 grams because I had no choice because there was no competition. </p>
<p>Edit: while it stated below, this Ohio reference is from 20 years ago. I was simply using as a reference point for supply and demand. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m the COO of a (licensed and legal) California cannabis company. Here’s the breakdown: it costs us about $1.00 to grow an 1/8th of cannabis. It costs another $1.50 to dry, cure, trim and fully process that gram into a bulk useable product. Add another $0.60 for child resistant certified packaging, $0.25 for custom printed high end labeling, and $1.25 for labor to pack an individual serving into the jar. Now you’ve got a product that’s ready for retail for $4.60. Wait! TAXES! Add another $1.15 for CA State cultivation tax and, depending where you are, about $0.15 for county/local tax. So you’re at $5.90. Now you need to get it to market: State required pesticide and potency testing - add another $0.20. Next, you’ve got to land the account with a dispensary: we have our own sales team who get 2% commission on top of base salary, and a regional manager who gets another 1.5% -  that’s another $0.50. So you’ve made the sale, but now you need to fulfill the order - 7% to your last mile distributor, add $1.00. And they pay you in cash! The bank you’re lucky enough to get a cannabis friendly account at charges you anywhere from 2.5-5% for banking your money - let’s call that another $0.50. Where are we at here? That’s $8.10. On top of that you have all your normal soft costs - accountants &amp; bookkeeping, general administrative costs, HR, office leases, inventory management, executive expenses, etc etc etc etc.
We wholesale to dispensaries for $15 for an 1/8th - and then the state taxes ya again at 24% - yes you read that correctly. So we’re at $18.60. Dispensary needs their mark up to cover their cost of doing business, so they keystone that to $37.20 and last but not least 9% sales tax. And you end up with a $40 1/8th</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth mentioning that not all drug prices are the same everywhere, even in the same region. </p>
<p>I lived in a small town 150km from the nearest city, pot was $25 an eighth. When I moved to the city it was suddenly 40. </p>
<p>The same is true for other drugs like coke and MDMA, some dealers in the same city will sell for less then others, some will offer deals based on quantity, some will offer to deliver for a fee. </p>
<p>Prices aren't really agreed upon but based on the sellers overhead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
