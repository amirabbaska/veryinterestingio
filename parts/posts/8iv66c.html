		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The good news is that when you get to a certain age it should plateau. After that, according to my optometrist, your eyesight will actually improve. Mine did, and it has. For reference, I'm over 40, eyesight has improved a bit in last visit, so much so and early enough I had to go see a doctor. All ok, but nice to know it doesn't necessarily just keep going downhill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lens, a small clear portion of your eye under the surface cornea, can be flexed and unflexed to adjust the focus of your eye. As your lens becomes older and less durable, you are unable to focus your eye as well as your should. This loss of range can result in either nearsightedness or farsightedness, depending on how the lens has lost it's range of motion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your eye is too short the image you see fall too far back. When your eye is too long, the image falls short of the retina on the back of your eye. In both cases the images you see are blurry in the same way a camera is out of focus. When you are very young the lens inside your eye can overcome this by changing shape. As you get older the lens becomes harder and cannot overcome a significant amount of error. By about 40 it can no longer focus on things near and most people need reading glasses to see things up close. Not a lot of 4 year olds wear glasses but a whole lot of adults do. Good news, you eyes are not deteriorating. You need glasses to overcome an eye that is just a few millimeters too long. You, and millions and millions of other people. Hope that helps you to understand. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
