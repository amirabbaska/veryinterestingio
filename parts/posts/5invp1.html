<p>All good and well, until an integral of e^i*x is used from 0 to ∞.</p>
<p>In the limits, e^i*∞ evaluates to 0. But neither is cos(∞) defined nor sin(∞). Can someone please explain this contradiction?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not about harmonic oscillator. He's talking about the radiation emitted by a sheet of oscillating charge using a complex scalar field to model the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>What he's talking about there is how the integration process of the complex numbers traces out a circle if the absolute value of the term remains constant. But this is only true if that plane of charge is infinite in extent, as assumed in the model, so the terms in the integral don't change in magnitude.</p>
<p>He then handwaved that way by saying in real life the plane of charge isn't infinite, and so you'd have a decaying term in the integral, which traces out a spiral. The center of the spiral is the integral's true value. (Additionally, if there's no perfect symmetry in the system, you'd expect the contributions of that term to end up pointing in all directions, so they would tend to cancel themselves out on average, giving a similar decaying result.)</p>
<p>In short, that e^i∞ arises because of the plane being assumed infinite and the charge distribution symmetric (so there's no decay, they always add up).</p>
<p>In real life, none of this is true, and that term would tend to die off and cancel itself out.</p>
<p>EDIT: A more intuitive explanation of what's happening in Feynman's problem. The final result has two terms: an oscillating term and a constant term. If you assume there's some decay, the first oscillating term dies off, the second constant term changes a little. So we might as well ignore the oscillating term and stick with the constant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not defined. But ironically it was mathematician, Dirac and others, that first used that integral. Specifically, it's all about fourier transform. I suggest you reading this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function</a> .Here is TLDR version. In early development of Fourier theory, it got a lot of criticizms for using a undefinable function as a eigenfunction. However, that function somehow &quot;made sense&quot; in a lot of calculation. Mathematician eventually proved every formula regarding it and now its safe to use it. I had same problem as you when I studied Quantum Mechanics and teachers seems to not care, or just leave it to mathematicians, about the explicity. I had to dig up by myself. It is called 'Abuse of Notation' and there is actually quite a few examples about it. When we calculate dx/dy <em> dy/dz teachers tell us to cancel dy like its rational number but in reality that being equal to dx/dz is a theorem. When we calculate Integral f(x)dg(x) we were told to do some weird dy=dg(x), dy=g'(x)dx while in reality, it's the Radon-Nikodym Theorem. The textbook you read might told you some formulas after telling you that lim-&gt;INF exp(i</em>x) exists but in reality, the formulas were proven first, then they made up with this weird abuse of notation, because it made sense intuitively.</p>
<p>Also, it is generally bad for you to ask about mathematics in reddit. Other comments are all misleading. It is better for you to dig up by yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the average value of a continuous function f(x) over the interval [a, b] is defined as (integral f(x) from a to b)/(b-a) and apply that definition to sin(x) or cos(x) over the interval [0, b], it's easy to see that the average approaches 0 as b gets very large.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're performing an improper integral with one of the bounds defined as infinity, the proper mathematical way to express it is with bounds from 0 to a, and take the limit as a goes to infinity. As such, you essentially end up with lim(cos(a)) a--&gt; inf, which is undefined due to oscillation. Because lim(e^ia ) a--&gt; inf decays to 0, it's evaluated as 0. To sum up, it's a little more proper to think of improper limits as approaching some value than just a straight evaluation. Hope that helps from a math standpoint.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
