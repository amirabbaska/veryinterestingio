		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>lets see</p>
<p>1) Megabit vs Megabyte, 1 megabyte is 8 megabit, so if you have 10Mbps from your telco, you probobly have 1.25MBps</p>
<p>2) Protocol overhead, the data dosnt go un a raw format, its usualy packaged in a protocol called TCP/IP which requires envalopes called &quot;packets&quot; with their own structure and inner detail, this usualy can take between 2 and 10% of your bandwidth. </p>
<p>3) Wifi is very dependent on protocol used (A. B. G, N, AC...), interferance from local sources, sometimes some brands hate other brands and things like this. so for a perfect connection you would have to be on a &quot;clean channel&quot; (meaning no interference or anyone else using it), your antenna and equipment be 100% operational and your reciving device as well, using the same protocol and with a wifi standard that is able to provide speeds which are superior to the speed you get from a cabled connection. </p>
<p>4) if you have a DSL connection, your distance from the nearest DSL exchange device where your line is plugged in (a DSLAM) will affect the connection, around 2/3 of a mile gives you 100% but from there you start to drop off, i use to live around 2 miles from the exchange and had around 45db of attunuation, my 20mbps ADSL2+ would end up being a 6mbps DSL link. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could be faced with a multitude of reasons why. Do you get the speed you pay for when your  computer is plugged in directly to the router? If that's the case, you need a better router that can handle the speed. </p>
<p>If you don't get the speed you pay for when directly plugged into the router, but you get the speed you pay for when directly plugged into the modem, you still have a bad router.</p>
<p>If you still don't get the speed you pay for when you're plugged directly into the modem, it's likely the fault of your ISP.</p>
<p>Maybe, if your laptop/phone/etc is older, your wireless card in the machine isn't up to par to match the speeds (ac standard should allow you to top out). </p>
<p>There are a lot of factors going into this. I have gigabit and get the full tap through my router, but I also have a very nice router and my wireless devices can handle speeds that high. Maybe the situation for you has a broken link</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A common point of confusion for people when talking about internet speeds is that they are usually quoted in &quot;bits&quot; while the computer measures in &quot;bytes&quot;. A bit is a single unit of binary information which is either a zero or a one. A byte is a standard functional unit of information composed of eight bits.</p>
<p>As a result the speed the computer will display will be 1/8th of that which your internet provider would be advertising. Obviously the provider prefers to advertise the bigger number and the only way you can tell the difference is by checking the units.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the one thing that many responses are missing is the key phrase &quot;I never have WIFI speeds...&quot; </p>
<p>Wifi is sent over radio waves to your computer, which is the key to why you may be having problems. If many routers are nearby and on the same frequency, or you or a neighbor are using a microwave, data transmission can be very spotty when sent over radio. This is especially bad if you are in an apartment setting, where 8+ people could all have their own wifi connections and be using microwaves at various times. And that is only in one building, nearby buildings could also cause interference! Even when you are feet from your router, you could still be receiving major interference from the many sources nearby. If many devices are trying to receive data from the same signal, you will have similar issues. For best speed over wifi, a single device needs to be connected to the router.</p>
<p>So that's one of the major things, but the next major thing is that your router may be using a older transmission format which has a lower capped speed. Wireless-G has a max throughput of only 54 mbps (mega bits per second). These speeds are only reached if the router is practically in isolation with no other signals interfering. Wireless-N can a throughput of 600 - 900 mbps. So in order to receive better speed from your router, using N will help tremendously. In addition, a new format was recently developed called Wireless-AC, which is even faster and more reliable.</p>
<p>The takeaway from this is that wireless is a very variable (and sometimes unreliable) method of delivering internet. If you want max speed, you need a wired connection directly to your router. Only then can you really say that you are not receiving the speeds you are paying for. Speeds from internet companies are assuming you are using a wired direct connection to the modem. Its also important to note that most internet service providers do not guarantee the speeds you are paying for, but that is another topic entirely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There can be a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>1)  You're confusing mbps and MB/s.  If you have 150mbps service, your maximum speed is going to be 18.75MB/s.</p>
<p>2)  Your router isn't capable of transmitting the full speed. If you have a B band router, the max speed is 11mbps. If you have a G band router, your max speed is 53mbps. Wireless N is 600-900mbps max. Wireless AC is up to 5300mbps.</p>
<p>3)  Your device that's on wireless isn't capable of receiving the full speed (see #2 above for speed limitations).</p>
<p>4)  There is signal degradation between the router and your device, preventing the top speed.</p>
<p>5)  Add in switches, hubs, cable lengths, wall and floor composition, data reflection, and other nearby wifi transmitters using the same channel range, and you can see major variances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
