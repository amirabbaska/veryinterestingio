Remembering a taste is no different than remembering a smell or a sound or a sight or a touch.  You're literally recalling the sensory perception in your brain where it happened in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Conditioning.  Have you heard of &quot;Pavlov's dogs?&quot;  Ivan Pavlov conducted an experiment where he would feed dogs, but only after a bell rings.   Eventually, the sound of the bell made the dogs salivate even if they weren't given food.  They associated the bell with food and their mouths anticipated that.</p>
<p>This is also why you feel the need to go to the bathroom even more when you're near a bathroom.</p>
<p>And also why your mouth waters when you think of certain foods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also have you ever felt jaw pain when eating or even thinking of eating sour candy?</p>
<p>What you’re feeling is your salivary glands producing saliva. Certain sour or very sweet foods — or even just the thought of these foods — can cause these glands to go into overdrive which is what causes the pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
