		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is that they don't slide, rather the whole nail bed and nail grows out together. In the same way that the skin of your inner ear (all the way to the outer ear canal) grows outward, but it's not as though it's &quot;sliding&quot; anywhere. If you could look at a slice of your finger and recognize individual cell types, you'd see that the cells of the nail bed grow up, and out. The whole process is naturally carried forward, but as a unit, not with a sliding motion.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
