<p>My research is about what happens to our memories when we cannot remember. When we experience memory loss, does it mean that these memories have been erased? Could it be that some memories exist in our brains but we are unable to find and recall them? These questions led me to study memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In addition to the impact AD has on our community, watching my own grandmother gradually forget drives me to the laboratory everyday with the hope that someday we will be able to help AD patients remember.</p>
<p>To study memory brain structures affected by AD, I use animal models that closely mimic the human condition. From patients, we know that initial stages of AD (known as “early AD”) are diagnosed when consecutive memory tests result in extremely poor performance. In particular, early AD patients seem to lose memories of events/episodes such as birthday parties, summer vacations with the family, high school reunions, etc. It has been assumed that early AD patients lose critical memory information and therefore cannot remember. My recent work (link to nature study: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17172" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17172</a>) using animal models challenges this widely held assumption. Not only did we find that early AD mice still stored the supposedly lost memories, but we found a way to bring these memories back. Given this work, I believe that memory loss in early stages of AD is because patients are unable find and retrieve the information, rather than a permanent loss of memory information. </p>
<p>Even though this particular work was done using animal models, I have hope that in the future we can learn more about retrieving lost memories in early AD patients. For a perspective on my recent work by expert memory researchers, go here (link to nature news and views: <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature17312.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature17312.html</a>).</p>
<p>If you are interested in some of my previous research that led to the study of memory loss in early AD, go here (link to science study: <a href="http://classic.sciencemag.org/content/348/6238/1007.abstract" target="_blank">http://classic.sciencemag.org/content/348/6238/1007.abstract</a>).</p>
<p>I would love to continue discussing the future of memory research on Twitter, follow me @dheerajroy7 (link to twitter account: <a href="https://twitter.com/dheerajroy7" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/dheerajroy7</a>).</p>
<p>If you don’t have access to any of my research articles, email me (d_roy@mit.edu) and I will try to help ☺!</p>
<p>I am very excited to talk about memory loss and Alzheimer’s disease with the Reddit community because I learn so much through your insightful questions and comments. I will be back at 1 PM EST to answer all questions. In advance, I want to thank the entire community for allowing me to share my work!</p>
<p>8 PM EST, EDIT: It's been an amazing day sharing my work with you all and learning about different interpretations of our research. I would like to thank Reddit and everyone for taking time out of their busy days to contribute to this AMA. I have learned so much from our conversations!</p></div></div>
