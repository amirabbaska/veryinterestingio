		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's because nobody bothers to make an effort to standardize it - because nobody really cares about these differences.  Most of the time, writing something by hand isn't meant to be something that's important in and of itself - only the message is important.  I have college papers written during the 30s from my grandparents - even that was typed.  And on the modern occasions when handwriting <em>is</em> important, it's it's often in a more expressive or artistic setting - invitations, for example - and standardization isn't valued there, anyway.  That isn't to say that we don't, in 2017, value standardization.  It's just that when we want it, we have tools to provide it. </p>
<p>But if you look at handwriting examples from 100 or 200 years ago (old census records are a good source,) you'll see that much of the writing is almost identical.  Typewriters weren't invented until the late 1800s, and of course weren't widely available or cheap for some time after that.  The only way people of this era had to create consistently similar text is through strict instruction and shit tons of practice - so that's what they did.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, they don't.</p>
<p>There's a solid case to be made that handwriting forensics is given more weight than it should.</p>
<p>It's done by eye and not some computer program as is often shown in television and movies. Someone sits down with a magnifying glass, looks at handwriting examples, and &quot;determines&quot; the result.</p>
<p>What points they focus on can vary depending on what person is examining a document.</p>
<p>A lot of people do write in a similar fashion, and it's hard to make a real case that everyone writes entirely differently. Especially given that while someone will generally follow the same format for each letter they write, every letter they hand write will be slightly different because we're not printing machines.</p>
<p>That isn't saying that handwriting has no value in forensics at all. It can be glaringly obvious that a written document doesn't match or is very similar to someone's handwriting.</p>
<p>Other times though, it can be abused as evidence that is less credible than is implied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was told it was because of physiological and physiological differences. The physiological would explain why parents and children have similar handwriting. Psychologically people who are stressed or happy write differently than if they are angry or scared. This is because the brain affects how the body moves and tenses during different emotions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My writing changes all the time.  If I look at things I wrote in high school it's actually quite different then how I write now.  There are some similarities but for the most part its noticeably different.  Same can be said from day to day.  I guess mood can make a difference, but I think alot has to do with the fact that I've always enjoyed writing.  Since I've always doodled and practiced different styles for fun it now translates into my everyday writing style.   Quite often I will even write the same letter differently in the same sentence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has more to do with perception than major differences, I think. It's not so much that we really write that differently (obviously not, that's the point of an alphabet) but it's just that we're highly tuned to those minuscule differences. It would be a fair bet aliens would see no differences in our writing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
