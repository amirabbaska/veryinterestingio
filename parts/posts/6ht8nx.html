		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the reactor and is turbines were meant to undergo a test to find out whether the spinning steam turbines and generators could produce enough electricity while coasting to a stop to run the reactor cooling pumps while the diesel generators were brought online.  This test, far from routine, was derived because, if, for example, the West attacked electrical grids and the plant was disconnected, the reactors would need to be E-stopped, like RIGHT now!  Decay heat would still need to be dealt with.  This test was supposed to have been done during unit 4s commissioning in, like, '83 or '84.  The paperwork was pencil-whipped (extremely kommon in the USSR bekause ahead-of-time konstruction delivery resulted in bonus of many roubles.)  Turns out, the communists were preeetty corner-cutty.  </p>
<p>The reactor design itself is loaded with flaws.  Let's put it this way... The USSR used a cheaper-to-build reactor design than LITERALLY THE WHOLE REST OF THE WORLD!  It lacked a heavy steel and concrete containment building, it used the steam directly produced by the uranium fuel to run the turbines (water turned to steam IN the reactor core and there was no heat exchanger separating irradiated steam and water from, fuckin... NOT radioactive water), it used hollow graphite blocks as a moderator to maintaining the nuclear chain reaction (US and West European reactors use pressurized water, so no water, no nuclear reaction), the boron control rods were graphite tipped (which briefly increased reactor output upon insertion, this is important for later) and about 57 other glaring flaws... like safety systems THAT COULD  BE OVERRIDDEN!</p>
<p>The test was scheduled for April 25th.  It didn't happen on the day shift; because Kievs electrical grid controller asked for it to be done later in the evening, after peak demand.  It didn't happen on the evening shift, either, for unclear reasons.  So when the night shift started at midnight of the 26th, the dude from Moscow who had been there all day and was to oversee the test was... well, testy.  The night shift guys were the youngest and least experienced (the reactor operator was 26 years old) and they'd just been handed a procedure binder loaded with annotations and crossed out procedures.</p>
<p>Note*
Xenon poisoning occurs when reducing capacity in nuclear reactors.  Xenon is a fission byproduct that actually absorbs the zooming around neutrons, preventing them from slamming into another Uranium 235 atom, splitting it, and setting even more neutrons free to go slam into other atoms.  During stable operation, Xenon is &quot;burned off&quot; at a rate that allows the chain reaction to continue.  If control rods are inserted and the reaction slowed, there's an excess of Xenon and it has a control rod like effect, further reducing output.  The nuclear chain reaction will nearly stop because of the excess neutron absorbing shit in the reactor over-coming the nuclear chain reaction itself.  The reactor should need to sit for 48 hours before attempts by to restart the reaction, giving the Xenon a chance to naturally decay. </p>
<p>So, with that fully explained, let's continue!</p>
<p>The reactor had a thermal output rating of 1500 megawatts (1.5 gigawatts).  The test was to be conducted at 1500, but must not to go below 700MW or reactor instability could occur.  The reactor had been running at full capacity, but the decision was made to slightly reduce capacity before starting. </p>
<ol>
<li>To begin, manual control was taken and the control rods were partially inserted into the core, reducing reactor output.</li>
<li>The operator switched the control rods back to automatic control, thinking the computer would hold the desired output. </li>
<li>The automatic system saw the sudden output reduction as a power failure and began plunging the control rods to their fully inserted position, nearly shutting the reactor down.</li>
<li>The Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) tried to start.  It was manually overridden and turned off. </li>
<li>Reactor output dropped to between 0 and 30 MW (depending on which report is read.)</li>
<li>The previously inserted rods were retracted.</li>
<li>Reactor output didn't increase. </li>
<li>Serious Xenon poisoning had occurred, further slowing the nuclear reaction.</li>
<li>The operator was ordered to bring the reactor back up to power, he REFUSED!  It went against written procedure.  (Poor guy, tried to do his job right, and was blamed for the whole thing)</li>
<li>Cranky Moscow dude yelled and made the 27 year old shift chief bring reactor back up: he did.  (Being so young, and being a nuclear plant operator or chief was pretty much a dream job in Soviet Ukraine. To argue with a senior official could cost you everything)</li>
<li>About half the control rods were now fully retracted, but reactor output was only up to 200MW... too low to test. </li>
<li>The coolant pumps were sped up, and additional pumps brought online to try to counteract the Xenon poisoning, this increased water volume, decreased steam volume, and slowed the turbines as a result. </li>
<li>Additional control rods were retracted to try to bring steam output up to speed the turbine back up. </li>
<li>The equivalent of only 8 fully inserted rods remained in the core.  15 was the minimum.  The reactor had over 211 control rods...</li>
<li>Hot spots began developing in the core, but instrumentation wasn't present in the interior of the core.  The operator noticed the computer was demanding the reactor be shut down.  Every safety system had been bypassed. Power output was still too low, Moscow dude insisted they continue. </li>
<li>Output finally increased enough and the turbine was disconnected and began its coast down test. </li>
<li>Once the turbine was disconnected, the condenser couldn't keep up and raw steam entered the condensate (steam turned back into water) return pipes and caused cavitation in the pumps. The steam in the pumps intermittently stopped pumping water into the core.  As pockets of steam collapsed inside the pipes, loud banging sounds could be heard in the turbine hall and near the reactor.</li>
<li>The already unstable core began violently producing pockets of steam. Output began surging. </li>
<li>4 of the 8 pumps were still running on the decelerating turbine and began slowing.  Even less water was available for core cooling. </li>
<li>The core temperature and pressure gauges were pegged.  The steam condenser should have kept up and cooled the steam back to water, but it was overworked - pockets of steam continued entering the pumps. The reactor was idiotically kept online to repeat the turbine test if necessary.</li>
<li>The core suddenly surged way past its maximum output. </li>
<li>Between the noise and power surges, operators decided to &quot;SCRAM&quot; the reactor - SCRAM means, Safety Control Rod Axe Man.  It was to plunge ALL control rods to their fully inserted position and stop the reactor. </li>
<li>The graphite tipped control rods began descending.  Soviet nukes used control servo motors that were notoriously slow, taking 18 seconds to fully insert the rods.</li>
<li>The graphite (graphite increased nuclear reaction) tipped rods acted like Vin Diesel hitting the &quot;NOS button&quot; in that first Fast and the Furious movie/turd.  The reactor went bonkers. </li>
<li>The sudden increase in output fractured the core and the rods became stuck only partially inserted.  There was now nothing to slow the reaction. </li>
<li>Reactor output soared well beyond what instrumentation could even remotely measure. </li>
<li>Pressure built so high it blew the 450 TON lid clean the fuck OFF THE REACTOR. </li>
<li>Air and steam rushed into the core, reacted with the zirconium jacket around each uranium fuel rod, created a ton of hydrogen, then blew the whole roof off the building in a second explosion, spewing tons of radioactive material into the atmosphere. </li>
</ol>
<p>It took awhile for what had happened to sink in.  They though the explosion was from a separator drum.  They continued trying to operate and cool the core, pumping tons and tons of water into it, all of which blew into the night sky as radioactive steam.  </p>
<p>The soviet government blamed the shit out of the operators.  There was no way they could, or would, admit that ALL their mighty RBMK-1000 reactors were gravely flawed.  They couldn't afford to shut their entire nuclear fleet down because of shitty design!  They lied.  They knew the reactors were seriously flawed, but they built them anyway.  They just decided to build controls to deal with the shortcomings... Then made them by-passable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a student in Nuclear engineering, so I'm not an expert (yet). But this is how I understand it:</p>
<p>They were not intentionally operating at low power, as the linked article says they were trying to operate at a higher 20-30% range. But because of reactor poisoning it was slowing down. Reactor poisoning is the buildup of unwanted fission products. These fission products will slow down the reaction by increasing the average distance between fuel atoms and absorbing neutrons that otherwise would've caused fission. The operators didn't fully understand why the reactor was slowing down, so they started pulling out control rods to attempt to bring it back up to power, leaving them unable to react quick enough when it started going wrong.</p>
<p>If I understand the situation correctly, they had the backup generators off because they were trying to run a test of the reactors accident tolerance. They knew that the backup generators would take about 60 seconds to turn on if power was lost, and that 60 seconds without coolant was long enough to cause problems. Basically they were trying to see if, when power was lost, the turbine would be able to keep spinning from it's own momentum long enough to power the coolant pumps until the backup generators came on. So they were trying to simulate a LOCA (loss of coolant accident), meaning the main coolant system is down and the backup one hasn't come on yet. </p>
<p>On top of this, I believe there was a problem with the test that forced them to delay it a few hours. Over that few hours a shift change occurred, meaning that a good chunk of the people that were trained for the test and knew what was happening had left. </p>
<p>So to put it bluntly, the operators didn't appear to understand basic reactor physics like poisoning, they were operating the reactor knowing full well that if something went wrong their backup generators would not come on in time to fix it, and their incredibly dangerous test that they were running occurred during a shift where very few people were trained and aware of the test.</p>
<p>I hope this helps, but definitely do your own research. I may have misremembered something, and I definitely didn't give full detail on anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are a lot of good comments here. I just want to add that boiling style reactors exhibit thermal hydraulic instabilities when they are in high power and low flow conditions. If you have too little forced coolant flow, natural circulation on its own isn't enough to force the steam bubbles out of the core at a reasonable rate, which then can have neutronic effects on reactor power. </p>
<p>Traditional boiling water reactors exhibit core oscillations when these instabilities start, which if not suppressed can lead to violation of the MCPR safety limit and transition boiling which can damage the fuel. Bwrs have restrictions on their operating power/flow map along with oscillation detectors which can trip the reactor before these instabilities can cause core damage. </p>
<p>Graphite moderated cores like chernobyl's RBMK can have power excursions, because voiding in these reactors causes power to continue to increase. This was a known issue and is why there were both coolant flow limits AND minimum control rod insertion limits, to prevent a thermal runaway event from occurring. Chernobyl explicitly violated both of these, placing the reactor in a state where thermal runaway could occur, and having insufficient coolant flow as a result of the test they were doing which induced the instability which grew into the power excursion which caused core damage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, let this be a lesson in humanity. If humans can screw it up, they will.</p>
<p>The whole situation came about because the reactor was to be taken off line for routine maintenance and they took the opportunity to see if the slowing main steam turbines could provide enough power to cool the reactor before the backup diesel cooling system took over. Preparations were made and staff was trained on what to expect. <strong>Actually not a bad idea, and they had a reasonable protocol on how to do it safely.</strong></p>
<p>Now the fun starts. The Evening shift begins making preparations required for the experiment. This means that they start shutting down many of the key safety systems designed to prevent exactly what happens. Separately, Soviet electrical authorities delayed the shut down due to power grid requirements. The test is delayed and moved from the trained staff of the Evening shift to the largely untrained (and more inexperienced) Night shift. <strong>The experiment should have stopped here and waited for trained staff.</strong></p>
<p>Now, the experiment begins. And so do the mistakes. Due to operator error, the power output is no longer stabilized in the 30% range but rather more like 1%. To fix the issue, the plant raises the control rods higher than allowed and has fewer engaged than allowed. This produces a &quot;stable&quot; output level and the test proceeds. <strong>Several trained personnel tried to abort the test here but were overridden.</strong></p>
<p>Several things begin happening. There is a build up of Xenon. This is a by-product of the reaction and under typical operation it is &quot;burned off&quot; by absorbing radiation and decaying further. Several emergency systems are disabled as they would have engaged at this point and ended the experiment. The operators engage all 8 of the cooling pumps. This is actually a bad thing. These reactors were not designed to be completely flooded with water but with a mixture of water and steam. By flooding it, they reduced the power output (reducing power available to the pumps) as well as created conditions the core isn't designed to work with. <strong>Good god, please stop the test.</strong></p>
<p>The test begins. Terrible things happen. The power surges. The Xenon built up begins to burn off, which increases the rate of reaction, which increases the rate of Xenon burn off. The additional heat being made starts to boil off water at the bottom of the core (not where it is designed to be converted to steam). Steam is much less dense and has a much smaller thermal carrying capacity per volume than water. This is also a positive feedback loop where the steam causes rising core temperatures which creates more steam.</p>
<p>The bubbles in the coolant start to cause cavitation within the cooling pumps (really good way to shred a pump). The pressure tubes where control rods are inserted have been deformed by the steam pressure. <strong>Too late now.</strong></p>
<p>They realize things have gone really, really badly. They try to insert the control rods to slow the reaction but they cannot be inserted due to the deformation. Fuel rods begin to burst. This causes an even more massive increase in steam pressure that causes the 1000 ton cover plate to burst off the core. This further damages the control rods and starts to allow radiation and steam pressure into areas not designed to handle or contain it. </p>
<p>&quot;The 1000 ton lid above the fuel elements is lifted by the first explosion. The release of radiation starts. Air reaches the reactor and the oxygen results in a graphite fire. The metal of the fuel tubes reacts to the water. This is a chemical reaction which produces hydrogen, and this hydrogen explodes: the second explosion. Burning debris flies into the air and lands on the roof of Chernobyl Unit 3. (There was barely any attention paid to this hydrogen explosion in the Soviet report about the accident. In studies commissioned by the US government however, it was concluded that the second explosion was of great significance, and that the original explanation of the accident was incorrect. Richard Wilson of the Harvard University in the US said this second explosion was a small nuclear explosion.)&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ex Nuclear Operator here.</p>
<p>The initial plan was to have this test run during the day, during planned maintenance. The idea was to see if the turbine generator could supply enough power to keep coolant pumps running while the generator was spinning down (there's a lot of spinning mass, so even with no steam being supplied, it will still produce power for some time) before the diesels could come online.</p>
<p>The electrical grid operator refused to allow them to perform the test, however, citing too much demand. So, they shifted the test to be run during the night, when demand was lower. Unfortunately, night shift wasn't briefed to the same extent as day shift.</p>
<p>Reactor power was lowered by lowering steam demand, i.e. electrical power output. If I recall, the emergency cooling system was disabled because it would have kicked on during the transient, and they wanted to see if normal cooling means could handle it. Don't quote me on that part.</p>
<p>Reactor power dropped too low for the test, however; assumed cause is operator error. We don't know everything about the events. Attempts to raise reactor power back up were then stymied by a combination of Xenon poisoning, and RBMK (of which Chernobyl was one) reactors having a positive void coefficient. </p>
<p>Chernobyl is of a style called a Boiling Water Reactor, or BWR. These exist in the U.S. as well, although their design is entirely different, and inherently safe. The other style is a Pressurized Water Reactor, or PWR. The US Navy uses this latter style exclusively, and there are some commercial examples as well. To ELI5, a BWR allows for boiling of the water inside the core, a PWR does not. There are pros and cons with each. Mind you, the pressure of the water is well above atmospheric, so the temperature of it can be raised above 212 F / 100 C. Anyway, as more boiling occurs, more steam is produced, and therefore more voids, or gaps, in the coolant channel occur. With a positive void coefficient, therefore, you get a positive feedback loop as you raise power. Since Chernobyl was at a very low power level, there were fewer voids, and so the reactor was sluggish to respond.</p>
<p>Xenon is the other contributor. To simplify, when fissioned, U-235 produces I-135, which itself decays into Xe-135. The time for the Xe-135 to be born depends on the transient, but to generalize, say ~6 hours. Xe-135 is a neutron absorber, meaning power is reduced even further. To counter this, the operators raised the control rods up, but as the RBMK design has a very slow emergency shutdown (scram) insertion speed, it couldn't respond quickly enough when they finally tried to abort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
