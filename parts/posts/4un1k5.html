		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a distributed control system. Each segment has a ganglion that acts as a small &quot;brain&quot; to control its pair of legs. The centipede brain sends a go signal and the ganglion handles the motion, coordinating its timing with signals from the segments ahead and behind. There's also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pattern_generator" target="_blank">Central Pattern Generator (CPG)</a>, an which is an intrasegmental network of neurons which generates a rhythmic output, that keeps them all in step.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't go terribly far in answering your questions, but it kind of reads that you're implying they're insects. If I've misinterpreted, then please ignore this, but I just wanted to point out for anyone who thinks of them as insects that centipedes and millipedes are instead myriapods. Myriapods, insects, spiders, and crustaceans are all arthropods. Insects are in part characterized by having 3 body segments and only 3 pairs of legs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
