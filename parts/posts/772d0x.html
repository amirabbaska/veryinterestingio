		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually tried to find this out a couple of years ago for a story I was trying to write. It turns out satellites actually have to deal with this problem of current being generated by their own movement.</p>
<p>I couldn't find out much information though. The best I could find was <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JZ065i001p00001/abstract" target="_blank">Charge and magnetic field interaction with satellites</a>. Also, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/H_Garrett/publication/4699638_The_charging_spacecraft_surface/links/00b7d52c6ff63be66b000000.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> has a lot of information. Bear in mind that the magnetic field is not the only source of charge -- particles can affect it too.</p>
<p>It seems like you might be able to get a few volts (~10V maybe), but the current would of course depend on the resistance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A regular open wire won't exactly generate a current, if you assume it to be a perfect conductor, but there will be an electromotive force that you can calculate. You could then turn that into a current if you knew the real resistance of your wire or circuit.</p>
<p>The Earth's surface might see a magnetic field of 0.5 gauss, or 1/20,000 volt-seconds per meter squared. By fiddling with the units (and taking the reciprocal) you get an expression of 20,000 meters per second, per volt per meter. To generate one volt across a one meter wire, you need to move it at 20,000 meters per second in the <em>optimal</em> orientation. That's a little faster than is practical, though it's approaching numbers like what you'd see on a satellite. Make the antenna bigger, or the voltage requirement lower, and that lowers the required speed.</p>
<p>Basically if you had a satellite in orbit at 7000 m/s, and you put an LED in the middle of what is essentially an antenna that was about 3 meters long, and had it oriented against the magnetic field... that might just generate enough EMF to at least overcome the LED's forward voltage and technically generate some light. (edit: It really won't generate light continuously due to there not being an actual circuit. For that you really need to make it a loop so those charges can get back around.)</p>
<p>(I also expect this would generate some torque on the satellite, eventually turning it away from the magnetic field lines or slowing it down. You can't get something for nothing!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a really interesting question because you specify current instead of voltage. Normally, a metal object in space can't get charge to flow. If you have a straight wire, it forms an open circuit with nowhere for charge to go, so current can't really happen. If you have a loop, essentially you still have that wire in space, but you just split it in half. There is still a voltage generated by the magnetic field, but this time its the top of the loop and the bottom of the loop. So how do we get current to flow?</p>
<p>It turns out if we are in the ionosphere we can actually interact with the surrounding plasma to gain electrons and and emit electrons to complete our circuit! If you have an electron emitter at the top of your loop, then the wire can exchange charge and make a current. </p>
<p>Now to actually answer your question. If you are going around 7km per second, the earth's magnetic field is around 25 uTeslas, then the voltage will be around 175 mV per meter of length. This, combined with the resistivity of your metal will determine how much current will move through the wire. What you are much more likely to be limited by is how much current you can collect or emit, which is limited by the plasma temperature, the electron emitter, and a host of other factors. </p>
<p>If this seems interesting, check out Electrodynamic Tethers. They're a form of satellite propulsion that is really interesting, especially for small scale satellites</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you give a length, it seems like you're heading in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tether" target="_blank">Space Tether</a> territory, specifically an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamic_tether" target="_blank">Electrodynamic Tether</a> where, &quot;Electric potential is generated across a conductive tether by its motion through a planet's magnetic field.&quot;</p>
<p>My understanding is that as long as you're not in geosynchronous orbit you can generate current as you are then moving through the magnetic field and can use that to generate electricity.  As the magnetic field is more-or-less static in relation to the earth anything in geosynchronous orbit should be similarly relatively static in the magnetic field and unable to extract power from it.</p>
<p>The appropriate formula are in the second link, along with the following bit:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1996, NASA conducted an experiment with a 20,000-meter conducting tether. When the tether was fully deployed during this test, the orbiting tether generated a potential of 3,500 volts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It probably doesn't scale down smoothly, but that suggests that a 10 meter length placed in the same orbit as the 1996 experiment would generate about 1.75 volts.</p>
<p>Less further out, more closer in as the magnetic field is more diffuse further out and more concentrated further in as orbital velocities lower down are faster than ones further out, meaning that, all other things being equal, a low orbit means passing through a stronger magnetic field more rapidly, which should result in more electricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Flux gate compass systems are basically a 3-phase generator, depending on the current generated from each coil, you can determine which direction is true north and then which direction you are pointing.
It's a very small current, but it's enough. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
