		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets talk first about why many animals <em>do</em> have mating seasons. The reason is usually quite simple: offspring born at certain times of the year have a better chance at survival.  For example, deer mate in the fall and give birth in late spring, ensuring they have plenty of food and time to grow before the harsh winter season.  Many tropical fish spawn when the rains come at the end of the dry season, providing their offspring with access to shelter and food in the newly flooded forests along the banks of their home rivers.  </p>
<p>In species where offspring survival isn't seasonal, breeding seasons don't tend to exist. This holds for many (but not all) tropical species, including all the great apes.  And it holds for humans.  </p>
<p>So to get to specifics, below are some reasons it doesn't necessarily make sense for humans to have breeding seasons:</p>
<p>A) none of our related species have them, so neither did our ancestors. </p>
<p>B) Humans are fundamentally tropical (having originated in tropical regions), and thus our &quot;native climate&quot; didn't have the harsh winters that a breeding season is often timed to avoid</p>
<p>C) Humans live in groups and use technology, and this insulates us from the variability of our environment, meaning our infants are less vulnerable to external environmental conditions</p>
<p>D) Humans have very long infancies, meaning no matter when they are born they are going to be experiencing a full year's worth of climate variation as a baby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like all other organisms, our mating strategy is part and parcel of our overall survival strategy.</p>
<p>In our case, we are extreme &quot;K-specialists&quot;. We devote a <em>huge</em> amount of investment and resources in our offspring, compared to, say, willows who just scatter their seed to the wind by the millions.</p>
<p>Our females have developped a strategy of concealed ovulation. Current thinking is that by concealing her ovulation and maintaining a perpetual state of potential sexual readiness, the human female makes it difficult for males to know whether her offpring are theirs. The male counter-strategy is to be at hand as often as possible to prevent cuckoldry. Together, this strategy and counter-strategy promote pair-bonding, monogamy and dual parental investment, thus maximising parental investment in offspring.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What others said, plus we do not have a strong downside to having births scattered through the year.  Thanks to our cooperation and ability to control the environment babies can survive if they are born in any season, which is not true for many, many species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a strain of thought right now that it's due partially to fully bipedal motion. </p>
<p>Most of the drawbacks of bipedal motion are born by the woman, greater angle of the femur into the knee creates much greater incidence of tron ACL/MCL etc. But the big one is a much narrower birth canal than even our closest relative, the Bonobo. A Bonobo is pregnant for 7 months, humans 9. Bonobos come out of the womb capable of climbing and clinging to their mothers. Human babies are near-useless lumps for 3 months. We really should be pregnant for much longer but simply cannot keep a baby in that long. A baby is such an incredible burden on a mother that the time in which she has him is irrelevant. What is more important is the social setting she has. It's also probably one of the reasons women get in ovulation sync after long-term exposure to each other. It's more important to have babies communally than to have them at a certain time in the season. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
