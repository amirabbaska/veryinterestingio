<p>This doesn't seem like a process that could be stumbled upon by accident; would even small amounts of ore melt outside of a furnace environment?</p>
<p>If not, then what were the precursor technologies that would require the development of a fire hot enough, where chunks of magnetite would happen to be present?</p>
<p>ETA: Wow, this blew up. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuCnZClWwpQ" target="_blank">Here's the video</a>, for the curious.</p></div></div>
