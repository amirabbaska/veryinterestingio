		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity has an infinite reach, but the gravitational force experienced on Earth by the other planets is extraordinarily small. If we removed the other planets, Earth and the Moon would continue their orbits virtually unchanged. However, it's believed the gas giants play an important role in the survival of smaller planets like Earth because they act as vacuum cleaners, drawing in debris that would otherwise strike Earth. Without these giants, the Earth might still survive, but it would be in much more peril.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Now that the paths have been cleared, it's somewhat likely that gravitational tugs on Kuiper Belt objects by the gas giants could destabilize KBO orbits and send them in toward Earth. It could be better going forward without them there, but Earth may have turned out differently if not for the presence of the gas giants. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2007/08/24/jupiter-protection-from-incoming-comets/" target="_blank">This article</a> alludes to a study that showed that Jupiter offers no protection at all, and answers at least part of your question: What would happen if Jupiter wasn't there?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember that something the size of Mars once hit the earth and it still survived, though a few chunks fell off to form the moon.  The earth is extremely tough and difficult to destroy.  Of course much smaller impacts would kill off the human race ... but that's not what you asked about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I don't work for them, or anything, but it's a fun toy when you want to see what happens when you do things like drop a super-massive black hole into the solar system, double the density of the moon, or send asteroids on a collision path with Earth. It's also on Steam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
