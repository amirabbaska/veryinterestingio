		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a problem everywhere these drugs are available.</p>
<p>When many of the drugs were put on the market, the risk of tolerance/addiction was either downplayed or not fully understood. Keep in mind that there are <em>still</em> doctors who don't believe opioids are potentially problematic and just keep writing prescriptions. Research is a lot more transparent these days and more people understand that something isn't right, but it takes time to change the culture. </p>
<p>There are a few contributing factors. </p>
<p>One, opioid withdrawal is really, really awful and very difficult without the right supports in place. </p>
<p>Two, the standard practice is to simply cut people off and stop writing prescriptions rather than address the underlying addiction. With detox looming, street drugs become a substitution. </p>
<p>Three, there are relatively few evidence-based detox and recovery beds for prescription opioid users. </p>
<p>Four, a shocking number of people still see addiction as a moral issue rather than a medical issue. They don't want their tax dollars/research dollars/healthcare dollars going to <em>junkies on the street</em> who <em>choose that lifestyle</em> and should just <em>pull themselves together and contribute to society</em>. And things like <em>harm reduction</em>? You mean this program <em>doesn't</em> force abstinence? The end result is that objectively helpful approaches like harm reduction tend to be unpopular politically, so they just don't happen.</p>
<p>Five, alternatives to opioids in pain management are still catching up and opioids may be the only option in some cases.</p>
<p>Basically, a lot of different systems failed and continue to fail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of pretty decent comments here so far. Jumping in from both the pharmacy profession inside the US and as someone who travels internationally a fair bit (including outside of the traditional &quot;West&quot;), I have a couple comments.</p>
<p>Prescription opioid abuse exists pretty much everywhere that prescription opioids exist. There are several reasons why its a mainstream issue here and less so elsewhere. </p>
<p>First, prescription opioids are just more common and more available here compared to most of the world. </p>
<p>Second, the relative availability and ease of access to prescription opioids versus the same for 'street' opiates makes prescription drug abuse much more attractive than it is in places where street opiates are cheap and easy to get hold of. </p>
<p>Third, we've had numerous public health and media campaigns here highlighting the issue. I have traveled in certain countries where vaguely similar epidemics are occurring, but the people there don't really recognize it for what it is.</p>
<p>Just a note - most of my experience with this outside of the US and the West in general is in the Middle East, where I travel frequently but do not practice. I've been struck by local ignorance when it comes to what types of drugs people are consuming and for what reasons. They know that some people are taking lots of medicine for less than medical reasons but they ignore it because it's unsightly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While opioids and other drug epidemics exist all around the world for many different reasons, the U.S. has it's own set of special problems caused by a very firm stance against drugs. The war on drugs is the best example. </p>
<p>Now, in other countries like Portugal, drug laws are a lot more loose. You don't go to prison for years just for doing heroin. At least not all the time. This means that instead of punishing people who have serious addiction problems, they offer them needle-exchange programs and healthcare. Heroin addicts in countries like these live much better lives and are given the opportunities to get their life back on track. This means that a lot of heroin users in some other countries are not only able to function in daily life, but they are also given the help they need to quit abusing. Addicts here don't often stay addicts, and thus their addiction rates are low. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, in America the law isn't so lenient. Addicts in the U.S. of A. are severely punished for their problems. Addicts here aren't given the tools to keep their lives on track, and thus spiral into a drug-fueled nightmare life. Addicts in America are often poor, unhealthy, and looked down on. Not only this, but they are also thrown in prison for years because of their addiction, making them even less likely to get their life fixed up. </p>
<p>This means that American addicts often stay addicts. The numbers pile up. If you want to find out more about the negative effects of the war in drugs, I would suggest reading up on countries with better laws here </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big part of the answer hasn't been mentioned yet - opiates are cheaper and quicker than other forms of pain management. They make sense for the US labor market.</p>
<p>Say you have a herniated disc. In Europe, you might get four weeks of paid medical leave, a bunch of appointments with a physical therapist, instructions to avoid physical exertion, and some ibuprofen. In the US you might get powerful painkillers because a) you run a real risk of losing your job or at least the pay if you don't turn up and b) the next physical therapist is possibly not covered by your insurance if you even have one, and could be far away if you're in a rural area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
