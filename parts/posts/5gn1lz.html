		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned by /u/lobsang_ludd, there are a number of natural reasons <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification" target="_blank">desertification</a> occurs. Important deserts have formed over long timescales. But as I understand it, for instance the exact reason for why Sahara is so dry is not known. We know, that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara#History" target="_blank">Sahara</a> was a lot more wet thousands of years ago after the ice age. It has been thought to be due to changes in the orientation of the Earth. But this is not completely sure.</p>
<p>But other than natural desertification, human caused climate change and overexploitation of land are important. If humans use land in ways that just deplete nutrients and don't take care of the soil, the soil will dry and die. Droughts, winds and rains, but also cutting down trees, tilling and low diversity agriculture increase erosion. The more vegetation there is, the better the soil can resist erosion and drying. The areas you speak of have been inhabited by humans for a long time, and they are areas of high danger for desertification. Many of such danger areas are also poor. For example Sahel.</p>
<p>Land degradation has happened fast due to humans in many places. China, Mediterranean and Mesopotamia for instance, in geologically very recent history. These areas were and are very densely populated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is due to the shift of Tectonic plates around Eastern Africa, Large mountains has been created due to two plates has collided. These mountains pretty much blocks the Monsoon rain Weather that used to come from India into Africa, but since then, everything began to decay in Northerend Africa. As little as just 11,000 years ago Sahara was somewhat green, and about 20,000 years ago it was a rainforest at almost the size of Europe. Also The Ice Age which ended had a huge influence as well! Since the world was much colder back then, Africa also sustained a more mild temperature than today!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, also to whatever everyone else said...</p>
<p>Drive down to the Mojave desert in Cali, then drive across the i40 for about a thousand miles...for the most part it's all desert. I think only in certain parts will you find sand dunes and dust storms though.</p>
<p>I think if wars didn't plague the ME and they set up proper irrigation it would be too much different that what we got here at home.</p>
<p>Further south near the i10/i8 will you find the sand dunes and what not.</p>

Then they turn north through the five other -istan nations, continue through the western half of China and finally end in Mongolia. It's a huge arid area that's clearly visible in Google Maps satellite view. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
