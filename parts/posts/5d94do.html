		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aerospace Engineer <em>(emphasis space)</em> here.</p>
<p>The short answer is we have and we haven't</p>
<p>The long answer is in industries that are collaborative with other countries (Medical, space programs, shipping) we HAVE switched over. (Ever hear a US TV medical show go &quot;I need 20 CC's, STAT!&quot; - CC means cubic centimeter, a metric unit).</p>
<p>In other industries that are more insular and only affect the US, we haven't. Civil engineers still use Kips, feet, pound-feet etc., as do car manufacturers (EDIT Apparently they're metric now), bakers, and your everyday carpenter.</p>
<p>They haven't switched for a number of reasons, but I'll explain why I use meters, Newtons etc for work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When doing complex calculations, having everything be multiples of 10 is VERY useful. Making a kilometer into a meter means moving the decimal point 3 to the right, while making a mile into a foot means multiplying by 5280 -- try doing that in your head in 5 seconds. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every paper and textbook in my field is already in SI, so to find a constant or something I need to use in calculations is a breeze in SI but can be a nightmare in Customary.</p>
</li>
<li>Converting to Customary just to convert back to SI can cause errors in measurement that get worse each conversion. It's similar to how you can put a sentence into Google Translate (&quot;I love doing math!&quot;), translate it to a random language--Hindi sounds fun-- then translating it back, only to see your initial input has changed (&quot;I love doing the math&quot;). That is what can happen if you convert too many times.</li>
</ul>
<p>That all being said, this is why I still use customary at home:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Converting is annoying and difficult. Even if everyday use doesn't really care about round off errors, I don't want to have to convert 1 Cup of flour to milliliters every time I'm making a cake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know customary more than metric, and it would take a lot of readjusting to get used to an entirely new system. Imagine being told your country was abandoning its language for a new one-- Swahili seems interesting. How long would it take you to get used to speaking Swahili? Would you EVER be fluent? </p>
</li>
<li>This is the most controversial, but there's no NEED to change. As great as converting by ten is for calculations, most of the time your conversions are very simple or nonexistent (except for the whole pinch-teaspoon-tablespoon-cup-pint thing. ARRRGGGHHH that's more confusing than orbital mechanics). And the smug &quot;Customary units are arbitrary!&quot; people forget that SI is just as arbitrary: some guys in France grabbed a chunk of Platinum and thought 'eh, this is good' and BAM, the kilogram was born.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty late to the party here, but I'll chime in anyhow.  The turning point dates back to the Carter/Reagan divide in the 1980 election.  </p>
<p>About the time that everyone else (including England) were switching from English units to metric, Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter pushed very hard for America to switch as well.   This was moderately successful, and between congressional action and executive order America began to move toward accepting SI standards.  &quot;Metric&quot; measurements were commonly taught in schools, cars had to report km/h as well as mph, and there was a trend toward acceptance of MKS in daily life.  There were large information campaigns with pamphlets, guides to the metric system, television spots, lesson-plan packets in schools -- even school lunchboxes (remember those?) with the metric system outlined on them.  I still remember a few of them from the late 1970s, but you can find TV PSA spots dating to 1973 on YouTube.</p>
<p>Then Ronald Reagan got elected, on a wave of reactionary resentment against the actions Carter was taking with the economy,  Volcker's &quot;bitter pill&quot; of very high interest rates to curb resource shocks, and &quot;stagflation&quot;. But Reagan's campaign was taking no chances, and pulled out all the self-identity stops.  A minor plank in Reagan's platform was to roll back adoption of the metric system, to leverage general grousing and resentment at the changing systems of units into a small additional advantage in the vote.  So in 1981 all motion toward SI for commonplace things in America stopped cold.</p>
<p>That's why, for example, NASA specifies all space hardware in SI units -- but the numbers always turn out to be round numbers in English units rather than in MKS (e.g. the Space Shuttle's dimensions, and the ISS modules' dimensions, are all in round multiples of 25.4mm).</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: SI adoption fell prey to identity politics in the 1980 presidential election.  Ronald Reagan killed it, nobody else picked it up.  And here we are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reading these comments has been interesting. For what it's worth, I have a Canadian perspective on all of this. Our government made the decision to swap years ago and faced heavy opposition for the same reasons the US did during their attempt. People claimed that metric was confusing and cited the costs of swapping road network signage over. The government was firm, though, and a couple generations later we are all &quot;fluent&quot; in metric.</p>
<p>The USA never made this swap, though. We are all huddled against the border trying to stay warm.... Through this proximity, most of us having a working knowledge of imperial as well. This leads to some uniquely Canadian issues: We drive in kilometers per hour, and buy our gas and milk in litres. However, if you ask us our height and weight you will most certainly receive it in feet, inches and pounds. The temperature outside? Probably in Celcius, unless you're from the oldest generation.</p>
<p>Personally, I'd like to think we took the best of both worlds. I might just be telling myself that though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just chiming in to say that Liberia is using both imperial and metric at the same time, but metric has never been made official simply because nobody cares.</p>
<p>The reason for the dual system is that Liberia is still one of the poorest countries on earth, and hence all goods are imported from wherever they can be obtained cheapest.</p>
<p>Now some cars (almost exclusively used ones) are imported from the US, others from Europe, so you'll have gauges in miles and kilometers, as well as fuel indicators in gallons and liters. Same goes for clothes and fabrics - you'll have them in inches and meters. People need to be familiar with both, since the availability varies.</p>
<p>Even some road signs are in km instead of the official miles (distances and speed limits alike), which might be considered as &quot;officially adopted&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't the whole answer, but a part no one else has brought up.</p>
<p>Outside Britain and its colonies, customary units varied from place to place within a modern country. A pound in southeastern France was 18% lighter than a pound in Paris. A Japanese cloth foot was 25% longer than a Japanese construction foot. Measurement differences were easily abused by fraudulent sellers. So changing to the metric system was an opportunity for new regimes to unify a chaotic system of measurement. </p>
<p>England was able to mostly unify its measurement system in the Middle Ages, so it bequeathed a usable system to the modern US. It's not perfect, and there has been some drift between units used when the US broke away and units used when the UK switched to metric. But switching from most countries' patchwork of local customary units in 1850 to a unified English system would be a bigger improvement than switching from a unified English system to a unified metric system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
