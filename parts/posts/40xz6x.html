		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those are the trails from sounding rockets fired from the ground near the blast, nothing to do with the nuclear blast itself. By launching those rockets shortly before the blast, the initially vertical smoke trails will be deformed by the shock front of the explosion which gives visual evidence of the fluid motion going on around the explosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the very beginning of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpTNdyHtr_s&amp;index=21&amp;list=FLSHrrkL_SNvEj5psT6Xi5JA" target="_blank">this</a> video, you can see the rockets launch on the left.  They leave smoke trails which display how the wavefront moves through the invisible atmosphere.  I believe this is a Mk3 type weapon, or around 21ks, like Nagasaki.  In 1953, it's the most likely candidate, an unboosted fission weapon based on effects, not bomb optimization, though there are several websites including Wiki which would indicate exactly what it is.  </p>
<p>If you spend a bit of time watching/listening to this video, you get an idea of the power of the weapon.  Of note: </p>
<p>The deformation of the smoke trails.<br />
Sound delay (distance).<br />
Nearly black lens filter.<br />
Exclamations of servicemen, used to loud noises, present.  I think you get &quot;Holy shit!&quot; twice.
Obviously muffled microphone.<br />
Chilling EMI on the audio track.  (probably in the amplifier circuit of the recorder).<br />
Sharp, high-pitched blast (high energy, not a low roar, muffled/broad wavefront).<br />
The actual low roar after detonation, which is nothing more than all of that air being jetted upwards by the intense heat and fluid action of the blast.  These things just create a column of rising air which rises so fast and turbulently that a huge roar is produced.  </p>
<p>This is one of he least visually appealing and most informative videos I know about nuclear weapons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
