		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, any color screen could be used. However, there are a number of reasons why green is preferable over other colors.</p>
<p>First is the nature of the subjects in front of the screen. In most scenes with a green screen (or the more technical term: chroma keying), humans are the main subjects in the scene. Humans tend to have very little green in their skin or their clothing, which makes it easier to replace the background without accidentally replacing part of the subject.</p>
<p>Another reason is more technical in nature. Digital sensors don't record R, G and B with the same level of detail. This is by design. A pixel in a digital sensor can only capture the total light intensity. In order to capture color detail, each pixel is fitted with a filter that only lets a certain color through. So you'll have red pixels, green pixels and blue pixels. A full color image, where every pixel can have a full range of colors, is reconstructed using this limited information. Since human vision is more sensitive to green than to other colors, the commonly used approach is to divide the sensor into blocks of 2x2 pixels and giving 2 of them a green filter, and the other 2 are used for red and blue. This is called a Bayer filter.</p>
<p>Because of this, the raw image data contains more green information than red or blue. That means that green features will have a higher resolution. Since the quality of chroma keying is very much affected by how accurate you can record the edge between the foreground subjects and the background screen, the increased resolution of the green channel allows for more accurate cutouts of the background.</p>
<p>Note that in the time of analog film, blue screens were more common, since the chemical properties of analog film resulted in a higher level of detail (reduced grain) for blue elements. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I just wanted to add a link to a recent Captain Disillusion episode that talked about this exact subject. I've included the timestamp for that particular topic, but really you should watch the whole thing as it's very informative while being entertaining.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The green screen needs to be as different as possible from the human skin color for best results. Human skin is orange, which is a combination of yellow and red. So yellow and red would be bad choices, as the computer would not just remove the background, but also the similarly colored humans.</p>
<p>Purple is a combination of blue and red, so again, there a common color with the human skin tone (red).</p>
<p>That leaves green and blue, none of which can be found in human skin. Both are used in special effects but green is used more often.</p>
<p>Digital camera sensors record more detail in greens than in blues, as there are twice as many green photocites than blue or red. Therefore, you get a more detailed background removal if you use green. But when characters have to be wearing green clothes for example, you can use blue.</p>
<p>You could use any color really, as long as its color is very different from your subject, but when given the choice, green works slightly better than other colors due to how sensors are built.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The technigue is called &quot;Color/Chroma Keying&quot; and removes a background of a solid, high-contrast color.</p>
<p>Any High-contrast color can be used, Red, Green, Blue (You can get Blue screens).</p>
<p>Green is highly used because:</p>
<p>1 - Green is a very rare color in clothing, making it easy to only remove the background.</p>
<p>2 - Cameras can capture pure green in a higher resolution then any other colors or combined colors.</p>
<p>3 - It is the standard color along with blue.</p>
<p>Color keying is a process in video editing where a specific color can be removed and made transparent so the background (behind the video) is visible, any image or video can be placed in the background.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not going to top all the good info that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8lj266/why_is_green_always_used_in_special_effects_like/dzfwih7/" target="_blank">Rannasha posted</a>, but I will say that just because you've never seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Green screens are the go-to for SFX, but any color can be used. Blue screens used to be pretty common with television.</p>
<p>There's no color that can't be used. There are just colors that are easier to work with and have more benefits over using.</p>
<p>You asked &quot;Why not yellow, or purple, or red&quot;. I know for a fact that yellow and purple (fuschia) screens have been used in the past. I don't personally know of any red screening, but I can guarantee it's been used at more than once.</p>
<p>Great wikipedia article explaining backgrounds in chroma keying:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Background color</h3>
<p>Blue was originally used for TV chroma keying special effects because human skin tone contains very little blue, and because the film industry used blue backgrounds for similar purposes. The color blue was tied to the blue emulsion layer of film having comparable grain and detail in comparison to the red and green layers of the emulsion. In television and digital filmmaking, however, green has become the favored color because of some practical considerations, and because lossy compression algorithms used in both analog and digital TV distribution retain more detail in the green channel. The choice of color is up to the effects artists and the needs of the specific shot. Whereas the blue screen was introduced to the television industry by the film industry, the use of green screen visual effects has been introduced to the film industry as electronic imaging has augmented and replaced the use of chemical film stock in cinema. Also, the green background is favored over blue for outdoor filming where the blue sky might appear in the frame and could accidentally be replaced in the process. Although green and blue are the most common in part because red, green and blue components are used to encode the visible light spectrum, any key color can be used. Red is avoided for human subjects due to its prevalence in white skin tones, but can be often used for objects and scenes which do not involve people.</p>
<p>So-called &quot;yellow screen&quot; is accomplished with a white backdrop. Ordinary stage lighting is used in combination with a bright yellow sodium lamp. The sodium light falls almost entirely in a narrow frequency band, which can then be separated from the other light using a prism, and projected onto a separate but synchronized film carrier within the camera. This second film is high-contrast black and white, and is processed to produce the matte.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a magenta background is used, as in some software applications where the magenta or fuchsia is sometimes referred to as &quot;magic pink&quot;.</p>

<p>TL:DR - Any color can be used but green has a lot of benefits that make it the first choice for chroma keying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
