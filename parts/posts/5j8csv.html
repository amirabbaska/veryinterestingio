		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people have to pay in more than their claims, so that people who have big claims can get paid.</p>
<p>People get confused about this, and think that insurance should reduce their day to day costs.  It doesn't work like that.</p>
<p>You pay car insurance, and you hope you have no claims.  With health insurance, you have some claims anyway, so you have to pay even more in premiums. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you're referring to.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They won't cover it at all? Perhaps the procedure is &quot;experimental&quot; or the doctor/hospital is &quot;out of network.&quot; This would be explained in the denial letter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deductibles? You have to spend $X amount before they start coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Co-pay? You pay Y% and they pay Z%.</p>
</li>
<li>Are you being purposely vague? You may be a perfectly healthy human being who only has one procedure done once every 5 years. However, there are many people out there who would spend more money on medical care than insurance (if they weren't covered). My husband, for example, has chronic back pain. He's only in his 30s and has received several steroid injections, 2 surgeries, monthly prescriptions, MRIs, and CAT scans. Trust me when I say we are very thankful we have a decent insurance program. It's only because both healthy and unhealthy people subscribe to insurance does the system work. I'm sure you could say the same about your car insurance too. We haven't had tickets or a wreck in a very long time, yet we still pay our insurance twice a year.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it as an agreement.  The insurance company has said they will pay for 100 people to get their healthcare covered, at a certain level of baseline risk.  For every 100 people in a certain range of ages, you can expect 2 to die in horrible accidents, 10 to get cancer, 10 to get heart attacks, and 20 to have medical needs.  This means that they will expect to pay $100,000 dollars for the 100 people.  This money comes from the other people who are not sick.</p>
<p>They usually &quot;refuse to cover&quot; if they believe that the group of people covered are not &quot;usual&quot;.  For example, lets say that after you sign up, one of the persons says &quot;Oh yeah I have cancer too, I just forgot to tell you&quot;.  The insurance company sees this as a &quot;preexisting condition&quot; and never factored you into the equation to understand your risk...in fact they thought you would be well.  Now the insurance company has to pay $200,000 because one person forgot to mention they have a condition that would be high cost. </p>
<p>Overall, the idea is cover costs for those who are at an understood risk in a population, using money from the total pile of folks, many of whom will not be sick.  However this agreement is based on understanding how sick you are vs how much money you spend in healthcare and making sure your premiums match in a way that a) you still want to pay for it b) they make money to cover their costs and to make money for shareholders c) they dont get sued</p>
<p>Usually when a doctor and an insurance company argue over if something should be covered, they refer to the contract they signed.  Very often it will have the limits and conditions agreed upon.  If there is further argument, the insurance company doctor and the treatment doctor will hash it out on the phone.  The insurance company doctor is paid oftentimes based on overall savings to the insurance plan, so there is a lean towards refusing to cover things &quot;outside the normal&quot; or &quot;experimental&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Experimental&quot; is another term for &quot;not covered by the FDA for that indication&quot;.  So if the FDA says marijuana is not FDA regulated to treat seizures, you are likely not going to get your insurance company to pay for it.  Even if it helps, and is the only drug that works, etc.  Many procedures and medications are like this...BUT...your employer or whomever is giving you the insurance also signed on the contract that they agreed to those terms.</p>
<p>If you cover pre-existing conditions, your costs are going to be higher, thus you need to spread that cost around a larger number of people.  If you refuse to get insurance?  Well thats the individual mandate Obamacare imposes to get that money anyway.  Get rid of the individual mandate and the insurance companies have no way to cover the cost of providing care AND making money while doing it.</p>
<p>So, in summary, its an agreement to cover a group of people.  Someone is getting more care than they pay in premiums, but many many more are getting little to no care at whatever premium to make up the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insurance isn't based on you, it's based on us. </p>
<p>ELI5 Example: Go grab a die. Imagine what ever you roll on the die is how much you'll spend in medical expenses each year. You rolled a 5, so you spend $5. If you have 30 of your friends do this each with their own die, you'll get quite the range of answers ($1-$6). However insurance is the idea that no matter what, everyone will pay the 'average' of $3.5 a year to the company and the company will cover the costs. So you rolled $5 thus you made money! However your friends rolling a $1 lost money. That's how insurance is priced. In this example the die is only coverage for 6 different procedures. </p>
<p>Lets say you go off and get your D-20 die and you roll a $2. You cost less than the $3.5 you paid in, so the insurance company should be happy right? Nope, because if they cover you rolling the D-20 die, they have to cover everyone rolling a D-20. Now they have to pay out an average of $10.5 to everyone while only receiving $3.5. Not very feasible, unless they raise prices.</p>
<p>Insurance is never ever EVER about the individual, it only works and makes sense when looking it as a group. </p>
<p>Also remember being for-profit as well as employee costs and such has to also be added to how much you pay to the company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
