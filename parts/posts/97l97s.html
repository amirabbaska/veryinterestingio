		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The big bang happened <em>everywhere</em>, right where you're sitting now included. The universe doesn't have a center; instead, <em>everywhere</em> is equally the center. When we talk about the universe expanding, what we mean is that <em>space itself</em> is expanding, not that the universe is expanding into something or away from a center point.</p>
<p>This is a difficult point to grasp, but it helps if you remember that the universe may well be infinite - it's only the <em>observable</em> universe that's finite, and that's because of two things: 1) light takes time to travel and 2) the universe hasn't always existed. There's more universe further out, ad infinitum, but the light from those parts hasn't had time to reach us yet. The stuff inside the universe is being carried away from the other stuff inside the universe as space itself expands, like a baking cake carrying raisins inside further away from other raisins as it rises. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You would think that if you took into account the motions of all the galaxies that you'd be able to calculate a &quot;center.&quot; Say, for example, you had a small explosive surrounded by glitter. If you set the explosive off and tracked all the glitter, you could calculate where the explosion was. That's NOT how the universe is.</p>
<p>See, EVERYTHING in the universe is moving away from EVERYTHING ELSE, pretty much equally. There is no &quot;direction&quot; that things are moving away... to. It's very hard to visualize. </p>
<p>I'll do my best to come up with a visualization.</p>
<p>Imagine you're in a kids ball pit. That ball pit is infinitely wide and deep, it has no sides. Suddenly, all of the balls grow. (While you do not.) It's clear that the center of the balls are getting further from each other, but there is no &quot;direction&quot; in which the balls are expanding. They're only getting bigger. At the beginning, you could reach maybe a few hundred balls with outstretched arms, but as they grew, you could only reach 100, then 50, then 10, and eventually you could only reach one or 2 balls with outstretched arms. That's kinda like what the universe is doing. Everything is &quot;growing&quot; (expanding) and getting further away from everything else. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically, there is no singular &quot;Center of the universe&quot; in the sense of a physical location that is different from all others. As I understand it, one can pick ANY point in space at random, and then &quot;wind back time&quot; to the point of the Big Bang, some 15 billion years ago, (Very rough number, likely off by at least a factor of 2,) and you will reach a singularity. In far less fancy talk, pick any spot at random in the universe, and reverse time until you get a singularity. Works for literally any spot in the universe. Its all dependent on the location of the &quot;observer.&quot; </p>
<p>However, that also means that every observer is the center of its own universe. I kinda like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much like Madge in the old Palmolive commercials, &quot;You're soaking in it.&quot; The Bing Bang happened everywhere at once. The is no privileged position in the current physics models, and they are models with great descriptive power. The usual visual example is the Universe as raisin loaf. I always been curious about universal fields and their relationship to space. It really blew my mind when the idea of a universal electrical field was explained to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
