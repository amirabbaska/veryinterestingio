		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because Kubrick did a really good job.  He relied on effects that could be done well given the technology, and left out ones that couldn't.  If you were to try and make the same exact movie today, without adding any more effects or content, there's not many parts that could be done much better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think everyone is missing the point slightly, it’s not just the director’s style or the quality of thee special effects, it’s also the color and sound quality of the movie itself.   Music and movies from the 60s usually have a distinctive sound due to the quality of the microphones but 2001 doesn’t share that.   Can anyone explain what I’m referring to because I think that’s a big part of the answer to the main question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The miniature effects for the space craft are all very slow, which gives them weight and believability. These effects were ground breaking and it wasn’t until Star Wars 8 years later that broke new ground in the addition of speed and action, that subsequently made visual effects much more accessible. You may like the look and feel of Silent Running (1972) as well, the effects are great for the time.</p>
<p>That said I think it looks like a 60’s movie because of the fashions within from dress to hair. Also a lot of the occupations are stereotypical for the decade. For example the service industry jobs within from waiters to air hosts are all female. All of the executive and scientific roles are male. </p>
<p>That’s not a slight on it all, I love the movie and expect to see cultural trends from the period it was made in.</p>
<p>There is also no electronic/synthesized music, which was very popular for 90’s sci-fi. The orchestral soundtrack for sci-fi is mostly only seen in pre synth times and Star Wars movies as Lucas rightly prefers John Williams’ approach to action.</p>
<p>I could ramble on about this all day, as it’s such a good cinematic experience, but I’ll stop here. Great question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The New Yorker answered almost exactly this question in an article a few weeks ago:</p>
<p>“By rendering a not-too-distant future, Kubrick set himself up for a test: thirty-three years later, his audiences would still be around to grade his predictions. Part of his genius was that he understood how to rig the results. Many elements from his set designs were contributions from major brands—Whirlpool, Macy’s, DuPont, Parker Pens, Nikon—which quickly cashed in on their big-screen exposure. If 2001 the year looked like ‘2001’ the movie, it was partly because the film’s imaginary design trends were made real.”</p>
