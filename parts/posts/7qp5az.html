		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the neuromuscular junction between motor neurons and muscle tissue, the motor neurons release a chemical called acetylcholine which triggers the muscle tissue to contract. When the motor neuron is damaged or recieves abnormal signals (e.g. from a nerve being pinched) it releases more acetylcholine than usual which causes the muscle cells near the junction to clench without releasing, forming a contraction knot known as a trigger point. A cluster of these contractions is called a trigger point complex and forms what we think of as a muscle knot.</p>
<p>Here's a fascinating video explaining this from the perspective of treating trigger points with dry needling:</p>

<p>edit: here's a paper that nicely summarizes the topic and goes into detail about the concept of different kinds of &quot;locus&quot; within the trigger point complex that correlate to symptoms of tenderness:</p>
