		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you have an example? Earthen dams are usually designed with a remote spillway at an elevation lower than the top of the dam so that it never gets topped. </p>
<p>Most concrete dams have spillways built into the top of the dam such that the water is shed in a controlled manner to dissipate the surging water quickly such that the height never exceeds its design limits. </p>
<p>That said, all dams can be bested by nature. They can't be designed for every plausible century flood scenario. All are built on some compromise between being capable of flooding the surrounding headwater lake areas and the rivers below once the reservoir capacity is reached. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When looking at the failure of dams we tend to describe the failure according to what we call the 'root cause'. For example; if you were driving a car on an icy road around a sharp corner and slid off the road  and hit a tree, a 'root cause' investigation would ask and answer the following questions; What was the damage? Car hit tree. How did car hit tree? Car drove off road. How did car drive off road? Sharp turn. Other preceding factors? Icy Road. Was he speeding? No.</p>
<p>We see from this that there are a number of 'causes' for why the car hit the tree. The root cause however is that the road was icy and the car lost traction whilst not speeding. We might look at redesigning the road to cater for icy conditions and stop future accidents.</p>
<p>There are a number of fancy named root causes of dam failures including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNFQ1EJX4h0" target="_blank">Slumping</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC58mGG55io" target="_blank">Piping</a>, amongst others. </p>
<p>For your specific question regarding the sudden collapse after '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VRGTkCv3sU" target="_blank">overtopping</a>' of an earthen dam (overtopping would be seen to be the 'root cause'), the answer is quite simply <a href="https://youtu.be/tkOBmiyTfEQ?t=8m48s" target="_blank">EROSION</a>. Water erosion is a very destructive force for any earthen structure. Water is seen as the the great leveler of engineers and engineering designs. Flowing water will make short work of any earth structure. If the water does not erode the top of the dam it erodes the sides, abutments, downstream face, downstream toe...anything not protected and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmKLxoAPU1c" target="_blank">makes short work of it</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just to further clear up my respsone; </p>
<p>The failure of dams can seem spectacular when the final stages of failure are happening. The amount of water/material pouring through the breach could be seen as an exponential-type increase. I don't have data to prove this and in reality there would be far too many variables to generalise it, but the crux of the matter is erosion = more room for water to flow. More flowing water = more erosion = more space = more erosion = spectacular failure.</p>
<p>The failure event often starts days - or weeks - before this final failure stage. People just don't notice it unless they are actively inspecting the dams for increasing seepage, potential piping, slumping or wet spots etc every day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For concrete dams, it's because the water erodes the river bed beneath the dam, or erodes the walls to which the dam is attached.  Spillways on concrete dams are designed to move the water away from the base of the dam to avoid this.</p>
<p>Earthen dams have a different issue, but it includes erosion as a component.  The video provided by /u/lockd0wn shows that seepage of water penetrating the earthen dam can turn it into mud, greatly reducing its strength and causing it to slump.  Once slumped, the water pouring over the top quickly erodes a channel with releases more of the water, creating a higher velocity stream, which increases erosion.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While water seems pretty benign when it comes out of the tap, it is really pretty powerful. It's heavy, it can fit through small spaces, and it can pick up and carry things with it. Even trying to stop the flow out of a hose with your hand can be challenging. A dam has to hold back an entire river. </p>
<p>With dams you basically have a very thick and very heavy wall wedged into, or built into, the river bed. Usually that material is either concrete or earth, but dams can be made of things like wood too. Regardless, that requires an incredible amount of material so dams are engineered to be able to hold only the load they need, generally what the worst possible flooding will cause, plus a good safety margin. However, sometimes they get that wrong and you have flooding that is much worse than predicted or you have something that damages the structure of the dam itself. </p>
<p>One way that can happen is that rapidly moving flood waters can erode the earth the dam is built into. That earth helps the dam hold back the water and holds the dam in place. As it is eroded away the dam gets weaker. Or if the dam is made of earth, it can erode the dam itself. Once water starts to move through, it rapidly accelerates the erosion which in turn causes more and more water to flow through. </p>
<p>Engineers are pretty good at building dams these days and the safety margins are quite large so catastrophic dam failures are very rare. Usually it only happens with smaller poorly built dams. What happens more frequently is that the water overflows or finds a path around the dam. Since dams generally reduce the flow of the river below them, those places have often adapted to a lower and more stable flow of water. So when the dam is overrun or bypassed you can have severe flooding. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Among the other good responses, I would like to add that there are several ways for water to become ore erosive. Get more speed, get more volume, or having more sediment. </p>
<p>This creates what is know as a positive feedback back cycle: water starts eroding the dam, that adds more water flowing over the dam. More water means more erosion. Eroding a channel in the dam makes the water flow faster. Faster water means more erosion. Faster water also picks up more sediment. When water is moving more sediment it becomes even more erosive. This is know as scour.</p>
<p>Imagine putting your hand under a faucet. Now imagine the same faucet with sand mixed into the water. The Sandy water will wear away your skin a lot faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
