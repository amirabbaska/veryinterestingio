<p>EDIT: I did mean RADIUS not diameter in the title</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Also meant the universe is 13.8 billion years old not 13.8 billion light years.
But hey, you guys got what I meant. Thanks for all the answers. My mind is thoroughly blown</p>
<p>EDIT 3: </p>
<p>A) My most popular post! Thanks!</p>
<p>B) I don't understand the universe</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone talks about space expanding, but nobody really elaborates on what that means.  Why would space be expanding?</p>
<p>Here's another perspective.  What exactly is space?  You're treating space as though it's some kind of grid, fixed, where a meter is a meter. Where space is some static construct measured by a giant clock ticking in space.</p>
<p>But relativity don't work like that.  A photon for instance doesn't really know time.  If you could ask a photon that was generated at the big bang and had been flying away since then how long it had been traveling, it would just say &quot;I dunno, an instant maybe?&quot;  The closer you get to the speed of light, the less time that passes, (for you, relative to someone that things you're getting close to the speed of light).</p>
<p>So then, again, what is space? Well, we say that a light second is a measurement of distance, and that is how far light will travel in a second.  So you look from earth at a distance of a light second by measuring how far light travels in what looks like a second to you, and you see it's about 299,000 km.  But if you were moving at a relativistic velocity now that distance that is traveled that appears to be a second is going to be different from what Earth sees.  It's going to look shorter for you because a second is different.  In the same vein, if the Earth were to make the same measurement, to you, the distance is going to look shorter because the Earth's second is faster than yours, just like your second is faster than the Earth's as far as they're concerned. </p>
<p>So then again, what is space?  If you asked a photon how far it could travel in a second, it would just say &quot;I dunno, infinite maybe?&quot;</p>
<p>So how do you measure distance? Well, we measure distance because we're in a relatively static inertial frame, and most of the stuff that we think and care about isn't really moving at relativistic speeds.  When we measure a meter, we do it based on the distance that light can travel in a specific fraction of a second relative to a rest frame.  So on the Earth which is pretty much at rest, it stays pretty consistent. </p>
<p>So we use a thing called proper length to kind of determine the length of things in different rest frames.   So from Earth, the distance of something that is traveling at a relativistic velocity looks shorter. So from our perspective we see something that's 1km on our earth, and something that's 200m in space.  But if we look at the proper length, maybe that is 1km too in its rest frame.  So the question is, are those two things combined really 1.2km or 2km?  Well, they're kind of 2km, but only really when they're in the same rest frame because again, what is distance? </p>
<p>So then say that is the case, and the 200m thing traveling really close to light speed is actually 2km, and it is apparantly 100km away from earth, how far away is it really?  Now you're not just talking about objects that might have a rest frame, you're talking about a distance that spans two objects which each have different rest frames but doesn't contain any stuff in it at all.  And we have ways of representing those distances too, but it gets complicated with &quot;buts&quot; and &quot;as long as&quot;s. </p>
<p>But the short of it is, distance is hard to measure, because distance is dependent on time, and time is relative.  So what is 13.8 billion years for us is a different amount of time for something traveling a different speed, because essentially the more the difference in speeds between things, the more space kind of expands, or squashes depending on how you look at it.</p>
<p>If something was traveling really fast it would be compressed, and I don't just really mean it would look compressed from some doppler shift, I mean, it would be compressed from your perspective.  But that it's actually based on your measurement of distance because of your measurement of time, it's shorter. </p>
<p>Space is a tricky thing because of general relativity.   Space doesn't just expand like a balloon for no reason.  It's that because things are moving relative to one another, and because of effects on spacetime from things like acceleration due to gravity and all this other funny stuff.  Time is different for everything that is moving relative to everything else, even if just a tiny bit, and because of that space is a bit different.  To something that thinks they're standing still, everything else in the universe that is moving relative to them is smaller than it is to themselves.  If material were moving at very near light speed for 13.8 billion years, two things would happen, first of all, the stuff moving that fast wouldn't think 13.8 billion years had passed, to them it would be less.  The second thing would be to us it would look a lot smaller than it would look like to itself. </p>
<p>Then asking a question like how big is the universe is a bit weird.  But we can say that if things are accelerating away from eachother, the universe is getting bigger, not just because of their acceleration, but because they are accelerating to a different frame, it now means they experience time differently, which means that space is defined a bit differently for them, and it's a bit larger for them than we perceive it.  So space is expanding. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matter isn't flying apart; space itself is expanding. So the speed of light doesn't come into it.</p>
<p>Think of it like a couple of ants an inch or so apart on the surface of a balloon. Even if they crawl apart, they can only each move at the speed of Ant. But if you blow up the balloon itself really fast, even if they don't move they can still end up way more apart than an inch (and quite probably much further than they could have gone at the speed of Ant in the same amount of time). And each one will think that the other is moving away very fast.  (Only they won't, because they're ants. And provided the balloon doesn't burst. But you get the idea.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1)  The universe did not start at a single point and expand out in a ball from that point.  The universe started with very high density and space expanded out from every point of space simultaneously.  If the universe is infinite now, then it was always infinite.</p>
<p>2) The universe can and does expand at a rate faster than light.  Objects within space cannot move within space faster than light, but space itself can expand faster than light making objects move away from each other at a right faster than light.  Most of the universe is, at this time, moving away from us at a rate faster than light.</p>
<p>3) It is speculated that there was a period of &quot;inflation&quot; in the early universe in which the universe expanded exponentially:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the brief period of 10^-34  that inflation lasts in this model, the
horizon size is boosted exponentially from submicroscopic scales to nearly
a parsec. At the end of the inflationary epoch, the horizon size reverts to
growing at a sedate linear rate.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matter is not in motion (in a cosmic sense.) The galaxies and superclusters and the rest of the stuff out there is sitting around basically at rest with respect to the rest of the universe and space is being created (or otherwise coming into existence) between the stuff.</p>
<p>The other dude's balloon analogy works perfectly. Just remember the ants are not moving. They are chilling on the surface and the balloon is expanding around them. They have no say in the expansion of the balloon. The actions and behaviors have no effect on that balloon.</p>
<p>Thus, though the distance between the ants is increasing, the ants <strong>HAVE NO MOMENTUM</strong> relative to each other based on their frame of reference because they do not see the balloon. From the perspective of the ants, they are not in motion.</p>
<p>Likewise, this universe is expanding but nothing is in motion. The distances are constantly increasing between us and everything else (outside our supercluster or whatever) but those changes in distance are not caused by motion (in any of the three spatial dimensions or time). The laws of motion simply do not apply to the expansion of the universe because the motion is happening outside the universe (perpendicular to the 3D surface).</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why physicists think that any of the forces can impact the expansion. If none of the 4 forces can cause objects to move in a fourth spatial dimension (direction) then it stands to reason there is a 5th force operating on the universe from outside. This seems quite obvious to me since if one postulates a fourth spatial dimension all kinds of implications hit the fan that string theorists simply weren't aware of.</p>
<p>If that last paragraph made you grumpy please just focus on the rest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
