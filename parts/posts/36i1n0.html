<p>EDIT: I did mean RADIUS not diameter in the title</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Also meant the universe is 13.8 billion years old not 13.8 billion light years.
But hey, you guys got what I meant. Thanks for all the answers. My mind is thoroughly blown</p>

<p>A) My most popular post! Thanks!</p>
<p>B) I don't understand the universe</p></div></div>
