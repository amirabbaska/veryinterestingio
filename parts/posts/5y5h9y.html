		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is a reasonably common phenomenon.  One common way it can happen is when species are strung out over a large geographic area, but the population doesn't mix frequently.  Individuals breed with their neighbors, but not with more distant populations.  When the gradient is smooth, it's called a cline.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology</a>)</p>
<p>But you don't need a cline to get the pattern you mention.  Sometimes it's simply distinct species that can hybridize in certain ways but not others.</p>
<p>When these &quot;species&quot; stretch out around a geographic barrier and meet on the other side, two adjacent populations may be unable to breed directly.  This phenomenon is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species" target="_blank">ring species</a></p>
<p>Really I think it's kind of remarkable that species sort out as well as they do (at least for certain branches of life). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although the other answer given is a neat example of speciation the layman might not know about, there's actually something that exactly matches the situation you've described. They're called ring species, it's somewhat similar to a cline. However, both ends of the spectrum are unable to breed and in order to fit the ring species definition those populations are close enough that hybridization should be geographically possible.</p>
