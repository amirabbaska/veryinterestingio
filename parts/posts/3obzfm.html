		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Making zero-calorie drinks is easy for one major reason, namely that they are based on water. As one may expect drinking water doesn't result in any caloric intake. In fact, cold water is actually a negative-calorie drink since the body needs to expend energy to raise the temperature of the water to the equilibrium temperature of the body. Moreover it's possible to add certain additives like caffeine, or zero-calorie artificial sweeteners like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucralose" target="_blank">sucralose</a> while still allowing the drink to remain effectively calorie-neutral.</p>
<p>With solid food the situation is a bit different. Most of the things we like to eat (and which are healthy for us to eat) result in a finite intake of energy. This should not be surprising since the kinds of things are bodies are designed to eat are generally foodstuffs from which we can draw energy since the major point of eating is to replenish the body's energy reserves. It is true that the body also needs to expand energy to digest food, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_dynamic_action" target="_blank">thermal effect of food</a> (TEF), which reduces how much energy we gain from eating a quantity of a given food. However the TEF is usually fairly low, averaging about 10% or so, so in most cases it doesn't really come close to cancelling out the total number of calories in the food. </p>
<p>Having said that, there are foods that result in a very, very small caloric intake. The trick is to choose foods that have both a low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_energy#Energy_density_of_food" target="_blank">energy density</a> (kcals/Calories per g of food) as well as a high TEF. One of the best examples in this sense is celery, where each stalk only has <a href="http://www.caloriecount.com/calories-celery-i11143?size=4%2520%2520celery%2520stalk" target="_blank">about 10 kcals</a> with a TEF of 20%, so you end up gaining 10 - 10*0.2 = 8 kcals/Calories. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A soda is a very simple thing.  </p>
<p>Ingredients for a soda (basically)</p>
<ol>
<li>Water (no calories)</li>
<li>CO2 (no calories)</li>
<li>Sugar (calories be here)</li>
<li>Flavoring (Optional, and usually neglibile calories)</li>
</ol>
<p>So you only really need to replace on thing: sugar with fake sugar, and voila, you have a calorie-free drink.</p>
<p>Now, try making a list of all the ingredients in your typical solid food, and then try making calorie-free substitutes for all of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
