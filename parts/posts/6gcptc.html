		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it helps any, the handwriting is a typeface at this point.</p>
<p>And it is difficult to learn to stay inside a certain art style's rules, but once you learn the rules, it's easy to make them bend and contort into your own style. </p>
<p>So it's a lot of practice and using a computer to include the text. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading that the art style to depic a satire of a figure of power started in the french revolution (or was in the industrial? It was one revolution, that I'm certain). And that sort of style, exaggerating the person face and body, as well as framing them in a white background is something globally done to parody politicians or political ideas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the style. Like manga, you can learn it. The style is quite dated and sketchy, and not terribly artistic. I'm sure it has a historical reason to be like this, almost like graffiti.</p>
<p>And also, most political cartoonists are older men who use pen and ink.</p>
<p>You can tell girl handwriting, you can tell old man handwriting. It's a product of the time, medium, and style they feel comfortable doing.</p>
<p>I notice this in a few mediums also. I work in architecture and all the hand drawers have the same scratchy old man handwriting and pen drawing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean to be argumentative, but I just canâ€™t accept the premise of your question. </p>
<p>The best artists have completely different techniques, and could never be confused with one another.</p>
<p>Herblock (RIP) could never be mistaken for Oliphant, who could never be mistaken for Danziger, who is nothing like Tom Tomorrow.</p>
<p>How can you ask this question in the first place? (Not trying to give you a hard time, but man! Could you confuse Picasso with DaVinci?) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
