		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You complex password isn't just for breaches. A couple of years back a ton of naked pictures of celebreties was stolen off of iCloud, this hack was done because of social engineering (figuring out their login) and weak passwords (using brute force to gain access).</p>
<p>If your password is a word or simple, it will take fewer guesses. If a hacker knows your login and wants to get <em>your</em> password, they will usually start with a dictionary attack (lists of common word and combinations); by requiring your password to be at least 8 characters with numbers, the amount of guesses needed goes way way up - if you have 4 characters and numbers it's 4^37, if you have 8 it's 8^37 (not counting symbols etc), that's hours vs. billions of years of computing. </p>
<p>Now when a breach happens, complex passwords are still your friend <em>if</em> the website did their homework. <em>A lot</em> of people use the same username and password on all their accounts; facebook, linkedin, twitter, pornhub etc. and this is where complexity starts to matter. They now have most of your credentials, they know what email you sign in with and they know the hash of your password for <em>this</em> website. Now most website worth their salt will have a custom way of salting their passwords, however the hacker just gained access to everything, which probably includes the source code for the login, they can now start to figure out your password, which probably gains login to everything. If your password is complex and the salt is correctly made, it will still take billions of years to brute force the hash.</p>
<p>So the reason why they require you to make it complex is for your own good. We <em>know</em> our websites are susceptible to attacks, it's simply impossible to make anything hacker proof, short of disconnecting it from the internet, turn it off and bury it in 10 ft. of concrete in the Mariana Trench. You <em>have</em> to assume that you have a data leak at some point, having good policies for password and other sensitive data will mitigate the fallout.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people hack sites for passwords, they usually get a list of the hashed passwords. That means when you put in your password, the site can check if it's the same password you signed up with but it doesn't know what the password is. It's like a one-way secret message.</p>
<p>The way hackers figure out passwords is they know common hashing techniques and they guess common passwords using those techniques. Since &quot;password123&quot; is a common password, they'll put that in the hash, see what comes out, and match that output to the stolen list of hashed passwords they got. If they can't guess your password to input, then they won't be able to know what it is.</p>
<p>Complex passwords make it harder to guess the hashed passwords once they're stolen. The biggest factors for making a password hard to guess are the total numbers of characters you can use and the length. So forcing you to have three special characters and two capitals and a number doesn't really help, but allowing you to use any character and requiring your password to be long does help. In other words, &quot;a%6L7&quot; looks like a more securepassword than&quot;!XthisismypasswordforthissiteX!&quot;, but the latter is actually more secure since it's longer and can possibly use just as many symbols. Longer passwords are harder to guess because the possible combinations of guesses increase quickly as you add additional characters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most account breaches come from guessing, you just never hear about them because they often go unnoticed. Think of a snoopy family member or &quot;friend&quot; trying to see what you've been up to. If you use an uncomplicated password, they can probably guess it, and they'll probably never tell you they logged into your account without permission.</p>
<p>Also, dictionary attacks on websites that don't have password restrictions can also fly under the radar unless the website publicly discloses that accounts were compromised. Which isn't likely; if they don't give a fuck about your password strength, they probably don't give a fuck about who is using your account.</p>
<p>Finally, there are many security reasons for password restrictions. Passwords are often stored as hashes which, if stolen, can be brute forced if the attacker knows how the hashes are generated. The more complicated the password, the longer it takes to brute force it. A good password with special characters can take a single computer upwards of billions of years to brute force, whereas bad passwords with only lower case letters can be forced in milliseconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
