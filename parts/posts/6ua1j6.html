		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the size of the lab?</p>
<p>But for a &quot;classical&quot; nuclear explosion to occour you need a &quot;critical mass&quot;.</p>
<p>This the minimum mass of nuclear material that can go critical (explode). Assuming you're not using any special technology to encourage criticality other than high explosives like in a classical nuclear bomb; then no you can not create a &quot;lab&quot; sized nuclear explosion unless you count something like the Nevada testing Fields as a lab.</p>
<p>However most nuclear physics and experiments even those related to nuclear bombs do not require a full explosion for testing. You can test aspects in reactors, Lazer ignition facilities, and simulators with out the boom</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The National ignition Facility (at Lawrence Livermore Lab) does just this:</p>
<p>They fire multiple extremely high power lasers from all sides at a very small pellet of deuterium/hydrogen and induce very short-lived nuclear fusion and can monitor things such as resulting neutron flux, etc to see the resulting energy output, duration , etc.</p>
<p>However you mean something that is exactly like a modern fusion or even old style purely fission bomb, but miniaturized,  then what others have stated in this thread is accurate: you need a minimum critical mass and &quot;lab&quot; analysis is not repeatable because the lab will be destroyed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. The closest thing would be fusion experiments on NIF which attempt to scale down an explosions using very powerful lasers and crush a small pellet. These have been important since the test ban as they let scientists understand the physics without testing a full bomb. They are far from lab-sized however. Laser Megajoule in France and Orion in the U.K. serve similar purposes. </p>
<p>The closest fission experiment we can do would be a pulsed reactor, whereby a special uranium reactor is designed to go critical very briefly creating a strong neutron pulse. Otto Frisch did these original experiments in Los Alamos in the 40s where it was called 'tickling the dragons tail'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If by nuclear explosion you mean induce fission then yes. You bombard fissile material with neutrons and they undergo fission. This has been done in nuclear reactors the size of dust bin and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Slotin#Criticality_accident" target="_blank">accidentally with a ball of plutonium sat on a bench </a> encased in a neutron reflector. </p>
<p>If however you mean get a critical mass of fissile material and induce runaway fission with no control (a literal atomic bomb) then the only lab experiments I can think of are the underground atomic tests where they detonated the bomb in a bunker and took readings throughout the process. This isn't really a true, lab sized, nuclear explosion as it destroys the lab/bunker. </p>
<p>I would like to point out that modern bombs are actually a small core of fissionable material surrounded by a fusable material. This fission is only used to induce fusion and so relies on squeezing a subcritical mass of material into an even denser state such that it becomes supercritical. So I guess in theory you could use this core (without the hydrogen jacket) to induce runaway fission momentarily in a lab and not have it destroyed, only largely irradiated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. As other mentioned already, if you want to start a fission chain reaction, you need a critical mass. But you don't have to fission all nuclei in that critical mass. If it reaches criticality just barely for a short time, you can get a very small release of energy. That is very dangerous, as the line between &quot;just a few more reactions&quot; and &quot;everyone in the room dies&quot; is very small. There were a few accidents. As an example, two of them happened with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core" target="_blank">Demon core</a>, where significant energy was released (the radiation was intense enough to be lethal for some in both cases) but there was no big explosion.</p>
<p>If you want more controllable reactions, the various fusion concepts are better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
