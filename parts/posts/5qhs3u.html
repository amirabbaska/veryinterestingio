		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very common fallacy. <a href="http://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/large_1x_/public/import/2013/images/2009/07/correction-apollo-525.jpg" target="_blank">The New York Times had an editorial in 1920 saying that space travel was impossible since there was no air to push against in space.</a> </p>
<p>I think the best way to get a feel for it is to consider a gun. When you fire it you feel a recoil force from the bullet being shot out. If you fired a gun in a vacuum chamber (or in space) you would still expect to feel the recoil, right? A rocket engine works the same way. Instead of firing bullets it fires hot gas. The recoil from the gas fired pushes the spacecraft around.</p>
<p>Another way to interpret it is to imagine that the rocket engines push against their own exhaust. </p>
<p>Of course if you want to formally derive it you need to look at the law of conservation of momentum. But usually people can't get rid of the intuition that you need something to push against just by looking at an equation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have given very good explanations, but here's another way to think about it. Imagine you and your buddy are floating around in space. You both have the same mass. Now you push your buddy as hard as you can. He will get pushed away from you, but because of Newton's third law you will also get pushed away from him. So you both start moving in opposite directions.<br />
See how you didn't need any air to push off of in order to move? Same thing happens with rockets, only they are pushing the fuel away from them instead of another human being (ideally).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever floated in an inner tube and pushed off against somebody else floating in an inner tube? You probably noticed that you BOTH moved away from each other. The rocket is one person floating in an inner tube and the propellant is the other person floating in an innertube; the rocket and the propellant push off of each other. Only the propellant is really light so the rocket has to push off if it really fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rocket initially has no momentum.  Exhaust, which has mass, shoots right, the rocket must shoot left so that momentum is still zero (momentum is a vector, which means motion to the right cancel motion to the left).    If M_gas is the mass of the gas and v_gas is the speed with which it is shot to the right, and M_rocket is the mass of the rocket then the velocity of the rocket to the left must be.</p>
<p>v_rocket = M_gas x v_gas / M_rocket</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're really interested in the mechanics of space flight, I'd recommend getting the game Kerbal Space Program.  Once you mastered launching a rocket, changing orbital planes, rendezvousing with other space craft and deorbiting, you'll have a firm grasp on how it all works.  It's actually a lot of fun too, you won't even realize how much you're learning until one day it all just clicks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
