<p>Doesn't say why she has to quit the royal family, but from what I see elsewhere it is outlined in a 1947 law modifying succession rules. I looked up that law and couldn't find anything referencing &quot;commoner&quot;s or marriage. I would imagine &quot;nobles&quot; or whatever equivalent aristocracy is considered &quot;valid&quot; for marriage, but it seems that nobility in Japan was also abolished in 1947.</p>
<p>Who exactly is a valid spouse to remain in the Japanese royal family? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan still has aristocratic families, even if they have a lot less power than they used to and lost their official titles. The families were not killed off, and they still tend to have their land holdings and businesses and do tend to hold very influential positions in the economy and political landscape. </p>
<p>And I am not sure about Japan, but you are generally allowed to marry extended royal family members (cousins) as well as the royal families of other nations, as well as the aristocracy of other nations. </p>
<p>Edit: With Japan specifically it seems that women leave the royal family regardless of the status of who they marry and join that family. They are only allowed to be a member of the Royal family (with the titles) if they are unmarried or are married to a male of the Royal family. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would assume it is because the Emperor must be male and must be of a royal/noble line.  By marrying a commoner she has chosen a husband that doesn't qualify for the position and as such she has to be removed from the line of succession.</p>
<p>The problem is that no male heirs have been born in 41 years.  There just isn't anybody available.  In the past it wasn't as big an issue because they had lots of children.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a traditional Japanese marriage the bride enters her husbands family completely and leaves her own family behind. For example should her husband die she would remain with the family of her husband and not return to her own parents. So no matter the standing of her husband, after the marriage Princess Mako is no longer part of the royal family.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
