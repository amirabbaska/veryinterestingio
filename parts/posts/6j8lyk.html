		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm Wes Wilson (/u/LabcoatNomad), a Canadian cancer researcher currently working in Australia on treating metastatic mesothelioma using combination immunotherapy treatments. I first got started in cancer research in Toronto at Sunnybrook Hospital before moving into research on childhood brain tumours at The Hospital for Sick Children. There I worked on the epigenetics of childhood brain tumour progression in 2010. </p>
<p>In 2013 the journal Science labeled cancer immunotherapy as &quot;the breakthrough of the year&quot; and many cancer patients were given new hope for treatment. But the work and research to identify the best treatments and combinations for the variety of types of cancer is still on going and desperately needed. No one knows why some immunotherapies work for some patients and others they fail. Our work hopes to increase the effectiveness of these new therapies by combining it with adjunct therapies to help the body self-vaccinate against the tumours!</p>
<p><strong>I will be back at 8pm ET to answer your questions. Ask me anything!</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Wes,</p>
<p>Fellow Canadian here doing cancer immunology research abroad. Thanks for being here today!</p>
<p>We've seen that durable patient responses to immunotherapies targeting T cells is dependent on a variety of factors, from the number of T cells infiltrating the tumor to even the gut <a href="https://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v17/n5/full/nrc.2017.13.html" target="_blank">microbiome</a>. Do you know of any biomarkers predictive of response to the adjunct therapies that you are researching? What do you think are the biggest problems preventing adjunct therapies from being more common in the clinic?</p>
<p>Also, I think it's great that you have a <a href="http://mostlyscience.com/" target="_blank">website</a> directed at translating science to non-scientists: what more do you think us scientists can do to improve our relationship with the public and make our discoveries better understood?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
