Rather than having 100 threads on the same topic, this allows our experts one place to go to answer questions.</p>
<p>So feel free to ask your climate change questions here! Remember Panel members will be in and out throughout the day so please do not expect an immediate answer.</p>
<p>For more general discussion /r/Science has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6erjjd/rscience_stands_with_the_paris_climate_agreement/" target="_blank">a thread</a> on this topic as well</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a simple question.</p>
<p>What is the worst case scenario for climate change? In other words, what happens if we cannot stop or inhibit the process of climate change? </p>
<p>Alternatively, what are the most likely effects of climate change? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Countries such as Canada, Russia, Finland, etc. are dominated by a lot of unusable land due to temperature restraints. It is not arable.</p>
<p>If the planet warms up, the countries that are already hot will be devastated agriculturally as their hot climate will go from hot to (possibly) unable to sustain life. Countries that are warm will become hot and lose many natural resources because of it.</p>
<p>Will areas that are currently cold become warm and therefore temperate, and arable?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I came across these two articles detailing the actual effects of the agreements if all countries would meet the guidelines and it looks disturbingly ineffective. Is this information biased or wrong or is this agreement not actually doing anything?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may be a bit naive question, but why are some people (and also scientists) still not believing in climate change? Isn't there a huge amount of data, studies, and most important undeniable effects on the environment around you. It seems to me, that everyone knows, or has heard of, at least one person, who has experienced the negative impact of the climate change for himself. How can these people still believe that climate change isn't real?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
