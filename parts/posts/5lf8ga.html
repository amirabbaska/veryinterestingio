		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody likes Norton because it is a resource hog that slows your computer down. It doesn't effectivly do it's job. Norton's CEO even admits that it only gets 40% of viruses at best. So why would people pay outrageous for a program that slows down their computer, and only does less than half the job. Stick with Microsoft Essentials; it is free and makes sense that Microsoft would know the in's and out's of their own code better than some 3rd party like norton. Norton is a complete waste of money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day Norton was the only game in town.  Time were much simpler and it was a product that did one job and did it well.</p>
<p>It's been a bloated POS for 20 years.  It spreads it's tentacles into every nook and cranny of your system.  I'm still salty about having to remove it piece-by-piece one time in 1999.</p>
<p>Their endpoint AV, which is installed on company computers and controlled by the sysadmin, is pretty good.  Very little resource usage and it seems to catch most things.  Can't speak to how easy it is to use from the admin perspective but as a user I really didn't notice it was there.</p>
<p>A final note; <em>Antivirus software is your last line of defense.</em>  If you're worried about security there are many layers that go on top of the AV.  Edge firewalls, OS firewalls, email filtering, ad blocking, DNS filtering, etc.  If you're counting on <em>any</em> AV to protect you you're doing it wrong.</p>
<p>A final, final note:  <a href="https://dns.norton.com/configureRouter.html" target="_blank">Norton's DNS service</a> is free for home users and seems pretty good at blocking malicious sites.  Pick a protection level and plug those DNS addresses into your router.  That way when your browser sends a request to resolve maliciousfuckersinc.com.cn Norton's name servers send back a &quot;Nope, this site ain't safe.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a multitude of reasons that Norton is infamous, the most common of which is its malware style behavior when attempting to get you to resubscribe. It was basically windows 10.</p>
<p>The last thing you want in an anti-malware program is for it to pester the shit out of you like malware itself does. </p>
<p>To answer your second question without any intention of endorsement, malware-bytes is, in my opinion, the most effective available free anti-malware software. Like most consumer products, you get what you pay for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That is, installing Norton/Symantec has been <strong>actively making users horribly less secure</strong>. The one thing that article didn't mention was exactly how many years it's been doing this.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Norton is a business that cares about money above all else. Your security is near the bottom of their list. Prepackaging and partnering is a pretty central part of their business (&quot;first one's free&quot; (or really cheap) is their favorite thing). So they have a business deal with Best Buy to push Norton installs.  That's all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
