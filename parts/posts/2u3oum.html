		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  It's called [visual acuity](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity</a> ), typically about 1 arcminute (1/60th of a degree).</p>
<p>However, the eye is not at all like a camera you can assess in terms like megapixels.  The resolution isn't uniform, it's only that high in the center of view.  The eye also has a &quot;blind spot&quot; where the nerves go out that has no sensing cells. </p>
<p>The eye makes up for this uneven resolution with super-deluxe image processing hardware that's capable of some very big apparent improvements.  The eye moves a little all the time in what are called [saccades](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade</a> ) the information from which is fused in [Transsaccadic memory](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsaccadic_memory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsaccadic_memory</a> ) to form the &quot;pictures&quot; we perceive of the world we see.  You can use [Johnson's Criteria](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%27s_criteria" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%27s_criteria</a> ) to understand the difference between something the eye can detect and something you can see.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yea, from the wiki, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell" target="_blank">90 million cones</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell" target="_blank">125million rods</a>, since you need 3 cones for one color and B&amp;W pixels stand on their own using the color information from the nearest cone, it's about equal to 125-150million pixels (about equal to 12,000x12,000px display) and a pixel is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis" target="_blank">31.46 arc seconds</a> in size.</p>
<p>But it feels like more, because you can move your eyes and sweep those pixels over a larger space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>this reminded me of a question I've occasionally had involving the &quot;fps&quot; of a human eyes. do our eyes collect images in a similar manner that a camera does - as in x amount of images a second - (or at least does our brain process it that way) and do we have a &quot;max amount of fps&quot; that we can see? or do our brains process this information in a completely different way?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
