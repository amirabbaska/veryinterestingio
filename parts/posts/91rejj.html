		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alkaloids are most commonly produced to protect the plant from parasites or animals eating the plant, but can have other roles as well (it's not a well settled question, in part because there are a LOT of different alkaloids).</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for alkaloids to have very different effects depending on what species ingests them - we see this with cocoa, for example, which is fine for human consumption but poison for cats and dogs.</p>
<p>I don't know the original biological role of curare alkaloids, but it's possible the organisms they're protecting against do not have the same barrier we do in the GI tract preventing the poison from entering the body (into the blood or hemolymph or whatever is relevant for the organism). Or the plant may just be relying on the alkaloid tasting bad, even if it isn't actually poisonous for the animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>But, back to then original question! It is likely that the neurotoxic effects are simply coincidental and had nothing to do with the selection process. It is important to remember there is no intentionality in evolution, consider the following scenario!</p>
<p>Plant A and Plant A(m) are both members of the same species but plant A(m) has a rare mutation that makes it produce bitter tasting compound x, lets say it is 0.1% of the population. Otherwise the compound does not help it in any way. The Plants live happily planting away on the hilltop habitat they live in, living their planty lives for many thousands of years. One day, the mighty Shmoops arrive. The Shmoops are terrifying herbivores with an insatiable plant-thirsty hunger for plant A. They devour plant A but cannot stand Plant A (m) due to the bitter taste. Over time plant A numbers dwindle and Plant A (m) thrives. Then, some time after that, humans come along and realize they can murder each other with compound x if they put it on a pointy stick and stab one another with it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
