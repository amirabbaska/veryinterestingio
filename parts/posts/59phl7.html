		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of that is still a mystery at the deeper levels, but I can explain what was taught to me in my neurobio class many years ago.</p>
<p>One of the (then) accepted models of thought was the &quot;spreading activation model&quot; theory of memory.  The idea behind it is if you think of your brain like a collection of streets on a map.  To get to a  memory, you have to access the location on the map.  You do this by very rapidly going up and down the streets in your mind until you find the memory you were looking for.</p>
<p>Obviously this is overly simplified, but hopefully it helps explain how you come up with that thought.</p>
<p>So in my mind (pun not intended) those &quot;aha&quot; moments are when you suddenly find a shortcut through the streets and realize that getting there is much easier than you thought.  That opens up a whole realm of new routes you can take, and makes understanding that much easier.  So suddenly instead of having to laboriously follow every turn in our head, we can just take the new shortcut and get there quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cognitive processes underlying these &quot;aha&quot; moments have largely been studied under the experimental task of insight problems (a problem whose solution requires one single moment of insight that is often not apparent for the first minute or two). People have proposed that when we view an insight problem, we come up with an initial incorrect representation/view of the problem that comes from things like the problem layout and our own prior expectations about what will contribute to the solution. Then, we subconsciously relax these previously formed assumptions because they are unhelpful (or even hurtful), and this is what contributes to this moment of insight. It's similar to the fact that once we see an image in a particular way (think of the famous duck/rabbit picture), it's very hard to perceive it in a different way.</p>
<p>I can get citations when I'm on my desktop, but this is the gist of what's thought to happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey there! So, we actually studied this not too long ago in my Psychology class.
There was a study done on these &quot;aha&quot; moments conducted by Wolfgang Kohlers involving a chimp retrieving a banana that was just out of reach. The chimp was in a cage with a stick, so naturally he picks up the stick and reaches again for the banana - still out of reach. Another stick was placed in his cage, and for a while the chimp just stood there. Until suddenly, its &quot;aha&quot; moment came and it was able to connect the two sticks (I'm not sure how the mechanics of this worked out, but they did) and retrieve the banana.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a facet of Cognitive Learning called Latent Learning, aka &quot;aha&quot; moments.
It has to do less with memory and more with learning and relationships; it involves a rapid perception of relationships. This &quot;click&quot; that you speak of is actually our mind LITERALLY putting two and two together.
(This doesn't mean that memory doesn't play a part. You need to have past experiences and exposures to even begin forming relationships.)</p>
<p>Another term that actually kinda relates in this chimp case is functional fixedness. Basically, this is when we are so &quot;fixed&quot; on an object's &quot;normal&quot; use, and it hinders us from using it in a situation where we definitely could have.</p>
<p>As an extreme example, you remember that one Saw movie where the person's head was in a cube, being submerged in water? The person would have died if they did not 1) have one of these &quot;aha&quot; moments and realize they could use the little barrel-like portion of the pen to stick into their air pipe and 2) overcome functional fixedness throughout this process.</p>
<p>I know this was long, but I hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuropsychologist here. Can confirm that you're onto something, but the &quot;aha&quot; moments is not due to a short-cut, but rather due to accumulation of neural activation.</p>
<p>When you're trying to figure something out, let's say the name of an actor you've seen in numerous films, your brain fires signals that activate different associations to that specific memory. These associations also trigger the node that holds the actor's name. However, when you only recognize the face, but cannot come up with the name, not enough activation is sent to the node. So, you get this &quot;familiar&quot; / tip of the tongue-feeling. However, if enough activation is accumulated over time, you'll finally remember the name.</p>
<p>It is important to say that this information doesn't neccessarily come from thinking about that specific actor etc. - Actively searching for the information doesn't neccessarily predict better or faster retrieval. Sometimes, you suddenly remember the actor's name when shopping, due to the fact that the actor's name is associated with something in the shop. So, after accumulating so much potential to the node, what makes the node fire (subsequently making you remember the name) might be a diffuse association from the grocery shop.</p>
<p>OP also asked about new situations which the person has never encountered before. I can't remember too much about this, but some of the earlier theories of KÃ¶hler on &quot;insight&quot; might be relevant here :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
