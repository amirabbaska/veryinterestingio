		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are right to be dubious of your textbook, because the statements made are false. Not &quot;false but only because we are making an approximation&quot; or &quot;false but it's only an apparent effect and not real&quot;, but &quot;egregiously and totally false&quot;, to the point that it's rather embarrassing that this paragraph made it into that text.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at each of these statements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a DC circuit, the impulse of electricity...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just for the record, I have never in my life heard the term &quot;impulse of electricity&quot;. An impulse is momentum and the term is typically used for describing the change in momentum due to a force that acts for only a very short time (e.g., the impulse of a tennis racket on an incoming tennis ball). We do have a term &quot;electromotive force&quot; which is abbreviated &quot;emf&quot; since it's not actually a force, but an electric potential. So maybe this author has defined &quot;impulse of electricity&quot; analogously, which would make &quot;impulse of electricity&quot; an electric potential per unit time. Those units strongly suggest that the author means &quot;impulse of electricity&quot; to mean that the dV/dt (where V is the voltage across the battery) is a unit impulse function. Not only is that impossible anyway, the term is still just not used, or used so exceedingly rare for my never to have heard it in my entire academic career.</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> <em>On further examination, however, it seems the author is using &quot;impulse of electricity&quot; to refer to (what he thinks to be a correct) fact that all electrons start moving at the same time once the switch is closed. So he is probably using &quot;electricity&quot; to mean electric current or the electron speed, and the &quot;impulse&quot; refers to the (incorrect) fact that the electrons begin at 0 speed and then all instantly being moving at some non-zero speed. Again, the term &quot;impulse of electricity&quot; is not used and it is extremely difficult to figure out what he means by it precisely because his entire explanation is wrong.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume for a moment that a pipe has been filled with table-tennis balls. If a ball is forced into the end of the pipe, the ball at the other end will be forced out. Each time a ball enters one end of the pipe, the ball at the other end will be forced out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes... but it's not instantaneous as the author wants us to infer. In fact, this very consideration is what leads to one of the most commonly asked questions on this sub (&quot;if I push a rod longer than one light-year, doesn't the end move faster than light?&quot; or something similar). When you push on the first ball, you create a pressure wave which propagates through the other balls and eventually pushes the last ball out. The speed of this wave is not infinite: it is finite and equal to the speed of sound in whatever material the balls are made of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This principle is also true for electrons in a wire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. The tennis balls in the pipe provide only a very rough analogy. In reality, when there is no electric field in the wire, the electrons are still moving. But they move randomly, and so, on average, they are at rest. If there is an electric field, the electrons still move randomly, but with some average drift in the direction of the higher potential. (Brownian motion with non-zero drift is a closer analogy than balls in a pipe.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are billions of electrons in a wire. If an electron enters one end of a wire, another electron is forced out the other end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes... but again, not instantaneously. If the electric field is already present in the wire, the drift velocity of the electrons is, in fact, very slow, literally a snail's pace in many common applications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume that a wire is long enough to be wound around the earth 10 times. If a power source and switch were connected at one end of the wire and a light at the other end, the light would turn on the moment the switch was closed. But it would take light approximately 1.3 seconds to travel around the earth 10 times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. Absolutely not. Period. This is certainly the most egregious error in this entire paragraph. <strong>The light does not turn on instantaneously.</strong> When the switch is closed, the change in the electric field in the wire propagates at a <em>finite</em> speed, less than the speed of light. (This signal is analogous to the pressure wave in the tennis balls.) The actual speed of this signal is determined by many factors, including the composition of the wire and its surroundings, and in copper wires in your home is typically on the order of 50-99% the speed of light.</p>
<p>The author of your textbook is demonstrating a very fundamental misunderstanding of physics. I would say that I am horrified, but I have seen worse.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Various followups to some common responses and questions</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The author's first statement is that the electricity <em>appears</em> to travel faster than light. The word appear does not necessarily mean &quot;looks as if this happens, but it doesn't&quot;. The word can mean &quot;this happens because this is what we see&quot;. Regardless, the author very clearly states in at least 3 places (&quot;instantaneously&quot;, &quot;instantly&quot;, &quot;the same moment&quot;) that the propagation of the EM wave in the wire is instantaneous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some have commented that according to the second figure, the light bulb is actually connected via a very short wire to the battery, and the EM wave does not have to travel all around the world to reach it. First of all, I think it's rather odd to think that that specific part of the figure is drawn to scale but not anything else (or else the bulb is as large as Earth). Secondly, and more important, the light would <em>still</em> not turn on instantaneously. &quot;Nearly instant&quot;, &quot;so quickly as to be imperceptible to humans&quot;, &quot;effectively instant&quot;, etc. are <em>not the same as</em> &quot;instantly&quot;, which is what the author claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The text is written for electricians in a high school or community college trade program. It is not written for physicists. The errors are rather egregious, and I do understand that the correctness of this particular paragraph is likely not relevant to most using the book. (There are applications in signal processing where the signal speed in the wire does matter though.) However, I believe that a book that purports to be an educational tool, a textbook no less, should not be incorrect in anything it claims (barring new discoveries that make statements outdated). Yes, electricians probably don't need to know the details of copper wires and electricity to the atomic level, but the claim that common electricity allows for FTL communication is outrageous. I sincerely believe that many students would doubt the veracity of that statement, just as the OP has. Would you not then be cautious in trusting anything else in the book? Regardless, there are other mistakes in the text which are very relevant to the audience.</p>
</li>
<li>For those asking what I have seen that is worse, well, just your standard fare of creationism biology textbooks was what I had in mind. In terms of physics, I have seen new-ish fluid dynamics texts explain airplane lift incorrectly (i.e., that streamlines split and must meet up again at the other edge). I have also seen many incorrect explanations of why light does not travel at <em>c</em> in media. But IMO those last two are not as bad as an implication of FTL communication via a long wire and a light bulb.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work on RF transmitters and one property of coaxial lines is propagation velocity.  That seems to be what this is, but I'm sure others in this topic are more qualified than I.  It's usually expressed as a percentage of the speed of light in a vacuum.</p>
<p>We use propagation velocity when doing time-domain reflectometry.  It allows us to pinpoint problems that would otherwise be invisible in large RF systems.  Things such as a bad connector.  Knowing the propagation velocity of that particular line allows the TDR to tell us &quot;problem at 122 feet from here&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
