		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just as a warning this is a HIGHLY simplified version of how they work:</p>
<p>(most) solar panels are made from two thin sheets of silicon.  Silicon has a very regular crystal structure, but each layer has been mixed with a small amount of two other elements.  What this accomplishes is that one layer has a crystal structure with some extra electrons and one has a crystal structure missing some electrons.</p>
<p>When you connect both layers the extra electrons move over to fill the holes and it just sort of sits there.</p>
<p>If you put this silicon sandwich in the sunshine, that sun has enough energy to knock an electron loose from one side, and then the electrons all shift places to fill in the new hole.  If you hook a bunch of these small cells together into a big panel you can get the electrons to flow through a wire and you get electricity out of it.  </p>
<p>Keep combining more and more panels (made up of lots of tiny cells) and you can get a lot of energy.  When the sun goes away all the electrons find all the holes and the whole things just sits there waiting for the sun to shine on it again.</p>
<p>If you hook a battery into the mix you can charge that battery with the electrons (again very simplified) if you connect it to the grid you can power your home, or you can use it for anything else that you would use electricity for.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br />
A lot of people have asked about &quot;where the electrons come from&quot; or &quot;can the panel run out of them&quot; etc.  As I stated above this is a VERY simplified explanation.  The electrons don't actually move around, and again this is highly simplified, but think of it more like they bump into their neighbor which bumps into its neighbor, etc.  They are not actually moving around the wire, or the panel.  Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Someone also asked why not one big panel instead of lots of little ones, and the answer to that is that no matter how big your panel is, it will always produce the same voltage.  A little tiny solar cells pumps out about .5 volts so does a really big one.  So if you want 12 volts, or 120 volts, etc you have to string the smaller panels together. In the same way you can take a whole bunch of AA batteries and get enough voltage to run something large, you can take a whole bunch of small solar cells and put them together in such a way that you can get the voltage you need.</p>
<p>Different solar cells work with different efficiency in different wavelengths of light.  Most commercial solar cells work best in full sun, but can still function in diffuse light.</p>
<p>Solar cells seem to degrade a bit after about 25 years, and then slowly degrade after that, some very old solar panels from the 50's are still going strong with relatively minor degradation.  With the current dramatic price drop in solar cells, it is very likely that the roof or the stand you have them affixed too will wear out before they do, and even then it will be nearly free to replace them in the future (assuming costs keep going down and efficiency keeps going up, which it can still do for a long time before we reach limits imposed by physics).</p>
<p>Here is a cool chart of all the different solar cells being tracked by efficiency. (how much sun they turn into electricity).  <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/images/efficiency-chart.png" target="_blank">https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/images/efficiency-chart.png</a></p>
<p>as you can see some cells are doing pretty good (46%), although they might be very expensive.  </p>
<p>Roughly 1000 watts of solar energy falls on 1 square meter of ground, so at 46% a meter of that solar cell would make (roughly) 460 watts of energy.</p>
<p>As you can see as the price of the cells comes down, as does the price of battery and inverter tech, solar has a very real chance of powering just about the entire world.  Combined with smart grids, grid energy storage, electric car energy storage, and increases in efficiency, solar and other renewables are clearly the energy supply we should be backing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar cells are made out of semiconductors which absorb light at specific wavelengths. That absorbed light excites electrons, which ionize, leaving a net negative charge on one atom and positively charged &quot;hole&quot; where the electron used to be. A small applied voltage causes the electron and hole to move in opposite directions to electrodes where they become electric current.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, the semiconductors inside of a solar panel are often doped into a p-n junction by adding atoms that have either one less or one more electron in the outermost energy ranges (the valence shell if we're using that model of the atom). This creates extra energy states that photoelectrons can use as a &quot;jumping off point&quot; to become conductive and move freely more easily at lower temperatures. It also lets you tune which wavelengths a solar panel will absorb for energy, to an extent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So most of these responses are generally along the right lines, but vague. I'm starting my graduate research focusing on solar (photovoltaic) cells, so I'll try to explain a different way.</p>
<p>The core principle of solar cells is the p-n junction. The n-type material has impurities consisting of atoms that add more electrons than silicon atoms normally have, and the p-type has added atoms with fewer electrons (quantized as &quot;holes&quot; with the opposite charge of electrons). When these are stuck together at the junction, the extra electrons from the n-type diffuse across to the p-type, and the holes diffuse across to the n-type, so the number of electrons balance out.</p>
<p>However, since the n-type atoms have lost electrons, that side now has a net positive charge, and the p-type side now has a net negative charge. An electric field has been created through the crystal that tries to push electrons back into the n-type side.</p>
<p>As others have explained, when light hits the cell, it &quot;knocks&quot; electrons free. They absorb the energy of the photons and are free to move through the cell, leaving behind holes where they used to be. The electric field separates the electrons and holes, pushing the electrons to the n-type side and holes to the p-type side (a process similar to diffusion, known as drift). The more light, the more charges are separated to collect on opposite sides of the cell. This is the photovoltaic effect! The cell now has a voltage across it, and when you connect a light or battery or other load, the voltage pushes electrons out of the cell and through the load.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many materials absorb light when it hits them. When a solar panel is hit by light it also absorbs the light, but it does this because the light knocks into an electron and makes the electron excited (which absorbs the light). This excited electron wants to move around a lot and it jumps around from atom to atom. But because of the way solar panels are built the electron can only move in one direction. If you have a lot of light hit the solar panel then a lot of electrons will be knocked around and &quot;freed&quot; to flow through the material, but only in that one permitted direction. Hook something up to the panel so the electrons have somewhere to go and they'll flow right through whatever you hooked up. And there you have electricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
