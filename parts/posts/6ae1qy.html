		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/gordonmessmer gets the &quot;what&quot; down, but misses some of the &quot;why&quot;.</p>
<p>Microsoft's strategy to keep customers captured in &quot;The Microsoft Ecosystem&quot; was &quot;Embrace, Extend, Extinguish&quot;. They used (and still use) it to insert themselves into other positions and then compel upgrades and bankruptcies.</p>
<p>So, for example, Microsoft would often give free versions of MS Office to the president of a company. Then none of his underlings could read his output unless he used &quot;save as -&gt; older version&quot;. This would frustrate the boss so eventually he'd demand to know how to &quot;fix this problem&quot;, but wouldn't want to downgrade himself. Downgrades would feel so last-year and all his stuff would have to be systematically opened and re-saved with that save as older version. So eventually the boss would order an expensive upgrade of the whole company.</p>
<p>Now there is no reason that Office had to work this way. With a little planning the &quot;doc file&quot; format could have been reasonably future-proofed into a forward/backward compatible core. But this was a useful strategy.</p>
<p>Now expand that across businesses. If I can get your biggest customer to upgrade, then either you have to upgrade or you have to keep telling your customer to go back and save as -&gt; older format everything they send you. And now you look hopelessly out of date. So now you have to upgrade.</p>
<p>Also include the fact that &quot;forward thinking&quot; Bill Gates famously declared that the internet would never happen in any meaningful scale. (He really wasn't particularly smart about technology, he was just one of the bastards that knew how to manipulate people.) So Microsoft was <em>very</em> late to the party. (EDIT: On looking for citations, this Bill Gates comment may be apocryphal. Microsoft was very late to the internet party, having just hoovered up Berkeley sockets and TCP/IP stack already developed by Berkeley and Apple under the BSD license. Windows had Server Message Block &quot;SMB&quot; networking, but that was premises only and could not be routed in any meaningful way. So windows did networking early, but it was very late in terms of any kind of Internet Protocols.)</p>
<p>So HTML is, among other things, a document format. It can pretty much display any document you can imagine. Not decode any save file, but produce the formats and layouts of an intended vision.</p>
<p>The actual intent of this vision, this HTML format, was to make document storage universal and accessible. It just so happened to &quot;also&quot; let documents refer to each other. But the true goal was to make the &quot;doc format&quot; obsolete.</p>
<p>The internal layout of all document data would be controlled by a data file format that was controlled by public committee and that <em>anybody</em> - company or individual - could write a word processor to manipulate equally.</p>
<p>What a disaster for Microsoft!</p>
<p>This would completely invalidate the whole MS Office model. There'd be no way to control who used what version of who's word processor, or spreadsheet, or whatever if everyone knew exactly what every byte of every data file meant.</p>
<p>With no &quot;secret sauce&quot; there was no need to buy Microsoft at all.</p>
<p>So, late to the game, MS did whatever it could to get <em>any</em> browser. They gave it away for free - not just to screw Spyglass, which was a bonus, but to make sure that everybody would &quot;suddenly&quot; have <em>their</em> browser.</p>
<p>Then MS integrated &quot;explorer&quot; and &quot;internet explorer&quot; into all their applications so that you literally could not remove their browser without rendering your system basically useless.</p>
<p>Then, having pulled &quot;market dominance&quot; out of their collective ass, they started making Internet Explorer &quot;Work Different&quot; than the standard. IF you pulled up anything in IE, compared to any other browser, you wouldn't see the same result.</p>
<p>The implication there would be that the other browser was &quot;wrong&quot;.</p>
<p>Nobody could afford to go into for-profit business against MS' deep pockets and free price tag. (This is why Mozilla is a not-for-profit foundation instead of a business. etc.)</p>
<p>Nobody could do anything but <em>guess</em> about the secret alterations that I.E. used.</p>
<p>Everybody who used a standards compliant browser would get different results than all the people using I.E.</p>
<p>This <em>almost</em> gave Microsoft defacto control over the internet. It <em>almost</em> worked.</p>
<p>Then Microsoft released some really atrocious and really insecure stuff for authoring web pages that were, in turn, really atrocious and insecure. Their I.E. gambit opened a gaping pipeline from &quot;the internet&quot; to the heart of windows and so your data.</p>
<p>One could craft internet URLs to delete files, install software, and do all sorts of harmful things.</p>
<p>The very ubiquity and thoughtless integration that worked as the sharp edge of the wedge in Microsoft's strategy to control the internet through shear numbers was basically thwarted by the fact that the internet is full of assholes. And thank god for those assholes really, we wouldn't have the internet of today if Microsoft had &quot;won&quot;.</p>
<p>So the Price and Penetration were there, and the war seemed all but over, and then the worms came to eat the dead flesh from Microsoft's scheme. (That's what scavengers are for.) The completely insecure Windows platform with I.E. which gave any remote actor control of the Windows kernel at the load of a page, was just <em>too</em> juicy a target.</p>
<p>So people started losing whole hard drives when their friends didn't and they asked how and why. Well the users of the not integrated browsers were not anywhere near as susceptible to penetration.</p>
<p>Which is sort of funny. Those other browsers were struggling to be just as bad as I.E. Their developers <em>wanted</em> to offer &quot;ActiveX&quot; and the undocumented OLE extensions and match the &quot;special&quot; formatting rules but those were secret. So Microsoft had literally locked their opponents out of the chance to make the same mistakes.</p>
<p>So at that point Microsoft is playing catch-up in the security realm. Trying all they could to turn the inherently insecure Windows into something that wouldn't burst into flames the instant it went online.</p>
<p>And the other browser makers are trying to get their products to burn exactly the same way I.E. did because they were seen as failing to do what I.E. did -- e.g. break the rules in those secret ways and open all those convenient security holes.</p>
<p>But the users were switching away to Mozilla, and eventually FireFox and such, because it was <em>safer</em>.</p>
<p>Once enough people were using &quot;not I.E&quot; the differences between I.E. and the rest of the world were finally seen as true flaws in I.E. That is, with Mozilla, FireFox, Safari, Opera, Konqueror, and all the rest showing results one way, and poor old Microsoft showing them some other way, the user base started to understand that it was I.E. that was broken.</p>
<p>Soon there were &quot;I.E. emulation&quot; check boxes and extensions in other browsers one could click to best-guess emulate the broken behavior of I.E. and now Microsoft was suddenly the one limping along. They needed to both fix the security holes <em>and</em> fix their implementation to meet the open and published standards. They also had to do it in a way that didn't break their whole operating system. So for more than half it's life (from IE 5 until now, which is IE 12 or 13) Microsoft's browser has been trying to recover from their own attempt to steal and lock-down the internet behind a wall of secrets.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if they'd succeeded then they could pull out patents to kill anybody who lived through the wars. Once Microsoft had &quot;extended&quot; the internet with their secrets, they could &quot;extinguish&quot; anybody who dared to make a compatible browser.</p>
<hr />
<p>As an aside, these wars are not over. We've still got the Word/Office problem. Microsoft still has their secret sauce strategy at work.</p>
<p>When governments started to demand open document formats so that they could use any software they wanted Microsoft paid a bunch of people to join the <del>IEEE</del> ISO so that they could control the Open Document Formats and inject proprietary vendor extensions tags.</p>
<p>So Microsoft's &quot;.docx&quot; format is just as bad as &quot;.doc&quot; for having secret sauce. There is a &quot;vendor extension tag&quot; (or set there-of) that lets Microsoft say &quot;sure, we store our documents in the standard format like your law requires&quot; but if you say &quot;so how do we read that chunk there?&quot; they can say &quot;that's private&quot;.</p>
<p>It's the same bullshit of embrace, extend, extinguish but it turns out that you can only cram so much stupidity into those little chunks so it's a slog.</p>
<hr />
<p>So the browser wars was all about whether one company would be able to dictate what software you could use on the internet, first by subterfuge and then second by patent law. They were stopped at &quot;first&quot; because the internet is not just full of assholes, but some of those assholes had a sense of the stakes at hand.</p>
<p>This didn't save the best of the best (WordPerfect) or let innovation flourish (Quatro Pro) in all areas, but it did stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>So like any war, it was an attempt by the powerful to take land and things from people who had worked to create them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some useful perspective can be gained by looking at when the browsers were originally released, and considering the context that provides.</p>
<p>Netscape Navigator, December 1994:  Navigator was a commercial product, sold for profit.  A number of developers of NCSA Mosaic (which was mostly free of charge) left NCSA in order to capitalize on the commercial opportunities in developing Internet software.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer, August 1995: Microsoft licensed the Spyglass browser (a descendant of NCSA Mosaic) for inclusion in Windows.  According to internal memos, Bill Gates was concerned that the spread of networked content rendered in a standard fashion threatened to &quot;commoditize the underlying operating system.&quot;  That is, if information could be viewed equally well on any platform, revenue for Windows was threatened.  As an interesting note, Microsoft licensed the browser from Spyglass in exchange for a percentage of their profits.  Microsof then gave away the browser, cheating Spyglass of any revenue.  Spyglass sued them, and won a pittance.  Early versions of IE were a stop-gap while Microsoft wrote their own browser that wouldn't be subject to license terms with Spyglass.  All of this, more than anything else, is the essential reason for the browser wars.</p>
<p>Tangentially related, and also of interest, perhaps, are the Halloween documents: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents</a></p>
<p>KHTML (Konqueror), November 1998: Free Software (Linux and BSD) desktops did have access to Netscape, but didn't have good Free browsers.  The KDE project set out to produce a usable mostly-Free desktop (they used a proprietary graphics library), including a web browser.</p>
<p>Safari, January 2003: Before Safari, Mac OS was dependent on Microsoft to provide IE.  At this point, Internet access was essential for any computer, and reliance on IE meant that Apple was dependent on their primary competitor, which was leverage that Microsoft could use against them in any negotiations.  Apple forked the Free Software KHTML components and used them to make Safari and WebKit.</p>
<p>Firefox, November 2004: After AOL acquired Netscape, various changes were made to the browser in an attempt to drive revenue for AOL projects.  The AOL Instant Messenger was bundled, for example, and Netscape's pop-up blocking (which served to block advertisements) was very briefly removed before outrage from users brought it back.  Several developers forked a new code branch to build a new light-weight browser that was focused on user needs rather than driving revenue for the parent company.</p>
<p>Chrome, September 2008: Google derives most of its revenue in whole or in part using advertising in search results, or ads that are targeted based on information they gather from what users search for.  It is vital to them that they are the default search engine in most browsers, and they release a new browser of their own (also descended from WebKit, and hence, KHTML).  That browser is highly standards compliant, and being an advertising agency, Google is in an excellent position to market it to a broad internet base.</p>
<p>As a Free Software advocate, I like to point out from time to time that while GNU/Linux still has a relatively small market share, software originally written for GNU/Linux systems powers virtually all of the browsers people use on a regular basis: Chrome, Safari, Android's browser, and iOS's browser all descend from KHTML.  The only other brower that matters, Firefox, wasn't GNU/Linux specifically, but was Free Software since </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're free, but they can still make the parent money, or serve some purpose.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<p><strong>Internet Explorer</strong> - only available on Windows. Windows costs money, even if it comes with the computer the manufacturer had to pay for it. So if IE is a preferred browser, people need to give Microsoft money to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Chrome</strong> - Chrome reports usage statistics back to Google, and ties very conveniently into lots of other Google products and services. Google makes most of its money on ads, and the more data they have about people the more relevant ads they can show.</p>
<p><strong>Firefox</strong> - probably the most altruistic of the browsers. Mozilla Foundation is nonprofit, and it's original drive of creation of FF was to break the IE stranglehold of the 90s and provide a free, standards-compliant browser that'd behave consistently on any OS.</p>
<p><strong>Safari</strong> - no idea, but they must be making it for some reason. Anyone else wanna chime in?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short: Dominance. </p>
<p>Microsoft made it to monopoly with this strategy: Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. They want to dominate the market so they are the only one who offers a service, and by default they can decide what happens and furthermore, what other products work in which way.</p>
<p>If you do business you <em>need</em> Office. You need to buy it. For that you <em>need</em> Windows. There simply is no alternative. </p>
<p>MS tried and tries the same with the browser market and as such with the internet, they want to dominiate all and everything, so anything that is sold is by them or through their policies. Achieving the same dominance on the net-market the same as they have with desktops failed, but they are big enough to keep trying.</p>
<p>The same worked for Apple very well. If you are in the Apple world, you are in a golden cage. No matter what one thinks about it, it is financially very good for Apple. </p>
<p>In a way it is the same with google, they want internet-world-domination, as that increases they ability to control what you see (ads), which is financially very good for them. </p>
<p>Add a few odd competitors who do it for &quot;ideology&quot;, as Firefox.</p>
<p>The question &quot;Why is the browser war waged?&quot; is basically the question &quot;Why want companies utterly dominate your access to the internet?&quot; and the answer to that is &quot;To press everyone else out and finally make all the money&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was because Microsoft tried very hard and pulled some dirty tricks to get a monopoly.</p>
<p>So to build web pages it should be an open standard meaning if you coded a web page in HTML it really shouldn't matter what web browser you use or even what Operating system you use.</p>
<p>Microsoft saw this as a threat , looking ahead tons of people use their computer as just a web browser machine. If all you do on a computer is open a web browser and browse the web, Microsoft loses its dominance. You can use Apple, or Linux, of FreeBSD or andriod to do that.</p>
<p>So back in the day Microsoft tried to do several things that made it so web browsers would only work in IE, if all webpages only work in IE Linux, android and even apple could be crippled .</p>
<p>So lots of people fought really hard for open web standards . Open web standards would allow any web browser running any OS to work.</p>
<p>Microsoft tried really hard  to make it so lots of web pages would only render correctly in IE or use activeX what would force people to use IE what would force people to use windows.</p>
<p>If they would have succeeded Android or linux would have been crippled. Would anyone use an O/S that you couldn't browse the web in?</p>
<p>Also apply would be at their mercy , all they would have to do is pull IE from apple  and they would be crippled</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
