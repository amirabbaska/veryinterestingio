		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly the flight recorders are incased in layers of steel and foam to protect it from any impact or fire. In addition the recording is done on media which can be read even if slightly damaged and exposed to the elements. Early flight recorders scratched lines into metal foil but now they use magnetic tape. Even if a flight recorder is shredded into small bits and put in salt water for months the magnetic tape still holds information and can be pieced together by investigators.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A while ago there was an article in Flying Magazine on what they do to test black boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire it from a cannon at a brick wall</li>
<li>Point flamethrowers at it for an hour or so</li>
<li>Put it in an oven for 24 hours</li>
<li>Put in salt water at simulated depth for two weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>These times are most certainly not quite correct, the article was some time ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Planes need to be light in weight, so they can fly in the air. Cue, Aluminum..... Black boxes, though, they are much smaller and can be made with the strongest things with the purpose to record and be strong. They are also painted in orange so that it is easy to find them.   </p>
<p>Also, the technical term for Black boxes is Flight Recorders. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
