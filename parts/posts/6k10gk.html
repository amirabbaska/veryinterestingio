I talked to a local welder who said he wouldn't touch Aluminum but would have welded my design if it was stainless steel and that I needed to find someone else. </p>
<p>Why is Aluminum so much more challenging to weld? What physical properties for Al are different that make it that much harder?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: Mine is 6061 Aluminum.</strong></p></div></div>

<p>Aluminum is a fantastic thermal conductor. This characteristic means that when you apply heat to a given area, it quickly dissipates. This is why it takes so much energy to weld aluminum, despite its low melting temperature. You're basically pumping energy in faster than you're losing it. </p>
<p>Aluminum also just doesn't flow very well. It's kind of goopy.</p>
<p>Other particulars like contamination, oxidation, anodizing, etc, makes everything even trickier. Most people prefer steel because it's just way way easier to deal with. </p>
<p>But, I do love aluminum. It's a FANTASTIC material to fabricate with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It requires a special welding machine. TIG *
(Tungsten Inert Gas).  It requires a shielding gas (Argon).  Aluminum oxide which forms over time on the surface of aluminum melts at a much higher temperatures than aluminum and must be removed with acetone prior to welding. Aluminum also has higher thermal conductivity and a low melting point alowing it to be easily burned through. If aluminum is anodized it becomes even more diificult to weld. Welding aluminum is not more difficult, just different and requires some experience. The welder you brought it to may not have had the proper equipment, or viewed the work as to risky to take on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aluminium is just different, requires experience that most welders haven't spent time developing. Aluminium has a fairly high coefficient of heat expansion, and is significantly higher in conductivity than, say, steel. It's also extremely sensitive to gases present in the air, thus requiring inert gas shielding (and more of it, depending on conditions and weld quality) to perform  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's easy enough to do if you've got the right equipment but it can go very wrong very quickly, too much heat and you can end up with a big hole and a puddle of ally. It's really satisfying if you get it right though!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aluminium is not that hard if set up correctly and you have experience with it. </p>
<p>The main problems is its oxide, which melts at a significantly higher temperature than the base metal and forms instantly in air. making it super easy to over heat the base metal into a liquid while it appears solid due to the thin oxide holding keeping the shape. then once the oxide breaks the base metal pours out onto the floor. </p>
<p>This issue is solved by using AC or DC Reverse polarity to break up the oxide, good shielding and a bit of technique.<br />
With GMAW (mig) a special feeder is needed. With GTAW (tig) it is the same equipment normally but a different movement.</p>
