		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello Reddit, we are excited to talk to you about the <a href="http://dogagingproject.com" target="_blank">Dog Aging Project</a>. Here to discuss your questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Matt Kaeberlein, Professor at the University of Washington Department of Pathology, co-director of the Dog Aging Project</li>
<li>Dr. Daniel Promislow, Professor at the University of Washington Departments of Biology and Pathology, co-director of the Dog Aging Project</li>
<li>Dr. Kate Creevy, Professor at Texas A&amp;M College of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences, lead veterinarian for the Dog Aging Project</li>
<li>Dr. Silvan Urfer, Senior Fellow at the University of Washington Department of Pathology, veterinary informatics officer for the Dog Aging Project</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to define the biological and environmental factors that influence healthy aging in dogs at high resolution, and to use this information to improve the quality and quantity of life for our pets.  So far, most scientific research on the biology of aging (geroscience) has been conducted in the lab under standardized conditions. Results from these studies have been quite encouraging (for example, Matt's group has recently managed to extend life expectancy in middle-aged mice by 60%). We believe that the domestic dog is ideally suited to bring this work out of the lab and into the real world.  There are many reasons why dogs are uniquely suited for this effort, including that they share our environment, receive comparable medical care, are affected by many of the same age-related diseases, and have excellent health and life span data available.</p>
<p>While aging is not a disease, it is the most important risk factor for a wide range of diseases such as cancer, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, kidney failure and so on. Therefore, by targeting the biological mechanisms of aging, we can expect to see benefits across the spectrum of those otherwise unrelated diseases - which has lead us to state that healthy aging is in fact <em>The Ultimate Preventive Medicine.</em></p>
<p>Our hope is that by understanding the biological and environmental factors that influence the length of time an individual lives in good health (what we call 'healthspan'), we can better understand how to maximize each individual dog's healthspan. Having dogs live and stay healthy for longer will be beneficial for both the dogs and their owners. Moreover, given that dogs live in the same environment as we do, what we learn about healthspan in dogs is likely to apply to humans as well – so understanding healthy aging in dogs might help us to learn how to ensure the highest level of health at old age for humans. </p>
<p>We welcome interested citizen scientists to sign up their dogs to be considered for <a href="http://dogagingproject.com/project-details/" target="_blank">two studies</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Longitudinal Study</em> will study 10,000 dogs (our 'foundation cohort') of all breeds and ages throughout North America. This intensively studied cohort will be followed through regular owner questionnaires, yearly vet visits including bloodwork, and information about in-home behavior, environmental quality, and more. In a subset of these dogs (our 'precision cohort'), we will also include annual studies of state-of-the-art molecular biology ('epigenome', 'microbiome' and 'metabolome') information. Our goal is to better understand how biology and the environment affect aging and health. Results from this study should help us to better predict and diagnose disease earlier, and so improve our ability to treat and prevent disease. There are no health, size or age requirements for dogs to be eligible to participate in this study.</li>
<li><em>The Interventional Study</em> will test the effects of a drug called rapamycin on healthspan and lifespan in dogs. This is a drug that has shown promising effects on aging in a wide variety of species, and based on those results we expect to see a 2 to 5 year increase in healthy lifespan in dogs. We have previously tested rapamycin in a pilot study on healthy dogs for 10 weeks and found improved heart function that was specific to age-related changes, and no significant adverse side effects. For the Interventional Study, we will treat 300 healthy middle-aged dogs with either rapamycin or a placebo for several years and compare health outcomes and mortality between the two groups. To be eligible to participate, dogs will need to be healthy, at least six years of age at the beginning of the study, and weigh at least 18 kg (40 lbs). </li>
</ul>
<p>The Dog Aging Project believes in the value of <em>Open Science</em>. We will collect an enormous amount of data for this project - enough to keep scores of scientists busy for many years. Other than any personal information about owners, we will make all of our data publicly available so that scientists and veterinarians around the world can make discoveries. We are also dedicated to Citizen Science, and will endeavor to create ways for all dog owners to become a part of the process of scientific discovery as the Dog Aging Project moves forward.</p>
<p>We'll be on at noon pacific time (3 PM ET, 19 UT), ask us anything!</p></div></div>
