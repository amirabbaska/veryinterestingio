If you just go by material strength, taller structures are possible, but it gets completely impractical, as more and more of its volume has to be used for structural integrity and elevators.</p>
<p>Air density has to be considered as well, and you probably have to make airlocks to get a reasonable climate everywhere without generating huge wind through the structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

After construction it needs to be maintained. 4000 meters up would present a lot of problems providing simple maintenance.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the factors is elevator technology. This is somewhat obsolete because some of the new buildings are using a new, cable-less elevator design, but a major limiting factor in the past has been the maximum length of elevator cables, which is on the order of 800 feet, and the size of the corresponding building core needed to house multiple tiers of elevators. Newer sky scrapers are using cable-less elevator that run one-way in the shaft, so you can have multiple cars in the same shaft at a time. At various points, the elevator shifts horizontally over to a down shaft.<br />
--- EDIT---<br />
I should state that this basically an economic limitation. The higher the building, the more lift capacity you need to get people up and down/to and from the usable space in the building. With cabled elevators, one elevator per shaft, this means more elevator shafts. These require space in the building core, leaving less room for actual &quot;building&quot;. There is also the height limitation that means passengers have to get off at some midpoint and head over to a different bank of elevators. Toward the higher floors, you can have fewer elevators going up because a smaller percentage of the total number of people entering the building are going to the upper levels. The point is, the building has to pay for itself in service traffic. If you built a super tall building, the first 1000 or so feet of the building would have to be all elevators just to be able to move the number of required people for higher floors. Putting multiple elevators per shaft helps reduce that building core foot print, but it is still limiting factor, once you establish a base people moved per hour per shaft metric. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We could easily go 6x these heights for a building on the moon. Plus, there wouldn't be as significant a worry about tectonics (earthquakes, moonquakes?, vibrations, etc.) nor wind. If we consider orbital constructs or the asteroid belt, they can be much larger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
