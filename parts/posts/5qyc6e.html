		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked my grandfather about this before he died.  He was in the Navy during WWII fighting the Japanese in the South Pacific.  What follows below are his words and opinions, not mine, so save your hate...</p>
<p>He said it was not necessarily a big deal at the time, in terms of media coverage or public debate.  However, most people supported it.  You have to realize how emotional the country was following Pearl Harbor.  People were scared and extremely angry.  The big worry at the time was that the Japanese would invade the west coast of the USA, especially since almost our entire Pacific fleet was destroyed at Pearl Harbor.  </p>
<p>The Japanese were able to get detailed intelligence on Pearl Harbor by having operatives blend into the large Japanese-American population of Hawaii.  With the threat of an invasion, the powers that be decided to not take any chances.  They did not have a way of ferreting out operatives, so the only option was to isolate the entire Japanese community in internment camps.  They tried to give them good living conditions as best they could (in their opinion at the time).  Everyone was just so focused on the war, that they really didn't think twice about these Japanese-American citizens.</p>
<p>That basically what he had to say.  Interpret it as you will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gallup was around then, and did a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/vault/195257/gallup-vault-wwii-era-support-japanese-internment.aspx" target="_blank">survey</a> among Americans.  Although not a majority, more favored preventing Japanese-Americans from returning after WW2 than did those allowing return.  This was not a bright moment in our nation's history, and one that people such as [George Takei] (<a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/celebrity_news/2017/01/star_trek_s_takei_shares_his_family_s_internment_camp" target="_blank">http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/celebrity_news/2017/01/star_trek_s_takei_shares_his_family_s_internment_camp</a>) have worked to raise awareness of. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of them were fully behind it. I've seen photos from the time with people pointing proudly to signs erected outside their house that tell Japanese people to keep on moving because that was a white man's neighborhood.</p>
<p>There were people who hated the Japanese for Pearl Harbor, and there were others who were happy to profit from the misfortune of others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Give that US servicemen brought back Japanese body parts as war trophies and Roosevelt was presented with a letter opener made from an arm bone from a japanese casualty (he didn't accept it). There was serious hate for the &quot;Japs&quot; back then. I doubt most people gave a shit and thought it was a good idea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that the United States will still segregating blacks at this point in history.  Overt racism was pretty widely accepted.  So the idea of throwing every person with Japanese heritage into internment camps didn't bother most people.  They had Pearl Harbor and the war to use as convenient excuses.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
