		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just read <strong>The Age of Radiance</strong>, so I'll chime in a bit.</p>
<p>Seems like the first test of Fat Man in the New Mexico desert actually involved human photographers, with folks like Jack Aeby and Berlyn Brixner being mentioned as being at the test specifically to photograph the event. Brixner was told to be ready with his 16mm black and white movie camera to film the event. Aeby wore welder's goggles, though one of them had a crack in it and the brilliant light burned into his vision for some time apparently. The only mention I can find of where they were relative to the blast is Hans Bethe saying that the observation site of Compania Hill was 20 km away.</p>
<p>Then for the Mike test in the Pacific (hydrogen bomb), you get this described setup: &quot;Troops bullied Elugelab's coral rock and sand into a platform to improve the explosion's visibility, then built atop that a six-story-high shot cab. Seven mirrors reflected the explosion to streak cameras housed in a bunker, one of which could attain a speed of 3.5 million frames per second, A nine-thousand foot plywood tunnel with a shell of concrete filled with helium balloons would carry neutrons and gamma rays to instruments on the island of Bogon, almost two miles away. C-54 photography planes, F-84 sniffer jets, and B-47 and B-36 technical planes would orbit between ten thousand and forty thousand feet overhead.&quot;</p>
<p>So...yeah. Seems that for relatively close-up photography of a nuclear test explosion the method is the periscope in a bunker method.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of ways. You can of course put a good zoom lens on the camera and shoot from farther away than it may seem.</p>
<p>Or, you can build a really sturdy building. A couple feet of thick concrete can do wonders for survival of camera equipment even fairly close to the blast.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the use of a periscope. Bury your cameras a few meters deep and run a tube with some mirrors up above ground. The camera is going to be very safe and the only thing you need worry about is the destruction of your upper mirror and buried tube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually at least one book out there, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Photograph-Atomic-Bomb-Peter-Kuran/dp/1889054119" target="_blank">How to Photograph an Atomic Bomb</a> that describes the process.  With the proper shielding (heat shields, lead shielding to prevent the radiation from the explosion screwing up the film) and shock-absorbers, it's not that difficult.  What's trickier is getting the cameras and equipment back after the explosion when they're contaminated by radioactive waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>followup: with modern cameras, could they just be considered disposable?  like, have a wire running to each that goes to a underground bunker, the camera sends a live feed, the camera captures images, then a fraction of a second later becomes radioactive dust.  could modern cameras transmit images fast enough to outrun the blast?  they do have a headstart, being further away than what they are focused on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The people who put the cameras there place them underground or in strong structures, but then attach those same tubes to the cameras so that they can record the action while not being in the destruction area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
