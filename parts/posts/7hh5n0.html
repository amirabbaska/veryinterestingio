		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atomic clocks are among the most precise scientific instruments ever made, and play an important role in advanced navigation, secure communication, and radar technology. Kyriakos Porfyrakis and Edward Laird of the University of Oxford are working on building a hyperprecise atomic clock that could fit on a chip inside a smartphone.</p>
<p>They begin with a nitrogen atom, which resonates at a particular frequency and acts as a very precise reference point by which to track time. Since nitrogen is highly reactive, they have to trap the nitrogen atom inside of an endohedral fullerene-a sort of atomic cage made out of 60 carbon atoms-in their lab. To do it, they used a process called ion implantation. This process produces a molecule called N@C_60 that can easily be collected and stored (they even sell it for Â£200 million per gram).</p>
<p>But before they could put the molecule in a clock, they also had to figure out how to cancel out magnetic fields from the surrounding environment that could disrupt the energy level of the nitrogen atom within. Earlier this year, they developed a way to shield the nitrogen atom from external magnetic fields by applying a steady magnetic field that would cancel out any effects.</p>
<p>They recently wrote about their work for IEEE Spectrum (<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/materials/to-build-the-worlds-smallest-atomic-clock-trap-a-nitrogen-atom-in-a-carbon-cage" target="_blank">https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/materials/to-build-the-worlds-smallest-atomic-clock-trap-a-nitrogen-atom-in-a-carbon-cage</a>).</p>
<p>They'll be here starting 12 PM ET (17 UT). You can ask them about GPS, atomic clocks, nanomaterials, or anything else!</p></div></div>
