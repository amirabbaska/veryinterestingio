		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your pot has a very very smooth surface all around its inside, and you heat it gradually, it can become 'super heated', and exist at higher temperatures than 100°C. After that, when it starts bubbling, it will cool to 100°C.</p>
<p>And the amount that it goes over isn't a whole lot. But it is measurable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the conditions (mainly pressure, also purity of said water) you may get higher or lower boiling point (eg. Cooking on high attitude, pressure cookers) so you may get higher than 100. However it will not go over the boiling point before turning into steam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you were to boil water that was pressurized greater than sea level atmospheric pressure, then yes, it can get hotter than 100 °C. For example, if you were in a mine that was about 700 meters below sea level then water would boil at close to 102 °C. For another example, I've worked on a steam ship that boiled water at near 6000 kPA (~60x greater than atmospheric pressure) which meant it would get up to around 275 °C before boiling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So 100C is the boiling point for water at 1 atm. If you put a cover on the pot you prevent the water vapor that is more hot from leaving the immediate area. Doing this increases the pressure of the air and by extension the water in the pot. This is why if you have stuff in a pot with a cover and you take the cover off a lot of extra steam comes out right away. The water also boils a lot faster for a moment.
The 100 degrees is the average temperature because each water molecule that begins to vibrate at a rate where its temperature is higher than that will evaporate leaving the pot in the form of steam. That is what the bubbles are. They are the overheated water vapor coming out of the pot. Not actually air pockets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
