It was made from crushed lapis lazuli that was mined “beyond the sea (ultra-marine)” in Afghanistan. </p>
<p>There were other blue pigments like cobalt blue used in Chinese porcelain, but a cheap synthetic blue wouldn’t be developed until around the age of the Impressionists. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually blue pigment has been rare up until the manufacturing of synthetic pigments. Most of the blue you can see in old paintings is actually black mixed with white (it looks like grayish blue and your eye perceives it as blue because the painter has surrounded it with warm tones). True blue pigment, that was acquired from semiprecious stone lapis lazuli, was very expensive and so was mostly used in church paintings (for the most important figures) or very wealthy commissioner orders. There have been different minerals used as blue too but ultramarine is the most remarkable and stable.
There’s also the indigo dye, that was used in dying fabrics and still is. but thats not for paints because it needs substrate to hold onto (which is how synthetic paints also work). Crushed minerals did the work back in the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
