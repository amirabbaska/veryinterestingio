		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(I'm just a curious noobie asking questions :-) )</p>
<p>Shooting a photon beam into a nonlinear crystal (BBO) is a method (SPDC) of creating two streams of quantum entangled photon pairs in superposition.</p>
<p>The first stream of particles is called stream A, the second stream is stream B.</p>
<p>What happens if the second stream is directed into a second BBO crystal again and one obtains two new streams of B1 &amp; B2 particle pairs?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>are these photon pairs (B1 &amp; B2) in <em>super-superposition</em> ? how is this measured in Bell tests of the streams of particle pairs B1 &amp; B2?</p>
</li>
<li><strong>or</strong> was a 'state collapse' forced onto the photon B before it was split into B1 &amp; B2?</li>
</ol>
<p>If option 1 is valid:
do the Bell test results of the streams of B1 and B2 particles change if the particles in stream A are measured first? (likely not, correct?)</p>
<p>I am quessing the Bell test results of the B1 &amp; B2 pairs must be unchanged, and that means all B photons were forced into a state collapse, correct ... ?</p>
<p>Is there any type of experiment that creates a <strong>super-superposition</strong> ?? ( ... GHZ?)</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks to everyone for all the excellent replies! I very much appreciate the answers and food for further thoughts :-)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is a great question for me as I'm working in a research institute performing this exact experiment this summer! So I do want to throw out a few disclaimers though: we are not using BBO, we are currently using PPKTP and may be moving to something else. You may want to look into dense teleportation, to my recollection (this could be wrong), it involves double entanglement as you describe. I'm not usually the one who does a lot of the theory do please someone correct me (gently) if wrong on anything!</p>
<p>It is possible! And a few individuals are working on an experiment involving that right now. Also if you're interested, we have individuals working on experiments that involve other odd entanglement techniques (one technically challenging one is downconversion only to recombine/upconvert into (hopefully) the same approximate photon state used for downconversion!). All sorts of interesting stuff can be done with entangled states and I'm glad to see a question about it! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're quite allowed to have a superposition over more than two photons.  The GHZ state that you mentioned at the end is exactly that - it's usually a certain type of entanglement over three Hilbert spaces (photons), but you can extend the concept to any number of photons.</p>
<p>The GHZ state looks like (|000&gt; + |111&gt;)/sqrt(2) in its most common version, but the general idea is that you have &quot;n&quot; qubits (here we're using photons), and two terms in the superposition.  For each qubit, it should have a |0&gt; (or other single basis vector) in one of the terms, and a |1&gt; in the other.  For example, (|000&gt; + |111&gt;)/sqrt(2) is the usual one, but we often say that (e.g.) (|011&gt; + |100&gt;)/sqrt(2) is also a GHZ-type state, or (|0+-&gt; + |1-+&gt;)/sqrt(2), where two of the qubits are in the |+&gt; and |-&gt; basis instead.  Also, we can go to higher orders, and say have a GHZ-type state that looks like (|00000&gt; + |11111&gt;)/sqrt(2), though it becomes more difficult to make these.  These types of states have been made experimentally: <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v404/n6775/full/404256a0.html" target="_blank">this Nature paper</a> is one example (you can find the pdf online if you search the name of the paper).</p>
<p>Like your other answerers, I'm not in non-linear optics, so I'm a little hazy on the mechanics of SPDC and what would happen in it.  I can say, though, that the chance of SPDC happening with any given photon is really really small - something like one-in-a-billion (10^(-9)), so it would be quite hard to realise this scheme experimentally (but not impossible, and my information on it may be a little outdated).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I told you in another post you can in principle generate GHZ states by down-converting a photon that is already part of an entangled state again. </p>
<p>Down conversion, however, is a very inefficient process. While down-conversion of already downconverted <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4967" target="_blank">has been demonstrated</a>, it comes with relatively low efficiencies.</p>
<p>You don't get super-superpositions, but just superpositions in higher dimensions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got slightly lost but I think you are asking what happens when we entangle an entangled system.</p>
<p>As suggested you get another superposition but something really cool happen when you collapse the wavefunction: called entanglement transfer or teleportation. There was a recent experiment where they entangled two electrons that were separated by several km in this way.</p>
<p>This was done entangling both elections with photons and then bringing the photons to the same point in space and entangling them. When you measure the photons the two electrons become entangled without ever having directly interacted. </p>
<p>Here is the experiment:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no &quot;super-superposition&quot;... you just have a more entangled state. I'm not a quantum optics guy, I do superconducting qubits, but I'll make a guess. Say the outgoing field from the first BBO is |vertical&gt;+|horizontal&gt;. Say we aim the |horizontal&gt; component at a BBO for which the optical axis is horizontal. Since |vertical&gt; can't interact with the BBO, what leaves the 2 modes |vertical,vac&gt;. If we post-select on the SPDC process occurring, we should have |horizontal,horizontal&gt;+|vertical,vertical&gt;... so we have {|vertical,vac&gt;,|horizontal,vertical&gt;,|horizontal,horizontal&gt;} with some coefficients I won't worry about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
