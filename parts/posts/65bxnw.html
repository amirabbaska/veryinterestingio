		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well recently -  Panama Papers investigation has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting.</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://www.icij.org/blog/2017/04/where-are-they-now-mixed-fortunes-post-panama-papers" target="_blank">article</a> - Written on April 3rd</p>
<p>When the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and more than 100 media partners began publishing the Panama Papers investigation on April 3, 2016, almost no country was untouched by its revelations.</p>
<p>Governments in more than 70 countries have launched over 150 investigations, inquiries, audits and probes into the affairs of thousands of people and corporations linked to Panama Papers. Just last month, Malta’s tax office announced it had recovered more than $10 million as a result of investigations sparked by the Panama Papers and another ICIJ project, Swiss Leaks.</p>
<p>One year after the Panama Papers first became an international catchphrase, here’s a globe-hopping update on the people and institutions caught up in the scandal:</p>
<p><strong>The law firm and the eponymous jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p>In March, Mossack Fonseca, the Panama-headquartered law firm at the center of the Panama Papers affair, announced that it had been forced to dismiss 250 employees from its offices worldwide due to the “current media, political and economic environment.”</p>
<p>Authorities in Panama have detained Jürgen Mossack and Ramón Fonseca, the firm’s founders, since Feb. 9 on money laundering charges.</p>
<p>The men’s lawyer, Guillermina McDonald, denies her clients are guilty of wrongdoing and has accused Panama’s government of “selective justice” in its investigation of Mossack and Fonseca.</p>
<p>Last month, a Panamanian prosecutor held a press conference to update the public on the investigation into Mossack Fonseca, and claimed to have a “solid case” against the firm. Mossack Fonseca’s lawyers denied the government’s accusations and called for the men’s release.</p>
<p><strong>Iceland votes, but what has changed?</strong></p>
<p>Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, who resigned as prime minister two days after the Panama Papers story first broke, remains a member of parliament.</p>
<p>Gunnlaugsson, who was forced to step down because of reports linking him and his wife to an offshore company, maintains an active Facebook profile, posting about Icelandic banking, new hospitals and the delights of raw meat on crackers.</p>
<p>When his replacement, Bjarni Benediktsson, took over as Iceland’s new prime minister in January 2017, critics noted that his name, too, had been included in the Panama Papers. Benediktsson used an offshore company to hold four apartments in Dubai, he said in response to the Panama Papers revelations.</p>
<p><strong>Can’t stop the music in Russia</strong></p>
<p>Sergei Roldugin, a classical musician and close friend of President Vladimir Putin, has played on even in the wake of Panama Papers documents that place him inside a circle of Putin friends who used offshore companies and bank account to secretly move some $2 billion around the world. Roldugin played the cello at a concert in Palmyra, Syria, in May 2016, one month after Panama Papers reports about him made global headlines.</p>
<p>Later in 2016, Putin gave the cellist and conductor a national award to recognize his contribution as an “outstanding citizen.” In February 2017, Russian media reported that the government had granted a tax exemption to an education foundation established by Roldugin in the city of Sochi.</p>
<p><strong>Fallout differs in Pakistan and India</strong></p>
<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been under pressure for a year in the face the Panama Papers’ revelations that his children owned shell companies that held homes in London.</p>
<p>In September, thousands of protesters swelled Islamabad’s streets to call for Sharif’s resignation. Opposition parties have been attacking him in court, alleging that Sharif failed to declare his family’s offshore connections. Sharif and members of his family deny wrongdoing. A decision in the case by Pakistan’s Supreme Court is expected any day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the border in India, focus has been fixed on the efforts of the multi-agency taskforce created to investigate India’s black cash scandals: just last month, regulators announced that their probe has expanded to 424 Indian clients of Mossack Fonseca.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainty reigns in U.S. political upheavals</strong></p>
<p>With Donald Trump in the White House, it’s unclear what will happen with Panama Papers-related investigations started during the Obama administration by the Senate Finance Committee and by the office the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan.</p>
<p>In March, Trump fired Preet Bharara, long-time U.S. Attorney for Manhattan, raising concerns about whether aggressive investigations by the office would be stymied. The Senate committee did not respond to ICIJ’s requests for information on the status of the investigations while the Department of Justice refused to comment.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr - Still a lot of investigation is going on even though the process is slow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 on Sumit316's info:</p>
<p>People checking on the bad people win a prize for their hard work.</p>
<p>The bad people's company fired a lot of their people because everyone was looking at them and doing bad things that make money became hard to do.</p>
<p>The most important person, like the president, in a country called Iceland lost his job, but was given another big important job anyway. The person who got his job was also doing bad things, so many people wonder if more change should happen.</p>
<p>A big musician in Russia who is friends with the president-guy of Russia was caught with lots and lots and lots of bad money he probably shouldn't have. The president forgave his friend, which makes people look at the Russia president guy and wonder why.</p>
<p>Other countries, called Pakistan and India, have a lot of people running around and shouting for people to lose their jobs, because they also had bad money. Also, in our own country, the USA, a lot of changes (like the new president) have been going on, so no one really knows what is going on just yet. But some people who are supposed to look into the bad money were fired, so it's a good guess that less people will get in trouble.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of major figures mentioned in papers was current president of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko. Panama Papers pointed out that he was dodging taxes through offshores. There was no coverage in Ukraine at all about this. And if there would be, the country is so corrupt, hardly anyone would care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an attorney in Banking, I've done a lot of work on this. There were some stark revelations ( Iceland, Russia, Messi, Cameron) but mostly it just released a lot of private people's information (Emma Watson) and the vast majority of that isn't connected to illegal activity. </p>
<p>Mossack Fonseca wasn't some tiny firm hideaway. They were a global player with a decent reputation. So showing up their radar isn't the smoke people think it is. </p>
<p>A lot of people don't know what money laundering or tax evasion actually entails, so there's assumptions that a foreign holding corp must be illegal. They're typically not. </p>
<p>The most useful aspect of it is verifying client information since a lot of bank due diligence relies on the customer. You can see connections you wouldn't have otherwise been aware of and can follow up to measure your risk. </p>
<p>Considering the massive scope of the leak, it's surprising there isn't more out there. It doesn't really fit the narrative the icij puts out there. </p>
<p>Edit: don't get me wrong. This exposed a lot of actual mechanisms for how peps and individuals hide their wealth for various means, but nothing here is really new except for the few headlines and specific people involved A lot of people doing things legally have a lot of their private info out there now. Being rich isn't a crime yet, and I think people forget that. </p>
<p>Edit2: Some people seem to think that there's one guy in a room somewhere going through all of these docs and hasn't found the big prize yet. A lot of thy data can be checked with analytics and cross referenced. Not to mention anyone can and likely has searched all know PEPS celebrities and powerful names. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
