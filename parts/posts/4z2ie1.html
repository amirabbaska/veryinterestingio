Two arms, two legs, two eyes, two nostrils, etc.  Did any animal ever exist that normally had 3 functional eyes instead of 2??

<p>The third eye (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye" target="_blank">parietal eye</a>) is found in a number of animals (some reptiles, amphibians, and others). While it shares ancestral origins with 'regular' eyes, it seems to have developed mostly for sensing light/dark for circadian purposes (since it is basically hooked up to the non-human version of the pineal gland). </p>
<p>'Eye spots' and other photoreceptors seemed to have emerged around 60 million years before the Cambrian explosion, during which a ton of different body plans emerged, many of which ended up being evolutionary 'dead ends'. I don't know if any of them featured three equally functional eyes, but my bet would be 'yes'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it's not a vertebrate example, an interesting case of additional &quot;eyes&quot; with a clear purpose is flying insects.  A broad range of insects, from wasps to flies to grasshoppers to mantids, all have 3 ocelli, or simple eyes, arranged in a triangular pattern on their head.  The purpose of these small, light sensitive &quot;eyes&quot; is for orientation during flight: the insect points their head so that the top two ocelli are oriented towards the sky of the horizon, and the bottom ocellus towards the ground of the horizon.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these ocelli are anatomically separate from the compound eyes, and are hypothesized not to even be processed in the same way as visual information from the compound eyes.  So even weirder than having two sets of eyes, these insects have two completely separate forms of vision.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprisingly, nobody mentioned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triops" target="_blank">genus Triops</a>, which exists today as it has for hundreds of millions of years. It was named for the very fact it has three eyes.</p>
<p>You can buy triops eggs at your local aquarium dealer and keep them at home. They are spooky critters, a bit gross (to me at least), but very interesting to look at.</p>
<p>Here's a nice movie: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q-idlTxNxU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q-idlTxNxU</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost all vetebrate have a Pineal Gland in their brain. This gland produce melatonin which affect sleep patterns. </p>
<p>All of these parietal eye or third eye are always directly linked to the pineal gland and are view as an atrophied photoreceptor, which make sense since the gland is suppose to manage your sleep pattern. </p>
<p>Some prehistoric fish and early tetrapod apparently had a third eye socket, meaning that maybe they had a functional third eye, but we can't know for sure. Is the modern parietal eye an evolutionnary remain of those 3rd eyes or did those 3rd eyes and parietal eye both evolved from the same photosensor. </p>
<p>But it make sense for a fish to evolve a photosensor on the top of your head to help manage your sleep pattern. A third eye on top of your head will see sunlight better than your eyes in front. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, &quot; ... tuatara has a &quot;well-developed parietal eye, with small lens and retina&quot; ... (but) parietal eyes are also found in lizards, frogs and lampreys, as well as some species of fish ...&quot;</p>

<p>Pick up your average lizard and you'll see that big translucent scale between the eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
