		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer this you should know how sound waves interact with each other</p>
<p>Have you ever used <em>real</em> noise cancelling headphones? The headphones aren't just little earmuffs. They have a microphone in them and work by sending frequencies to your ears that are related to the sounds coming into the microphone, cancelling out the sound.</p>
<p>And have you ever been to a concert, where everyone sings along and it actually sounds pretty good? (Even though most of them are probably tone-deaf) That's because on average, people are singing the right note, so wrong notes get cancelled out by other people singing similarly wrong notes and everything sounds pretty good.</p>
<p>When you're out in a noisy environment, lets say a construction worker is using a jackhammer, it's really fricken' loud. But if it was in the city where there's lots of loud car horns it would seem less loud: partly because you're gradually getting more accustomed to louder noises, and partly because some frequencies will cancel eachother out.</p>
<p>Obviously, a random loud noise is scary. But if you're at a really loud concert you'll quickly get used to it because your body realizes that you're not in a dangerous environment. So if you turned up your volume too high, you'd be fine eventually, you just might suffer hearing loss. (Note: most - all headphones these days do have the ability to damage your hearing if turned up too loud, please preserve your ears.)</p>
<p>You should also know that, not all noises are created equal. Higher pitches are actually louder to our ears than lower notes, <del>so a song with some gnarly violin solos is going to mess up your hearing a lot more than a bass guitar.</del></p>
<p>I generalized a lot and I'm sure others may have more to add, I encourage any questions or corrections! :)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our ears have a way of protecting themselves from high energy sound â€“ it's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_reflex" target="_blank">acoustic reflex</a>.</p>
<p>The most delicate parts of our ears are the small hairs or <em>cilia</em> in the cochlea. Intense noises can damage them, so the acoustic reflex stiffens the bones that connect the eardrum to the middle and inner ear. A stiffer connection dampens the energy going into the cochlea. It can reduce the energy by a huge margin, between 15 and 20 dB, which is up to <em>90%</em> attenuation.</p>
<p>The acoustic reflex is triggered by loud sounds or vocalization, so when you are in a loud environment, your threshold for pain and damage automatically adjusts to the ambient sound level.</p>
<p>The most damaging sounds are ones that have a very quick onset, like gunfire. The acoustic reflex takes about 15 ms to take effect, which is too late to protect you from an impulse-like sound. Steady sounds, like a loud subway car, might have comparable decibel levels, but your ears have physically adjusted to protect themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The background noise from the loud room interferes with the noise you want to hear. This is pretty obvious; it's harder to hear someone in, say, a nightclub than in a library. Decibels are also measured on a logarithmic scale, so a doubling in sound wave pressure is something like a 6% increase to perceived sound. There's also the concept of the <a href="http://www.hear-it.org/temporary-threshold-shift" target="_blank">Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS)</a>, which is a kind of hearing loss / reduction brought about by loud noises. This is why the volume of the music player you set when you left work yesterday is now too loud right after you wake up, even though it's (theoretically) the same driving environment.</p>
<p>And because I'm too lazy to make another thread, I have doubts about Semoln's point about the concert. The crowd singing will sound in key because the majority of the crowd will sing correctly (more or less), while the people singing so badly will be in the minority, thus being drowned out. The point about the noise-cancelling earphones is correct though: if the microphone senses a signal of +X, it will produce a noise of -X to get a net result of 0. Also, yes, the noise will damage your hearing even if it isn't currently hurting you. Hearing loss begins at 80 dBa (spots car interior at 120km/h), and OSHA recommends no more than 90 dBa (passing subway train) over 8 hours or 110 dBa (chainsaw) for more than 30 minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The headphones are literally right on top of your ears meaning the sounds will be much louder and more intense. Also the sounds of the noisy room will be blocking out a lot of the sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
