		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no! River ecosystems are actually deceptively complex, there's a bunch of different types of organisms living in all different parts of the river. The easiest way to describe it would be to divide the river into three parts: The top layer of water (where the air and water meet), the middle, and the bottom (which includes all the sedeiment and dirt on the bottom of a riverbed). Different types of organisms exist in each of these sections, and some are more influenced by river flow than others. </p>
<p>Some animals, such as the planktons, are lazy. They will just float along with the flow of the river and accept wherever it takes them, and because they are usually photosynthetic, they don't really have to worry about gathering food and so can just float along wherever the current takes them.</p>
<p>Neustonic animals are the one's you're thinking of, and yes, they're able to fight currents to move around feely in river ecosystems. They can float above or under the surface, and if they wanted to stay in the same place then they'd have to use energy to swim against the river current. These can be fish, or even water striders which float along the top of the water.</p>
<p>Benthic organisms are those that live within the riverbed sediment, and will remain fairly stable in the same stretch of the river. Most of them have structures that help them cling to the bottom of the river bed, allowing them to stay in place.</p>
<p>Like another commenter has already said, many insects lay their larvae in the water to spend the first half of their life, before growing into fully realised insects and leaving the river later on. These can float along, or stay put, all depending on the type of insect and where larvae eggs are laid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I fish a lot of bass tournaments and something anglers seem to recognize is that a bass pulling on your line in a river is noticeably &quot;stronger&quot; for it's size than a similar sized fish caught in the slack water of a reservoir.  Of course there are other factors that may be at work, including the current itself making the fight harder, and the water temperature.  Cooler water holds more oxygen and produces a much more lively fish and since most rivers are fed by a dammed reservoir (the water from the bottom of the lake is colder and passes through the dam to create the river), river fish fight harder because of the elevated oxygen levels.  All that said, I can tell you that I catch my largest river fish set up behind an eddy of some sort.  An eddy is anything that disrupts the flow of water such as rocks, trees, sea walls, etc...  Based on my completely non-formal educated, cognitive knowledge, I say a larger fish is an older fish.  An older fish has more life-experience, making it in a sense &quot;smarter&quot; or at least more adapted to it's living conditions.  So a &quot;smarter&quot; bass knows to get out of the current and let the water bring the food to it, rather than swimming against the current constantly like smaller (younger) fish that chase bait every which way.  So in my estimation, experience counts.  I've also read research that showed bass caught in a tournament, tagged, then released miles away from the area they were caught, will return to the area over time.  Unlike salmon, bass don't use a homing instinct for breeding, so perhaps they follow water conditions which happen to lead them back home.  </p>
<p>TL/DR don't bother reading it, just a dumb country boy's speculation on how bass act in a river. I'm sure there are more entertaining/educated answers. </p>
<p>Edit: What!?!?  Gold for talking about fish?  Far too kind stranger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some animals, like aquatic insects, spend the first part of their life cycle on the water. You correctly assumed that the water tends to carry them downstream. However, many insects have an adult form that is non-aquatic (or flying). They tend to leave the water and travel back up the stream, near where they were born. The idea is that it must be a good place to lay eggs because that's where their parents did and look how successful they were. </p>
<p>Some vertebrates,, like salamanders, have been known to do this too. Usually, though, they are more able to resist water's strength</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the fish, they can move up and down a river, and even jump over small obstructions to move to different places (suck as sticks blocking a stream). Fish like salmon are famous for this.</p>
<p>Yes, fish constantly swim against the river current. They even do it while they are sleeping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trout fisherman here. There's plenty of fish that do live in a particular section of river and do have to fight the current. Trout are one type of fish that do this (steelhead are another story) even though they lack the stamina to swim hard or fast for extended periods of time, so they conserve their energy the best they can. They do this by taking shelter behind objects that sheild them from the current (and.from predators) like submerged rocks, logs and other structures. They also spend a lot of their time in &quot;holes&quot; which are bowl-shaped depressions on the river floor formed by erosion. Most of the force of the current flows right over them, so they don't have to expend as much energy to stay in the same place. The holes are also typically where they feed, because as food items (worms, bugs, whatever) float down the river with the current, they will hit the &quot;pocket&quot; of relatively still water formed by the hole.and sink down right into the waiting trout's mouth. </p>
<p>Since its common for many fish to hang out.in these.holes and it's where they like to feed, fishermen have found that if they figure out where the holes are and float some bait down the river into them, they can catch their limit fairly easy. </p>
<p>This is where the term &quot;fishing hole&quot; comes from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
