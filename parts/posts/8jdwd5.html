It was misshapen, had uneven weight distribution, and it's not like it's an object I throw regularly, yet I was able to accurately guess how to throw it, and how hard as well. </p>
<p>Is there a science behind how our bodies are able to make these calculations on the fly? Is it simple repetition and muscle memory, or is there something more to it?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, but in reality, is too 'big' a question to answer well in a reddit post.  </p>
<p>The short answer is that, over the course of your lifetime, you've developed a variety of motor skill schemas, basically blueprints for how to perform an action.  For something like throwing a bag of trash, you've developed that schema from lobbing beers to your friends, throwing a softball, laterals in football, or any other thing you've ever done that involves a similar pattern of movement.  </p>
<p>That schema is modified based on input from your body - the degree of muscle tension and joint position tells your body how heavy that bag is, and based on that, your brain can get a decent idea of how much force needs to be exerted (Relative to something you're more used to throwing), and then modifies that motor skill schema (say by recruiting more motor units to increase force) to try and achieve the desired outcome.  </p>
<p>That is an incredibly basic and shallow version, but until you can pare down your question to something more manageable, it's probably the best answer you're going to get.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception" target="_blank">Proprioception</a> is &quot;the sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement.&quot;  It's the high order control mechanism you use for compound motor actions like you describe.  I encourage you to read the Wikipedia article as it goes in to great detail about such a complex future of the human body.  A quick summary would be that you have constant sensory inputs from all your active and inactive joints and muscles which along with a lifetime of previous inputs to compare to, allows you to move you're entire body in a coordinated manner.</p>
<p>That was how your human body was able to make the toss, but I'd also like to point out that even though your daily garbage bags seem to be quite different, from a tossing standpoint, they probably behave very similarly and make for a great lesson on basic concepts in physics.</p>
<p>First, as you swing each bag back and forth while walking to the back door, you're exerting a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force" target="_blank">centrifugal force</a> with each swing.  What do centrifuges do?  They spin and the resulting bouyancy forces sort the most dense materials away from the center of rotation (toward the bottom of the bag) and the lesser dense material above it.  This means for two different bags where people tossed the same things in completely different order, you can end up with a very similar distribution just by swinging it a couple of times.</p>
<p>Once a bag is settled and there's no more shifting, it becomes a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body" target="_blank">rigid body</a> which makes it FAR easier for both physics students to calculate and your body to estimate the bag's behavior.  The only two variables that we need to be concerned about are weight and it's distance from the center of rotation.  You've picked up the bag so you already have a good idea of it's weight, but what about it's position in the bag?  There might have been a big piece of styrofoam at the bottom that the more dense stuff couldn't work its way around.</p>
<p>Fortunately a rigid rotating body with most of it's weight at a single point behaves as a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum" target="_blank">pendulum</a>.  When you swing pendulums, the period of oscillation is determined only by the distance of the weight from the center of rotation.  This means that bags where most of the weight is at the bottom will take much longer to swing through than a bag where all the weight is higher up.  </p>
<p>All of these sensations you feel as you walk with the bag provide all the information you need to estimate a good throw.  I should also mention that once you release your bag, it's center of gravity travels in a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_trajectory" target="_blank">parabolic trajectory</a>.  The thing about parabolas is that there are an infinite number of vertical parabolas which pass through the bag at launch and the dumpster opening.  The key is to know how fast the bag needs to be moving for all the different launch angles you can choose from.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

You've taken 100s of 1000s of steps, written 10s of 1000s of characters, thrown 1000s of balls, etc.  Your brain is good at doing error correction with feedback which we colloquially called &quot;muscle memory&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's my question is what part of the brain handles it?</p>
<p>Like we have the cerebrum which is where consciousness is thought to be somewhere, where we get our motives and intents and what not. </p>
<p>Then we have the cerebellum which is like a little computer that smooths out our motions and makes our motions fancy and elegant.  Very simple design but massively parallel, not unlike a powerful computer, more neurons then the cerebrum. </p>
<p>Certainly the cerebellum smooths out the motions of throwing the ball, and certainly the cerebrum is the one to identify the target, but how involved is the cerebellum in calculating the trajectory?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
