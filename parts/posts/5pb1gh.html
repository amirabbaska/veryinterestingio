		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Phases" target="_blank">17 known phases of ice</a>. When you deal with ice, you are almost always dealing with I_h which expands as it freezes. However, at different temperatures and pressures (pressure being the more important one here) different types of ice form. In the case of staying close(ish) to regular freezing temperature, and upping pressure until ice forms, you'd end up at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_III" target="_blank">Ice III</a>. </p>
<p>You're unlikely to see this outside of a lab though, since you need to put water into a container which can withstand over 43,000 PSI of pressure, otherwise the ice wins and will crack the container. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A few days ago I wanted beer chilled quickly. I put the glass bottle into a plastic cup which I then filled with ice and water.</p>
<p>I promptly forgot about the beer and opened the freezer yesterday. Beer and water were both frozen solid.</p>
<p>The plastic cup was broken, but the bottle did not crack, nor did the beer push out the top.</p>
<p>Why not? Did the pressure of the freezing water in the cup (which I assume froze first) push in and prevent breakage? If so, how did the pressure inside the bottle dissipate?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of maybe not really related, but maybe you would find interesting.  There is something called a triple point of water cell. It contains water in a glass tube essentially in a vacuum. When the cell is frozen to 0.1 C degrees all three states of water will exist simultaneously (solid, liquid, and gas).   I personally have used used it many times at work which is where I have my information, but I'll leave a link to a Wikipedia article.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you probably meant to specify a rigid container but otherwise the average plastic water bottle is designed with ribs so that the volume can change a considerable amount and permit the water to expand and contract through a range of temperature, including frozen solid, without rupturing the container.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

After a few hours, I take the bottle out and shake it about. The water is liquid, but because of the shaking, it goes into this 'freeze' mode and I can watch it become a slushy solid in front of my eyes in a mater of a second or two. Why does the water react like this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
