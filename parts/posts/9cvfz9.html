		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I presume the answer will be no. So I'll turn it into more what-if question:</p>
<p>There was recently news article about a company that stored energy using big blocks of cement which they pulled up to store energy and let fall down to release it again. Lets consider this is a perfect system without any energy losses. </p>
<p>How much would the energy needed and energy restored differ if we took into account position of them Moon? Ie if we pulled the load up when the Moon is right above us and it's gravity 'helps' with the pulling and vice versa when it's on the opposite side of Earth and helps (or atleast doesn't interfere) with the drop. </p>
<p>I know the effect is probably immeasurable so how big the block would need to be (or what other variables would need to change) for a Moon to have any effect? Moon can move oceans afterall. </p></div></div>

They either take advantage of the tide current themselves (like an underwater windmill) or close off an entire bay with a<a href="https://www.connaissancedesenergies.org/sites/default/files/image_article/energie_maremotrice.jpg" target="_blank"> dam like structure</a> fitted with <a href="https://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/1/47/74/05/20161125/ob_dcbdb5_centrale-electrique-maremotrice.jpg" target="_blank">turbines</a>. The main issue is that they only work well in specific places that get big tides and have narrow shallow channels closing of a bay. The local ecological impact on marine life and sediment movement is also non-negligible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do use the moon's gravity for tidal energy production but others can address that more accurately.  I just want to consider your example of the concrete blocks.</p>
<p>For simplicity I will assume that each block is 1kg, that the Earth is 384,400 km away from the moon and that the moon is 7.35*10^22 kg.  All of these numbers are pulled from a quick Google search so may be slightly off and incorrectly assume that all of the moon's mass is on it's surface (although that moves the mass further away and so works in our favor for demonstrating the point).</p>
<p>The force of gravity from one object on another can be expressed as (G<em>m1</em>m2)/r^2.  Plugging in our numbers we discover that the moon pulls on our 1kg block with 0.001 N of force.  Our block experiences 9.81 N of force due to gravity from the Earth.</p>
<p>So, if we timed our work such that the blocks were only stacked when the moon was overhead and only dropped when it is directly opposite us we would improve efficiency by roughly 0.0001%.  It's not nothing, but it is very very small and not worth losing the flexibility to store and release energy on demand.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am doing my math on my phone and may have missed a zero somewhere in the very small decimals involved here.</p>
<p>Edit: second disclaimer: as noted below, this calculation purely demonstrates how small the moon's gravitational pull is compared to earth.  It does not accurately represent how much more energy you could store &quot;for free&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the effects of the moon's gravity on your &quot;big block&quot; would be small compared to the Earth's gravitational pull, it would make a calculable difference.  Assuming a closed and perfect system and ignoring other external gravitational effects such as the Sun, you would have an increase in the potential energy stored in the mechanism as the Moon moves from overhead to opposition.  Using PE=mgh and giving our big block a mass of 1000 kg and raising it 100 meters the difference in potential energy would be 6.79 kgm²/s² (6.79 joules), which is not insignificant in itself though compared to the total potential energy of the system at maximum load it only equates to an increase of 0.00000692 %. Hence, it would take close to 400 years for the energy gain to equate to the equivalent of the potential energy stored in a metric tonne weight raised 100 meters. </p>
<p>This is how the moon affects the oceans to create tides.  If the moon's gravitational effect were stronger, tidal surges would be higher.</p>
<p>Good question.  I enjoyed playing with the math on this one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Using the tides to generate energy or as a source of useful work has been used in a very limited capacity since the middle ages. Water wheels powered by the tides filling and emptying coastal lagoons, or even artificial impoundments were used in some places on the european continent since the middle ages. the oldest discovered example is in Ireland and dates to the 600 AD's. Tidal mills were generally used to grind grain. By the 1800's there were several hundred examples in the UK, france, and the atlantic coast of the US. Again, these were quite small and used as a source of mechanical power rather than electricity.</p>
<p>This has been limited, and is still limited, by the ability to find coastal sites with sufficient characteristics to create strong tidal flow.</p>
<p>The major drawback to tidal hydropower is efficiency. Traditional styles of hydroelectric turbines are quite inefficient with a low &quot;head height.&quot; That is, the difference in height and thus hydrostatic pressure between the inlet and the outlet. Therefore, to generate enough power to be profitable, very large amounts of flow and large equipment are needed.</p>
<p>The second major drawback is that power can only be generated when the tide is close to it's lowest or it's highest, in general about 30-40% of the time.  Adding 2-3 stepped reservoirs in series can get around this problem, but this limits the head height problem still further.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, recently a number of large scale of tidal power projects have been developed, notably in france, south korea. The Rance river in France was developed as a tidal power station in 1966.</p>
<p>Since the 2000's a number of &quot;tidal stream generators&quot; with capacities up to 1000 kW have been installed, and many more proposed. These are similar in design to familiar wind turbines, but take advantage of the fact that tidal currents are much denser than air, and therefore carry more kinetic energy. The advantage of this is that a reservoir is not required so the ecological impact is much less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: the moon already indirectly generates electricity!</p>
<p>The Pentland Firth power plant uses turbines in the ocean to generate electricity (over 700 megawatt hours!). The turbines are turned using tidal changes (the change from high tide to low tide and vice versa) between the Atlantic Ocean and the a North Sea. The tides are a direct result of the moon's gravitaional pull on the Earth's oceans.</p>
<p>So: Moon &gt; Tides &gt; Hydroelectric turbines &gt; electricity</p>
<p>HOWEVER! As far as your idea of using the moon's gravity to assist in moving a cement block? It's a very negligible difference. The moon's effect on the weight of an object in the Earth's surface is about 1/300,000 of what the object weighs. So a 1000kg cement block would weigh ~999.9967kg when the moon is directly overhead. To have any actionable effect in generating useful amounts of electricity, the cement block would need to be the mass of the Empire State Building (~332 kilotonnes), and by then, the force needed to lift the block at will (or move it for that matter) would be near impossible to achieve. For scale, the heaviest object ever lifted was 'only' 20.133 kilotonnes. Anyway, the force needed to lift the object with and without the moon's gravitational 'help' would essentially be the same.</p>
<p>The reasons tides can generate that much force is because of the sheer mass of an ocean. The (very) approximate mass of all of earth's oceans is about 1.35 x 10^15 kilotonnes, so 1/300,000th of that in motion is such a great amount of kinetic energy, that harnessing it to generate even a few hundred TWh of electricity is far easier and more effective than trying to store potential energy by lifting a huge cement blocks (For reference, the entire world in 2014 consumed about 110,000 TWh of energy).</p>
<p>EDIT: actually kinda answered the cement block question :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
