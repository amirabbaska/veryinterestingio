		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In fluid dynamics there is a principle called Bernoulli's Principle which states that a flowing fluid (here: air) creates a lower pressure compared to the still fluid around it.</p>
<p>Of cause in this case it is surprising since you would think that the flowing air molecules would hit the ping pong ball and push it out of the socket, however the lowered pressure from the air that has to flow around the ball is enough to counteract both the &quot;push force&quot; from the air and gravity.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot of wrong, incomplete, or misleading answers here. I'm late, but since this is the best-asked aerodynamics question in the history of /r/askscience, here goes. If there's anything I hate more than wrongly applied Bernoulli, it's citing the Coanda effect. I cringe every time. <strong>For the love of God please stop mentioning Coanda.</strong> After a handful of aeronautics degrees, reading dozens of aerodynamics books and god knows how many research papers and conference presentations, I have <em>never once</em> heard a practicing aerodynamicist mention Coanda. /rant</p>
<ul>
<li>First, ELI5 explanation of how to interpret Bernoulli when you see a flow diagram. When streamlines (just a particle path if it's a steady flow) converge, this means the flow is accelerating (it has to because of conservation of mass.) When streamlines diverge, the flow is decelerating. Faster flow = lower pressure, slower flow = higher pressure. You can't exactly apply this to turbulent flow like in the following case without some further knowledge but let's forget that for now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, onto visual aids:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Vrgm5kv.jpg" target="_blank">This is what flow looks like past a sphere in open air, like a wind tunnel or outside, even flow going over it.</a>  That image is from &quot;An Album of Fluid Motion&quot; compilation by Milton Van Dyke. Incoming flow is basically pretty even, then heavily separates behind it creating quite a bit of low pressure turbulence. Pressure behind the sphere is lower than the oncoming flow, so it experiences drag (or would fly away with the wind if it wasn't held down.)</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IVd690i.jpg" target="_blank">This is a diagram of what's happening in your case</a> drawn by the wildly untalented me. Your lungs pushing out air are approximately at the same pressure as the ambient air (slightly higher, but don't worry about it). It's accelerating through a small hole creating lower-than-ambient-pressure. Now a <strong>huge difference</strong> in the geometry of this situation that you <em>don't</em> see in free air is that the toy forces the air through a very thin gap between the ball and the toy cylinder, including creating very fast flow on the side of oncoming flow, resulting in low pressure on that side (<strong>much lower pressure than you'd see in free air, though that still has lower-than-ambient</strong>). On the downwind side of the sphere, you'll have flow separation and a loss of pressure for sure, but not as much as the drop in pressure created on the upwind side. Without the toy there, you won't create enough pressure drop to suspend the ball from gravity.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's great that you moved on to testing a sheet of paper to see what would happen. I imagine that chance occurrences just like this drive much of our early scientific discovery.
Someone did something and got an unusual, unexpected result then tried to understand what could be going on.
Maybe Bernoulli saw something similar to this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your toy is basically a nozzle. When flow is forced through a small hole like that, the pressure drops dramatically. It's not a simple venturi effect, either, there are actually losses to the flow because nozzle like that creates a lot of turbulence, which quickly dissipates energy through viscous effects. This is useful, because the pressure stays low on the other side of the restriction, instead of recovering as it would for a venturi device.</p>
<p>The object stutters because it's unsteady. The drop in pressure depends on how much flow there is. When the ball restricts the flow, the pressure rises, which makes the ball fall, which then raises the pressure.</p>
<p>Simple flow restrictors like that are commonly used when there's a need to drop the pressure of a flow. There's a piece like that in your refrigerator, and that little 75-cent piece is crucial to the operation of the whole device. Forcing the refrigerant through the nozzle drops the pressure and causes it to evaporate, also dropping the temperature.</p>
<p>I wouldn't have expected it to work the way it did. Good work testing it on the paper, too, that made it much easier to figure out what was going on!</p>
<p>Something you could try which would prove this is to put the ball or the paper on the table. Then approach the ball while blowing through the tube. You should be able to suck the ball up into the tube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look closely at the inside of the toy, there is a small ~80mil orifice which grossly increases the speed of the airflow given that the airspeed is much higher, and hence the pressure becomes much lower by bernoulli`s principal, the pressure differential likely overcomes the momentum push force of the air. The air still needs to escape, that's why you need the oscillation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
