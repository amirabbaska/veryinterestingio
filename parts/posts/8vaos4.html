We've had significant advancements since then, and will probably continue to do so until it's launch in 2021. Is there a method for implementing these advancements, or is there a stage where it's &quot;frozen&quot; technologically? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was lucky enough to go to a presentation from Northrop Grumman about the JWST and someone asked that exact question. As I remember they basically said they design it to do a specific job, for a specific amount of time, so they use the tech that's available, finalise the design and that's it. They don't keep upgrading the CPU with the latest from intel just because there's now a faster one. I think that the truth is the tech is so bespoke that once they've finalized the design, they've got bigger things to worry about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bit of both. </p>
<p>The key component of some things, like the lenses themselves, are pretty much &quot;locked in&quot; at some point. We know we can build them today, and we know we'll find a better way to build them when we actually start manufacturing them. So, how they will actually be made is up in the air but we know the size and precision needed. </p>
<p>The next thing is that no one wants to send the newest tech into orbit - first generation things tend to break, and so when scientists discover some lighter than air nanomaterial, it's not about to make it into a satellite a week later. </p>
<p>But in 20 years, they've definitely improved a lot. Plans would have been generally drawn up, knowing that computers would change over time, and individual components would be tested and swapped out if they can work. Each time, someone would make sure that the weight, format, reliability, and everything else will keep working as planned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is absolutely a point where it's frozen. The final major design review in most defense-style programs is the Critical Design Review. This is the point at which the system itself is fully designed (as in schematics generated, parts selected, mechanical parts designed, drawn,  and analyzed).  Basically after CDR, you're &quot;ready to build&quot;. At that point, the system design is pretty much frozen, and any changes you make will cost you a significant amount of money, as you'll have to redesign parts of the system and basically redo the design review to show that the redesign still meets all the requirements.</p>
<p>So, in order to meet the CDR, you really have to freeze the technology a year or two before that date, so that you can actually do the design.</p>
<p>Design changes do happen post-CDR, but you really have to have a good reason to justify the additional cost and schedule impact. E.g. a part becomes obsolete, a vendor goes out of business and you have to find a new supplier/part, mission requirements change, etc.</p>
<p>For the JWST, it went through various levels of CDR in 2010/2011, and the various subsystems (e.g. the science instruments) did their respective CDRs in the ~2008 time frame.  So that's the timeframe you'd expect the tech to be frozen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think one thing that isn't mentioned in the other responses is that the things that are rapidly improving are not things that are the driving technology of the project. A super fast cpu on the satellite is not going to result in better pictures. The limit here is the lenses and recording tech.</p>
<p>For something like the lenses/mirrors, this project is the driving force behind the tech. Developing it is the project. No one else is making these and part of this project is to push the tech. Although the tech may be &quot;frozen&quot; at a certain point in the project, any more advancements that happen are probably part of the next super telescope project.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I know this one! I used to work on military and NASA funded space projects.</p>
<p>Here's a link to the broad outlines of the space acquisition process
<a href="https://www.dau.mil/acquipedia/Pages/ArticleDetails.aspx?aid=9a6a4b3f-d956-4365-88b8-585c70bc8d5d#anchorInfo" target="_blank">https://www.dau.mil/acquipedia/Pages/ArticleDetails.aspx?aid=9a6a4b3f-d956-4365-88b8-585c70bc8d5d#anchorInfo</a></p>
<p>Basically a satellite is a system of systems, with components like propulsion, telemetry, command processing, and &quot;science stuff&quot; that make up each sub-system.</p>
<p>Throughout the lifecycle of the acquisition process different groups will meet to finalize specifics regarding the materials and technology being used. Even small things like screws and glue are heavily scrutinized. These groups form what is called a &quot;change advisory board&quot; where different members of the project get to proposed changes, discuss their impact, and vote on them .</p>
<p>New technology is evaluated against a variety of factors that are specific to the mission at hand but generally break down along a standard set of lines; cost, schedule, and mission. </p>
<p>Generally any change is going to impact at least two of these items and the decision of what to except and reject, regarding changes, is left to the advisory board and the projects manager. For some projects, like JWST, schedule has been a low priority . Other projects like new horizons had a higher emphasis on schedule due to external factors like launch Windows and orbital mechanics. </p>
<p>So the answer is it depends on the specific project, but in general new technology is always considered along the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
