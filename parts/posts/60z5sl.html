<p>I have assumed that there's a dude clicking in everything in the corner of the stadium, but surely that person can't track it all. Are there multiple people? Is it automated? How does it work? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that no one tracks it on the field itself.  However, for radio/TV broadcasts and the general statistics they keep on people, there's people watching whose job is nothing but count points, who takes shots, passes, and the like, on clipboards.  They do this by uniform number (one reason they exist).</p>
<p>Of course, it gets relayed to the PA announcer in the stadium and the play-by-play guys so they can talk stats (&quot;Jones has 12 points so far&quot;).  Now, the PA/play-by-play can see enough to relay whose taking shots and the like, but anything else gets fed to them by people who do nothing but count that stuff or research records/history of players (last time Jones played against Michigan he had 23 points), and the like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The video is of Aussie Rules, but more than likely it is applicable to all sports. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was in charge of statistics for the Scotties Tournament of Hearts (Canadian women's curling championships) for a few games this year. I literally recorded every shot and gave it a score out of 4. The program I was using analyzed those numbers and spewed out stats. </p>
<p>I'm sure it's different in other sports, but there are definitely people who sit there and compute. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some sports, like baseball, have an official scorekeeper whose job it is to track everything.  Baseball is slow enough paced that one person can keep up, and they main function is to make judgment calls like error vs. base hit.</p>
<p>Most sports, however, don't worry about most statistics during the game, becomes they don't impact the outcome.  They let broadcasters track unofficial stats for their audiences, then have someone review the video later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would honestly look into the data revolution in sports. At this point, not only are they tracking data during the event, they are tracking data behind the scenes to ensure the investments are performing optimally. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
