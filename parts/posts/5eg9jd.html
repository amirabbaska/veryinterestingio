		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's how to get water out of your ear:</p>
<ol>
<li>fill the palm of your hand with water</li>
<li>lay the offending ear over your palm</li>
<li>quickly turn your head so that the offending ear faces upward, and the palm water goes into your ear.</li>
<li>listen for glub glub</li>
<li>turn head again so that the ear faces downward</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel warmth coming out? You're done. You can even do it while you're still in the pool. If it doesn't work, do it again. I've never had to do it more than twice to be done. 15 seconds.</p>
<p>What the fuck, yall. . . Has nobody heard of this? I've been doing it for as long as I can remember. A minute of jumping? hydrogen pyroxide? Spit water? If the above method takes 5 seconds, you're doing it wrong. </p>
<p>[edit]<br />
it works from a siphoning effect. Seriously nobody's heard of this?</p>
<p>The water is behind hard turns and narrow holes. Putting water on top, then draining that water, pulls the deeper water. The palm water won't get stuck as it's more water than the ear can contain.</p>
<p>Next time you go swimming, try it before you spend an hour going to the store for hydrogen pyroxide, vinegar and rubbing alcohol. Stand in your bathroom and try it.  </p>
<p>[edit 2] don't vote my bullshit homeopathy above the fucking doctor you knuckleheads.</p>
<p>[edit 3] great. thanks, internet... putting more importance on this one morons anecdotal bathtub tip than a real doctors information. I'm gonna go apply for WebMD right now... that'll show you fuckers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ear surgeon here (hear)</p>
<p>Wax comes from the keratin cells that make up the outer 1/3rd of the cell sandwich that makes up the main part of your ear drum. These keratin cells migrate, like your nails or your hair keratin so that any holes can be healed by a new sheet of cells growing out to the edge and replacing them. Kinda like a little conveyor belt. </p>
<p>When the sheet of cells comes to the hairy outer section of the ear they peel off, mix with natural oils in the skin and become brown/orange waxy substance called cerumen (ear wax) </p>
<p>If you jab q-tips (or cotton buds over here in the U.K.) into your outer ear canal it disrupts the normal flow of the conveyor belt and can ruin your body's natural clearance of the wax forever, leading to the need for removal by your doctor. </p>
<p>People always seem surprised that you shouldn't &quot;clean your ears&quot; with a q-tip, but I don't think that humans were deaf from ear wax accumulation for the first 100,000 years or so of our stroll outta Africa until Johnson &amp; Johnson came along. </p>
<p>TL;DR don't stick anything in your ear smaller than your elbow. </p>
<p>Edit: lot of comments rightly point out I didn't answer OP's question : ear canals aren't generally that curved, and most common cause is wax blockage which is strongly associated with cotton bud use (q-tips). People who swim in cold water often can develop small bony lumps in the ear canal called exostoses, and sometimes this is the cause instead. Most people feel their ears are blocked because of pressure changes in the middle ear, BEHIND the ear drum and yawning/popping your ears with your jaw (also google valsalva manoeuvre) can sort this it it is the root cause. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of straws. You know how you get the drops in a straw after u you've taken a drink? The ones that take up the entire space inside for a few millimeters? They stay there unless you blow them out, it's the same thing except the tube is open at one end only do you can't just blow in one end to push them out. </p>
<p>Next time, put your finger over one end of the straw and try and get the drops out. </p>
<p>Water also likes being next to other water, which is why it forms droplets rather than not bundling up together. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Am I going crazy? OP asked why it happens and everyone is giving old wives tales about how to get the water out. One guy just went on a rant about not using Q-tips</p>
<p>Anyway, to actually answer the question, it has to do with cohesion, aka surface tension. Little water droplets basically get into the small spaces on your ear, and are held in by the surface tension that holds the droplets together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is actually a really weird liquid due to its polar nature. Notice how if two droplets get close enough they snap together like magnets? It's not technically magnetism, but water molecules are strongly attracted to each other. That's where surface tension comes from and it leads to all kinds of strange things that aren't possible with other liquids. Have you ever seen a close up picture of how water striders stay on top of the water? That wouldn't be possible if it was, say, rubbing alcohol. The ear thing uses the same principles. I think the best illustrative example I could use is trying to pour every last drop out of a cup. The tiny drops don't pour out easily, because they're so small that the attractive forces of water easily hold it together in a droplet. As soon as two drops get close enough, the same forces cause them to snap together, but now the drop is too big and heavy to be held together and so it runs down and out of the cup. In your ear, there's just room for one tiny drop. It's shape and the polar attraction keep it inside your ear canal, but you can easily siphon it out if it connects to a larger mass of water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
