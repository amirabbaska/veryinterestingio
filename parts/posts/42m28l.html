I was taught a while ago that gravity is kind of like dropping a rock on a trampoline and creating a curvature in space (with the trampoline net being space). </p>
<p>So, if I place a black hole in the middle of the universe, is the fabric of space effected on the edges of the universe even if it is unnoticeable/incredibly minuscule? </p>
<p>EDIT: Okay what if I put a Hydrogen atom in an empty universe? Does it still have an infinite range?</p></div></div>
