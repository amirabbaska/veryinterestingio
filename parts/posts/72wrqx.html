		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you ever just randomly think of a morbid situation that could happen that relates to whatever normal thing you're doing? For example, say your at a movie theater. The movie is about to begin and your feeling relaxed, when the thought of an armed madman busting through the doors, shooting everyone, and killing you pops into your head. Why do we think things like this? What's it called?</p>
<p>Edit: decided to add another example to maybe get my point across a little better. Say you're driving, stuck in traffic. You get stuck waiting under an overpass and there are a lot of cars packed closely together all sitting right above you. Suddenly out of nowhere you think about the very tiny possiblility of the overpass becoming weak with the weight of the cars, and crashing down on top of your car. It's almost like 'final destination' type scenarios popping into your head for no real reason at all. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT:<strong>Please do not put much weight into the OCD aspect. Anyone can have intrusive thoughts and people with OCD can not have them. While I have noticed that in my case they fuel each other I did not intend for that to be the main point of this post. If you have intrusive thoughts it does NOT mean you have OCD or any other disorder.</strong> Also thank you everyone for the upvotes and responses. I am so happy to know I helped.        </p>
<p>These are intrusive thoughts.     </p>
<p>Essentially they are a result of the fact that the brain doesn't focus on/remember good or bad thoughts, but extreme thoughts. A beautiful woman walking past you and you think about her, that's a REALLY good thought, you will think about it later. Getting a 25% raise is a great thought, it will stick with you. For the same reason if you happen to think about killing your own child (you don't always get to choose what pops into your head) Your brain will recognize it as a terrible awful thing that you don't want to happen. It's so far to one side of the spectrum so your brain emphasizes it.             </p>
<p>Sometimes the brain has to identify what the wrong thing is in order to not do it. When you think of somebody shooting up a movie theater your brain is just &quot;indexing&quot; it into the bad category. The reason the thought seems so important is because your brain is telling you &quot;make sure this doesn't happen! this is a bad thing! Don't let this happen!&quot;                   </p>
<p>I have talked to a lot of people about intrusive thoughts and the big problem most people have with them is that they obsess over them. THey blame themselves for having the thought and feel like they are a terrible person for having the thought, but really all that's happening is your brain is indexing it. If somebody tells you not to think about killing your own mother, you will think about it at least for a moment simply to recognize what the person said. The thought will probably bother you and make you sad, and that's what it SHOULD do. If more people just learned to recognize that the pattern of &quot;have bad thought---&gt;feel sad about it&quot; Is perfectly reasonable and normal, and move on, these thoughts would not bother us nearly as much.           </p>
<p>My dad always told me I will never have full control over what I think, but I will ALWAYS have control of what I do. And that's what matters.        </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusive_thought" target="_blank">Intrusive Thoughts</a> and there's a fascinating Wikipedia page all about them. Basically there's a whole category of very common thoughts that are unwelcome but hard to get out of your head. They usually fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggressive thoughts</strong> – ex. causing harm to elderly people, imagining or wishing harm upon people, impulses to attack small children or animals, impulses to be rude or inappropriate to people</li>
<li><strong>Sexual thoughts</strong> – ex. thoughts or images of kissing, touching, or raping people</li>
<li><strong>Religious thoughts</strong> – ex. sexual thoughts about god, saints, religious figures, bad thoughts or images while praying or meditating, fears of sinning</li>
</ul>
<p>I've always thought that even though we don't talk about them often, intrusive thoughts actually bond a lot of people together, and if we could only eliminate the taboo of talking about them (you can't really control what you think about, can you?) then we'd realize we actually have a lot more in common with other people than we think. Even the bad stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am going to share a personal story, to try and make a connection between what was going on in my head and provide a contextual answer based on my own experience. I am not a professional psychologist, just a lot of passion for psychoanalysis since I did catch myself quite a few times having apparently random morbid thoughts.</p>
<p>I was 19, just got my drivers licence. My family and I were travelling to my grandparents for a holiday. I somehow convinced my dad to let me drive, because it was an 8 hour drive at least.</p>
<p>For the first few hours, everything was fine, but out of the blue my dad told me he wants to take over ( he must've noticed that I was tired because we had to wake up very early, but was too proud to complain), so I sat on the passengers seat and we continued. </p>
<p>I started dozing off, as one does on a long, boring, family road trip, and as I closed my eyes, thoughts of a crash came before my eyes, and I started thinking about that. What would I do if we crashed, or what if out of the blue something happens to my father, he has a seizure, and we crash.</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking that, I opened my eyes to some worried sound my mom made, to see that my father is having a seizure while driving 80kmph. Luckily, his muscles contracted away from the steering wheel, and feet didn't push the pedals any further, but moved back, so I managed to grab the wheel with one hand and push the break with my other hand and stopped the car safely. Luckily we were on a long bend, so car didn't fly off the road immediately and I had more time to react than I would have if the bend/turn was any sharper. </p>
<p>There were also a few different situations in which I started thinking morbid/dark thoughts, and your question here made me think about why. </p>
<p>One explanation that I have is: it is our brains natural process of preparing ourselves for the worst case scenario, so that we can be ready in case something goes wrong. It's like a piece of a dream thought during which we are awake (dreams helps us cope and give answers to some questions we ask ourselves... yadayadayada). Those are my 2 cents, hopes it provides enough context for the question.</p>
<p>Maybe, just alphas have those thoughts because leaders of a pack have to be prepared for the worst in every situation! I myself, however, am a whiny lil' bitch, so that's most likely not the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things like this pop into my head all the time. I'll be at the grocery store in the checkout line and I'll get the image of the woman in front of me getting her skull bashed in with a hammer. At least once a day these types of thoughts pop into my head.</p>
<p>Sometimes it <em>really</em> freaks me out though. I recently just had my first kid as a new dad. When we first got him home, I constantly had thoughts of hurting him, and even killing him. This freaked me out bad to the point where I would avoid taking him into even remotely dangerous areas (like the kitchen, because knives). I did some research on this since it was obviously very disturbing for me to think those things. They are indeed <strong>intrusive thoughts</strong>, and can even be exacerbated by anxiety.</p>
<p>It turns out I'd been worrying a lot about my newborn son -- keeping him safe and being responsible for his well being brought on some anxiety that was attributing to an increase in these thoughts. The fact that this little human can't survive without me, it's a scary thought. It's like I feel the anxiety of being as vulnerable as he is. After I started acknowledging this in my head, any time those thoughts would come on my brain was able to reason them away to me being a protective new father, and over time, the thoughts have more or less become a rare occurrence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may get buried but consider your dreams. Sometimes they make sense. Others they seem odd at least on the surface. Sometimes though, they involve situations that are relevant, like real world scenarios. </p>
<p>They did a study on people where they made them play a skiing arcade game, the kind you might find at a large arcade, that you actually stand on and lean and such. They'd do this often and before bed. These peoples dreams would involve the skiing. It was a problem that their mind recognized. &quot;I need to be prepared&quot; type thing.</p>
<p>Now apply that to these thoughts. Do horrible things happen? Yes. Can they happen to us? Yes. Your mind knows that. It's a little more complicated when awake I'd think since you can guide or allow that initial seed thought of the overpass collapse to continue into a whole complicated scenario. </p>
<p>Now compounded on to that, if those thoughts spur a gut reaction of horror, it's easy to have your mind form a sort of thought loop. Consider anxiety attacks. You feel that first wave of panic, but it's not just that. It leads to the &quot;oh no it's happening&quot; thought loop. It grows and grows. Or another example would be the &quot;don't think of a pink elephant.&quot; Fearing the thoughts brings them to us. </p>
<p>I think these morbid thoughts play a role. The top comment is a good example of a coping mechanism in action. They use them for good. They act. They prepare. A good thing to do I'd say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
