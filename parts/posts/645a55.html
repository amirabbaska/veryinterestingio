		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is of course affected by mass distribution. That said, the differences are mostly pretty small. The earth's gravity field, for example is very subtly lumpy. Mapping this is an ongoing effort of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (it's important for guidance systems).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barring some physics I'm not privy to, gravity will be distributed in proportion to mass. However, mass is not something that is always evenly distributed. More dense areas will be more massive given the same volume. </p>
<p>So let's take the Earth as an example. You would, in theory, have gravitational spikes (more like ripples) over areas with huge uranium veins.</p>
<p>I'm guessing that the way that the Earth's gravitational field actually manifests is more complicated than that, but if the Earth were uniform density everywhere except the uranium vein (which was more dense) you could theoretically detect it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on whether your mass is equally (homogeneously) distributed. Generally, if there is more mass, the gravitational pull will be larger. If I recall correctly, due to the shape of the earth, being not perfectly spherically symmetric, the gravitational acceleration one experience is different at different places. However, this is very small.</p>
<p>Basically, to get the total gravitational pull on a point due to a massive object, you should sum the contribution of each infinitesimal volume of mass inside the massive object. This means multiply each volume element with the density at that point and then devide by the distance squared to the point in which you want to know the gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Now, it is easy to see that in homogeneous bodies, this force doesn't change from place to place, because at every point inside the body, the density is equal. However, in inhomogeneous bodies it does change since not all infinitesimal mass points are equivalent, and their contribution will vary when the distance to them varies (i.e. if you change position relatively to the mass object).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to differences in the Thickness and materials of Earth's crust in different places, gravity can be a bit different depending on where you are. The ESA launched a satellite a few years ago to <a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-06/esa-satellite-maps-earths-gravity-3-d" target="_blank">map out these differences</a>.</p>
<p>There are also other things that can change how much gravity you feel. YouTube channel Cody's Lab <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkG1iFanoNo" target="_blank">did a video this week</a> exploring all these things. Skip to 11:00 if you just wanna hear about the crust stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It fluctuates based on the density of the various parts of the mass, and we can use that to look inside a large mass. The NASA <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/grail" target="_blank">GRAIL</a> program was a pair of lunar satellites named Ebb and Flow tightly synced to each other that orbited and measured the gravitational fluctuations over the moon's surface, allowing NASA scientists to map the gravitational field of the Moon even more accurately than we have the field of Earth mapped. We're able to use that information to describe the internal structure of the Moon from the crust to the core, and the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/grail/multimedia/pia16587.html" target="_blank">map</a> solved a decades-old puzzle about the origin of lunar mascons, concentrations of extra mass that increase the gravitational pull over a specific spot. Turns out that they're caused by ancient impact sites, and the information gleaned from studying them has increased our understanding of the mechanics of large impacts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
