		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In mattress sales over here, and the type of mattress that people buy can affect this a lot. That's why there's all types of sleep guarantees, and if you don't like it you can return it type of sales. When someone who always sleeps on their side gets a really nice firm mattress they aren't going to like it. It's going to put too much pressure on their shoulders and hips. Same way with a back sleeper switching to a soft mattress, it will not give them nearly the same support that they're used to. </p>
<p>Think about it like this, in your home you want slippers. They're nice and cozy. On a run you want tennis shoes, they're durable and flexible. When you're on your feet all day, you'd want a nice pair of dress shoes with enough support to help with your posture, but at the same time having a good comfortable sole. With stomach sleepers you want a very soft mattress to take the stress off of your lower back. Side sleepers want soft mattress to conform to their curves, but also enough support to keep from sinking in. Back sleepers need support to keep their spine in line. Not a perfect metaphor, but it gets the job done. Sometimes one might have to change the way you sleep based on the type of mattress you have. </p>
<p>Just because someone has a great mattress, it doesn't always mean it's a great mattress for them. P. S. Buy a mattress protector with at least a 10 year warranty, yes they're expensive but it goes a heck of a long way. </p>
<p>Edit: they're, their, there. Because that seemed like the end of the world to some people. </p>
<p>I will admit that was pretty atrocious though. I apologize for completely not proofreading.</p>
<p>Edit: I want to point out that if you have a firm mattress and you sleep on your stomach, I'm not saying that you need to go out and buy a new mattress tomorrow! Honestly if you're feeling pain then try to sleep on your back. I had to do this and it was super annoying at first and it honestly took me about 2 weeks to completely adjust, but once I did I started getting wonderful sleep with the same mattress I already had. </p>
<p>Edit: I'm not sure why people are so skeptical of my advice considering I'm getting no commission off of this, and the chances of me running into any of you is extremely unlikely. Take it as you may, I'm just trying to help out the everyday type people. </p>
<p>Final Edit: When I said tennis shoes I meant athletic shoes in general. I grew up around people who referred to athletic shoes as tennis shoes. I know the difference, but I'm just so used to calling them tennis shoes. Kind of like how a lot of people will call tissues &quot;Kleenex&quot;, or call lip balm &quot;Chapstick&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Habit for most, sleep apnea for the people who can't sleep on their back.</p>
<p>As someone who works in a sleep lab, I see a lot of people who &quot;only sleep in (x) position&quot; change that position once they're actually asleep.</p>
<p>Its just a matter of routine for most people.</p>
<p>Edit: Stop messaging me about your sleep positions. If it hurts see a doctor. If not then that's nice. </p>
<p>Double edit: Banned for violating rule 1. Can't honestly say it isn't deserved. Also a bunch of people here are big whiny babies. I bet it was that one tech saying Dental Appliances were BS because fuck him on particular. I'll probably regret this later but I'm drunk so that's tomorrow me who has to deal with it.</p>
<p>Could be worse, could be Trumpeting sober. I feel like we should call Ill advised hostile social media posts Trumpeting. Gonna make it a thing.</p>
<p>Triple edit: most upvoted comment and no gold? Fuck you birches.  I want a golden shower like I'm a president in Russia or a black child  at an R  Kelly show. Yeah. R Kelly pees on children. Second black president 2020.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry about format. I'm on mobile :) </p>
<p>Sold mattresses for years. Still weirdly passionate about it. Here's my take:
Our bodies are made to sleep on our back. Unfortunately, a lot of times our pillows and mattresses work against us. I would see a lot of people (usually elderly) come in and say &quot;I have back problems. I need something firm for support.&quot; Unfortunately &quot;support&quot; and &quot;firmness&quot; are two very different things! Think of what your spine looks like: it isn't a straight line, is it? It's curved. So when you lay on something hard your spine goes down to meet that hard surface as opposed to that surface coming up to meet you. THEN you have springs in most mattresses. They have what I used to call a &quot;push back system.&quot; Those coils, no matter what they are made out of, are constantly trying to go back to their natural position causing pressure points along your body. It may be subtle but it's why a lot of people toss and turn! Their body can feel those coils pushing on them after a while.
Does a softer bed help? Somewhat! But what if you're not comfortable on a soft bed? No problem! My number one recommendation will always be a high quality memory foam bed or a hybrid (there's enough memory foam between you and the coils to make it pressure relieving). My personal favorite is a Tempur Pedic because science. Like, for reals. They have put a shit ton of research into those beds, BUT there are other options that aren't as pricey!
If you get around to searching for a new bed the #1 way you will find a mattress that works for you will be to lay on that bed for 10-15 minutes. I don't care what sales people say, trust your body and keep an open mind!
Pillows? Go see your chiropractor. They have this kick ass pillows that are weird at first but they'll fix you right up!
Hopefully that helps somebody! Having what we called in the biz &quot;a good sleep system&quot; seriously helps your quality of sleep and really your quality of life. I slept comfortably at 9 months pregnant, which is usually unheard of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience as a massage therapist there isn't really a prefect answer. Most of this is just preference and what the body is used to. </p>
<p>If you're a side sleeper, it's not that you <em>can't</em> sleep on your back it's just your body isn't used to it. If you laid there long enough you would fall asleep. And vice versa. </p>
<p>For those wondering, best sleeping position is on back with pillow or some support under the knees. If you're a side sleeper stick a pillow between your knees. Don't sleep on your stomach. (But thanks to those who do because you keep me in business.)</p>
<p>Edit: usually stomach sleepers have neck pain because the neck is always on one side for hours at a time. If you don't have pain and it's comfortable then go for it. If you wake up with a sore neck then consider changing positions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep technologist here and in my experience, position dominance is quite common due to sleep apnea. Typically the fight or flight syndrome kicks in from the individual having sleep apnea, or lack of oxygen, and patients find the less destructive position. Many patients that tell me &quot;I can't sleep on my back&quot; aren't lying. This is because the body will interrupt sleep to breathe since they aren't breathing while sleeping. When apnea occurs continuously, sleep is significantly interrupted and the heart is stressed from reduction of oxygen in the blood. Too often the individual will turn to their side as a result where apnea is less frequent and severe. Same goes for many patients sleeping on their stomach. However when sleep apnea is resolved, many of these people that &quot;can't&quot;, sleep on their back, end up doing so quite successfully. Hope this makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
