<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you again to everyone. The argument I was in started because I talked about retro fitting an auto with a motor and batteries, and charging with my houses solar system. I was told I would be wasting my time and would only be making a show off statement. </p></div></div>

<p>This is long-disproven propaganda that was false <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/2kou6r/does_anyone_know_what_happens_to_the_batteries/clnlkue/" target="_blank">when it was first aimed at the Prius</a>, and it's still false now.  Every lifecycle analysis in existence (eg <a href="http://www.environment.ucla.edu/media/files/BatteryElectricVehicleLCA2012-rh-ptd.pdf" target="_blank">Aguirre et al</a> and <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903729a" target="_blank">Notter et al</a>, to name a few) tells us that the large majority of environmental impact for cars is inflicted in operations rather than manufacturing, and that any increase in manufacturing impacts for hybrids and EVs is more than made up for by operational efficiency gains.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, propaganda dies hard, which is why people continue to claim that hybrids and EVs are worse for the environment by citing the batteries, even though lifecycle analyses conclusively disprove that.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I love when they come up with these crazy comparisons.    They just completely make things up and then don't explain how or why battery manufacturing is that bad.     Like the other poster said this has been debunked again and again.    There are many life cycle studies that show this is the case.   It is the same with fossil fuel elelctrical generation.   Even when an EV is charged by fossil fuels it can still have a lower lifetime footprint then a gas powered car.    One study is here and takes into account the battery manufacturing.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To clarify/build upon some of the responses here:</p>
<p>There's a difference between <strong>lifecycle</strong> of a product (it's total impact over the total period of time it is used) and the <strong>manufacturing</strong> impact of a product.</p>
<p>In regards to electric cars, their impact tends to be higher for the manufacturing of the product, but they are wayyyyyyyy more efficient in the long term (<a href="https://ecotricity.co.nz/cradle-to-grave-emissions/" target="_blank">this article suggest 7-10 times more efficient for a car's lifetime of use in NZ</a>).</p>
<p>EDIT: NB, the &quot;7-10 times as efficient in NZ&quot; claim assumes that you're using renewable energy. Due to the energy sector here, that's a relatively easy task (almost all night time energy is renewable due to low demand).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since weâ€™re exploring all aspects of the efficiency argument here....</p>
<p>What about potential changes in consumer behavior with electric vehicles that have a higher up front cost but lower cost per mile to operate?  We would expect owners of electric vehicles to travel more than owners of combustion engines because the cost per mile of travel is lower (though perhaps this is offset by the limited range of electric cars and/or relatively inelastic demand for miles traveled).</p>
<p>Greater efficiency re energy consumption per mile still holds, but overall consumption of resources could theoretically increase if consumer behavior changes significantly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've got a question here:</p>
<p>I see the responses on manufacturing vs lifetime impact and I wanted to ask - what if your city only uses fossil fuels to generate electricity? So with an EV you would reduce the usage of petrol which means that impact from production and usage of petrol is reduced, but to charge your EV you use more electricity generated through fossil fuels. Based on this trade off is the total environmental impact lesser?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
