		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speed bumps are intended to force drivers to slow their speed.  Most are designed in such a way to make it uncomfortable for the driver to take them too fast, but are not intended to damage their vehicle.  Others are poorly designed and <em>will</em> damage the vehicle, even at a reasonable speed.  Even properly designed speed bumps can damage a vehicle if the vehicle is going much too fast, though.</p>
<p>The wear and tear you experience going over a speed bump is negligible.  You'll experience more wear and tear through simple road driving because you do more road driving than you spend time driving over speed bumps.</p>
<p>Thing to remember about speed bumps is this: the speed that it is safest to driver over the speed bump is the speed you are supposed to be driving on the road even where there are no speed bumps.  If you are going 45 mph, then slow down to 25 mph to go over the speed bump, accelerate back up to 45, slow down to 25, again to go over the next speed bump, you are doing it wrong.  You should be traveling 25 up to the speed bump, over the speed bump and between the speed bump.  The city likely placed the speed bump on that road because drivers are travelling that road too fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
