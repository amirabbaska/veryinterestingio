		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Did you give them your phone number? Even if it isn't public, if some idiot installs the facebook app on their phone and has it in their contacts, facebook will link you. Same for email address - if someone has that in their phone's contacts or gave facebook access to their emails (e.g. has both the gmail and facebook apps installed).</p>
<p>I recently saw someone from way far away with 0 friends in common who I have emailed a few times for something very specific and business-related as a suggested friend.</p>
<p>Facebook actually <a href="https://spideroak.com/articles/facebook-shadow-profiles-a-profile-of-you-that-you-never-created" target="_blank">builds profiles on non-members based on members' data</a> and then links the two if that person ever does join facebook.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the higher ups with the company I work for is always showing up in my suggested friends. He's not in my contact list at all. No phone number. No email. Nothing. We have no mutual friends. I don't have anything linked to my workplace on my profile at all. We don't even work out of the same building or the same city for that matter. I would really love to know how that works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of ways. If you have the account signed in on your phone, it can read your contacts and find their Facebook accounts.</p>
<p>An obvious way: it looks at mutual friends.</p>
<p>If you use apps via Facebook, it could look at other people using those apps, people you've used it with and people nearby who've used it.</p>
<p>It could and probably does track the location of users (via IP addresses and GPS) and - if it finds you spend a lot of time with particular accounts - might consider that you were friends.</p>
<p>It might also buy data from Google, Yahoo or Hotmail about the people certain people email, and find accounts registered to your frequently contacted email addresses.</p>
<p>Finally, it's unlikely but possible that if you create multiple accounts from the same computer, it will automatically associate them with each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
