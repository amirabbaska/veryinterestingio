		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are over 200 viruses responsible for giving you a cold, so there is a lot of variability between these that your body will deal with over different time lengths, the usual length is 7-10 days if you get a cold but it can be less or up to three weeks. Sometimes your immune system can react quickly to the virus and snuff it out (especially if you have been infected with it before or a virus that's very similar - this is called adaptive immunity and is how vaccines work). Also as others have said there are many other viral and bacterial infections or allergic reactions (e.g. a particularly bad day of hayfever) that will present similar symptoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ear, nose and throat doctor, here. Why does it rain for 5 minutes, sometimes, and other times rain for 3 days? The bigger issue here is why one would assume any illness would be predictable or nailed down to last a certain duration? There is a lot going on, biologically.</p>
<p>Some replies are stating &quot;different viruses, different durations.&quot; Sure, but, there is some significant variation in th e same household. Each person has a certain tuning or calibration ton their immune system. Lots of factors affect how the immune system functions, including the patient's other medical problems, state of nutrition, fitness, emotional stress, sleep deprivation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical Lab Tech in Microbiology here: you PROBABLY didn't have a &quot;cold&quot;. 1) Many non-viral ailments have symptoms indistinguishable from a cold; allergies are a good example. 3) If you start antibiotics and that takes care of it in a couple days, then it was a bacterial infection, not a cold(viral). 2) There are a handful of viruses that also have the same symptoms, but are known to only last up to a week (&quot;Coronavirus and Respiratory Syncicial Virus&quot;). An actual cold, or &quot;Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus&quot; lasts 7-21 days.
If your symptoms go away in 2-3 days (without a zinc zupplement), my best assumption is it was just allergies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm guessing you didn't have a cold then. Common cold is a virus and takes several days (up to a week), to flush out. Other fatigues/illnesses can develop cold-like symptoms. From my experience, temporary allergic reactions are often mistook for cold (runny nose, sometimes with thick brown mucus, tiredness, cough...). I'm currently having an allergic reaction and I didn't know up until yesterday whether it was cold or allergies. Sucker gave himself away when for the first time this week, my eyes started to water and itch -&gt; antihistamine -&gt; problem solved.</p>
<p>Again, this is just a guess. Maybe a cold infection could disperse in a day, although that would be the first time I've heard about it (annoying little f***er)
A real doctor/bioligist could give you the definite answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
