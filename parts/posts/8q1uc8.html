		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it momentarily cause the bottom of the bottle to move away from the beer faster than the beer can move. this creates lots of tiny vacuum bubbles. the beer then rushes into this gap. each of those becomes a nucleation site for the dissolved carbon dioxide to form dozens of small bubbles. this basically turns all the beer contacting the bottle into foam. fun fact if the original hit is just right the vacuum pressure can cause the beer to slam back into to bottom of the bottle so hard it blows out the bottom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the impact of a weight against the mouth of a bottle triggers a compression wave, which hits the bottom of the bottle and bounces off as an expansion wave. Then the expansion wave hits the free surface of the liquid and bounces back as a compression wave, and so on and so on until the waves are damped out. Because the free surface is relatively close to the bottom of the bottle, we get a train of expansion and compression waves, driving the rapid cavitation of the air bubbles in the beer.</p>
<p>The air bubbles collapse due to the train of expansion-compression waves, forming clouds of much smaller daughter bubbles. These daughter bubbles have a larger surface to volume ratio than their parent bubbles, and therefore expand much more quickly. This turns the liquid to foam and results in buoyant clusters of expanding air bubbles that rise to the surfaceâ€”and swiftly make their way to the mouth of the beer bottle.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's called cavitation.<br />
the bottle moves down faster than the liquid is able to move and thee is some sort of vacuum wich then in turn pulls the liquid down very fast and &quot;shakes up&quot; the liquid as if you would shake it forcefully. most often cavitation occurs in high pressure hydraulic lines where the liquid moves very fast and little cavitation bubble/explosions form and damage the walls of the lines. Edit: P.s. not true that it is a vacuum more of an under pressure</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A trick for opening stubborn vacuum packed jars (pickles, red sauce, ect.) is to hold it bottom side up and give the bottom of the jar a firm smack with the heel of your hand.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its cavitation as many had said. Just wanted to share a lesser known outcome of what you described above. Its possible for the bottom of the bottom bottle to shatter out. Also don't do this to people is a good way for some one to accidentally drink glass or slice their mouth open if the bottle chips or breaks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
