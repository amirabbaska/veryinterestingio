		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say you have some object with mass.  It's mass causes gravitational attraction. </p>
<p>If you could instantly turn all of the mass to energy, and somehow keep it all together in the same space the object occupied, this energy would have the same gravitational attraction as the object it came from. </p>
<p>Both mass and energy contribute to the gravitational attraction of an object. </p>
<p>Realistically, the gravity field of your object would disperse in a roughly spherical pattern as all of that energy expanding at high velocity. You would still have the same total gravitational attraction, it would just be broken into millions or billions of smaller fields. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr In cases we have directly observed where mass-energy conversion in a gravitational system is significant, gravity itself will be transporting energy away from the system via gravitational waves. </p>
<p>To fully understand this, you have to use Einstein's General Relativity instead of Newtonian dynamics. </p>
<p>In General Relativity, spactime curvature (i.e. gravity) is generated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stressâ€“energy_tensor" target="_blank">stress-energy tensor</a>. In the limit of weak gravity, the T00 term (labeled &quot;energy density&quot;) dominates, and we recover Newtonian gravity. </p>
<p>If we have strong gravity, the other terms in the stress-energy tensor matter as well. The &quot;momentum density&quot; terms are what give rise to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging" target="_blank">frame dragging</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitoelectromagnetism" target="_blank">gravetomagnetism</a>. With strong gravity, the equations describing spacetime curvature become nonlinear because the potential energy of the gravitational field itself adds to the gravitational field. </p>
<p>So, to completely answer your question, it depends on the system you are studying. For a star, a negligible amount of mass is converted into energy (compared to the star's mass), and any gravitational effects of the outgoing radiation will be very small. </p>
<p>However, if you instead consider a <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/jun/15/ligo-detects-second-black-hole-merger" target="_blank">binary black hole merger</a>, then a significant amount of mass-energy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave" target="_blank">radiated away by gravitational waves</a>. In the link about the black hole merger, almost an entire solar mass's worth of energy is lost to gravitational radiation! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, mass doesn't get converted into energy. Mass is energy and vice versa. To answer your question then, it is energy which causes gravitational attraction and so the no matter what you do to an object, the gravitational field doesn't change unless some of the mass/energy dissipates. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you convert 1kg of mass into energy via e.g. matter-antimatter annihilation, gravity still interacts with that energy in whatever form it's now in (e.g. as photons).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
