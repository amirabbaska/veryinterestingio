		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have often heard that alcohol intake during the first few weeks of pregnancy is harmless, due to the embryo getting nutrients not from the mother but from the yolk sac. I've tried to read up, but haven't found anything conclusive. Wikipedia confirms that the umbilical cord is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord#Development_and_composition" target="_blank">not developed until week five</a>, supporting the &quot;harmless-hypothesis&quot;.
But other sources claim that the embryo/fetus can indeed be affected by alcohol intake before week five. According to <a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/developmental-timeline-alcohol-induced-birth-defects" target="_blank">this article</a> written by a researcher at the ASU, &quot;in the third week after fertilization that specific alcohol-induced birth defects begin to affect the developing embryo&quot;. The article lists many aspects of how the early development can be affected.
I've seen loads of other sources claim the same thing. But how does this work, if the embryo/fetus is not even connected to its mothers bloodstream yet?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So before the umbilical cord is developed, the new embryo is already implanted onto the mother's uterine wall. Basically in early development, the zygote has gone through several divisions to become a blastula. This ball of cells makes its way to the uterus and will eventually make contact with the uterine wall and implant itself into the mother's cells. </p>
<p>The site that this occurs will eventually develop into the placental attachment in later development, but the initial contact happens very early, well before 5 weeks. At this point, the embryo is attached to the mother but there's no real circulation happening and is instead passive diffusion from the mother's body is the biggest factor.</p>
<p>With regard to ethanol: since ethanol is an ambipathic molecule, it can easily pass through cellular membranes and disrupt them along the way. Now I don't know how much passive diffusion would allow the ethanol and resulting acetaldehyde to affect the embryo at this point, but there is definitely a route that the embryo could be affected by alcohol consumption before placental development.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So yes, the umbilical cord isin't developed till week 5, but at around the 12th day after fertilization the utero-placental circulation is established between the maternal sinusoids and lacunae in the syncytiotrophoblast. While maternal blood is not in contact with embryo proper(the part that is the baby) per say nutrients and things are diffusing across into the fetus. </p>
<p>Excessive alcohol intake around the second week time, a time where the mother usually doesn't even realize she is pregnant, affects the cells in the caudal(towards the tail) of the embryo's germ layers. This leads to a condition called caudal dysgenesis aka sirenomelia. </p>
<p>So in short, yes the embryo doesn't have a umbilical cord but that doesn't mean exchange isin't taking place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a maternal and child health MPH student. Decided to do some quick research on this for you.</p>
<p>I found two studies, both  of which women were interviewed about alcohol intake before pregnancy and during pregnancy (including very early pregnancy). </p>
<p>1) In the first study, &quot;There was no association between alcohol consumption before 15 weeks of gestation and small for gestational age, reduced birth weight, preeclampsia, or spontaneous preterm birth.&quot;
2) In the second study, &quot;We found no systematic association between binge drinking during early pregnancy and child intelligence.&quot;</p>
<p>I can't explain the biology behind it, as I am not knowledgeable in that area, but it appears research suggests it does not harm the fetus (since the children are being born in normal condition).
Now, this is not to say you should drink if you know you are pregnant and it is early in the pregnancy. It's always better to be healthy than put the fetus at risk. The first few weeks of development are critical to a fetus' outcomes, both in birth and throughout life, so staying away from anything harmful is advised. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During embryonic development, alcohol can change or delay the differentiaton of different cells. </p>
<p>Other people already said alcohol could reach the embryo without going through the cord. </p>
<p>When cells differentiate, 1 cell type can form different cell types after devision. Also, cells migrate during development. Disruptions cause developmental defects that will also affect other development later on. Basically, development is one big cascade of crosstalk and reactions.</p>
<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome can already occur when the mother isn't aware she is pregnant yet. 2 beverages can already kill some cells that play roles later on. I think it is recommended to not drink alcohol when you are planning on getting pregnant. </p>
<p>Im on mobile now, so I can't look up specific papers. You might want to look into Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Also look into somite/neural crest differentiaton. Disturbances in these cells might lead to neurological problems and facial deformities. Once again understandable because the cell gives rise to multiple tissues.</p>
