		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, your body is an engine. Our bodily functions produce heat. If we kept all the heat, we'd cook ourselves and die. We need to get rid of the excess heat. In room temperature-ish conditions, enough heat leaves our body to the air without sweat. When the temperature is hotter, less heat is transferred from our skin to the environment (heat flow is proportional to temperature difference). We need a new method to shed the extra heat that's not flowing into the air. The body then sweats, with extra heat being taken away by evaporating water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer this question from a physics point of view. There are obvious biological components to the mechanism of body temperature control, but I'll leave a discussion of those to experts in that field.</p>
<p>Our bodies constantly produce heat. Averaged over a day more than a regular tungsten light bulb. This heat has to go somewhere, because if it doesn't leave our body, our body temperature would keep rising. There are a number of mechanisms to shed heat. An important one is heat conduction to the surrounding air. Heat is transferred from our body to the air, cooling our body and heating the air.</p>
<p>The rate at which this happens depends on the difference between the temperature of our body and the temperature of the air. If the difference is large, the rate of heat transfer is large. As a sidenote, this is why a breeze helps cool you down as it replaces the air that was just warmed up by your body with cooler air.</p>
<p>When the difference in temperature between the air and your body is small, the rate of heat transfer is small as well and can be insufficient to properly get rid of the heat you're producing. Especially if you're active (sports or physical labour) and you're using a lot of energy and therefore producing a lot of heat.</p>
<p>This is when the body activates sweating as a cooling mechanism. The evaporation of sweat draws heat out of your body in a process called evaporative cooling.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion: The reason that you're sweating when the air temperature is still below your body temperature is because you're constantly producing heat and other cooling mechanisms become insufficient well before the air temperature reaches your body temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is constantly producing extra heat that it needs to get rid of and put into the air. However, if the air tempature is too close to your body tempature, than your extra body heat won't be absorbed by the air fast enough. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I cannot really answer the question better than it was already, but I'd like to explain how our body generates so much heat ..</p>
<p>Well the 37C is not really the temperature that your entire body has , more like the normal value where we can measure it (37 is for oral , 36.5 is for armpit and 37.5 for rectum)</p>
<p>The temperature in the body do varies a lot , for example the lowest temperatures are in you hands/feet , and the highest is in your liver(40-41) , meanwhile the most organs in your abdomen and thorax are around 38.5.</p>
<p>There are 2 main ways your body generates heat:</p>
<p>Mechanical work (the muscles use the energy to create movement , however only 30% of the actual energy is converted into force , the 70% is transformed into heat) </p>
<p>Metabolism. In order to generate energy for your body to work , you need to make catabolism (you destroy exogenous substances that comes from food , or endogen substances from own body structures and you generate energy). The main organ that does catabolism is liver , and 55% of the energy is &quot;wasted&quot; as heat.</p>
<p>The blood that goes through your liver will warm up and will also warm the other organs that will be close , but as it get farther away it will cool down (that's why you have much lower body temperature on your extremities) .</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Conveniently for us, heat likes to spread out. Heat doesn't conduct well directly into air though, so it can't just freely leave our body. Heat does conduct well in liquids though, so we release water through our skin that. The sweat absorbs heat from our skin until it evaporates into the air, taking the heat with it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
