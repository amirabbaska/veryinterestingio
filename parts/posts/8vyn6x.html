		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most cellars were concrete, very hard to run electrical through the wall buy simple to drill in the top and insert a bulb fixture.  A string works without any additional wires. Switch requires wires ran to the switch point. </p>
<p>Edit: yes there are plenty of other reasons. And you might have a pull string in a modern house. I don't care, I gave a simple explanation for concrete cellars like my grandma had for canned food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its easier to to install a fixture with a draw string than to wire to a switch. There are fixtures with the draw string already set up and because basements are usually less likely to be seen by company, the aesthetics are less important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>It's cheaper to install than running a line to a switch.</p>
</li>
<li>It's safer in rooms where water is present or that could potentially have water on the floor. Touching a poorly insulated switch with wet hands or standing in a pool of water could kill you.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK a lot of bathrooms still have a string. My understanding was that this was to avoid potentially wet hands touching a switch and causing an electric shock (very unlikely sure but still). As cellars can flood or are susceptible to damp could this factor be another consideration perhaps?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's cheaper. You'll usually find the pull string in unfinished basements, and that's what they are, unfinished. The assumption is that if you finish the basement you'll install switches, otherwise this gets the job done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
