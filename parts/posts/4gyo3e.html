		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cooking pasta is essentially hydrating dried pasta. You can &quot;cook&quot; pasta in room temperature water, it just takes very long.</p>
<p>Increasing the temperature of the water also increases the rate of absorption (water into pasta). Since we like to spend as little time as possible when cooking, we use the maximum temperature of water. Also, it's easy to identify water at 100° (boiling). It won't go higher either, so it's also a good standard to estimate cooking times from.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This one I can't say for sure, but it might be that the increase in absorption rate increases exponentially with temperature (ELI5: that means that the difference in absorption rate between 20°C-40°C is less than between 80°C-100°C.</p>
<p>Theorectically, you could cook pasta even faster using a pressure cooker (don't know the correct word for it, it's essentially an airtight pan), since higher pressure means water will have a higher boiling point, meaning you can cook your pasta at &gt;100°C... But you'd have to be very impatient to not want to wait +/- 10 minutes to cook pasta.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: The above only applies to <strong>dried</strong> pasta, not fresh.</p>
<p>Also, please scroll down to /u/Tinlad 's comment about gelatinisation of starches (which is dependant on temperature).</p>
<p>As for fresh pasta, it's just kneaded flour and egg. Leaving that in cold water would rather dissolve than cook it. The high temperature of boiling water will denaturize the proteins (think raw egg -&gt; boiled egg) and gelatinize the starches. I don't think this is the full story, but this is all I know now... feel free to expand on this :).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>no one has taken into consideration dry vs fresh pasta.</p>
<p>Dry pasta, you are hydrating it only for the most part.  You could put it in warm water and it would hydrate just fine, albeit slower.</p>
<p>For fresh pasta, you need to cook it otherwise you are just eating dough.  For that, you definitely want water boiling and damn near close.  The cooking is going to cause the proteins in the glutin to do its thing as it is heated and cause the structure change and now when you bite, you get that small pop rather than teeth going through dough.  The heat is for the protein restructure from dough to pasta.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biochemistry answer - Starch molecules (that largely compose pasta) have a certain helical structure (with alpha glycosidic bonds, I believe). Dried pasta has no water associated with these starch molecules, but when the starch molecules undergoing boiling, the glycosidic bonds are &quot;loosened.&quot; This loosening allows incorporation of water molecules directly into the alpha helical structure of starch molecules. </p>
<p>The heat involved is related to the energy required to denature or &quot;loosen&quot; the starch glycosidic bonds. I believe the denaturing is technically destroying the hydrogen bonds between glucose monomers that stabilize the alpha helical structure.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bit late for this, but anyway, I'll offer an engineering perspective since it's a common example we use to teach heat transfer.</p>
<p>Cooking is the process of heat transfer to an object in order to make it edible. Your question specifically asks the difference between 80C water and 100C water that causes it to cook faster. The difference, primarily, is the 20C increase in the temperature. But also, a contributing factor is that the boiling itself causes movement in the water, which causes heat to transfer faster.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the math, the relevant equation is newton's &quot;law of cooling&quot;</p>
<p>Q= h (Twater-Tpasta)</p>
<p>Q is the heat transfer rate, h is the coefficient, and T water and pasta are the temperature of water and pasta. Boiling causes the &quot;h&quot; to increase as well as the T water increased to 100.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there's also what is called the coupled heat-mass transfer effect where while water is absorbed, it brings its heat in along with it in addition to the heat normally being passed into the pasta. (Edit: As opposed to say putting it directly on a 80C frying pan)</p>
<p>As other's have noted, the &quot;cookedness&quot; of dried pasta is more linked to the hydration of the pasta as well, but I think your question was linked more to the properties of heat transfer.</p>
<p>Also as a fun fact, salt added to pasta does add a lot of flavor to the pasta, but that's not the only reason why you add it to your pasta water before boiling. You've probably noticed that adding salt to your boiling water makes it take longer to boil. That's because adding the salt makes the boiling point actually increase. This will help cook your pasta faster in terms of the amount of time it spends in the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
