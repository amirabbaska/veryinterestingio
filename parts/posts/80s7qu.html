		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sloths move so slowly for one main reason. It's efficient. Natural Selection doesn't select for the fastest and strongest, but the one that is most suited for their environment. The key to sloths survival is that they use their calories extremely efficiently. They have a slow metabolism, and have evolved to have a lower body temperature than other mammals. They found a weird niche to fill, and it's a winning strategy.</p>
<p>Sloths eat leaves, which are inherently low in calories. If I remember correctly, it takes multiple weeks, if not over a month for the sloths to digest the leaves they eat.</p>
<p>Sloths largest threat is habitat loss. Other predators do sometimes eat sloths, but the trees are fairly safe for them to hide and thrive in.</p>
<p>Sloths actually have tons of insects and algae that actually live in the sloths fur. A sloth is it's own ecosystem.</p>
<p>Surprise fact. Sloths can swim.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Survival of the fittest doesn’t mean the strongest life forms ‘win’. It means the most suitable lifeforms reproduce. The obvious ‘winning’ animals are the ones that are strong and fast enough to stave off their predators or catch their prey and thrive.</p>
<p>But there are many strategies for success. Some species produce so many young that the majority of them can die and the species still thrives. Some species evolve to be able to eat and digest almost anything and thus survive in niches where they have almost no competition.</p>
<p>Many species try to reduce risk. For instance by being camouflaged so predators don’t spot them. Living in social groups so there are more eyes, ears and noses to watch out for predators. Many predators hunt from ambush to reduce the risk of injury and most only hunt when hungry because it makes little sense to risk your life picking a fight if you’re not hungry.</p>
<p>Sloth’s have a strategy that revolves around efficiency. They spend much of their time asleep, well camouflaged in hard to reach tree tops. Every time a herbivore leaves their nest or hiding spot to go find a meal, they risk attracting the attention of a predator. Sloths minimize their energy needs and thus minimize the risk they need to take risks in foraging for food.</p>
<ul>
<li>They need very little energy, thus very few risky foraging trips</li>
<li>They’re very well camouflaged to the point where a whole ecosystem of molds and mosses grows in their fur</li>
<li>They stay small and light enough that they can hang around the treetops where the branches are so thin, most predators can’t even get to them</li>
<li>They’re not just energy efficient, they’re also waste efficient. They excrete little and infrequently</li>
<li>Predators are motion activated, ie. motion attracts their attention and they’ll have a hard time spotting still prey (it’s actually fight, flight or freeze, where freeze is the most common response for animals). You’re going to have a hard time spotting a sloth if you rely on motion</li>

<p>Sorry for posting it twice but figured folks might not see it buried in my earlier response.  Addresses the why and how of sloths including diet, digestion, and metabolism.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Deliberately in that case, they were introduced to boost the sport fishing industry. But similar examples could easily happen naturally as a result of geological events for example. An earthquake diverts a river, introduces a fish to a lake it had not previously occurred in. A cold snap creates a temporary land bridge between previously isolated habitats. We know this can happen, we know it has happened, but it unfortunately doesn't leave a lot of evidence of the whole process. When humans do it, it tends to be documented which makes the science a lot easier and more definitive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mechanistically, their skeletal muscle contracts slowly intrinsically. The myosin crossbridges that produce movement cycle slowly compared to jack rabbit myosin. Slow movement conveys two advantages, low metabolic rate and protection from predators who are triggered by prey movement. By staying in trees they are forced to eat leaves, not very nourishing food. As such, arboreal protection comes at the cost of slow movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
