		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Declaring bankruptcy is seeking legal protection from your creditors (people you owe money to). As far as personal bankruptcies go, chapter 7 is what people generally think of when they bankruptcy. The courts allow you to discharge your unsecured debts (credit cards, medical bills, personal/ payday loans, civil lawsuits, repossessed vehicles, foreclosed real estate, etc). The entire process takes a few months to be discharged and you also have to income qualify- if you make more than the median income in your state you would have to pay back some portion of your debts. You can only do this once every eight years, it will bring down your credit score as you have demonstrated that you were unable to pay back your debts and creditors in the future might not want to lend to you or only will at a higher interest rate. </p>
<p>A chapter 13 is a bit different and can deal with other debts as well as unsecured. You would file this if you make too much for a chapter 7, if you are behind on a financed vehicle/ real estate that you want to keep, if you have a lot of back taxes to pay off or to freeze student loans. A monthly payment would be determined based on which of those debts are being dealt with, how much the debts are and also on your income. You would make this payment to a bankruptcy trustee for 3-5 years and your unsecured creditors would receive a percentage of their debts, secured creditors receive 100% (generally). You would be discharged of any unpaid debts at the end of the bankruptcy. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the <a href="https://redd.it/jerb3" target="_blank">previous thread</a> - this is a great ELI5 version </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like you're Five: On the day you get your allowance, you buy a bag of candy. The next day, you want more candy, but you spent your allowance, so you ask your brother if you can borrow his allowance, and pay him back with your next allowance. You buy another bag of candy. The next day you ask your sister if you can borrow her allowance, and promise to pay her back when you get your allowance. You buy another bag of candy.</p>
<p>When you finally get your allowance, you realise you're in trouble - you can't pay your brother and your sister. You get so worried about it that you go buy a bag of candy instead. When you get home, you get in a big fight with your brother and sister about it.</p>
<p>When your Mom asks what you're fighting about, your brother and sister tell her that you borrowed money and you won't give it back. She asks you why not, and you say that you spent all of the money on candy, and you don't have any money left. She sighs, and makes you give all the candy you have left to your brother and sister. They want to know when they get their money back, and she tells them the money is gone, and they need to stop fighting with you and forgive you. They say that that isn't fair, and she says that it really isn't, and that they should remember this the next time you ask them for money.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bankruptcy is a highly nuanced area of the law. With that in mind, I provide the following answers in <em>very</em> ELI5 terms.</p>
<p>Let's first make a distinction between &quot;bankruptcy&quot; and &quot;solvency.&quot; The terms &quot;bankrupt&quot; and &quot;insolvent&quot; are often used interchangeably in common discussion, but they are entirely different (albeit related) legal concepts. &quot;Solvency&quot; refers to a person's/company's ability to pay his or her debts. If you are unable to pay your debts as they come due, you are &quot;insolvent.&quot; &quot;Bankruptcy&quot; specifically means the legal proceedings in which an insolvent debtor pays, reorganizes, and/or discharges its debts.</p>
<p>So in any bankruptcy proceeding, you have a debtor (the bankrupt party) and (usually) <em>several</em> creditors to whom the debtor is indebted. The problem is that the debtor has no way to pay back the creditors. Bankruptcy provides an orderly, judicially-administered process by which the debtor partially satisfies and/or reorganizes its debt. In very general terms, bankruptcy seeks to maximize the recovery for creditors in a way that protects the debtor from being constantly mired in an unending cycle of lawsuits and debt collection. Without bankruptcy, creditors would essentially race one another to the courthouse to try to get as big a piece of the debtor's remaining assets as possible. This would create situations where a debtor's credit card company (for example) could get a 100% recovery on the debtor's credit card debt, while the debtor's mortgage lender (who is owed way more money) gets nothing.</p>
<p>As you note, there are several chapters of bankruptcy, which include:</p>
<p>Chapter 7, Liquidation - In this chapter, a debtor's assets are liquidated (auctioned off for cash) and the proceeds are divvied up among the creditors. In the context of an individual person's bankruptcy, there are several carve-outs (&quot;exemptions&quot;) for property that they get to keep, in spite of their debts. If an individual debtor obeys the rules of the bankruptcy court (e.g., doesn't try to hide assets), he'll get a &quot;discharge,&quot; which means that (most of) his debts are wiped clean at the end of the proceedings. If the debtor is a company, ALL of its assets are sold and it essentially dies.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, Municipal Bankruptcy - A rather uncommon type of case, chapter 9 cases involve municipal institutions that have become insolvent. It permits the reorganization of their debts <em>kind of</em> like a Chapter 11 below.</p>
<p>Chapter 11, Reorganization - In these cases, the debtor (usually a business) still has a lot of value and income. It just needs a little help to pay its bills. In a chapter 11, the goal is to come up with a &quot;plan&quot; that reorganizes the terms of the debtor's debt. If a plan is successfully confirmed, it becomes the new deal between the debtor and the creditors going forward.</p>
<p>Chapter 12, Farmers and Fisherfolk - This is essentially a specific type of Chapter 13 bankruptcy (below) available to farmers, fishermen and the like. These are kind of uniquely positioned debtors because these are often blue collar jobs that require very high capital commitments.</p>
<p>Chapter 13, Reorganization - Available only for individual persons who meet specific debt requirements, these are quicker and easier proceedings that permit an individual to reorganize his debts.</p>
<p>Chapter 15, International Bankruptcy - Chapter 15 permits creditors or debtors in a foreign bankruptcy proceeding to obtain certain bankruptcy relief in the U.S.</p>
<p>So that's it in <em>very</em> broad strokes. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I meet all kinds of people in my line of work. Just because someone is &quot;homeless.&quot; Doesn't mean they are broke. They may have more money in their chequeings account than you do. I have met some of these people. They just like the lifestyle of being off the grid and not have to answer to anyone. Weird, but to each their own.</p>
<p>One man stands out in the back of my mind the most. Has a cellphone, regular bill and PO Box. Has a Facebook account and is a professional violinist that has seen more of the world than I ever will. He also used to makes violins by hand. And lives on the street. I met him when I arrested him for trespassing into an old factory. He broke and entered to stay warm. As that is not an indictable offence, charges were dropped and he just had to pay damages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>File for bankruptcy in bankruptcy court. Follow all the correct rules and procedures. Judge bangs gavel. Makes debt disappear.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 is for throwing in the towel. You sell your assets, except those assets which are exempt. The proceeds are divided among your creditors. You get any change leftover. There won't be any change leftover. All of your debts, except for certain kinds like student loans or debts that you got because you hurt someone go away.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 is for hitching up to the plow. You agree to work for 3 or 4 or 5 years and some amount of your proceeds go towards your creditors. At the end, all of your debts, except for the same kind mentioned above, go away.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 is for reorganization. Businesses with a ton of assets who got too far in debt to dig themselves out can do this. The creditors may take over the company, or you may get to keep it. It depends on what you can bring in and what everyone, including the court, agrees to.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 is like Chapter 13, but for farmers.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 is like Chapter 11, but for cities.</p>
