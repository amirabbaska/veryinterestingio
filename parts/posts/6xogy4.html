Another reason is that reading down a list with uneven row heights isn't as easy and doesn't look as good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you find yourself using wrap text as the predominant setting in excel, you probably aren't using it properly. Wrap text should be the exception, not the general rule. It's most useful for #s, not text. It's not a word document application.</p>
<p>In fact, if you find yourself manually changing a lot of things in excel instead of using the innate functions, you're probably doing more harm than good. For example, manually changing row and column sizes instead of AutoFit.</p>

<p>Edit: oh my what a clusterfuck this has become. This is ELI5. I gave an answer that assumes someone is a noob. Are there people who can use excel in a way that's probably not intended and still get it to do what they want? Yes. I can write an entire research paper on excel and have it come out like it was done in word. But I wouldn't do that because it's fucking stupid. I get it that you probably want to use excel as a word application because word doesn't do a good job of formatting charts and such. This is a big question for me every time I do work as well. &quot;Is this work more suitable in word, excel, or some other?&quot; This is why I used words specifically like probably, exception, etc. I will say, if you're encouraging a complete noob to go into excel recklessly using it halfway as a word app, you are ABSOLUTELY doing them a disfavor. People like this get laughed at in the office setting, because they make fucked up spreadsheets based on never having learned how to properly make them in the first place. Further, the sad and ironic thing is, many people who think they're great at spreadsheets are absolutely horrid at them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our experiences differ.  Wanting text to not wrap is very common.  If you have a several columns and of numbers and of short text, and one column of long text, you generally want the long text to be there so you can &quot;drill down&quot; into it.  That is, it is present so you can view it as an exception, but you don't want it to distort the layout of the entire sheet when you aren't looking at one of those exceptions.  If the goal was to have the entire sheet dominated by the layout needs of a few exceptionally long cells, why would you be using a spreadsheet in the first place, rather than a word processor?</p>
<p>Also, our experiences differ on what the default actually is.  In excel, the default when opening a txt or csv file is for it to have most of the cells not wrap, but then a few scattered cells, for no apparent rhyme or reason, get automagically set to wrap.  So to get back to sanity, you have select the entire spreadsheet by hitting ctrl-A, (or ctrl-A-A, or ctrl-A-A-A, depending on version), then hunt down where they hid the wrap button this time, and then click it twice (the first time wraps everything, the second time unwraps everything, including the things that shouldn't have been wrapped in the first place but were).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people who put long things into a cell aren't planning to keep that cell it's default 8.43 width. Overflow is helpful for seeing how wide a column needs to be. Since Excel's primary function is dealing with numbers, those numbers aren't likely to overflow terribly far. And even with a paragraph of text, if the default was to wrap text an 8.43 width cell, you'd end up with a row that was ridiculously tall and might not fit on the height of your monitor.</p>
<p>If you are anticipating needing to wrap text, you can select all the cells (the button left of the A column/above the 1 row) and set all the cells to wrap text. I like to middle align my cells too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
