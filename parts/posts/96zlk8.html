		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The previous answers were talking about the housing bubble collapse in 2008. If that's what your question was about, then /u/biggestofbears has a good synopsis.</p>
<p>Today, you're also seeing a slowdown of the housing market, primarily due to rising interest rates, rising prices, and somewhat flat incomes. In short, it costs more to buy a house right now than most people can afford. I suspect we're overdue for a market correction for housing prices.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm getting a lot of questions about what a &quot;market correction&quot; means. If you're interested in the question, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_market_correction" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> has a good article on it. Everybody remembers the correction of 2008, but we've had many over the years. The one before that was from 1989-1998. Each correction is different: some are regional, some are national, some are even global. In the end, you buy a house to live in. It's not an investment, and it's not a savings account. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Americans generally spend 30% of their total income on housing.  That's 30% of EVERYONE's paycheck going to a single industry. That's why the housing market is such a big deal.  </p>
<p>So, you want to buy a house.  In the 70's/80's, this was a big deal, because you had to have excellent credit to score a sweet 15% interest rate.  If you default, you lose your house, which means you generally become a social outcast so you lose your friends and family too. </p>
<p>That made the loans very stable.  Folks would default on everything else in life before missing a house payment.  Eventually, banks start lowering the interest rate because it's such a safe investment for them. </p>
<p>The only problem is that when a bank writes a mortgage, they don't have that money back to write more mortgages for another 15-30 years.  To fix that, they will sell your mortgage to bigger bank.  </p>
<p>Say they loan you $100k today.  In 30 years they'll make $200k after interest and payments.  But they won't have their original $100k back for 15 years.  Same goes for the other 10 people that took out mortgages this week.  So, they bundle it all together, and sell that debt package (worth 10x $200k) to a bigger bank for $1.05m, netting them a quick $50k profit.  </p>
<p>The big bank that bought it will eventually collect the $2m in debt they just bought over time.  </p>
<p>Ooooor they could bundle it with a bunch of other packages and sell THAT package for cash today, netting themselves a quick profit, and transferring your debt to an even bigger bank.  </p>
<p>Eventually the piles of loans get so big, it's tough to determine how credit worthy the debtors are still.  Every once in awhile, someone defaults, and that debt package becomes a little less valuable.  So, you buy insurance.  If a single loan defaults, the insurance company pays the difference in exchange for a flat rate.  </p>
<p>Basically, the bank is gambling that more people will default this year, and the insurance company bets that their premiums will make more money than they pay out in defaulted mortgages.  </p>
<p>And know what? The insurance company has insurance too.  Bets on bets on bets.  </p>
<p>Honestly, this is all great.  Keeps the economy well funded, interest rates stay low, and everyone can have what they need to grow TODAY instead of having to wait and save.  </p>
<p>Just one thing, it all depends on EVERYONE paying their mortgage on time.  </p>
<p>Problem is that the low level bankers are conditioned to think in short term exclusively.  Their profit incentive is to write as many loans as possible, because whatever they write will be packaged up and sold within the week.   They'll make their quick $5k, and if you can't pay after that it's not their problem.  </p>
<p>So now you see strippers qualifying for 3 $500k homes because their income looks fucking fantastic TODAY, and nobody's asking how they're going to make their payments in 30 years.  McDonalds workers are finally able to buy houses for their whole families because interest rates are so low.  </p>
<p>When they default, the big banks that bought the loans don't care because they just kick the folks out and file the loan insurance claim.  </p>
<p>But then 2008 happened.  The insurance companies ran out of cash to pay the claims and file for bankruptcy.  Suddenly the banks have to deal with the steaming pile of shit that are these loan packages.</p>
<p>They start to run out of cash, because folks aren't paying their mortgages.  The street level lenders can't write more loans because they're out of cash to give, and can't offload last week's take.  </p>
<p>Now the banks own all these abandoned and foreclosed houses.  Normally they'd sell at half price, but since the entire neighborhood looks like foreclosed houses, they're lucky to get 20% of the purchase value.  </p>
<p>Also, nobody's buying because they can't get loans, because street level lenders are tapped.  </p>
<p>This means construction stops.  Those that sell parts of houses shut down, the entire lending industry has a lobotomy.  The whole economy just stops because nobody can spend money.  </p>
<p>That's where Obama was forced to do bailouts.  A cash pump to stimulate the economy.  Anything to put some cash back into the economy to get the machine running again.  </p>
<p>Did we learn anything? Fuck no.  Fun fact: They're still playing the same games with Mortgages.  Funner fact: They're doing it with Student Loans too.  Funnest fact: Total student loans now exceed total mortgage AND Credit card debt combined.  And there's not even a house you can sell for quick cash when the loan defaults.  </p>
<p>I figure within 4 years we'll have another collapse, but worse.</p>
<p>Edit: For those of you asking if you should buy a house now or later, it depends. Houses are cheaper during a crash, but loans are more expensive and harder to qualify for. When things are good, loans are cheaper but houses are more expensive. My bet? If you're paying cash, buy later. If you're hoping for a good rate? Buy now, but responsibly. Like, 50% of what you qualify for.</p>
<p>Also, remember that YOUR debt situation doesn't matter. If the housing or student loan market crashes, that means the banks don't have cash. That means they don't have the cash to finance Amazon's new HQ, and all those construction workers are laid off. Those workers in turn don't make their loan payments, and the bank has less cash to lend, which means more layoffs to those depending on easy debt.</p>
<p>Even if you don't owe anyone anything, you are affected if your employer needs loans to cover large capital projects, which is pretty much everyone working somewhere with more than a dozen employees. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’ve received a lot of good answers, but they all leave a few things out.  </p>
<p>Historically when you took out a mortgage to buy a house, you paid off that entire loan over several decades to the original bank who made the loan.  So the bank was very careful to make loans to borrowers who could be relied on to pay the loan back.  As loan payments trickle in, the bank’s pool of funds is slowly replenished and new loans can be made.   This was a very stable system.  </p>
<p>Internationally, many formerly impoverished nations began to generate wealth and began looking for safe places to invest.   Eventually banks and mortgage companies figured out how to “sell” their portfolio of loans.   This gave the bank a quick infusion of cash and the ability to make more loans.  The investors got a stable pool of loans that would pay a steady income over decades.   </p>
<p>So now the banks look for new borrowers.  Over time, all of the borrowers with good credit have already borrowed money, so the lenders start to lower their standards.   This increases the pool of borrowers.  The banks are okay with making riskier loans because they are just going to sell those loans to investors.  When the defaults come, it will be the investors not the banks who get stung.  </p>
<p>As this goes on housing prices rise to meet increasing demand from all of the new home buyers.   This meteoric rise cannot be sustained and prices eventually crash and the whole system collapses.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are just explaining the crash.</p>
<p>Housing prices skyrocketed due to the availability of mortgage loans. Because the people who got these loans couldn’t afford them, they defaulted and flooded the market with homes. This greatly depressed home prices because supply far exceeded demand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are referring to the present, the main factors include a long, long period of stagnant wages combined with houses that are much bigger than 40 years ago creating a serious issue of affordability.  I'd add that a near non-existant level of job security and very high transaction costs makes it very difficult to feel secure enough to recoup your losses in the case of a job transition.  Most people need to be in a home for 7 years to make up those transaction costs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
