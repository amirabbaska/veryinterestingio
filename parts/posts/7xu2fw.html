		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those detectors use magnetic sensors to detect specialized tags placed on or in big-ticket items. If you've ever seen one of those stickers with a big metallic spiral on the back, that's one design for them. Meanwhile, speakers work by using small electrical currents to turn an electromagnet on and off incredibly quickly, each on/off cycle corresponding to a single wave of sound produced by the speaker. Magnetic and electrical fields are really the same thing (hence the word electromagnetism), and as a result sufficiently strong magnetic fields can cause a current to move through a wire passing through them. The presence of the magnetic field essentially transforms a tiny percent of the energy involved in moving the wire into electrical energy. This electricity is very weak, but earbuds also work with tiny electrical charges.</p>
<p>Try moving through those detectors at different speeds to see how it affects the sound. I have no idea what it will do, but I suspect faster speeds will make the sound higher pitched.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can induce current by moving a magnetic field past a conductor.  Electricity and magnetism are the same thing, and the magnetic field causes the negatively charged electrons to move, which is electricity.</p>
<p>The detectors use a magnetic field to induce a current in a tag, which essentially powers it remotely to send a signal back saying that it can detect. </p>
<p>The detectors induce a current in any conductor. Your headphones too.  This powers the magnets that move the speakers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those item detectors typically work by generating a electric/magnetic field, strong enough that the electronic tag on some items picks up the field through the antennas and received enough power to send a new radio signal that the sensor is listening for.  </p>
<p>Headphones, and the wire attached to them if applicable, often function as an antenna, and the sensor's EM field is strong enough to induce a small current in that wire. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
