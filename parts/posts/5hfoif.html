		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of plants today putting out big gobs of resin, it just hasn't had a chance to fossilize yet. The reason amber is so important is because it tends to leave parts of other organisms intact, not because there was much more of it being made than there is today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another smaller point in addition to the answer already here is that it doesn't have to be all that abundant. Remember that these periods are tens to hundreds of millions of years. I mean, think of the entirety of human history, which is just around two hundred thousand years. It's not hard to imagine that at the very least once or twice a few bugs got captured by some sap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
