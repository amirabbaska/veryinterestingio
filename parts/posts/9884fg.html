		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a PET bottle manufacturer. Though there are different types of plastic most water bottles use the same one. And given you don’t expose it to extreme conditions (heat, microwave etc) you can technically use it as many times as you like. </p>
<p>The only reason why you might choose not to (and should) is bacteria. When the water is bottled a manufacturer makes sure that there is no bacteria by either killing it during the process or by using a deep underground source where the bacteria count is much lower (and still UVing it nonetheless). </p>
<p>However once you open the bottle and especially once you get your saliva inside, the bacteria can really start to grow. You know those water cooler machines at the offices? If you take a swab from the nozzle the bacteria amount will be off the charts. It’s a very stupid design actually because of how often it needs to be disinfected (which most people don’t do). </p>
<p>So in short you shouldn’t reuse your PET bottle because of bacteria. However if you wash it properly and don’t expose to any extreme conditions, I don’t see why not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/reuse-plastic-bottles/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good Snopes article. In short, it looks like reusing plastic water bottles is totally fine - but there is some concern around the bottle being heated. So if you have a water bottle in your car in the hot summer, there's concern potentially harmful chemicals could now be in that water.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, as others have said, I would always toss once you notice deformations. And while plastic in inherently more sanitary than other more porous materials, reusing it can lead to a build up of bacteria so be sure to wash with hot soapy water as the article suggests.</p>
<p>Reduce, reuse, recycle :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at the bottom or the side of the water bottle. There should be a number with some arrows going in circles around it.</p>
<p>That number is the type of plastic they used in said water bottle. There are at least 5 different types they used in water bottles, 2 sort of rare the other 3 are more common. Look up those numbers on Google to get you started.</p>
<p>The MOST common one(like at grocery store) is actually pretty well off. It has a very low leech rate and usually does it if you expose the water bottle to high heat.</p>
<p>Use glass or metal(types that passively kill bacteria) if you plan on using something to drink from long term. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that the plastic container you use is made from food-safe plastic, intact, clean, and has not been used to store anything dangerous, then it is also safe to reuse or refill. Sodas, water, and juice are typically sold in bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET). These bottles are safe to use (and reuse).</p>
<p>There was an internet rumor circulating that suggested PET plastic bottles could leech the carcinogenic element diethylhydroxylamine (DEHA). This is wrong for two reasons. First, DEHA is not used in the manufacture of these plastic bottles, nor is it produced through the degradation of these bottles. Secondly, DEHA is not a carcinogen.^1 </p>
<p>Can chemicals leech from plastic bottles? Absolutely, which is one of several supposed reasons why bottles might have an expiration date. But these chemicals are not &quot;dangerous&quot;—they merely taste bad.^2 Similarly, vinegar is perfectly safe to drink, but it doesn't taste refreshing. ^<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vinegar+challenge+drink" target="_blank">[citation](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vinegar+challenge+drink" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vinegar+challenge+drink</a>) ^[needed]</a></p>
<p>You should also not reuse a bottle that has melted or has holes. This could potentially be dangerous. You might spill your drink and trip in the puddle.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm really bad about leaving my water bottle somewhere random while at work and losing it. I've been buying just a single cold bottle of water from a store, and refilling it until I lose it since it's cheaper to replace. I do wash it often and sometimes use them for a month or so before getting rid of. Is this bad for me ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
