When I turn and face away from the fire, the skin on my face feels much cooler. I'm guessing that if the heat I felt came from the heated air around me, then it wouldn't really matter which way I faced if I were just rotating around a point. Does my skin heat up mostly because of the (I'm guessing infrared) radiation coming from the fire?</p></div></div>
