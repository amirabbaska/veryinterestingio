When I turn and face away from the fire, the skin on my face feels much cooler. I'm guessing that if the heat I felt came from the heated air around me, then it wouldn't really matter which way I faced if I were just rotating around a point. Does my skin heat up mostly because of the (I'm guessing infrared) radiation coming from the fire?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are right. </p>
<p>The thermal radiation created by the bonfire travels away in all directions. Heat that is transferred via convection mostly travels upwards as the heated air billows up. If you are to the side of the fire, the heat you receive is transferred via thermal radiation. If you are standing directly above the fire, you receive heat from both thermal radiation <em>and</em> convection. For this reason, directly above the fire is the hottest place to be. I don't recommend it. </p>
<p>Note that thermal radiation can include many different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation and not just infrared, although infrared is the dominant type near room temperature. For a bonfire, the thermal radiation is composed of both infrared radiation <em>and</em> visible light in significant amounts.</p>
<p>UPDATE: In loose usage, the term &quot;thermal radiation&quot; means &quot;radiation that is able to heat an object upon being absorbed by the object&quot;. In this usage, all electromagnetic radiation is thermal radiation, from radio waves to gamma rays. In the more strict usage of the term, &quot;thermal radiation&quot; means &quot;radiation that is produced in a broad spectrum that depends on the temperature of the source&quot;. In this stricter usage, the visible light from LED flashlights is not thermal radiation, since LED flashlights do not operate that way. Each photon from the LED flashlight is not different from a photon of the same frequency from a campfire - they can both heat something they strike. But the spectral frequency distribution of the photons from an LED bulb is not thermal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Situational observation: At an air show a few years back they had their reenactment portion and blew up bags of gasoline for the explosions. The finale explosion*, a few hundred gallons of gas, was a large 200ft-wide pillar of fire. The heat from it could be felt immediately; much faster than wind or convection from it could have reached the crowd ~1/4mi. away.</p>
<p>^(*probably technically a conflagration rather than an actual explosion.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could experimentally feel the difference by walking around from the upwind to the downwind side of the fire (and for bonus points, jump over it). That would keep the radiation exposure constant but vary the heated air exposure.</p>
<p>And what you'd find is what others are saying: it's mostly radiation, especially since most of the hot air goes straight up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Should it also be taken into consideration, that electromagnetic radiation is received differently depending on it's wavelength? e.g. uv/vis effects electronic transitions while infrared effects vibrational and rotational (edit - -perhaps rotational only in the gas phase) transitions? Seems to me this will influence one's perception of the radiation. </p>
<p>Second edit; another user addresses this by remarking that all electromagnetic absorptions may result in various excited states which can then decay giving rise to, for example, &quot;thermal&quot; photons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are the light from the fire and it's heat one in the same? Because when I'm sitting at a campfire and it starts making my face feel hot, and I shield my face from the fire's light, the heat seems to also be blocked in the same instant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
