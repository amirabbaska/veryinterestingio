		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(Edit:  Wow, thank you for the gold, stranger.  I didn't even think this was one of my better answers.  Also, I have edited the post to clarify and correct some things based off some very good comments I received.  Thank you all.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Fusion involves taking charged particles and ramming them together until they fuse.  This releases a ton of energy, but it's like trying to push the same pole of two magnets together.  You need to overcome the resistance first to get them to &quot;touch.&quot;</p>
<p>This requires an enormous amount of energy.  The only way to really confine and squeeze the gas tightly enough to do this is via electromagnetic fields.  More specifically, confining it inside a magnetic coil, like a cylinder.  Most commonly, we then twist the cylinder back on itself to form a torus, and have the gas zoom around in circles inside the coil.</p>
<p>But now you get into the problems:</p>
<p>1) The amount of energy needed to drive the magnetic field is enormous, and the current will melt any standard conducting cable or metal.  The only thing that won't heat up when that amount of current goes through it is a superconductor.  There are no known room temperature superconductors, only those operating at very cold temperatures.  So you have to keep the entire thing constantly cooled with liquid helium, and it's prone to break a lot.  The Large Hadron Collider has the same issue and has suffered some high profile breakages this way.</p>
<p>2)  As the gas starts to collide and fuse, a plasma is formed.  This is a good thing.  It's what you want.  But plasmas are highly conductive.  As the plasma zooms around, it starts to form its own electromagnetic current and fields, which start to mess with the fields you're using to try and contain it.  This is extremely difficult to detect or model and very hard to adjust in the split-second time frames needed to keep it stable.  We're still figuring out the exact shape required to get the plasma's currents to self-contain in a nice stable way with the others.  So far we can only keep the plasma going for about 100 seconds at the very longest recorded.</p>
<p>3)  Energy extraction.  We still haven't quite figured this part out yet.  All that energy in the plasma is &quot;real,&quot; but how do you get it out?  The only simple and practical way we really know right now is using the heat to boil water and use the steam to drive turbines.  (This is also how fission nuclear plants work.)  This part is taken as a &quot;we'll do it easily once we get to that point,&quot; but we still aren't even to the point of stable long-standing plasmas so nobody's really invested much into it.  The good news is, we have gotten very close to getting more energy out of the reaction than we put in at this point. The JET reactor hit 70% efficiency -- 97% efficiency if you don't count the initial startup spike.  ITER is gunning for 1000%.  We are confident it's doable at scale, now.</p>
<p>4)  Fusion is much safer than fission, and does not leave as many crazy exotic radioactive isotopes everywhere.  This is because most of the radioactivity is confined within the plasma and does not ionize the surrounding material the same way.  The &quot;fuel&quot; also does not naturally break down into dozens of exotic, long-lasting radioactive isotopes.  However, fusion does produce neutron radiation, which by having no charge, can't be contained via electromagnetic field.  These neutrons bombard the vessel walls and slowly irradiate and break it down over time.  It's currently unknown how exactly we will avoid having to replace the entire reactor semi-frequently due to this, but like the above problem, it's considered a &quot;cross that bridge when we get to it&quot; issue that will be solved by some kind of new material or exotic layer of shielding like beryllium.  The trick is making whatever shielding we use also compatible with energy extraction, because those neutrons are a good chunk of the energy that comes out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right now we have a few major issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First Wall Problem: The fusion plasma needs a high product of density-temperature-confinement. Practical solutions almost always involve plasma at millions of degrees C. The plasma will also emit a lot of neutrons, assuming the mainstream D-T fuel approach. The layer of the reactor that faces the plasma is called the first wall, and in most fusion schemes it needs to have some pretty intense properties to survive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simulation: Simulating a plasma is really hard. It has both fluid dynamics and electro-mechanics. This is called Magneto Hydro Dynamics (MHD), and it is a fairly good approximation of certain regimes of plasma operation. It is quite difficult to solve and simulate due to the nasty nature of the underlying equations. Fluid dynamics is very non-linear and chaotic, which is why it is hard to predict weather far into the future. There are many different code bases used to simulate MHD but as far as I know they all have their own major tradeoffs and there is no clear winner.</p>
</li>
<li>Exotic hardware: most fusion schemes require expensive power supplies, since there is almost always a large amount of power involved in the process. The National Ignition Facility is a major fusion project and has 330MJ of capacitors that pulse into flash lamps which fire massive lasers at a tiny pellet of DT fuel. This capacitor bank is billions of dollars, and takes up several football fields. ITER is a tokamak fusion experiment that is wrapped in massive superconducting magnets and those are surrounded in a huge cryostat. The balance of plant required to make these kinds of machines function is truly massive.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't understand why fusion is difficult until I read a short article called &quot;<a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/ast110_99/sunfire.html" target="_blank">A Pint of the Sun</a>&quot; by Joshua Barnes.  Here's the article in its entirety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Descriptions of nuclear `burning' in stars sometimes give the impression that the central furnace of a star is a place of violent activity. In fact, the inside of a star is rather peaceful, and hydrogen burning goes on very slowly.</p>
<p>To appreciate this, imagine we had a magic transporter which could beam one pint of gas from the center of the Sun right into this room. One pint of water weighs one pound, but the center of the Sun has a density about 150 times the density of water, so a pint of sun-stuff weighs almost as much as I do.</p>
<p>Now the first thing that would happen is that this building would vanish in a huge explosion. When it was down these in the center of the Sun, the gas was compressed by the vast weight of all the thick layers of dense material above it, so it was under enormous pressure. When it's suddenly transported to Earth, the confining pressure is removed, and the gas expands -- very rapidly. The explosion would have the force of a small nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>So if we want to get this experiment approved by the University administration, we need to make a container which can hold our pint of sun-stuff under pressure without bursting apart. That's not easy to do, but we've already assumed we have a transporter right out of Star Trek, so a little more magic won't be noticed. But our troubles are not over, because this gas from the center of the sun is incredibly hot, and the heat would escape in the form of X-rays, cooking everyone in the vicinity.</p>
<p>OK, let's assume we can make the walls of our container perfectly reflective, so that all the escaping heat energy is reflected right back in. I said we were using magic, didn't I? So we have a pint of sun-stuff sitting right there in front of us, safe as can be. Now let's allow a little energy to escape -- just exactly the amount of energy being generated by nuclear reactions, so the gas stays at a constant temperature. We can use the escaping energy to run a generator and produce electricity. Thermonuclear power!</p>
<p>But before we call a press conference or make any big deals with HECO, we better figure out how much energy those bottled nuclear reactions are generating. And the answer is...</p>
<p>About a thousand times less energy than I'm generating by breathing. That's all! Per unit mass, the Sun produces much less energy than a living human body. In total, the Sun generates a lot of energy, but that's only because it's so massive. If I was as massive as Jupiter -- perish the thought -- I'd produce more energy than the Sun, just from my body heat.</p>
<p>Of course, the Sun produces energy by nuclear reactions, while I produce energy by chemical reactions. That's how the Sun can go on shining for ten billion years, whereas I get hungry every few hours.</p>
<p>The enormous lifetime of the Sun gives us another perspective on the same basic point, which is that nuclear reactions in stars are, for the most part, very slow and gentle. It takes about ten billion years for all the hydrogen in the center of the Sun to be burned to helium. That means that per year, a hydrogen nucleus has about one chance in ten billion of being involved in a nuclear reaction. The center of the Sun is an incredibly safe place for hydrogen nuclei! A hydrogen nucleus in the Sun runs much less risk of undergoing a nuclear reaction than I do of being hit by lightning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why is fusion so difficult?  We're trying to do better than nature and it appears that nature, trying its very best at the heart of our star, is doing a rather humdrum job.  In the short term (&quot;short&quot; meaning roughly <em>3 million years</em> in this context), there is many orders of magnitude more energy just in the pressure of the solar core than there is in the fusion taking place in the sun.  Without that pressure, we get no fusion at all.  And on top of that, we would need to efficiently extract the energy released by fusion.  Unless we are exceptionally clever (and as you'll read from other responses in this thread, we actually are pretty clever), we can't perform the same type of fusion that the sun does without first building up an insurmountable energy deficit.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> By the way, to quantify these claims, including my &quot;3 million years&quot; figure, I pulled some numbers directly from Wikipedia's article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_core" target="_blank">the solar core</a>.  The power density is 276.5 W/m^3, which works out to 0.1308 W/pint.  The pressure, which can also be interpreted as the pressure energy per unit volume, is 265 billion bars (261 billion atmospheres).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://klotza.blogspot.com/2016/08/whats-deal-with-fusion-power.html" target="_blank">Basically, you need to build a really really big facility</a>, which is really expensive, so even if it makes more power than it consumes, it wouldn't produce enough to sell at a reasonable cost and recoup the costs, so it needs to be even bigger. This is something that would cost tens of billions of dollars and decades if we started today. Part of this waylaid by the fact that plasma research has been extensively gutted, below the point where researchers said &quot;if we get only this much money, we'll never achieve it.&quot;</p>
<p>ITER, when it's finally done, will at least produce more power than it consumes, but it won't be economical to sell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm too late to the party but it seems to me few people realise how serious the metallurgical problems are. Fusion creates high energy neutrons that impact the reactor walls. This radiation will cause most alloying elements typically used in steel to become radioactive. It also causes the physical arrangement of atoms in the steel to slowly get mixed around. Our best bet is oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels. Unfortunately the conditions in the reactor are very difficult to recreate outside of the reactor, so it's very difficult to test how these materials will respond to the reactor environment.</p>
<p>Tldr we literally don't know what materials to build the reactor from, and its difficult to find out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
