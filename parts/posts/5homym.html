		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each s orbital has n-1 nodes. Your first analogy is the more accurate one. At certain radii, the wave function is zero, giving a node. So in the case of the spherically symmetric s orbitals, each node is basically a shell. The wave function is nonzero on either side, arbitrarily close to the shell, so it's a very thin shell indeed. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neither. It shows where you're most likely to measure an electron in the 1s orbital.</p>
<p>Electrons are not discrete balls of &quot;stuff&quot; whizzing around a nucleus. Electrons are more analogous to the vibrations on a drum. They're waves of &quot;stuff&quot; that vibrate in different configurations around the atom, depending on their kinetic energy, angular momentum etc. When we measure the position, it's like asking where a wave &quot;is&quot; (which isn't a super well-posed question to ask a vibration) and it essentially forces the wave to shift and focus all of its vibration at a single point. It's not that the electron was there the whole time, because an electron is not a &quot;thing&quot; with a &quot;position&quot;, it's more like a vibration. It's like when a drumstick first strikes the drum, at the very moment it strikes, the drumhead is only vibrating at the single point where the drumstick actually hit, it takes time for it to travel to the rest of the drum. Similar kinda thing here. What point this will be for the electron is more-or-less random, but some positions are more likely than others. We can plot this likeliness as a graph, the higher the point on the graph, the more likely the electron will arbitrarily decide to focus it's vibrations all on that point.</p>
<p>Each atomic orbital has a different graph and the s-orbitals have graphs that look like (disregarding a massive amount of scaling) f(r)=e^(-r)p(r) where p(r) is a polynomial of degree 2(n-1), and n is the principle atomic number. The 1s, 2s, 3s ones look like</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>f(r) = e^(-r)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>f(r) = e^(-r)(r^(2)-2r+1)</p>
</li>
<li>f(r) = e^(-r)(r^(4)/4-2r^(3)+5r^(2)-4r+1)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note, r&gt;0 in these, since it represents the distance from the center of the atom.) The electron can be measured anywhere, but they have a larger chance to be measured in a range that has a larger area under the associated graph. The bubbles you see in a chem book represent the distance where the average value of these graphs are, or the maximum values of the function rf(r), which is used to compute the average. This gives a decent picture of where you can expect the electron to be measured.</p>
<p>If you  choose a different letter, p2 or something, then orientation matters, which is how you get the nodes that extend out and fall back to the center. The likelihood of measuring it some distance from the center depends on what angle you look at, so the maximum will change based on your angle, hence the bubbles. <a href="http://plato.mercyhurst.edu/chemistry/kjircitano/InorgStudysheets/InorgWaveFunction.pdf" target="_blank">This</a> low-dpi pdf has some of these probability functions explicitly written out in full, for different orbitals, along with some graphs on how they look. (Though, to recover the actual probabilities from the functions in this pdf, you have to square them.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital#Orbitals_table" target="_blank">illustrations of electron orbitals such as this one</a>, what you're looking at is a visualization of what's going on throughout all of 3d space and not just that surface. An atom's electron can be found basically anywhere in space, but in some areas you're far more likely to 'find' the electron than in others. Illustrations of these orbitals usually show the surface where the electrons most likely to be found.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/HAtomOrbitals.png" target="_blank">Here's a little bit different of a visualizatoin of electron orbitals.</a> This is a plot of where you're most likely to find electrons around a hydrogen atom. The brighter the color, the higher the likelihood of finding an electron. As you can see, most space has some amount of color in it. If you traced out the brightest parts of this image, you'd see something similar to the orbital shells that you were asking about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes your first intuition is correct. We build our mathematical models of orbitals by finding eigenfunctions (i.e. the &quot;standing states&quot; of the electrons in the atom) for H<em>W = |E|</em>W, where H is the Hamiltonian operator and equal to kinetic energy + potential, W is the vector wavefunction, and |E| is an eigenvalue of H and the expected net energy of the electron.</p>
<p>It just so happens, that every particle with nonzero kinetic energy will have a term in H that includes the Laplacian operator ((d^2)r/(dr)^2) for a position r. Conveniently, functions like e^-x and sin(x) have the property that their second derivative is also their eigenfunction. So we build up our solutions for W, our orbitals, as products of these functions.</p>
<p>Also, W^2 is interpreted as the probability of an electron at position r, so solutions to the equation W^2 = 0 give us our nodes. This equation has solutions on a 2D surface in 3-space, like a balloon. The wavefunctions for the orbitals of the first two quantum levels are W1s, which is proportional to e^-x, and W2s and W2p proportional to (1-x)e^-x * Yl(theta), where theta is the spherical coordinate of r and Yl is a spherical harmonic function.</p>
<p>Note that since W1s is monotonically decreasing <em>it never reaches zero</em> (edit: for r &gt; 0), and so the 1s orbital has no nodes. We get the W2s node by finding the 0 of the radial part of W2s, ((1-r)e^-r)^2 = 0. We get the 3 2p orbitals by finding solutions to Y^2 = 0 for three different spherical harmonics, Yz(theta), Yx(theta) and Yy(theta), which we generate based on the angular momentum quantum number of the orbital. These give us 2px, 2py, and 2pz. These have angular nodes cause they are the zeros from theta, the angular component of W.</p>
<p>Anyway obviously I've glossed over a lot of math and formalism, but I think its pretty neat we can predict all of those nodes. There's some pretty mind-boggling math that was developed over centuries to solving these kinds of equations, so my treatment probably confused more than helped, but heres a <a href="https://winter.group.shef.ac.uk/orbitron/AOs/2s/radial-dist.html" target="_blank">neat visualizer</a> that shows the zeros I'm talking about nicely. Wish I knew about that link back in the pchem days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Within the context of organic chemistry it is better to think of the s orbital as a wave function inside the spherical Shell. Maybe not &quot;better&quot; but more useful. You don't need to think about the fact that the wave function is actually infinite and the electron can appear anywhere in the universe at any time and still be in the s orbital...it's just the probability of it leaving it's imagined Shell is close to a probability of zero. Absorption of photons creating quantum tunneling is important also because characterization of organic compounds can rely on how individual bonds absorb and emit photons. That's how we are able to tell that the latest eruption on Europa  contained hydrocarbons; we saw and measured the way it interacted with the em spectrum coming from the sun. The bonds are quantized so if we see light of a specific energy interacting with them we know exactly what the bond is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
