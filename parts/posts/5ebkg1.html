		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What we think of as lazy is often not detectable as lazy by our brains.  Our brains want us to do productive things, and we've learned ways to relax that feel productive.</p>
<p>Sometimes you'll relax, sit in a chair, and stare at the horizon.  Or a TV screen.  Or you'll play a video game.  Or you'll read a web comic.  Or you'll browse Reddit.</p>
<p>If I sit and relax and do NOTHING, that's what our brains think of as lazy, and it's possible you need some alcohol or something to really enjoy doing absolutely nothing.  Otherwise, maybe you'll start a conversation, pick up a book, browse the internet, watch some TV, or open a video game app.</p>
<p>When we consume art or social media our brain thinks we're learning and solving social puzzles.  When the art we consume is interactive (as in video games) it feels even more like we're doing something worthwhile.</p>
<p>Our brain gives us a burst of happy every time we finish a chapter, open a new link, or make a new level in our video game.  These burst of happy are the chemical &quot;dopamine&quot;, and dopamine is such pleasant stuff it's the agent that makes some illegal drugs work so well.</p>
<p>Our actual job?  Many of us are lucky enough to have jobs that give us job satisfaction as well, but those moments are rarer, often pretty hard to accomplish, and mitigated by the fact that we're so familiar with them we don't feel like they're as special.  And, sometimes the job is unpleasant.</p>
<p>It's not that our jobs are bad, though, it's that we've learned through centuries of practice how to make entertainments for ourselves that hit the same buttons as actual mental accomplishments, but far more effectively and swiftly.  This is why people fail college because they're playing video games; real accomplishments are harder and don't feel as good.</p>
<p>tl;dr:  Our methods of goofing off are both pleasant because they're rest and also pleasant because we feel a bit like we're doing the fun part of working.  They're the <a href="http://www.stuartmcmillen.com/comics_en/supernormal-stimuli/" target="_blank">refined sugar</a> of effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laziness is a luxury. You tend not to be lazy when you don't know where you are sleeping that night or you don't know what you will eat next.  Having secured your needs, you can grant yourself the right to rest. </p>
<p>However higher-order needs require planning and motivation. If you can't make rent next month, you can still be lazy this month - your needs are met right now. But you should probably go to work so that you aren't homeless after the 30th. </p>
<p>We all struggle with motivation, don't take it personally. The hard part is deciding. Doing is relatively easy. Just ask a morning jogger about putting their jogging shoes on - it's harder than the run that follows!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's a bit of a bell curve?</p>
<p>Lately, technology and society has advanced much quicker than our bodies have, and instant gratification has become all the rage at a psychosocial level.</p>
<p>When it comes to consumption of food and conversion to energy, we are storing energy in the form of fat much faster and more often than we are using energy for tasks like walking/running, using physical force to craft tools and fight off predators, and generally just being more active. I mean average weight of Americans has been increasing every decade, that is pretty indicative of something. </p>
<p>There is a punishment reward complexity that exists in the brain that feels rewarded for eating food (American food these days are loaded with sugar), but simulate happiness by hijacking your reward pathways and releasing lots of feel good hormones like dopamine to your system. Feels good being lazy in the short term, but it makes you suffer later.</p>
<p>When we are lazy, start to psychologically become affected. Back when we didn't have civilization and were hunter gatherers, our fight or flight responses were more in tune, we did feel more &quot;natural&quot; in working. Now, we are protected, and have a life of ease compared to the hunter gatherer life we originally came from. Because of short term rewards in being lazy, storing excess energy and eating sugary foods that make you feel good temporarily, we build up tolerances to sugar, eat more, get fatter, and unhealthier, which then starts to expand your waistline, make you break out, and decrease any physical prowess you may have had.</p>
<p>This might be anecdotal but I think prolonged states of lethargy and constant consumption make people more prone to psychological issues (depression from weight gain, negative feedback loop of eating/purging/ body image issues, etc). The happiest, most resilient people I've met are those that work out. I've seen more depression in people who are long term lazy people and cases of clinical depression from people who do not engage in physical activity.</p>
<p>Most people I see working out at the gym are actively engaging with their fight or flight responses by exercising. As you put your body through stress, endorphins are released which make you happy. Most people I see who work out or play sports feel good from that reaction and get hooked on working out/being active. Some people never get to that point because the short term reward pathways are easier to access (eating food, laying on couch, doing nothing), whereas the gym and physical work don't immediately seem appealing or give the immediate benefits that a person might be looking for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Until very recently food was very hard to come by and hoarding as much of that energy as you could might mean the difference between life and death. Since most of us spend the majority of our time being not hungry or not really needing anything the best thing for us to do to conserve energy is to do nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
