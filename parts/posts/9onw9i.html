		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is the energy breakdown of a <strong>fission</strong> reaction, in MeV (i.e., millions of electron-volts, which is a common unit for nuclear reactions), from <a href="http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Library/Fission.html" target="_blank">here</a>: </p>
<pre><code>Kinetic energy of fission fragments  165 +/- 5 
Instantaneous gamma rays               7 +/- 1 
Kinetic energy of neutrons             5 +/- 0.5
Beta particles from product decay      7 +/- 1 
Gamma rays from product decay          6 +/- 1 
Neutrinos from product decay          10 
TOTAL                                200 +/- 6</code></pre>
<p>Individual reactions can vary, but they hover around 170-200 MeV. For comparison, chemical reactions (like the decomposition of a TNT molecule) release energy on the order of eV. So fission and fusion are more powerful than chemical reactions by a factor of millions. </p>
<p>All of those fall under the &quot;kinetic energy of the particles&quot; but this gives you a better sense, I think, of what's really at work here. Most is electrostatic repulsion of fission fragments (two positively-charged &quot;halves&quot; of a once-whole nucleus find themselves uncomfortably close to one another and repel, like the positive poles of two magnets), but a substantial fraction is also in the form of radiation, some of which is &quot;delayed&quot; (it will only be released after the fission products themselves undergo nuclear decay).</p>
<p>In <strong>fusion</strong> reactions, the end products also contain kinetic energy. Depending on the reaction, it can manifest in different types of particles. The fusion of H-2 + H-3 can result in He-4 (3.5 MeV) + a neutron (14.1 MeV), where the MeV values are the respective energy imparted to each of those products (so the neutron has a lot of energy). </p>
<p>Personally I prefer talking about it this way instead of just saying &quot;the reaction produced 17.6 MeV of energy&quot; (or representing it as a little lightning bolt) but for some purposes (not all) you can abstract it down to just how much energy is released. If you care about how much energy that neutron has (because you're trying to search for it, or do something with it), then it makes sense to break it down further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common form of fuel envisioned for fusion is a 50-50 deuterium-tritium mix. The reaction releases one alpha particle (a He nucleus) and a neutron. The neutron carries 80% of the kinetic energy, about 14MeV.</p>
<p>The alpha particles can be used to heat up the plasma, while the neutron can be captured either as heat to produce energy or to breed more tritium fuel.</p>
<p>Existing plasma devices have fusion reactions in small quantities... tritium breeding blankets will be tested in ITER and are an essential component of a reactor. No tritium, no fuel, no fusion.</p>

<p>Also, is this the most efficient way of doing it? Is using other material perhaps better but too expensive to be feasible? Like heating up gallons of mercury to turn some sort of pump generator or something to that effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
