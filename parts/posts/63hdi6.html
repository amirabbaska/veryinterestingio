		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answering from a British perspective, traditionally only the kitchen cold tap got water directly from the supply. The supply also fed a cold water storage cistern in the loft that then fed the bathroom cold taps and the hot water storage cylinder, which in turns feeds the hot water taps. Sometimes instead all the cold taps got a direct supply and the storage cistern was just for feeding the hot water cylinder. Now that storage cistern isn't sealed airtight, although it should have a lid. That means that dirt, insects, and so on (even a rat, in one reported case) can get into the cistern especially if the lid is missing and that means that any tap fed from it isn't properly safe to drink. It's <em>probably</em> fine, I drank from the bathroom taps all the time as a child and never got sick, but better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>If the kitchen cold tap is noticeably forceful, whereas all the other taps flow more gently, then your house probably has a system like this.</p>
<p>EDIT PS: I don't know exactly why that system became the most common, but an advantage is you probably have about 300 litres (80 US gallons) of water stored, useful if the mains supply is cut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're referring to speed of heating, it's not scientifically correct. I don't have an in depth knowledge, but have read about it. And think about it logically. If you have a pot of water at 0° and a pot at 50° and heat them both, eventually the water that was 0° will rise to 50°. So how is that different than using water starting at 50°? </p>
<p>This is an excerpt from Scientific American Magazine:</p>
<p>Takamasa Takahashi, a physicist at St. Norbert College in De Pere, iWis., attempts a definitive answer:</p>
<p>&quot;Cold water does not boil faster than hot water. The rate of heating of a liquid depends on the magnitude of the temperature difference between the liquid and its surroundings (the flame on the stove, for instance). As a result, cold water will be absorbing heat faster while it is still cold; once it gets up to the temperature of hot water, the heating rate slows down and from there it takes just as long to bring it to a boil as the water that was hot to begin with. Because it takes cold water some time to reach the temperature of hot water, cold water clearly takes longer to boil than hot water does. There may be some psychological effect at play; cold water starts boiling sooner than one might expect because of the aforementioned greater heat absorption rate when water is colder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the past, hot water was stored in a separate holding tank where it was kept heated. This water was not necessarily &quot;safe&quot; for drinking as the same water could be sitting for days at a time. </p>
<p>I've also heard that old lead pipes leach lead into hot water, but not into cold water. This explains why hot water would be fine for bathing, laundry, etc., but not for consumption. Can anyone verify this? </p>
<p>It's safe now (unless you live in a very old house), but in the past people had to be careful of these things. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>The claim has the ring of a myth. But environmental scientists say it is real.</p>
<p>The reason is that hot water dissolves contaminants more quickly than cold water, and many pipes in homes contain lead that can leach into water. And lead can damage the brain and nervous system, especially in young children.</p>
<p>Lead is rarely found in source water, but can enter it through corroded plumbing. The Environmental Protection Agency says that older homes are more likely to have lead pipes and fixtures, but that even newer plumbing advertised as “lead-free” can still contain as much as 8 percent lead. A study published in The Journal of Environmental Health in 2002 found that tap water represented 14 to 20 percent of total lead exposure.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll attempt to sum up all the reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lead and other contaminants dissolve much more easily in hot water.  This can lead to unwanted tastes, and could possibly build up to harmful amounts of chemicals in the bloodstream if consumed routinely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hot water tank isn't necessarily a clean place.  A sludge made of minerals and bacteria can easily form.  Additionally, in Britain, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfHgUu_8KgA" target="_blank">the hot water from the tank isn't rated as potable water.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The old myth that cold water heats faster.</p>
</li>
<li>Water heaters are less efficient than heating water on the stove because of all the water that gets pulled out of the tank and just sits there cooling in the pipes.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to make your water boil faster, boil some of it in an electric kettle or the microwave while letting the rest heat on the stove.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
