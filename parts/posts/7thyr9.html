		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been trying to read as much about this as I can on Wikipedia but I haven't seen on there yet an answer to this question.  In the article on the History of Chemistry, it mentions that Jabir ibn Hayyan identified mercury and sulfur as chemical elements but doesn't indicate how he actually figured this out.  Whatever he did, it didn't seem to convince the scientific community of Europe (if they even knew about it) because in the article on sulfur it mentions that Antoine Lavoisier helped convince them that sulfur was in fact an element and not a compound.  What did Lavoisier do to convince the scientific community of Europe that sulfur was an element and not a compound? What experiments did he run (if any) to do this? Both mercury and sulfur have been known since ancient times but other elements were only identified later, like nitrogen.  How did people like Daniel Rutherford isolate nitrogen and how was it determined by scientists at the time that it was an element? I'm curious about this for all the elements, especially the ones discovered before the nucleus of the atom itself was discovered.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In these kinds of discussions it's often worth going straight to the source. One can find an online copy of Lavoisier's Elements of Chemistry <a href="https://archive.org/details/2561010R.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>Not only is his original work still quite readable, it contains fascinating insights into his thought process. For example, on page xx of the preface he admits that his elements are what they were capable at the time of decomposing, but that one day more advanced chemists might be able to break them down further (as was eventually done by distinguishing subatomic particles).</p>
<p>As for his arguments, he leans on the chemical reactions he knew and the ones most popular at the time.  For example, he suspects nitrogen and carbon are elements, he burns them, and he gets a corresponding type of acid, and furthermore finds he can account for all of the mass. He does a similar thing with sulfur and finds a corresponding acid and no loss of mass. However, if he burns carbohydrates, he loses mass as water and later tracks down and proves that he lost it. It was not just one thing, but collections of similar observations like these that allowed early chemists to realize  that elements differed from salts which differed from acids, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s important to keep in mind that in many cases, isolating gases can be done using a lot lower “tech” methods than other elements. So a lot of the first elements isolated were probably also gases, with the early gas laws being developed towards the end of the 1700’s.</p>
<p>So I think Rutherford’s Nitrogen experiment is a good example. All he really did was continue removing other gases (oxygen by a candle, CO2 by a liquid that absorbed CO2) from a chamber until all that remained was a single, inert gas that could not support burning or keep a mouse alive. Rutherford did not know it at the time but he had isolated Nitrogen from the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much of this work was essentially deduction from the reactions something could produce. For example <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier" target="_blank">Antoine Lavoisier</a> managed to recognise hydrogen oxygen phosphor and predicted silicon. </p>
<p>From an article:</p>
<p>In 1783, he was the first person to succeed in determining the composition of water and in synthesizing the compound from its elements.</p>
<p>Lavoisier coined name as oxygen in the year of 1778 and hydrogen in the year of 1783.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should watch the BBC's fabulous three part documentary series &quot;Chemistry: A Volatile History&quot;. You can find it online.</p>
<p>Presented by Jim Al Khalili, it details the history of our understanding of chemistry and the elucidation of the periodic table. Because the discoveries are presented chronologically, you get an incredibly clear sense of how each discovery contributed to the next. You also get a good sense of some of the colourful personalities involved. Scientific progress really feels like an adventure.</p>
<p>It doesn't really dumb anything down, and does an extraordinary job of clearly communicating ideas that I have seen botched over and over again by university lecturers.</p>
<p>For my money, &quot;Chemistry: A Volatile History&quot; and a sister series &quot;Atom&quot; (which takes the same approach to discoveries in sub-atomic and quantum physics) are the finest scientific documentaries of recent years. They should be required viewing for any undergraduate scientist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Try to break it into components with various chemical reactions. If all attempts fail, it is some evidence that you actually have an element. Before the relative masses of atoms could be determined and the periodic table was filled, you couldn't be sure. With modern knowledge you can also measure the thermodynamic properties of a gas to see if you have individual atoms, diatomic molecules or something more complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
