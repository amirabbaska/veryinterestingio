<blockquote>
<p>Researchers from the University of North Carolina Wilmington investigated how marine mammals’ tissues—specifically, fat deposits in the jaws of toothed whales that are used in echolocation—absorb nitrogen gas, one of the gases that contributes to the bends. They found that the makeup of the fat affected how much nitrogen gas dissolves in it—and that different species had different fat compositions.</p>
<p>Once, scientists thought that diving sea creatures like the elusive, deep-diving Cuvier’s beaked whale were resistant to the bends, but mounting evidence suggests that this may not be entirely true.</p>
<p>In 2002, international navy sonar exercises were linked to a mass stranding of 14 whales in the Canary islands. The whales had gas bubbles in their tissues, a sign of decompression sickness.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always been told that free divers (divers without SCUBA gear) aren't subject to the bends. What I've always heard is that they don't get the bends because since they only go down with the air in their lungs, there isn't an excess of nitrogen to go into their blood to form bubbles. Basically, the nitrogen in their lungs just comes back out of their bloodstream into their lungs instead of being trapped since they aren't constantly breathing in new air leading to an excess of nitrogen to be dissolved in their blood. Seems like the same logic would apply to whales and dolphins. They only go down with their lungs worth of air so it just comes out of their blood back into their lungs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading a study (I can't find the link right now but IIRC it was mentioned the the wiki page on either Cuvier's Beaked Whales or Sperm Whales) that in post mortem analysis they showed pitting on the bones in older specimens indicative of damage caused by repeated or long term exposure to nitrogen narcosis effects. So maybe not entirely immune. Whether they've evolved to not be bothered  by it / feel the same pain, or the same mental affects as us though, isn't really known.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason people <em>can</em> get the bends is because they are breathing compressed air. Air is mostly nitrogen and when this gets released at depth, the nitrogen bubbles get into your bloodstream. It takes time for these to dissipate as you ascend, which is why you ascend slowly when on compressed air. If you take a big breath of normal pressure air and then drive super deep, you can ascend at whatever rate you want.</p>
<p>This is why free divers can swim upwards incredibly fast with their huge monofin after their speed descents - besides the fact that they have to in order not to drown...</p>
<p>By the way, they call it the bends because when it happens, the nitrogen bubbles get trapped in people's joints, causing them much pain when bending the joints. IE: &quot;the bends&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
