		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's suppose you have two twin astronauts as described in the Twin Paradox thought experiment. Each of them is given one particle of a quantum entangled pair for safekeeping. One
twin remains on Earth, while the other flies away for several years traveling at nearly the speed of light. When he returns to Earth he is younger than his brother. The entangled particles have experienced the same effect as the brothers have, and are brought back together. Are the particles both still entangled in the same time reference to one another? If you collapsed the wave function of one particle would the other &quot;end&quot; collapse at the same time, or would it seem to happen with some sort of delay in relation to the time dilation effect that had been imposed?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum information is pretty far from my field so I feel like I shouldn't say too much until someone who knows more comes along.  However, considering that every answer you've gotten so far is flat-out incorrect, I will at least take a stab at answering WHY you haven't gotten any more expert answers yet.</p>
<p>First off, correcting some incorrect answers:</p>
<p>1) Quantum entangled particles ARE correlated in some non-classical way.  If they weren't we wouldn't have needed to come up with quantum mechanics.  </p>
<p>2) Quantum states absolutely experience time/age.  Time evolution (through unitary operators) is pretty central to quantum mechanics and quantum wavefunctions, on top of regular time dependence that classical particles have, also have a phase that change in time.  This actually even allows for types of time dependence, like Aharnov-Bohm, that classical particles don't have. So one could argue that they're even MORE time dependent than classical particles. If they weren't you couldn't build something like a LASER.</p>
<p>However, there is an inherent problem in mixing measurement paradox thought experiments with special relativity.  Namely, such thought experiments are phrased in the language of quantum mechanics (bra-kets and states) but QM is not actually the most fundamental form of quantum theory and, crucially, is incompatible with special relativity (not to be confused with incompatibility with general relativity, which is the case of all quantum theories and is one of the biggest open questions in physics).</p>
<p>Conversely, the more fundamental version of quantum theory that IS compatible with special relativity, quantum field theory (QFT), does not lend itself to such simple little thought experiments about state and measurement.  For example, I honestly have never seen a QFT treatment of the popular spin-singlet measurement set-up and I'm not sure if one exists (again, hopefully someone knows more).  More specifically, in QFT, not only do you not even have a wavefunction, but particle number is not even a concrete number in any real system.  That's not to say that entanglement doesn't occur in the more &quot;fundamental&quot; QFT, it does reduce to QM in certain limits after all, but rather the formalism makes tackling the issue far more complicated, which is why people choose to almost exclusively work in the &quot;approximation&quot; of quantum mechanics when talking about such things.  However, talking about SR and QM is a no-go.</p>
<p>There actually is something called &quot;Relativistic Quantum Mechanics&quot; that is essentially the first effort to make QM compliant with SR, but it was eventually abandoned after it was realized it could never work, and the entire quantization procedure itself had to be changed - which lead to QFT.  Though I do wonder if it works well enough that you might be able to consider something of your problem, but I'm hardly an expert on such defunct theories.</p>
<p>You can maybe get an idea of the problem as such, in QM you have an individual particle's behaviour modeled by a wavefunction and the behaviour of two particles governed by some linear combination of a product of two wavefunctions (don't worry about this).  These wavefunctions, like all waves, obey Heisenberg's Uncertainty which can be said, in a certain form, to say:  the variance/uncertainty in the time interval in which a system is considered multiplied by the variance/uncertainty in the system energy, must be equal to or greater than some number.  This means that if the time interval becomes arbitrarily small, the energy variance/uncertainty becomes arbitrarily big.  That's what QM says.  However, SR says E=mc^2 .  So if the system has enough energy, then new particles can be created (i.e. if energy is greater than mass of two electrons times speed of light squared you can make an electron-positron pair, for example). So putting the two (SR and QM) together you arrive at the notion that you have a theory of &quot;one particle-one wavefunction&quot; but depending on the time interval of consideration, one can have arbitrarily large energy variances implying that the number of particles is not only not fixed, but dependent on the interval of consideration.  So you could not possibly have a theory of one particle-one wavefunction that was accurate to arbitrary time and energy scales.</p>
<p>So QM and SR don't play nice, in QFT this issue is avoided by throwing out the concept of particles altogether and instead talking about quantized excitations of fields (an electron isn't a particle but an excitation of the electron field).  And QFT, although the most accurate scientific theory developed by humankind and entirely compliant with SR, is really set up to allow things like scattering probabilities to be calculated and doesn't treat state in such a straightforward way like QM.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that your thought experiment involves  BOTH SR and GR (general relativity). With SR alone there is no Twin Paradox, as how does one know which twin is younger and which older?  SR says all (inertial) reference frames are equivalent so where one twin heads off in a space ship at 0.9c, from that twin's perspective it's the Earth zooming away at 0.9c.  The symmetry is broken by the fact that one twin, and only one twin, entered a non-inertial frame, which is to say they accelerated.  Such acceleration is not described by SR and one needs GR.  Thus, although it is a point often skipped over, the Twin Paradox is actually a result of SR+GR.  Of course one can ignore this and use QM and just demand by fiat that one part of the spin-singlet is time evolved more than the other, but I'm fairly certain that will just lead to garbage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The particles do not actually have a physical link or connection, it can only be said that by knowing the state of one of the particles , you are able to know the state of the other, without having to be communicated that state, and visa versa. There is no communication between entangled particles, and no violations of causality. Nothing is &quot;collapsing&quot; but our ignorance of the actual state, all other postulated manifold possibilities (arrived at using imprecise models, at best) are excluded once an interaction occurs/a measurement is obtained. The distance, time, frame of reference, etc, are not material to this effect. If I've seriously erred here, someone please correct me!</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm wrong about the details of entanglement (see below), but I still think it's true that OP's conditions on the communication are not relevant because there is no communication (at least no one tore me a new one about that part, yet, haha).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be use the wrong mental model for entanglement. It is not some kind of wire that transmits information between both particles, so that one tells the other when to collapse. In particular, the (non-existent) wire does not keep a record of when (or in which reference frame) it was created, so that it would know to wait the appropriate amount of time to collapse the other particle that stayed at Earth.</p>
<p>It is hard to find a good classical analogy for entanglement precisely because it's so nonclassical. The closest one comes is a correlation between two random variables, but even that is wrong, as the correlation is information calculated by someone who is keeping statistics, whereas entanglement is something physical, that does not depend of whether anyone is making measurements or not.</p>
<p>The clearest explanation I know for what actually happens when an entangled pair of particles is measured is the one given by the Many Worlds interpretation. According to it, the entangled pair is a superposition between two potential worlds, one where both particles &quot;point up&quot;, and another where both particles &quot;point down&quot;. Then when one of the twins makes a measurement on one the particles, it creates two copies of himself, one in the &quot;pointing up&quot; world, and another in the &quot;pointing down&quot; world. When the second twin does his measurement, he will also create two copies of himself, one in the &quot;pointing up&quot; world, and another in the &quot;pointing down&quot; world.</p>
<p>This explanation makes it clear that the copy of the first twin that saw &quot;up&quot; in his measurement will meet the copy of the second twin that also saw &quot;up&quot; in his measurement (and the same for &quot;down&quot;), without any information being send around, or any conflict with relativity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum states do not &quot;age&quot;. In the sense that if they changed, it would amount to interacting with the state and therefore destroying the entanglement. Entanglement is actually most easily done with particles at light speed, since most experiments use entangled photon pairs. So to answer your question. No there would be no delay. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
