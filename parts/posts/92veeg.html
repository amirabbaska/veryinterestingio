		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Float : USD rate is depending on what the foreign exchange market believe it is to be worth. What causes it to go up and down simply is how much people are buying or selling the dollar for tradw uses/investment. </p>
<p>Like apples ..if there are a lot of people wanting apples from Mr. John down the street and he's the only one but has limited amount of apples to sell..the value per apple will rise. If no one wants it or if Mr. John has too much apples..he will lower price to get some people to buy it..thus people will value the apple less. </p>
<p>To get into the complexity of currency market is far beyond ELI5 especially with interesting rates and free flowing capital (the trifecta system..you can only control two).</p>
<p>The other side is a fixed exchange rate: countries like China and others will tie their currency to USD or another currency..buying or selling that currency to keep their own value.
Fun article to see what happens when a nation suddenly stops fixed currency.</p>

<p>There is a third way but I'm sure 5 year old tommy has gotten bored. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ask yourself: how is the value of anything determined? </p>
<p>Its a balance between what buyers are willing to trade for it, and what sellers are willing to accept for it.</p>
<p><strong>Money is no different from any other market good</strong>. There is a supply and demand of money. The value of a currency is determined by what people are willing to trade for it, be that sandwiches, cars, houses, etc, or other currencies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Person 1: I say 1 snarf is worth 18 shmeckles.</p>
<p>Person 2: I think it's worth 20.</p>
<p>Person 1: I will trade you 19 shmeckles for 1 snarf.</p>
<p>Person 2: That sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>1 snarf is now worth 19 shmeckles. Just replace the nonsense with real currencies. </p>
<p>As conditions behind a currency change like how much is in circulation and how much people want a currency can change. </p>
<p>If shmeckleland were to suddenly become an industrial power house with out adding new shmeckles, more people may try to buy shmeckles to buy their products driving up the demand and it will become more valuable as people try to get more. 1 snarf could be worth 5 shmeckles as a result.</p>
<p>If all their factories got taken out by a supervolcano, their production would be greatly affected and people would not need to buy shmeckles so the value of their currency would drop. 1 snarf could go back to being worth 20 shmeckles.</p>
<p>Or if their government were to start making lots of new shmeckles to fund houses for every man, woman, child, and dog in shmeckleland, people seeking to get shmeckles would no longer have to offer good deals as there wouldn't be as much competition for to buy them so the price could go down depending on how many new shmeckles are made. 1 snarf could be worth 50 shmeckles. </p>
<p>Edit: added snarf to shmeckle exchange rates at the end of the scenarios.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If people are willing to accept one currency as a means of payment more than another, then that first currency becomes more valuable - you are more likely to accept US Dollars from me as a means of payment than you are Kenyan Shillings as an example.</p>
<p>In reality what determines this is things like the economic prospects of one country vs another and things like how indebted that country is and its interest rates.</p>
<p>How &quot;in demand&quot; a currency is on the global stage, dictates how valuable it is compared to any other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are on the border of Denmark and Germany, and you want a hamburger. A hamburger in Germany is 1 Euro and a hamburger in Denmark costs 8 Krone. So 1 Euro is worth 8 Krone for you. You are willing to sell your 1 Euro for 8 Krone and vice versa.</p>
<p>Everyone who trades currency makes a similar decision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
