		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not significantly. Not removing the honey instead triggers swarming and the foundation of new hives, or they get to a point the queen can't lay enough in a day to grow the population.</p>
<p>Honey is a hives food stores for winter. Adults need only carbohydrates to survive since they do not grow or repair and honey provides that.  Bees have no mechanism to know how long or cold winter will be during the warm seasons so they store as much honey as possible which ends up being well in excess of their needs. </p>
<p>When winter starts approaching the queen will stop laying (depending on environment, tropically located queens might never shut down laying) and the population of the hive declines. This is partially to ensure that there is enough honey, a smaller population needs to eat less. Its also because in the off season they have no reason to have large populations. There is less brood to be raised, no nectar or pollen to bring in and generally less work to be done. </p>
<p>After the winter solstice and the first pollen availability the queen will start laying again. The population starts to climb but it takes population  of adults to care for the young and raise them so the queen can't just lay 2000 eggs a day. She has to limit the growth for a while so there are enough adults to care for the larva. </p>
<p>Assuming everything goes well and winter ends in a timely fashion the hive will grow significantly and just before the major spring nectar flow it will swarm. Half or more of the bees and the old queen will leave the hive and found a new hive somewhere else. A new queen will be raised in the old hive. In both space is freed up because there is a gap in brood production. In the old hive because it takes 16 days for a new queen to mature, a week or so for her to start laying and 21 days for her first brood to emerge. In the new hive the old queen can start laying as soon as there is comb, less than a day after its founding but space is limited and its still 21 days before adults emerge.</p>
<p>Both hives then go about collecting for winter. They will draw as much comb as possible given the available space and fill it with brood, honey and pollen. Situations can arise where brood nest space is backfilled with honey when they run out of space to build comb but this triggers additional swarming reducing the population. </p>
<p>Given a very large space they will store more and more honey but the brood space has a limit. The queen can only lay so many eggs a day (the max is generally given as 1500-200). Once those emerge as adults they have a summer life span of apr 45 days and work themselves to death. The queen can keep up with the turn over but at a certain point (50,000 workers or so) she can't lay fast enough even if there was space available to increase the population further. They will instead just store more honey. This is the honey we take as beekeepers, that honey they clearly have in excess and will never eat in winter.</p>
<p>I am a beekeeper.</p>
<p>EDIT: More info:</p>
<p>Experiments have been done to show bees look for a space <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/2653/Bait%20Hives%20for%20Honey%20Bees.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y" target="_blank">apr 40L in size for a hive with an opening about a 10-15 cm3</a>.  So in nature they aren't looking for giant spaces anyway.  The standard American hive the Langstroth with 10 frames is apr 40L. The standard is also to have 2 of those boxes for the brood nest so double what is found in nature and then to add additional boxes just for honey collection. Beekeepers also manage hives to reduce swarming (we don't want half our bees flying away just before peak production times). We also protect them from predators, pests and diseases found in the wild. If anything managed bee hives that we take honey from tend to have larger populations than those found in nature.</p>
<p>Down here in the south its not unusual to find Africanized bees in boxes as small as a water meter rather than the 40L 15' up that European ones prefer. These small hives swarm as often as the can, nearly once a month. Those small size hives produce virtually no honey and if winter is cold (like North Florida cold a few freezing nights a year) they can't survive the winter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Found the guy who made a reddit topic after reading about the <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/article218795955.html" target="_blank">70,000 bees</a> that were dislodged from a rotted out tree after a Virginia tornado.</p>
<p>I'm guessing you were wondering if this nest got so big because it wasn't getting harvested? From the other answers, it sounds like this hive must've been special in some way.</p>
<p>Although now I wonder how possible it would be for a second hive to be established within the same (huge hollow) tree, and then after that the second queen dies and the first hive just adopts the second hive. I would love to hear how possible this would be</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. If you are over harvesting and not leaving enough for them to survive through dirth and winter, then yes. If you are only harvesting the excess then you wouldn't see much difference. Honey bees don't stop storing honey as long as they are able to produce it, so excess is likely under the proper circumstances. </p>
<p>Many beekeepers even supplement their bees honey stock with sugar patties in the winter so that the hive will be stronger going into spring and with sugar water during a dearth. No artificial food will support a hive better than their own honey though.</p>
<p>Supplemental feeding is also used when they're building comb so that the comb is produced with low quality food rather than honey. Sugar water honey tastes like garbage. This way they're using nectar during the big flows to make honey rather than comb. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Then people complained about bees round there and the house was investigated for the problem.  </p>
<p>Bees had built a nest in the roof space and over several years the ceiling in one room had collapsed and the bees continued to build in the room where the nest had landed and filled half the room.</p>
<p>It was a major undertaking to remove the whole lot!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A queen can lay between 1,000 and 2,000 egggs per day. A worker bee born in the summer lives 6 to 7 weeks. So if a queen lays 1,000 eggs per day for 42 days, that is 42,000 bees and 2,000 eggs for 49 days is 98,000 bees. Average hive is about 60,000 in the summer. In the winter it drops to about 10,000 and those winter bees have a longer life span, 4-6 months. Bees are amazing,</p>
<p>Fun fact. The bees keep the temperautre in the hive between 92 and 99 degrees all year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
