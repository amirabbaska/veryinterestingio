So, in theory, if I pull some Magic School Bus shenanigans and shrink down, how fast would it seem to be? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed at which the cells will move will significantly depend on a range of factors, such as the local environment. But to give you a sense of the speed, there was <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5614560/" target="_blank">one study</a> where researchers used 3D microscopy to track neutrophils moving through a forest of collagen fibers. They found a speed of ~10um/minute. This is about the same size as the diameter of the cell, meaning that they travel their own size about once per minute.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that white blood cells are twice as active for every degree of a fever. Not everyone recognizes that the immune system functioning properly leads to a fever. The fever is part of the immunological response, so as I understand it, taking an antipyretic is antithetical to immune system function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
