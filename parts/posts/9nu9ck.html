		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My grandpa (a known story stretcher) told me he used to haul tankers full of this chemical. It was supposed to absorb really fast and that it was so deadly a drop on your skin would kill you in a minute or two. It was used in the production of tires. He said it was phenol but phenol doesn't match up with his description. He's told me this story since I was a kid but now at 23 I'm curious as to if there are any chemicals that deadly and what they would possibly be used for.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There certainly do exist some chemicals where just a few drops on your skin can kill you. The chemical in question needs to have two properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>It needs to be lethal at very low concentrations (e.g. as measured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose" target="_blank">the median lethal dose or LD50</a> or a related metric). Specifically for your question we would require that a volume of ~0.5mL of the substance should be enough to kill a person. Quite a large range different solutions actually fit this bill. But then there is a second requirement:</li>
<li>The chemical needs to be easily absorbed through your skin, such that enough of the active component can cause damage. Your skin is actually a decent protective barrier for a lot of substances, but some compounds are more easily absorbed.</li>
</ol>
<p>A very famous example of a chemical that fits both criteria is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethylmercury" target="_blank">dimethylmercury</a>. This is a powerful neurotoxin that is frankly terrifying. To quote the Wiki article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The toxicity of dimethylmercury was highlighted with the death of Karen Wetterhahn, a professor of chemistry at Dartmouth College, in 1997. Professor Wetterhahn specialized in heavy metal poisoning. After spilling a few drops of this compound on her latex glove, the barrier was compromised and within minutes it was absorbed into her skin. It circulated through her body and accumulated in her brain, resulting in her death ten months later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, even when wearing safety attire, just spilling a few drops on a glove was enough to send the researcher to an early grave. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TMAH <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetramethylammonium_hydroxide" target="_blank">(tetramethylammonium hydroxide)</a> is a nasty chemical that a spill roughly the size of your hand will kill you. </p>
<p>Like start making phone calls to the people you love sort of kill you. It is also used in industry so it is possible that he was hauling it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A less likely but still somewhat plausible candidate is chlorine trifluoride, whose properties are described in vivid detail by Dr Derek Lowe <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/02/26/sand_wont_save_you_this_time" target="_blank">here</a>. A droplet of <em>that</em> hell-brew doesn't even need to hit your skin to kill you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with what others said, DMSO is incredibly good at both solvating things and going through your skin.  Almost any compound dissolved in DMSO would immediately get to the bloodstream if spilled, so that relaxes the skin absorption requirement.</p>
<p>Fun fact, DMSO will also make you taste garlic immediately upon absorption on any part of your body.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerve agents such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX_(nerve_agent)" target="_blank">VX</a>or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent" target="_blank">Novichok</a> (keeping it topical, no pun intended) will certainly do the job. Several types of alkaloid would be classed as deadly enough that a drop would kill you e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine" target="_blank">Nicotine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batrachotoxin" target="_blank">Batrachotoxin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epibatidine" target="_blank">Epibatidine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrodotoxin" target="_blank">Tetrodotoxin</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethylmercury" target="_blank">Methylated mercury</a>, as another comment stated, will certainly kill you albeit not quickly. </p>
<p>Very often the lethality of a substance is lower than might be expected due to poor absorption upon skin contact e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl" target="_blank">Fentanyl</a>. </p>
