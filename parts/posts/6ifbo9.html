		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We really don't know, and some people can not. Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">Aphantasia</a>, which generally concerns the inability to &quot;visualize&quot; things, but extends, in some cases, to having no &quot;inner monologue&quot;.</p>
<p>ASIDE: I didn't realize I couldn't do the mind picture thing until the one time, as an adult when I suddenly could for a few seconds. For whatever reason I suddenly could see a camshaft in my mind... and I'm not even a gear head. Now, of late I've discovered that CBD oil in a fairly large dose will let me turn on this feature of my brain somewhat.</p>
<p>There is also the inextricable question of &quot;what is consciousness&quot;, which strongly seems to include this inner voice, but according to that whole aphantasia thing doesn't require the voice completely...</p>
<p>When I read the literature as a lay person (and something of a librarian, and an accomplished computer scientist) it seems to me that the whole mechanism of consciousness and inner monologue is something of an error correction protocol.</p>
<p>We seem to have a vested interest in being able to monitor our own thoughts. The primary role feels like a &quot;bullshit detector&quot;, where we can try ideas to see if they fit, or if they are worth admitting despite their ill-fit, with our &quot;story of the universe&quot;.</p>
<p>Basically we need to be able to &quot;try on&quot; what we just heard or thought, and so what we are about to say.</p>
<p>In terms of pure mechanism, most of the brain is an electrical/neurological dead end. All the signaling enters and leaves through the brain stem or other &quot;primitive&quot; structures, but all of our &quot;higher thinking&quot; happens in the newer structures that don't directly touch the outside world.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that &quot;the outputs are tied back to the inputs&quot; in a feedback loop.</p>
<p>We hear sounds. Those sounds go through a decoder to convert them into information. The information goes pretty much everywhere in the &quot;neocortex&quot; systems of your brain. Those cortex operations formulate a response. As that response heads back it gets looped through the decoder. We get a chance to decide if that output is worth it. (Should I <em>really</em> say that or is it just going to lead to violence or embarrassment?) If it gets a pass then that's what we say (or do) in response.</p>
<p>So people who <em>couldn't</em> &quot;Try on their words before speaking&quot; might be a lot more likely to say something that would get them in trouble. It also lets us choose between phrasing; &quot;I is happy&quot; and &quot;I am happy&quot;; to decide which one makes us sound less stupid or whatever.</p>
<p>Once you understand that you experience yourself at sort of the mid-level of abstraction, that you &quot;hear words&quot; <em>despite</em> the input just being a bunch of individual sound waves, then the model makes more sense.</p>
<p>Try repeating a word, any word - I recommend &quot;door&quot; - aloud, again and again. You'll soon find yourself asking yourself if its a real word. The sound will literally begin to lose its meaning. We think this happens because when its repeated for no reason the parts of the brain that are so conceptual that we don't feel them running concludes that the repetition of the word is &quot;just a sound&quot; instead of being a meaningful act of speech.</p>
<p>So a lot of inclusive and frankly subjective thought tell us that the part of us we think of as being us is just a slab of middleware. It's the system that monitors the flow from the physical to the conceptual and back. And the system works because it can block the noise and the &quot;bad ideas&quot; from making it all the way through by saying &quot;nah, that can't be right&quot;.</p>
<p>But since it's the same singular system it all &quot;sounds the same&quot; whether the signal is coming from the outside or the inside. But not exactly the same. Most people assign their own voice to their inner monologue. They can tell someone else's words from their own.</p>
<p>And, of course, when that identity operation starts to fall apart, people start &quot;hearing other voices in their head&quot; instead of just their own.</p>
<p>This means the system is important but a little bit fragile.</p>
<p>And none of this is &quot;fixed and solid scientific doctrine&quot; as there is no identified and absolutely distinct part of the brain where this all happens. There's no one spot we could laser out to &quot;pull the plug&quot; to turn off this feature. So it is extremely difficult to quantify.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a big question in the realm of psychology which has been thought about since the inception of that particular science. Actually this is a question that many philosophers addressed since before &quot;psychology&quot; was &quot;psychology&quot;, and we can take two different approaches towards this.</p>
<p>The most simple and most suited to most modern day people is the neurological approach. Essentially, &quot;what is happening in your brain when you hear your own inner voice?&quot;.</p>
<p>Science has noted that when someone is engaged in inner-speech that the part of their brain that is active during normal audible speech is also active. So, basically the part of your brain that is responsible for making words is also working to create your own inner dialogue. In fact, it has been noted that even though you are making no audible sound there are minor fluctuations in your larynx (throat) that are also happening despite that the throat isn't producing sound.</p>
<p>The other approach to this is a bit more esoteric, and it basically has to do with the idea that your brain, or your intellectual function is not really <em>YOU</em>. It is just a portion of you that performs a job, and this job is to think. So that part of you that is actually &quot;awareness&quot; or &quot;conscious&quot; is observing the portion of you that thinks from a third-person perspective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/maggierogers/dog-years" target="_blank">song stuck in my head</a>, and I just realized that the song continues, including vocals, underneath my inner dialog or when reading different words. It kinda just lowers in volume a bit like music does in a movie when they're focussing on the actor's words. Strange.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I have a follow-up question that's been touched on but perhaps not fully answered to my liking elsewhere in this thread:</p>
<p>I do not hear a &quot;voice&quot; when I think things through in my head, unless I'm actually thinking about how something would sound when spoken. I can generate and &quot;hear&quot; my own voice or voices of others if I want to/need to for a thought. I can visualize images, colors, etc., I can hear music, and I think through processes, ideas, memories, etc. very easily, but when I'm just considering things, there's no &quot;inner monologue&quot; (or at least nothing I'd characterize as such). I kind of &quot;feel&quot; the thought or run through &quot;experiencing&quot; an action or idea, rather than hearing anything.</p>
<p>Does this seem like anything related to aphantasia?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

How, if at all, did this inner dialogue exist before language existed? Would that even be possible? If so in what form would it manifest?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
