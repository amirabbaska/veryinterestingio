		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Burn blisters occur when the second layer of the skin is damaged, they occur to protect the underlying skin layers from more damage and infection. You could see it as the bodys/skins natural bandage, so never pop them.</p>
<p>The skin remain  warm because of the increased blood in the area to repair and replace the damaged skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blister formation has to do with the effects of inflammation and cell injury. When cells die due to burn injury, a variety of inflammatory processes go into effect, one of which is vasodilation (enlargement) of capilaries (the body's smallest vessels) in the affected area. This process serves to  bring more blood to the affected area in order to fix the burn. </p>
<p>During the vasodilation, a phenomenon known as capillary leak occurs, where the water part of blood and some soluble particles escape from the circulation and pile up the intersitial spaces (outside of the vessels)  around the burn. When the top layer of skin detaches from its base due to the increased pressure, we see the blisters.</p>
<p>As for why it remains warm, it is based on the same principle. When we have vasodilation of capillaries to one area, it increases blood flow, and with increased blood flow we also have increased heat to that area coming from the blood.</p>
<p>The principles of inflammation are all related to the question, heat, redness, pain, and loss of function.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently completed a first aid course and it was emphasized to us to cool down a burn for <em>20 minutes</em>. This is much longer than anyone typically cools down a burn for, because in the case of minor burns you'll start feeling relief much before then. </p>
<p>The instructor assured us that the heat under the skin will continue to do damage in that 20 minutes if we weren't continually cooling the burn. </p>
<p>And it kind of clicked for me when I equated it to, of all things, baking. </p>
<p>I enjoy baking and there are some confections (like chocolate chip cookies) which I make sure to remove from the oven just /before/ they're done. The logic is they will continue to retain heat, and finish baking outside the oven. So if you were to take them out when they're &quot;done&quot;, by the time they have cooled they might be dry or crispy or generally overdone. </p>
<p>A similar thing is happening with a burn. Your skin is continuing to &quot;cook&quot; until all the heat has dissipated. </p>
<p>Please remember to run minor burns under lukewarm water for a full 20 minutes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quick &amp; easy:
When you have a wound the system reacts creating new mini vessels to help repair it (these mini vessels allow cells from the immune system to come more quickly), so basically there are more vessels therefore the blood flow increases and it warms up the area due to the great amount of blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blisters occur when small blood vessels, known as capillaries under the first layer of skin, are damaged. The damage allows smaller molecules to pass through the damaged walls of the capillaries. A blood blister occurs when the damage is large enough that blood can pass through too. </p>
<p>Blood cells being significantly larger then water molecules. </p>
<p>Burns remain warm due those capillaries dilating,  allowing blood to flow closer to the surface. This allows the body to get nutrients and white blood cells where they need to be to protect and heal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
