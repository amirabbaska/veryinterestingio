		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a rough flight, definitely.  But surprisingly enough, it's not as turbulent as you would think.  The winds are fairly constant in speed and direction and there's not a lot of updrafts and downdrafts to toss you around like if you were flying into a summer thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Sure, there's been a few times where the hunters from both NOAA and the AF Reserve planes have been tossed around good, but that's only been a few instances vs the hundreds of eye penetrations they've done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hurricanes have very strong winds, but those winds are basically parallel to the ground. There's no downward draft that makes flying through other storms so dangerous. So while the plane's path will be offset by the strong winds, there's not as much risk about the winds forcing the plane into the sea. And remember that many planes typically fly at speeds exceeding 200 mph and are designed to hold together at those speeds. The groundspeed might be low if flying directly against the incoming air, but as far as the plane is concerned, it's flying as normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you were to roll down the window of your airliner and stick your hand out, the wind would be about 600mph. 175 is nothing, in fact it's about the speed those things takeoff at. They can barely fly with wind over the wing that slow. </p>
<p>The thing with planes is, yes they make their own wind by flying fast, but they also drift along with whatever the local wind is doing. Imagine you're running indoor laps on an ocean liner. You run and run and the only speed you feel is your own, the only wind on your face caused by your own running (regardless of what direction your pointed, you are running laps), and you're completely oblivious to how fast the ocean liner is going because you're getting carried along with it. The ocean liner is to you what the jet stream or hurricane or any wind is to an airliner: something that carries you along that you don't even notice unless it abruptly changes speed or direction. If you stick your hand out while running laps or flying, the only wind speed you'll feel is your own.</p>
<p>Now you won't feel the wind of a hurricane because you're drifting with it, but you will feel when it changes speed or direction because you'll get pushed and shoved until you're drifting in the new speed and direction, just like an ocean liner turning sharply might push you around uncomfortably. In a hurricane that speed and direction changes approximately once every constantly, so it'll be a bumpy ride for sure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a great video explaining how the winds in a hurricane affect a plane differently than the winds of a thunderstorm: <a href="https://youtu.be/h7CQaDEKbBU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/h7CQaDEKbBU</a></p>
<p>Basically,  a thunderstorm has incredible vertical wind shears while a hurricane has much more predictable, horizontal shears. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, these are specially trained pilots.  Second, they are in specially designed aircraft.  Third, They are able to travel WITH the hurricane, whereas other aircraft are trying to get to a fixed point on the ground and have to fight against the hurricane. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
