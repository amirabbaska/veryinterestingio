<p>Now what the product has in it is different, it must contain all necessary items that are advertised for FDA and Dietary regulations to apply. You can't sell things to people without knowing exactly what's in them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the country. Here in Czechia (and I believe it is EU law) they actually are required to do just that else its considered misleading the customer. Also its about the good will of the company because its impossible to set legally what is still ok and what not</p>
<p>I worked for a huge food corp and i remember when the pizza marketing team decided to photoshop packing of some mini pizzas they were bringing in from another country to look LESS rich with topping because the image looked nothing like the real thing... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In many places the food has to be the real item... but it's kind of like the difference between a model having their makeup meticulously applied for a photoshoot vs wearing it for a day. The burgers are constructed from the real ingredients by artists and presented in the best possible light. They're positioned so that you can see all the ingredients, even the bits that would be hidden in the middle of the burger.</p>
<p>See videos like <a href="https://youtu.be/NFzAPAJWAf4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/NFzAPAJWAf4</a> (pizza) or <a href="https://youtu.be/oSd0keSj2W8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/oSd0keSj2W8</a> (burger). It's all &quot;real&quot;, but it's also the very very best possible version of real.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, I don't mind glamour shots of food used in advertisements; however, misleading food quantities are where I draw the line. If a menu photo shows 15 deep fried mushrooms, but only 5 show up when I order it, that makes me angry. A slight discrepancy in quantity is normal, but not a 66% smaller quantity than is displayed on the menu.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>just FYI all those McDonald's burgers are really original burgers you are buying too, the thing is they use different lighting and they move all content to one side and take photo from the best angle, but in the end it's same burger as you buy, blaming them they are selling you different product their defense works be they just reshuffle content for easier holding in your hand</p>
<p>maybe it's same case with many other products</p>
<p>BTW all Ikea catalogue is just computer renders and I don't see people complaining about it, same goes for all smartphone advertisements, almost no company use actual products</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
