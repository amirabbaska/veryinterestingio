		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Saliva has very little “bodily” material for the HIV to reside in. Its mostly just water and salt. And as always dose makes the poison, so technically you could get HIV from saliva, but you would need to drink liters of it to even have a chance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It technically can be, but because you're producing so much of it, and it doesn't really contain much in the way of living cells for the virus to infect, little to none are transfered. If, however, you have a cut or ulcer, or other thing that is shedding blood and other live cells into the saliva, it's much more likely to spread that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HIV infects and invades particular types of white blood cells. Transmission of HIV usually requires contact with bodily fluids containing these infected cells, although free-floating virions could do the job as well (but probably require a larger dose to actually cause infection). Saliva typically doesn't contain these cells unless there are open sores in the mouth or you have recently had dental work done or something. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HIV is a bloodborn virus. It needs certain white blood cells to replicate and spread. Unless you have a sore or scratch, the HIV in the blood has no way of crossing over to the saliva in the mouth. At least not in a quantity that poses a risk of infection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human immune defense system has multiple layers, and saliva is one of these. It contains a cocktail of antiviral proteins, and assuming you don't have any sores in your mouth or throat saliva has to pass through the stomach, filled with hydrochloric acid, to reach the blood through the intestinal wall. </p>
<p>While some viruses have evolved adaptations that lets them survive all of this and infect a human, HIV isn't one of them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
