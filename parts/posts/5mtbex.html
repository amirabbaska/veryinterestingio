		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Little 1in. Lines on either side of the windshield about 4in from the top indicate the bottom of legal tint area. </p>
<p>Little dots called frits are used to create rough surface for proper bonding to take place during installation of the windshield. They are also used to help prevent being blinded without losing complete vision, working as a factory sun visor. </p>
<p>Edit: Corrected a mistake brought to my attention by u/BlueRockStar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The dots are acting as grit, to better make adhesive stick, instead of sliding around, since it is on glass. As for the lines, those are usually the heating elements for the defrost, and one may also be your antenna.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is to help protect the adhesive from the UV rays that would break it down.  Plus also hides it, as it wouldn't look attractive if you could see the bead of adhesive, the wavy pattern and possible air gaps from the outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black band around windshield is called the &quot;primer band.&quot; It protects the adhesive below from UV and also blocks it so you cant see it, as well as gives the glue a rougher surface to adhere to. The little dots are called frits, they are just for looks, and up around your RV mirror is the &quot;3rd visor frit&quot;, blocks the sunlight and looks nice. </p>
<p>Glass can also be shaded at the top 3 or 4 inches of the glass, usually blue to block the sun, but some fancy cars like porsche and Mercedes come in grey.</p>
<p>The orange lines that are in your back window can be many things, they are defrosters but can also be antennas for radio or GPS. </p>
<p>The little camera in the front of new cars is for the lane departure warning system and forward collision alert. Stops the car if you are going to rear end someone and warns you if you sway over the lines without your blinker. </p>
<p>You can also have a rain sensor, which turns the wipers on automatically when it rains.</p>
