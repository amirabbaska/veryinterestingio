<p>Sort of true; days/months/years are kind of standard, but the concepts of seconds, minutes, and hours has a varied history. Sit back, I got home from work early and the adderall is flowin' so I wrote up a nice history of units of time:</p>
<p>Early man tracked time day by day using apparent time, or time based on sundials and other observations of nature. I can't find too much info right now but as far as I can tell there was no standard unit of time shorter than a day among any major civilization for a while.</p>
<p>The Egyptians defined hours as 1/12th of either day or night, and had seasonal variations on the length of their hour.</p>
<p>Greek astronomers were the first to establish the modern hour, by dividing the day into six parts and then dividing those parts into four more. They also had an early version of the minute, which was how long it took for the sun to travel one degree along the sky, or about four minutes.</p>
<p>The Babylonians went a little nuts, also dividing the day into six parts, but then divided each part by sixty for their sub-units, up to at least six subdivisions, the smallest individual units being as accurate as two microseconds. However, instead of using a 1/24th of a day hour like the Greeks, they had a 1/12th day hour (120 min), but did use the 1/360th day minute, and something resembling a second called the barelycorn, about 3.5 modern seconds and still used in the hebrew calendar today as the helek.</p>
<p>In 1000, a Persian scholar named al-Biruni first termed the word second when he defined the period of time between two new moons as a figure of days, hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths. The minute was the first subdivision of the hour by 60, then the second, and so on. Roger Bacon did this again in the 1200's, but started with hours, giving a more accurate figure. The term third still exists in some languages, such as Polish, but fourths were apparently too small for any practical use and fell out of style with the general population.</p>
<p>The late 1500s what the first time a true standard second came to being with the advent of mechanical clocks, so that the time could be measured objectively from mean-time instead of deriving it from the apparent-time. The first clock with a second hand was built between 1560-70and 1579 saw the first clock with actual markings denoting the seconds. However, they weren't very accurate, and the second remained arbitrary from machine to machine and unable to be reliably measured.</p>
<p>In 1644 it was realized that a pendulum of a specific length would have an oscillation period of exactly two seconds, and by 1670 William Clement had tinkered with the physics enough to build a clock precise enough that the second was now an established unit of time. By 1862 it was established that the second would be the base unit of time for all scientific research, along with the millimeter and milligram, by The British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS), defining the second as 1/86,400th of a solar day by the 1940s.</p>
<p>From there we've just been refining the accuracy of what we call a second, accounting for the Earth's axis and ever-so slowly declining rotational velocity, to the point where it's not even measured by observations based on the earth and sun, but by the distance light travels in a vacuum or how many vibrations a cesium atom makes. We've divided time so hard that to do so any further wouldn't make sense; events in subatomic physics just don't happen quickly enough for smaller units of time to be measured.</p>
<p>But yeah, that's where we got our units of time. It's such a ubiquitous thing that we've had literally our entire existence to hash it all out, and while today we're all in agreement about the standard subdivisions and have been for a long time, there were discrepancies in the past and in the context of your post it must have been a special kind of frustrating trying to figure out what two people mean by &quot;hour&quot;</p>
<p>*However, while we all agree on the day/hour/second situation, the annual calendar is still pretty sporadic in it's appearance. The lunar month may seem standard, but there are many South-East Asian cultures that have their own unique way of dividing the year. I won't get into that, because it's mostly a headache and I'm kinda losing steam on this anyway, but long story short we're far from having a universal system here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer....</p>
<p>Ok, I lied. It's not short. <strong>TL;DR:</strong> it comes from the Earth's rotation. First came hours (1/12 of daytime, or 1/24 of a full rotation), then minutes (1/60 of an hour), then seconds (1/60 minute).  Why those numbers?  Read on.</p>
<p>People have always liked dividing things up into numbers that can be split evenly among groups of lots of different sizes. The most popular such number is probably 12 (dozens of eggs or doughnuts or muffins or cookies; larger pizzas are sometimes cut into 12 slices), since 12 things can be split evenly among 2, 3, 4, or 6 people (or 1 or 12, of course). </p>
<p>So historically, lots of things have been divided into 12 parts. There were originally 12 ounces in a pound (the word &quot;ounce&quot; comes from the Latin word for &quot;twelfth&quot;). And the day (sunrise to sunset, that is) was divided up into 12 parts, which we English-speakers now call &quot;hours&quot;. (Who first did this - the Chinese, the Sumerians, the Babylonian conquerors of the Sumerians - is a matter of some debate.)</p>
<p>Precise time measurement is a relatively recent invention; hours, usually as determined by a sundial (meaning they weren't all the same length), were good enough for thousands of years. But when we started to need units smaller than hours, we again wanted to divide them up into a convenient-for-grouping number. You might expect that we would just pick 12 again and have 12ths of 12ths, but that's not what happened. Don't get me wrong; 12 is great - like I said, you can distribute evenly around a group of 2,3,4, or 6 - but you'll notice that list skips a number: 5. If you want to be able to handle 5 groups with a whole number of pieces each, you need to bump the total number of pieces all the way up to 12 <em>times</em> 5, which is 60. (Presumably for this same reason, those Sumerian/Babylonians I mentioned actually counted in base 60, which is related to how we got 360Â° in a circle.)</p>
<p>So the hour was divided into 60 parts, called the &quot;small part of the hour&quot;. Eventually, of course, we needed even smaller pieces, so they renamed those as the &quot;first small part of the hour&quot;, and divided them into 60 again, making the new smaller unit the &quot;second small part of the hour&quot;. (And yes, there was also a &quot;third small part of the hour&quot;, and at least some documented uses of even smaller subdivisions; but these days those have been replaced by decimal fractions of the second.)</p>
<p>Those &quot;whateverth small part of the hour&quot; names are kind of unwieldy, however, so naturally they got abbreviated. Back when there was only one small part, it got abbreviated to just &quot;small&quot;. When the second one came along, it was naturally abbreviated &quot;second&quot;. Except all of the scientific writing where these units were first needed  was done in Latin, so the names were likewise Latin. From Latin for &quot;small&quot; we get &quot;minute&quot;, and from Latin for &quot;second&quot; we get &quot;second&quot;. </p>
<p>So that's the answer to your question: if you take the average day(time period in temperate zones) and divide it into 12, then divide those 12 parts into 60, and then divide those 60 parts into 60 again, you get the second. It's ultimately based on the Earth's rotation - a 60th of a 60th of a twelfth of a half of it, which is 1/86,400. In other words, on average, the Earth takes 86,400 seconds to make a full rotation with respect to the Sun. (It actually only takes about 86,164 seconds to rotate all the way around its axis, but since it has moved in its orbit in that time, it needs the extra 4 minutes or so to catch up so the same part of the Earth is directly in line with the Sun again.)</p>
<p>But the Earth is a lousy clock by modern standards - it wobbles due to all sorts of influences: gravity from the Moon, the asymmetrical effect of wind and tides on its uneven surface; basically, it's actual rotational speed is not consistent. So while its rotation is the ultimate source of the unit we call the &quot;second&quot;, it's no longer part of that unit's definition. Instead, we have a much more precise definition based on counting cesium radiation emissions. Those emissions are impossible to predict individually, but happen very quickly - so fast that there are almost 10 BILLION with a B of them in a single second. Thanks to the law of large numbers, the amount of time required to collect such a huge number of emissions is amazingly consistent. Based on the number of emissions counted during the second as previously defined, we now define the second as the amount of time it takes to rack up 9,192,631,770 radiation cycles of cesium-133.</p>
<p>But we picked that number based on the previous definition, so the second is still derived from the Earth's rotation, even if it is no longer actually tied to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Egyptians were the first to split the full cycle of day and night up into 24 hours, a system that was later improved upon by Greek astronomers Ptolemy and Hipparchus who further split it up in a sexagesimal (60 as a base) system, and that's where the second comes into play. First you divide an hour into 60 parts, creating the minute, and then you divide that a <em>second</em> time, hence the name, creating 1/60th of a minute. Further splitting up a second in sixthieths is called a third, but that's not really used nowadays.</p>
<p>At the time it wasn't possible to keep time that accurate, but towards the end of the 16th century mechanical clocks were able to measure seconds accurately, which is also when the English word for them came into use.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Since so many people ask &quot;Why use 60 as a base?&quot;, the answer is because it's easy to divide it by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12 15, 20 and 30, making it a solid base for counting.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One second is equivalent to the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.</p>
<p>This is the atomic way to measure 1 second. Anyone anywhere who could measure this physical event would have the precise measurement of a second. If all the clocks on earth disappeared, this is how we could accurately recreate them. </p>
<p>Edit: Just thought I'd add, I didn't just pick a random element to describe this. This is the official measurement for a second in SI units (International System of Units). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Back when using 1/60 as a common part, the common word for 1/60th of something was a minute (my-newt) part. So, 1/60th of an hour became a minute part of an hour, and eventually just a minute.</p>
<p>What about dividing up the minute itself? Well, that was 1/60 of 1/60 of an hour, or a minute part of a minute part of an hour. It was easier just to say it was a minute part to the second degree. This is how the name &quot;seconds&quot; came about for 1/60 of a minute.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
