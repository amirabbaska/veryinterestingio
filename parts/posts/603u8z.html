		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is also known to cause precipitation as well. About 30-40 minutes after detonation in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, survivors experienced an irradiated &quot;black rain.&quot; While this may have also been attributed to heat gathering from city-wide fires, still a weird and terrifying phenomenon. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a meteorologist so it's hard to answer this sort of thing. There doesn't seem to be much published on the question. It is just worth noting that thunderstorms are typically quite large — 15 miles in diameter or so. Even very large nuclear explosions have relatively small fireballs compared to that (the 100 Mt Tsar Bomba would have had a 10 mile diameter fireball; whereas a 10 Mt weapon fireball is only 4 miles in diameter — both of those are extremely large weapons). There are going to be complicated relationships with the clouds above; blast waves can reflect off of clouds and temperature inversions, which can under some circumstances increase their range on the ground, in some cases reduce them. Under some circumstances you can <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/11/15/how-to-make-an-atomic-thunderstorm/" target="_blank">actually create a thunderstorm with a nuclear blast</a> (and it's been done).</p>
<p>So this isn't an answer — it's more of a &quot;it's complicated, it probably would require serious study&quot; sort of thing. I'm not sure it <em>has</em> been studied. The effects of nuclear weapons on very large storm systems (e.g. hurricanes) would be negligible — the systems are just too large relative to the size of the bomb that would interact with them. For smaller systems, it's definitely the case that the detonations can affect the local weather, but I'm not sure how easy it is to predict what would happen in any given situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just addressing the sudden temperature and pressure fluctuations, yes, the rain storm would stop. Low pressure allows for cooler air to gather and cause moisture; also, considering the dew point would no longer be close to the ambient temperature, it would cease to be conditions for precipitation. There's your answer in a nutshell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
