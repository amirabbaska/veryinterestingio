		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants sense gravity and then bend in response to it. This is called called gravitropism. One of the major gravity-sensing parts of the plant is the root tips.</p>
<p>Plants also sense light, and bend to respond to it. This is called phototropism.</p>
<p>Both processes act in concert to orient a plant appropriately.</p>
<p>The bending is achieved through the action of a growth-regulating plant hormone called auxin. When it's secreted selectively, those regions with the higher concentration of the hormone grow and elongate more quickly, which causes a bend in the overall structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called a &quot;tropism&quot; which is a response to a stimulus.  Geotropism; growing straight down towards the centre of the earth and phototropism; growing upwards towards sunlight (&amp; warmth).  Plants also grow towards water; hydrotropism.  A tropism explains why a pine tree on a mountainside will grow straight up on a 45 degree hillside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants have a growth factor (note: NOT hormone)  called indole acetic acid that causes cell elongation in shoots by interfering with the hydrogen bonds in the cell wall, so that they slide over eachother thereby lengthening. Sunlight affects distribution of this growth factor such that it exists mostly in the shaded side of the shoot. As a result, the shaded side grows faster than the sunny side, so the plant grows towards the sun.</p>
<p>In roots however, the same substance inhibits growth so that roots grow downwards. Its distribution is affected by gravity. The lower side has a higher concentration so its growth is inhibited more.</p>
<p>Like others have mentioned, this is called a tropism. Phototropism for light, geotropism for gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a really cool podcast about this, it's &quot;smarty plants&quot; from Radiolab. They talk, among other things, about some research that suggests plants can hear water. It's one of my favorite episodes, check it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good answers here but I don't see anyone describing the mechanism through which plant roots &quot;know&quot; to grow downwards. Plants contain statocytes at the tips of their roots. Statocytes contain statoliths, starchy organelles that rest on the bottom membrane of the cell due to gravity pulling them down. The location of the statoliths influence the direction of growth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
