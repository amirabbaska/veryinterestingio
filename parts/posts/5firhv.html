<p>Put very simply indeed, a clock is powered by a falling weight or an unwinding spring, but the speed at which these things happen has to be regulated -- otherwise the timepiece would simply run down within seconds, the hands spinning round in a blur. The escapement is what regulates this.</p>
<p>There are many different types of escapement, but the simplest rocks back and forth. As it does so, it lets go of a toothed wheel very briefly, before &quot;catching&quot; it again: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Anchor_escapement_animation_217x328px.gif" target="_blank">this GIF animation shows how it works</a> -- the rocking motion is provided either by a pendulum, or by a wheel (called a &quot;balance wheel&quot;) with a spring forcing it to oscillate back and forth. The escapement has two positions, and so two very slightly different sounds when it clicks into each position. Another type of escapement with two different states is the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Grasshopper-escapement_colored.gif" target="_blank">grasshopper escapement</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gears inside the clock are moved forward by a ratcheting movement in two phases.  There is a two pronged fork resting one prong against a gear.  The fork then pivots so that the other prong is resting against the gear.  This allows one tooth of the gear to move forward in a discrete motion (one tick).</p>
<p>Something like this.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is the ratchet thing mentioned by /u/liarandathief but there is also the fact that in classic pendulum clocks (much more strongly than &quot;Eccentric Escapement&quot; clocks) the pendulum is &quot;powered&quot; in one direction and reflexive in the other.</p>
<p>So you wind the clock and you start the pendulum swinging. The pendulum controls the rate at which the clock advances. Basically the length from the pivot to the center of mass determines how long one second (or half-second) takes (because of math and the &quot;period&quot; of the swing). There's a little screw on the pendulum that lets you fix a clock that's running a little fast or slow.</p>
<p>But if you've ever set anything swinging by hand, you know that it will stop swinging.</p>
<p>So, the clock spring or weights must gently nudge the pendulum with each swing.</p>
<p>This magic trick is performed by the fact that the real clock there are clever angles in the actual gear where the rocker and sprocket thing is working. This means that the pendulum ratchets one full cycle, but it's a &quot;shove-stop&quot; and then a &quot;stop&quot;, then a &quot;shove-stop&quot; then a &quot;stop&quot;.</p>
<p>If memory serves the shove-stop is slightly more energetic and makes a slightly higher pitched tone. Hence &quot;tick&quot; versus &quot;tock&quot; or &quot;shove-stop&quot; versus just the &quot;stop&quot;. Basically the mechanism moves slightly further and faster in one half of the cycle, and so makes a slightly different noise.</p>
<p>This was a huge problem in terms of both wear and stability, so over time the mechanisms evolved towards more uniformity in the two directions and clever means of dealing with the fact that springs and weights change how much push they have as they unwind or as the weight lowers (the longer chain length on the lower weight increases the torque a little.</p>
<p>So the tone differences and the &quot;is the power stroke the tick or the tock&quot; changes by clock clock maker choice and specific design.</p>
<p>Some clocks even contrive a way to have both strokes be power strokes.</p>
<p>And in &quot;electric pendulum drive&quot; clocks there are little linear motors that do the shoving and the two halves of the cycle have the same sound.</p>
<p>If you ever get a chance to look at the various mechanisms, and if you like mechanical things, it's really fascinating and clever.</p>
<p>EDIT: P.S. &quot;escapement clocks&quot; use a lop-sided weight with a separate spring to do what the pendulum does, the same push and return cycle is in force, but the forces are typically much smaller so the sounds are nowhere near as distinct. If you go to a drug store and buy the &quot;classic alarm clock&quot; with the bell(s) on top and the big round belly, you'll typically find the ticking to be quite uniform.</p>
<p>EDIT2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_7rE8afFfo" target="_blank">This Short Video</a> has an pendulum escapement that has power on both cycles, but the hand-made wedges are slightly different in either shape or lever arm distance (I couldn't tell for sure) and the tone slightly alternates.</p>
<p>EDIT3: In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLhqNET5OXg&amp;list=PLmUQT7cUKsbmLFgnK2xOgeW_48fihWpRW" target="_blank">This Very Short Animation</a> the left arm is ramped (vertically faced) and is the power stroke, the right arm is blunt (horizontally faced) and is the non-powered catch half of the cycle. You can see that the left side can be &quot;pushed&quot; by the gear while the right side can not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I love getting to see questions like this. I took a couple pictures of a clock in my shop really quick so I hope this makes sense. In one picture you can see the wheel ticking against the verge (the silver fork shaped piece). In the next it is against the other side. As the escape wheel turns it clicks against each side of the verge giving you two distinct sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
