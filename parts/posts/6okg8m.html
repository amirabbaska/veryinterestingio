<p>And really, why would they ever buy a new one? How long as that doctors office existed? They probably bought the scale 20 years ago and haven't had to replace it yet. Also, the electronic ones are spring based, and can suffer somewhat from drift errors when their springs age. They need periodic calibration. The balance style is much less sensitive to this, their wear modes don't really screw with their calibration (that would only happen if you chipped the weights).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They can't just say &quot;Darn, the scale broke, we can have another one in two days&quot;.  That puts durability in a different cost light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is the difference between a &quot;scale&quot; and a &quot;balance&quot;. Scales measure weight(downward force due to gravity on an object) by the use of springs or electronic load cells. Balances measure mass, an intrinsic property that is independent of the force of gravity by comparing the downward force on the  object with the force on know masses (those slides on the doctors scale. Not for nothing, but your doctor's scale (balance, really) would yield the same result on the surface of the moon. Your digital scale would not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I work in the medical office, we have 2 digital scales but the boss only replaces things that break. It's funny because the digital scales frequently are touchy but those old ones probably will work forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
