		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you drop a bouncy ball on a smooth floor like wood or even most cement, it will bounce straight back up. If you throw it at an angle, you can pretty easily figure out where it's going to bounce based on that. </p>
<p>Now drop or throw the same ball outside on some rocky or uneven ground and the direction the ball will go is much harder to predict. Even a small change in where the ball hits the ground could send it off in a totally different direction. </p>
<p>Now imagine we have a lot of balls and drop them at the same time making sure they aren't touching so they don't interfere with each other. On the smooth floor they will all stay in roughly the same positions relative to each other. On the rocky ground they will scatter everywhere. </p>
<p>A mirror is very smooth while a piece of paper is much more uneven on the small scale that light interacts with it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Something that is white reflects light in a bunch of different directions. This is called &quot;diffuse reflection&quot;.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an aside, mirrors best reflect light between 495 and 570 nanometers making them, in fact, slightly green.  This is noticeable in the &quot;hallway of mirrors&quot; effect.  When you position two mirrors to reflect each other, the images further down the&quot;hallway&quot; will appear tinged green.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The white paper reflects imperfectly, scattering the light and essentially mixing all the colors together.</p>
<p>The mirror reflects more precisely, and keeps the light in about the same order it started tith.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For mirrors, light rays that come in leave the surface at the same angle to the surface normal (the line perpendicular to the plane of the surface) they came in on. Because the mirror is smooth, at every place the light hits, the surface normals all point in the same direction. All that changes in its propagation vector is the sign of the component normal to the surface. Your eye sees then the image as reversed but recognizable.</p>
<p>With a rough diffuse surface like white paper, the light that reflects goes off again at the same angle to the surface normal as it came in on, but here the rough surface has surface normals pointing in a bunch of different directions. So the image seen by your eye scrambles as those reflected rays go off in a bunch of different directions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
