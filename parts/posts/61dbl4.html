		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is it about Citizen Kane that makes it such a highly regarded movie?</p>
<p>A lot of the time when someone is talking about if a movie is good or not they'll say something along the lines of &quot;It's no Citizen Kane or anything&quot;. It almost seemed to be used as a benchmark of moviemaking.</p>
<p>So why is this movie so highly respected? What makes it such a good movie? Is it the acting, cinematography, sound design, etc? What factors make it the pinnacle of movie making?</p>
<p>Also do you believe it deserves all the praise? Is the name it's built for itself deserved?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's less about being the pinnacle of movie-making and more about being the <em>start</em> of modern movie-making. </p>
<p>In <em>Citizen Kane</em>, director Orson Welles revolutionized how films were shot. There are a number of cinematic techniques that were introduced in <em>Citizen Kane</em> including low angle shots, multiple dissolves, deep focus, non-linear storytelling (in particular supported by the film editing), people talking over one another (most films were shot then as back-and-forth dialogue), full sets with four walls and a ceiling (most films then were shot on sets like stage plays -- 3 walls, no ceiling), incorporation of fake documentary/news reels (which Welles had pioneered on radio with <em>War of the Worlds</em>), expressionistic lighting, and more.  </p>
<p>All of these things are so commonplace today that you'll see them in many 30-second commercials, never mind feature films. But in 1941 they were all almost entirely new innovations that people had never seen until <em>Citizen Kane</em>. </p>
<p>Watching <em>Citizen Kane</em> today, you'd think &quot;What's the big deal?&quot; But the <em>reason</em> you think &quot;What's the big deal&quot; is because of all the techniques that <em>Citizen Kane</em> introduced to cinema. </p>
<p>Possible recent analogy: think about how the special effects of something like <em>Jurassic Park</em> or <em>The Matrix</em> in the 90's or maybe <em>Avatar</em> in 2009 changed the way that people thought about how films could be made. <em>Citizen Kane</em> had <em>ten times</em> the impact that those films had in people's thinking about how films could be made. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of reasons for Citizen Kane being highly regarded outside of its historical significance.  As /u/DoctorOddfellow explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Citizen Kane, director Orson Welles revolutionized how films were shot. There are a number of cinematic techniques that were introduced in Citizen Kane including low angle shots, multiple dissolves, deep focus, non-linear storytelling (in particular supported by the film editing), people talking over one another (most films were shot then as back-and-forth dialogue), full sets with four walls and a ceiling (most films then were shot on sets like stage plays -- 3 walls, no ceiling), incorporation of fake documentary/news reels (which Welles had pioneered on radio with War of the Worlds), expressionistic lighting, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it's important to note that it's not just that Welles used these techniques, but <em>how</em> he used him.  And in fact, many of the innovative things he did where already done in previous films (deep focus is used heavily in The Rules of the Game, 1939), but he was the first to do them all in a single movie.  The final chapter of one film textbook I read was dedicated to explaining why Citizen Kane is so great, and it opened by stating something along the lines of, &quot;Every shot in the movie contains meaning, and the worst of the shots are merely very good.&quot;</p>
<p>So to give you an idea, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbGbqRWwC_Q" target="_blank">here's a famous shot that students typically look at in film school.</a></p>
<p>Here are some things to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single shot once we enter the house/cabin.  Creating continuity in time, and also means that the blocking in this shot is all related</li>
<li>Contrast between how the mother is dressed (formal) vs the father (casual)</li>
<li>The camera moves away from the window with the mother in the foreground and father in the background, suggesting further that she has control over the scene</li>
<li>They sit down.  The characters are arranged so that the father is the only one standing.  Usually a character standing suggests strength, but since he is still in the background and his dressed casually, this blocking convention is somewhat subverted, just as this scene subverts gender dynamics as a whole.  Also, as they debate over the fate of a young Charles Foster Kane, he is scene in the background, between the two parents, playing in the snow.  (This all being visible to the audience is an example of his use of deep focus).</li>
<li>As the drama in the scene escalates, the father moves to the foreground and the camera tilts up (still the same shot).  The shot goes from a wide to a medium-wide, low-angle.  The continuity in movement further articulates the rise in drama, and suggests a last ditch effort by the father.  He now appears more menacing than before.  Maybe there is more to his relationship with his wife and son?  &quot;Anybody doesn't think I've been a good husband, or father...&quot;(we find out a few moments later that he is not a good father)  Note: Charlie is still in the center, background. </li>
<li>As the mother signs, the camera tilts back down, excluding the father from the frame, indicating that he has no agency in this scene, or this moment.  The mother owns the scene, the mother has &quot;won&quot; the scene</li>
<li>After the papers are signed, the camera rises, and the father moves back to the window and shuts it.  The closing of the window following the signing of the papers, suggests that these documents have actually ended the boy's blissful childhood, a major theme of the movie.</li>
<li>They are all standing now and move towards the window, and the mother actually opens in one last time.  The dialogue in the following closeup, with her action of opening the window reveals that she may not be as cold as we were previously lead to believe, that she does care about her son's well-being, and this is what she thinks is right for him.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's just one shot in the movie.  That's not even going into the overall structure of it and the depth of the narrative.  There's a lot going on in Citizen Kane, and it's acclaim is not unwarranted.  Roger Ebert did a commentary track for it, which is supposed to be fantastic.  That can explain in more detail why it's a near perfect movie. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the silents or early talkies, they are almost like theatrical plays. Static stage, camera, and lighting. The story is usually pretty linear, and told exclusively through dialogue (and maybe a bit of action)</p>
<p>In Citizen Kane, most of the locations are filmed through several different cameras, some at some fairly unusual angles. And a great deal of care is taken with the lighting. All this gives a much greater sense of the locations being actual places instead of a stage with the curtains hidden from view. It also was pretty innovative with the narrative frame - there are flashbacks, montages, and so on. Citizen Kane wasn't necessarily the first movie to use any one of these techniques, but it did so many of them, and executed them so well that it has come to be seen as kind of a master class in how to use the unique properties of cinema to create artwork that wouldn't be possible in any other medium. And the acting, dialogue, cinematography and all that is very well done.</p>
<p>It also probably acquired a certain amount of mystique because Orson Welles was such a young and unknown quantity in Hollywood when he made it, and then never really lived up to that early promise. It was also very controversial when it came out, because the incredibly powerful newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst (whom Kane was based on) tried to bury it during production. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides its innovations, the performances are amazing, and the guts the unknown Welles demonstrated to take on William Randolph Hearst at the time is testimony to the power of art itself.</p>
<p>The storytelling is so strong in certain scenes, also.  Check out the dialogue-free scene in which Kane and his first wife grow older through a montage of eating breakfast over the years.  She is shown reading his newspaper every day until the end when she picks up the rival paper, showing the rift that has grown between them.  </p>
<p>And the always phenomenal Joseph Cotton is the quintessential &quot;best supporting actor&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's really more popular with people in the movie industry. It doesn't normally top the list of general audiences.
It's partly revered because it's kind of a film making clinic. So many techniques used in the various aspects of cinema are used, and used very very well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
