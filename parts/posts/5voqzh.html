		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have selectively bred a small number of species to help provide better for human needs at the expense of the animals natural survival. Sheep are one of those species.</p>
<p>Prior to domestication sheep would have grown a much smaller amount of wool up to the point where it served their needs, like the hair on a bear or a wolf. It doesn't grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>Then humans came along and found these relatively docile sheep sitting around and someone realised their wool was very useful to make things like clothing out of. Over many generations humans captured and bred these sheep to harvest their wool from. Humans also realised that by breeding the males and females with the most and best wool, the offspring would usually end up with even more wool than the parents. By repeating this process over time we ended up with the types of sheep we have today, who are completely reliant on humans to regularly shear them and remove the wool. This is domestication and selective breeding. Without us they would suffer many problems like overheating and being far too heavy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Living on a farm that has a type of sheep that was never bred for wool production. Much like dogs sheep will have a different coat in summer and winter. They keep their top wool over summer for sun protection but they shed the side and stomach for heat reasons. Then in winter they will grow a thick coat all over.
Sheep grown for wool production have been specifically bred to be genetic mutants that never shed their wool. Thus they rely on people. Look up shrek the sheep. Was a New Zealand sheep that went for many years without being shawn and had one of the biggest wool coats ever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have suggested, the original &quot;wild&quot; sheep had shorter hair before selective breeding.</p>
<p>With that said... There is an island near where I live that has a wild population of wool sheep. They were left there by the Spanish when they first discovered the island with the hopes that by the time they came back there would be a big herd of sheep. The plan succeeded, but the Spanish never came back, so now the island has a bunch of wooly sheep.</p>
<p>They look <a href="https://cherylyoung.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/45.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a> and have long, nappy hair. As they run through the woods, bits of their dreds/hair get caught on branches and twigs and pull off in little tufts. The result is that their hair gets long, but never, like, crazy long.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Even long-haired sheep in the wild don't have that long of hair. It dreds up a bit, and is &quot;trimmed&quot; over time by getting pulled off by trees/branches that sheep run into.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Domestic sheep have been bred for thousands of years for maximum wool production, and are now dependent on humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sheep that that have excess wool are only one type of sheep  - the domesticated sheep. Other type of sheep don't grow wool beyond what they need to survive. As its name suggests, humans created this species by selective breeding, that is, mating males and females so that the result would be an animal <em>more beneficial to humans</em>. In the case of sheep that means more wool. It's worth noting that one of the requirements for domestication is that the resulting species be useful to humans.</p>
<p>So the answer is that domesticated sheep did not exist before humans because humans made them. They would not survive in nature for the most part. All this is true also for other domesticated species, like the cow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
