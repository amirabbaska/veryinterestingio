<p>Edit: Getting somewhat tired of the responses demonstrating an undergraduate level of understanding. No, I'm not looking for a general explanation involving the concentration of cells at the fovea, or a similarly general answer. </p>
<p>I am looking for researcher level responses. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an actual expert in visual perception, allow me to give the definitive answer to this question:</p>
<p><strong>We don't know.</strong></p>
<p>It's not as simple as resolution (as others have pointed out, you can see the individual dots peripherally if there's no masking grid), or adaptation (which is never as fast as 'instantaneous'). It's more likely related to some kind of competitive pattern-completion process that <em>doesn't</em> match the peripheral resolution, i.e. [crowding] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowding" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowding</a>). But that said, we just don't know the answer.</p>
<p><em>edit</em></p>
<p>Possible contributors to the mechanism of Hermann grid-type illusions like this one (some suggested in replies below):</p>
<p>1) powerful lateral inhibition (but White's illusion? also, what kind of lateral inhibition exactly, and where in the brain?)</p>
<p>2) feature mis-integration (but neural how? why are low-contrast lines integrated at cost of high-contrast spots?)</p>
<p>3) adaptation (but how so fast? if adaptation, why is there no oscillation or timescale like in motion-induced blindness or binocular rivalry)</p>
<p>4) filling-in (but how and what's so special about this type of display? how does pattern filling-in work anyways?)</p>
<p>5) crowding/inappropriate integration (but crowding doesn't usually cause blindness to features)</p>
<p>others?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Secondary question- I saw this first on my computer screen and couldn't see at the black dots at once when the image was about six inches square. Maybe two at a time. But when I looked at it on my cell phone screen I could see about four at once. Why would shrinking or possibly changing the angle of the image make a difference?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
