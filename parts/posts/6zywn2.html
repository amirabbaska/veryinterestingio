While Mars also has two moons, they are 10^6 and 10^7 times smaller than our own moon. Why doesn't Mars posses a similarly proportional sized moon?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While its true that most observations about axial tilt in our solar system are the product of planetary collisions, there are some that can't be adequately explained that way (Uranus). People have come up with other mechanisms that have been shown in simulations to cause axial miss-alignment over longer periods of time. Its been shown that the axial tilt of mars has changed dramatically in &quot;cosmically recent&quot; timescales. Its possible that mars's tilt is a product of gravitational influence rather than collision. This could also explain why mars has such an elliptical orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The obliquity of Mars's rotation axis appears to oscillate chaotically between close to zero and almost 60 degrees, over a timescale of a few million years. This is caused by the gravitational influence of other planets. Earth's moon actually stabilizes Earth's axial tilt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw once that a theory for the tilt is that Olympus mons and some of the other volcanoes displaced such a large mass from eruptions while the opposite side doesn't have that so once mass shifted the planet tilted to compensate for the change in center of mass. Obviously this would have taken millions/billions of years</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Last first: moon size is purely chance, no  intuition here. </p>
<p>First last: precession and nutation change much slower than our rotation or revolution around the sun. Impact with a large object could surely influence an axis, but is not the only factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
