		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Space itself is expanding. We know this because the light from distant galaxies is redshifted (stretched out), and the farther away they are the more redshifted they are. So while it is natural to think of the time since the Big Bang as a bunch of galaxies expanding out into empty space - in which case the universe would, as you say, be only 27.4 billion years across - the expansion of space <em>itself</em> means the galaxies have moved farther than that.</p>
<p>There are some problems with it, but the 'spots on a balloon' metaphor is pretty good... the galaxies are moving away from the Big Bang, but space itself is expanding too.</p>
<p>(This has some interesting repercussions. At some distance, the speed at which distant galaxies are moving away from us becomes faster than the speed of light, and we will never see those galaxies again... they will have become causally disconnected from us.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's space itself that expand. So the further two object are from each other, the faster they will go away from each other. </p>
<p>So let take two object. The earth and a galaxy. This galaxy is 10 billions years away from us. So in theory a photon will take 10 billions years to reach us. But in practice that's not the case. Space will continue to expand between us so the actual distance that photon will have to travel is actually bigger than the 10 billions years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers thus far have missed a critical element to the real answer to your question: space is <em>accelerating</em> in its expansion. The explanation /u/BennyPendentes gave is correct: space is expanding and has been since the Big Bang. However, the speed with which space has been expanding has not remained constant since the BB. About 2.5 billion years ago, the expansion started to accelerate. This acceleration was first measured accurately by the High Z Supernova Project in the mid 1990s (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe" target="_blank">wiki</a> for details) and was a complete surprise (that's why folks got Nobel Prizes for it).</p>
<p>This acceleration also affects the age of the universe, but in the opposite way. If we use Hubble's law (which assumes a constant expansion rate), then you get an age of the universe of about 14.5 billion years. Including the accelerated expansion, you get the 13.8 Gyrs that is usually quoted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...I found that if you use a value of around 1.4 for z (the redshift), you get the required distance of 4,200 megaparsecs. Therefore, any galaxy with a redshift greater than 1.4 is currently moving away from us faster than the speed of light.&quot;</p>
