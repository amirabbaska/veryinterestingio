Since signal intensity goes down as the covered area spread, how powerful are satellite signals to cover such a vast area?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GPS satellites are supposed to be about the power of a car headlamp - imagine a 50 watt bulb illuminating a hemisphere of the globe! The signal is incredibly weak, about 400 times weaker than background noise. In fact the signal is so weak that you can't pick up the GPS signal unless you know what the signal is.</p>
<p>The satellites used for TV are much much more powerful, around 10-20kW, and the signal is targeted at a much smaller area of the globe, for example Western Europe might have a dedicated satellite. Also at the receiving end you have a nice big dish to capture as much energy as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typical geostationary satellite transponders are about 60W spread over 36MHz of capacity. However, given that most are now carrying multiple signals (rather than one huge one), you need to have about 6dB back-off so that the signals don't interfere with each other. This leaves you with a useful transmit power of approximately 15W.</p>
<p>I used to design and build satellite networks for a living, and it's really quite astounding how good/low noise the electronics are. Just looking at one of my link budgets, the typical flux density for the link was -112dBW/m^2. That's about 6.3 picowatts per square meter.</p>
<p>The real magic is in the receivers. The LNBs (Low Noise Block upconverts) had about 60dB gain, and the modems will receive down to about -55dBm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is my understanding that the older C band satellites which required 10 foot diameter dishes were 2 Watts per channel while the newer 60 cm diameter dishes required 75 Watts per channel.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It is an interesting math exercise to determine how much power reaches a 60 cm diameter satellite dish considering that the area of the U.S. is about 3,000,000 square miles or 7,650,000 square kilometers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Satellite signals are relatively weak when they arrive since they are spread over a huge area, but the satellite is usually the only signal emitting thing in the direction that the satellite dish is pointing, so it can receive the signal relatively easily. Two way communication is much more difficult. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
