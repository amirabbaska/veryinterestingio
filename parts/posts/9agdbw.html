<p>For viruses that infect nerve cells (like shingles, which is the chicken pox virus) the pattern comes out in <a href="https://imgur.com/szLJC3g" target="_blank">dermatomes</a> or the pathway of the nerves that they infect.</p>
<p>For some infections, it depends on the point of contact of the infection or where the infection takes hold or where the pathogen migrates to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The blisters on my feet hurt so bad I could barely walk and the ones in my throat were so bad I could barely eat. Lasted about a week.
My feet are STILL peeling from it to this day and my sons (whom I got it from) fingernails almost peeled off, they are also just getting back to normal. Hfm is a bitch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
