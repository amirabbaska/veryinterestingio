		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually the harder or more rigid something is, the more sound it makes when it crashes against something. The vibrations have nowhere to go but out into the air, because the object itself is stiff and resists vibrating too much. Something soft like paper will bend easily and let energy pass through it no big deal. </p>
<p>Also weight is important too, because sound is energy, so more energy is vibrating out into the air as sound when something heavy is dropped on the floor as opposed to something light like a piece of paper. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would venture to guess that it has to do with the mass and resonant properties of the material. So you drop a disposable aluminum 13&quot;X9&quot; cake pan on polished cement. It has a large flat surface to resonate sound but it's made of a bendable material and has very little mass. When the pan hits the ground it isn't falling with much force because of the low mass and the bendable material slows down the vibrations that make sound. If you drop the same pan but made of steel, it is a less bendable, stronger material allowing more vibrations. It also has a higher mass meaning more force to vibrate. A Pyrex pan is often more massive than the steel thus hitting with even more force. Because Pyrex is a crystalline material, its it bends even less meaning less vibrations are absorbed by the material and more resonate into the air(but only if you hold your breath so it doesn't shatter). Kind of like the difference between a bass drum and a snare drum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
