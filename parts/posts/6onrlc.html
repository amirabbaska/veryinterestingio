		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone seems to be saying the same thing of &quot;oh actually they're good because we build cool stuff on top of them&quot;, but this seems a little disingenuous. It's not like the landfill <em>enabled</em> you to build that. Unless it strengthened the foundation that otherwise wouldn't have supported the structure. But landfills involve digging which involves dislodging soil that's had thousands of years to compact tightly together. It is not obvious that tearing all that up and then filling it with waste will make it stronger than before.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's only sustainable if the trash turns into soil faster than we're putting more in the earth. If they can be reused that helps a lot too. Not an expert on this but I don't know, it still seems like such an inelegant solution that just runs the risk of contaminating all kinds of processes. Brainpower spent devising workarounds and harm mitigation seems better spent exploring methods that don't make the planet filthy from the ground up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is far in the future, though, when electric cars are the majority, renewable energy sources and nuclear energy is used, and glass and renewable materials make up everything. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
