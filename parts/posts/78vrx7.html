		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generic drugs work the same as name-brand drugs. (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/GenericDrugs/ucm167991.htm" target="_blank">Source:</a> Food and Drug Administration.) This is a standard they have to meet to be approved for use. In particular, generics must: </p>
<ul>
<li>have the same active ingredient </li>
<li>have the same strength and administration method</li>
<li>have acceptable inactive ingredients</li>
<li>be manufactured under the same standards as the name-brand </li>
<li>provide the same clinical benefits </li>
</ul></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can think of exactly two.</p>
<p>Levothyroxine.  Name brand is Synthroid.  My mail order pharmacy simply refuses to fill generic L-thyroxine.  Dosing for this drug must be very precise, and Express Scripts simply doesn't think the available generics are precise enough.  Submit a generic script for L-thyroxine and they will fill it with Synthroid - at the generic price.</p>
<p>Similarly Creon, which is a biologic - pancrelipase.  There are generics but there have been potency issues with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They might have slightly different release mechanisms and fillers. I was prescribed venlafaxine for depression. I got a generic brand and it worked great. After a few months I got a different generic and everything just turned to shit. I felt sick constantly, my gut and joints ached and I felt miserable for like 4 weeks. I tried switching back to the first generic I had and everything went away after a few days.</p>
<p>I can't say for sure it was because of the brand change but it sure seems like it. Looked at the ingredients and the fillers were quite different. Most notably the &quot;bad&quot; brand had SLS (sodium laureth sulphate) in it, which is an inflammatory agent and an irritant. Maybe was related to that, maybe not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
