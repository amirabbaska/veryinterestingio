<p>Edit: Some have asked about the particular phone I'm using - I have a Droid Turbo. </p>
<p>Also, if this is still getting attention, I'd love to know more about why my 4G signal allows significantly faster browsing than when I'm using wifi. I have blazing fast wifi at the house but the phone absolutely drags when I use it. I don't want to think conspiracy, but Verizon DOES benefit financially from me choosing to use my data over my available wifi connections.</p></div></div>
