Someone had suggested that they just end up swimming too close to shore and get pulled in by the current or that it could also be due to ongoing marine studies, such as the use of sonar, dredging, etc.What are some of the current theories/studies trying to prove as to why this happens?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons. When it comes to mass stranding, there's a decent bit that's unknown.</p>
<p>Extremely infrequently beaching has been directly attributable to human activity. Namely, the use of high frequency sonar during military exercises causes a mass beaching in the Bahamas. The whales involved showed hemorrhaged ear drums, effectively making them incapable of echolocation; leading to the beaching.^<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2002/01/navy-admits-sonar-killed-whales" target="_blank">1</a> </p>
<p>Generally speaking, beaching occurs because of errors in echolocation. This can be because of injury or disease effecting their ability to navigate. The beaching whales are usually species that infrequently go within miles of the shore. So, they basically have to be extra careful being in that unfamiliar environment, and small errors can be catastrophic. The issue of fatigue comes in to play, too. Because the currents are rather different, and they're already hyper vigilant--sickness or general fatigue can cause them to beach because of currents. </p>
<p>In the case of mass beaching, the general idea there is that the leader of the pod becomes confused, exhausted or otherwise has some catastrophic issue that leads it to beach. Because the rest of the pod is in a vulnerable situation, they will follow the leader regardless of their own &quot;thoughts on the matter.&quot; And subsequently, beach en masse.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have answered your question regarding <em>why</em> whales might end up beached, but if you are actually asking <em>how</em>, then there is a little bit of physics and oceanography involved.</p>
<p>Large whales can't actually haul themselves completely out of the water. Some smaller cetaceans like orcas and dolphins can and do use partial beach strandings to catch prey like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christophe_Guinet/publication/230729878_Development_of_intentional_stranding_hunting_techniques_in_killer_whale_Orcinus_orca_calves_at_Crozet_Archipelago/links/02e7e5302437c754e6000000.pdf" target="_blank">seals</a> and <a href="http://www.aquaticmammalsjournal.org/share/AquaticMammalsIssueArchives/1995/AquaticMammals_21-03/21-03_Silber.pdf" target="_blank">mullet</a>, but they usually don't come completely out of the water and death has not been documented from hunting-related stranding (of which I am aware).</p>
<p>The largest whales that you are asking about &quot;strand&quot; by entering relatively shallow water, getting stuck, and then getting trapped when the tide recedes. They are absolute behemoths - the largest animals that have ever lived, and it's not even close. Whale of this size are utterly helpless out of the water, unlike a spry dolphin. All of the photos that you see of huge whales trapped on the beach on what appears to be dry land did not wriggle up there onto dry land the way that a nesting sea turtle does. They didn't leave the ocean - the ocean left them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don’t quote me on this but I remember a whale being beached in Scotland and hearing an official of some sort say that it was believed that sometimes they beach themselves intentionally when ill as to not prolong the suffering. </p>
<p>This was around 15 years ago though so maybe we’ve learnt a lot more since then.</p>
