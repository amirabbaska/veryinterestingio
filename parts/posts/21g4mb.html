		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a hierarchy, effectively.</p>
<p>Getting away from the 4 oz water scenario, let's just say that you're VERY dehydrated. To the point that your blood pressure is low. </p>
<p>Your body has various ways of maintaining perfusion to vital organs. When you're dehydrated, perfusion to certain organs (including the skin, general extremities) reduces, and essentially the body will maintain perfusion at whatever cost to three organs: the brain, heart, and kidneys. It does this through local hormonal control, as well as (for the brain) its generation of idiogenic osmoles. The kidneys in particular has its own system of autoregulation of blood flow (it'll fail if things are severe enough, though) that depends on hormones/other factors produced within the kidney itself and elsewhere; the brain also regulates the pressure in the skull cavity (intracranial pressure) for the same reasons (also so that it doesn't herniate, which is bad). Essentially maintaining perfusion means regulating local blood pressure by altering vessel size (so even though you may be told your &quot;blood pressure&quot; is 120, this is not the same). So even though (for instance) your intestines may be hurting for some liquid/oxygen/nutrition that blood has, these other organs get the lions' share because they are so critical. Because other organs suffer more, with severe enough dehydration or hypotension, we get negative effects like muscle damage/lactate build-up, liver damage, and intestinal barrier breakdown and sloughing.</p>
<p>So you drink 4 oz of water. A small amount, relatively speaking. It gets absorbed as others have stated, goes into the blood stream, where it makes a small difference in your osmolarity in the blood, and while perfusion everywhere improves slightly, your body will still favor what it needs to. But with severe enough dehydration, as previously stated, your intestines/etc actually don't get as good of blood flow. So drinking water may not be as efficient as it normally is. </p>
<p>Let's say instead you are dehydrated and go to the hospital. They'll give you fluids intravenously (but carefully, depending on how you became dehydrated, to avoid brain swelling), which is direct and bypasses the need of the intestines to work (or, as is sometimes done for animals in vet hospitals, subcutaneous fluids that require the skin have adequate circulation). The fluids (which are not pure water but an electrolyte solution) go into your bloodstream, temporarily directly improving your blood pressure and perfusion. If it's just electrolytes and small molecules in the solution, the fluid will get absorbed into your tissues pretty quickly. Which tissues it goes to first has the same priority as before correcting dehydration, but with enough of a fluid bolus you will be replenishing everything. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the body can actively distribute it, unless it tightens bloodvessels (like it does when you have hypothermia.  </p>
<p>Either way, water is distributed by osmosis. Osmosis works by trying to even the concentration of salts and other disolved substances (like proteins)  </p>
<p>Image you have a special balloon which only allows water to pass through its skin, nothing else. Now in that balloon you put a bit of very salty water. If you then put the balloon in a container with extremely pure water the water from the container will go in the balloon in an attempt to even the concentration of salt in and out of the balloon. Since the balloon only alllows water to pass through it'll absorb more and more water because there'll always be that bit of salt disolved in the water in the balloon while there's none outside. </p>
<p>Ofcourse the same works the other way around. Having the same balloon filled with extremely pure water and putting it in a very salty solution will drain all the water out, leaving the balloon practically empty.  </p>
<p>Your cells work in the same way but with one difference. Water can migrate in and out freely, but they can actively pump substances like salt, proteins etc in and out of the cell. That way they can prevent themselfs from exploding (from absorbing too much water), or dehydration.  </p>
<p>Now if you're very dehydrated and you drink that bit of water the cells that are 'hit by it' first will absorb a lot initially. However due osmosis most of the water will migrate out of the cells again, into the blood and will hydrate other cells a bit. The hydrating and dehydration will go on and on till all your cells (and blood) have the same concentration of salt and proteins again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only add this to what everyone else is saying; if you're severely dehydrated and you drink a lot of pure water very quickly (a liter in a few minutes or whatever) then your brain will swell up and kill you.</p>
<p>Your brain has fewer effective electrolytes then the rest of your blood and this electrolyte concentration is tightly regulated by the blood brain barrier. In a normally hydrated person this would cause water in your brain cells to leave and go out into your blood stream. (More electrolytes are forbidden from getting in.) </p>
<p>In severe dehydration the proper ratio is maintained despite a lack of water. So if you suddenly find a spring in the desert and drink it too fast then you will dilute your blood and your blood plasma will have a lower concentration of electrolytes then your brain. This will cause water to enter your brain cells too fast causing them to swell up and choke off their blood supply. (This is a type of cerebral edema called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_cerebral_edema#Osmotic" target="_blank">osmotic cerebral edema</a>.)</p>
<p>This is the only example of water &quot;going someplace&quot; in a severely dehydrated person that I could think of. Certainly though your body doesn't do this on purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ICU nurse here. Honestly if you are hypovolemic, 4 oz of water will do nothing.  2-7 litters might get your kidneys to start working again, but 4 oz will do nothing.  </p>
<p>Several days of walking in a very hot desert (death valley 3pm in the summer) will dehydrate you to the point of multisystem shutdown. Your kidneys which are the filters that produce urine will have shutdown. Other organs will follow.</p>
<p>However you will first undergo sun stroke(heat stroke) before this happens.  This can happen within a few hours and has very little to do with the amount of fluid circulating. Again 4 oz of water won't change much.</p>
<p>(edit) Sun stroke=Heat stroke</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) the water goes through your digestive tract and is absorbed by the large intestine into the blood stream. this blood goes back to the heart where it is pumped to the lungs (to pick up oxygen) and then back to the heart. after that it is sent to the rest of the body.</p>
<p>2) your body can increase and decrease the blood flow to different parts of the body by contracting and relaxing sphincter muscles around the blood vessels going to those organs. during dehydration your blood pressure would drop significantly and the body would restrict blood flow to your extremities to try to maintain blood pressure/oxygen flow to the core organs. physical exertions during dehydration will not only increase your body temperature but also increase the blood flow back to your limbs, away from your core, making things much worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
