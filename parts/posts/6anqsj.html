		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gauss-Bonnet identifies a fundamental connection between geometry and topology. And, perhaps more crucially, between local properties and global properties.</p>
<p>In a sort of naive sense, topology is about ignoring geometry (topology is much more subtle and complicated than this, but roll with me here). Given a topology, what about a space/surface/what-have-you stays the same given continuous transformations, i.e. stretching and pulling and twisting? The classic example is recognizing that a coffee cup and a donut are the same topological &quot;shape&quot;.</p>
<p>Geometry is generally much more concrete. You're measuring angles and curves and distances, the properties of an immutable object.</p>
<p>What the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem is saying is that the total curvature--defined as the integral of the Gaussian curvature--of a surface is directly proportional to its Euler characteristic, which is basically the number of &quot;holes&quot; it has in it. The first is a geometric property defined locally. The second is a topological property defined globally. This is a kinda ridiculous connection because you can do <em>crazy</em> things to a surface with continuous transformations. Completely change what it looks like. But because the Euler characteristic is constant, the Gauss Bonnet theorem says that the total curvature won't change.</p>
<p>Intuitively this really just means that, no matter how you do it, continuous changes to the curvature of a surface will be balanced out elsewhere on the surface, so that the total curvature remains unchanged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
