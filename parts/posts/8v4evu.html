		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, you want the highest output input into the amplifier. So, turn up your software first, then the hardware.</p>
<p>(Volume that’s turned “down” in software just results in a lower level output, so if that’s not loud enough and you start cranking up a preamp to compensate, you’ll get more noise.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Software volume control reduces the bit-depth of the signal sent to the DAC, thus reducing the amount of information used to describe the signal, and thereby potentially impacting things like dynamic range.</p>
<p>For the best quality audio, if possible, use a hardware volume control post-DAC.</p>
<p>To really hear the difference, you can try setting a minimal volume in software and cranking up the hardware control to a normal or loud listening volume. The difference will almost certainly be quite noticeable. </p>
<p>However, you can't really do this with nothing but a pair of headphones plugged into a PC or phone, you'll need an amplifier.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The right answer is already scattered throughout the other comments.</p>
<p>The path your audio takes until it reaches your headphone speaker starts from a digital signal and ends up in an analog signal. Depending on your setup somewhere along the path there's a conversion from digital to analog (using a DA converter).</p>
<p>Starting from within the DA converter the analog part of the path always has noise/hiss (as expressed with signal to noise ratio). So you want the input signal to be as loud as possible so that the noise becomes relatively inaudible. But not too loud as to distort the signal (signal clipping).</p>
<p>The digital part of the path has no noise. But lowering the volume will sacrifice the detail of the signal. The signal isn't using the full range of the bit depth. You can compare this with photo editing. If you make an image dark (and save it as jpg) you cannot fully restore back the original quality by simply making it brighter again.</p>
<p>So best to lower the volume somewhere in the analog path. And best do it at the specific component that has the worst signal to noise ratio. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is all about improving SNR (signal to noise ratio). Even though the PC/program volume controls are digital, the rule that applies to analog also applies here: crank up the intermediary volume controls and use the last one to set most comfortable volume. Though it's probably going to be much less noticable, unless your intermediary volume is very low to begin with. </p>
<p>The reason for this is due to how the digital audio signal is encoded. It's pretty much a stream of dozens of thousands of 16 bit integers designated for samples per second. When you digitally reduce the volume, your software or hardware pretty much multiplies these integers by some real number between 0 and 1 to get other numbers that also have to be encoded as 16 bit integers. Since doing this mathematically rarely yields other integers, your system has to round them up or down, thus distorting the signal. This effect is negligible when your volume is high enough, but make it low enough, and you will start hearing the distortion. The more volume controls you have, the more your digital signal is going to get distorted</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
