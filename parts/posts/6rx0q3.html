		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: So I asked this question last night on a whim, because I was curious, and I woke up to an astounding number of notifications, and an extra 5000 karma @_<strong><strong>__</strong></strong>@</p>
<p>I've tried to go through and read as many responses as I can, because holy shit this is so damn interesting, but I'm sure I'll miss a few.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thank you</em></strong> to everyone who has come here with something to explain, ask, add, or correct. I feel like I've learned a lot about something I've always loved, but had trouble understanding because, hell, I ain't no physicist :)</p>
<p>Edit 2: To elaborate. Many are saying things like time is a constant and cannot slow, and while that might be true, for the layman, the question being truly asked is how does gravity have an affect on how time is perceived, and of course, all the shenanigans that come with such phenomena.</p>
<p>I would also like to say, as much as I, and others, appreciate the answers and discussion happening, keep in mind that the goal is to explain a concept simply, however possible, right? Getting into semantics about what kind of relativity something falls under, while interesting and even auxiliary, is somewhat superfluous in trying to grasp the simpler details. Of course, input is appreciated, but don't go too far out of your own way if you don't need to!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speed is equal to distance over time.</p>
<p>Gravity increases the distance light travels as it curves space.</p>
<p>The speed of light is constant no matter where you are and no matter how fast you're going.</p>
<p>So, if the speed of light is fixed and the distance increases due to gravity then time has to slow to make sure the equation still balances.</p>
<p>The more gravity there is the more space is curved and the slower time moves.</p>
<p>Edit - thank you very much to u/Undead_Kau, u/GamerKingFaiz and an anonymous user for the gold, it's very much appreciated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well that right there is the heart of Einstein's most famous contribution to science; his theory of relativity. It's a beautiful one, really, because it unifies three things that always had been a bit of a tricky subject to wrap your head around: <em> Space, Time, and Gravity</em> .</p>
<p>You might have heard the pair &quot;space-time&quot; thrown around, and if that confuses you, you have Einstein to blame. In his theoretical views, time and space are intimately intertwined, both acting as two ways to describe the landscape in which all of matter and energy takes place. Gravity is basically what this landscape looks like!</p>
<p>As for why time slows down, is difficult to explain without going into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation" target="_blank">detailed mathematics</a>. If you do take a shot at the formulas, my suggested take away from it is that <em>light speed</em> here is the culprit for this funny phenomenon. Whilst space and time turn out to be variable, curving and twisting depending on the conditions, <em>light speed</em> always needs to be the same. Speed relative to what though? Relative to someone chilling at the surface of the sun, or relative to us looking from a distance? If you think about it, these two scenarios <em>must</em> be different. Perhaps you could say it's all a consequence of time and space having to accomodate to the stubborn speed of light, and impracticallly large celestial bodies messing up the environment.</p>
<p>Finally I just need to repeat how silly and strange the concept of time and space is. Time doesn't slow down for <em>you</em> if you'd be the one dancing close to a Black Hole's embrace, you'd just be surprised to see everyone so much older if you get back to Earth. In other words, it's not that time slows down to be honest, it's that apparently time itself is relative to the space-time landscape you're in. There is no absolute clock, but we can however, compare how fast our clocks are running <em>relative to each other</em>. That's why Einstein called it the theory of relativity ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, this creates somewhat of a paradox for humans pursuing long distance space travel. Should we ever obtain the ability to travel long distances in space, we are likely to encounter future humans in far away places who have already made it to our destination. In other words, say we leave earth on a 50 year trip to a distant solar system at 50% the speed of light. In that time, 1000 years may have passed on earth and we may have developed the technology to travel at 99% of light speed. By the time the first space travelers get there, they could encounter humans from their own future. My numbers are completely arbitrary and I have no idea of the true math.</p>
<p>Edit: I guess this has less to do with gravity and is more purely dependent on speed but, interesting ntl.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://imgur.com/0fHi0WR.gif" target="_blank">Here is an animation showing how this works.</a></p>
<p>Since the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, and space-time is warped under the influence of gravity, we find that the distorted space-time increases the distance a particle of light travels, effectively slowing time.</p>
<p>In this animation, the red line is the path of the beam of light as if there were no gravitational influence, and shown in blue is the light traveling through the warped gravitational field at the same speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's more to this though isn't there?  In relativity, speed matters as well, not just gravity.  The faster you travel, the more time dilation you experience, and the bigger the effect on the Twin Paradox.  Einstein clearly described an effect where mass increases with speed, etc...  It's not just distance or gravity that are factors here, right?  Or am I seriously misunderstanding something basic here?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
