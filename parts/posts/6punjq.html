		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the question was &quot;Does it gulp a lot of water into it's stomach along with the food and does the water stay there or does it somehow get pushed out. And the reason this is an interesting question would be, does gulping large quantities of water mean that the shark is always ingesting way more water than food? And does that affect how it has to eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yup. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, crocodiles have a false palate to avoid too much water in, but they still swallow amounts of water (they don't wait for the food or even their mouth to drain before swallowing). Think of when you eat meat in broth or soup. As for sharks and if they would ask if humans eat air, it's actually true. We ingest air which is why we burp, especially when eating fast (it's not all stomach gases like cows and methane). Moms have to make babies burp because they ingest air, and if people want to force a burp, you need to swallow air.</p>
<p>In fact we also get water from food. It depends on the food content because some food needs water to be digested, but there are some desert rodents that get all their water from the food they eat (seeds, insects etc). The point is that food and water consumption are not separate. <del>There</del> The body doesn't go into &quot;food mode&quot; then &quot;water mode&quot;, but our digestive systems separate them.</p>
<p>Edit1: There/The</p>
<p>Edit2: To clarify about 'water burps', that was to explain the comments about 'eating air' in humans. Adding much more detail, trying to keep it Eli5:</p>
<p>Crocodiles, as humans, could get water into their lungs when eating. Humans avoid this when swallowing, when our tongue and other muscles close the way to the thrachea (airway) while letting food and water into the oesophagus (let's say 'foodway'), but we can still breathe while chewing. Crocodiles, as OP asked, need to bite underwater which would mean water getting into their lungs. That's why they have the palatal valve, like a trapdoor, but it actually closes both airway and foodway. This helps while biting (they don't chew, they break off chunks small enough to swallow), but they need to get out of the water to open the palatal valve and swallow. Bonus fact, they have a special tube from the nostrils to the airway, letting them breathe even with the palatal valve closed, like a snorkel. They can close their nostrils when swimming.</p>
<p>Sharks of course don't breathe air, and they don't have lungs. They get oxygen by getting water though their mouth  (and spiracle, a hole behind the eyes) and filtering the oxygen then throwing water out through the gills. They actually need water getting into their mouth to survive and many species need to move to help this. When they eat they just take water in as usual, and some goes to their stomach, becoming part of what they digest and then expel. Like others said, <a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/water-h2o-life/life-in-water/surviving-in-salt-water/" target="_blank">urea in sharks keeps water concentration in their body balances with the sea water so they don't need to 'drink' as other fish do</a>. If we keep talking about water burps then these would be when they expel water through their gills, although sharks can vomit and even turn their stomach inside out to clear it (you can search shark stomach eversion).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Once an alligator captures something, it will hold it in its mouth and drag it underwater to drown it. It must then get back above water to swallow it -- otherwise, the alligator's stomach and lungs would fill with water. Using its incredibly powerful jaws (which are able to exert up to 2,000 PSI), an alligator will break bones or crush shells (in the case of turtles) to create a chunk of flesh that can fit down its throat. Then it will raise its head, open the palatal valve and swallow the piece whole. An alligator can digest anything it swallows -- muscle, bone, cartilage, etc. are all digested completely.&quot;</p>
<p>So just like mammals can't inhale a bunch of water without drowning, neither can gators. They keep they're throat closed while underwater and come up to swallow their prey without getting a mouthful of water. As far as Sharks and predatory fish, I'm assuming they swallow water all the time.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="http://animals.howstuffworks.com/reptiles/alligator3.htm" target="_blank">link</a>  where I found this info if you would like to read more about gators! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sharks differ from bony fish in the way they handle saltwater.  Most fish have to drink large amounts of water to make up for what they lose to the salinity of the ocean.  Bony fish drink a lot and their kidneys are powerhouses that remove the excess salt.  </p>
<p>Sharks instead generate a lot of urea throughout their body which counterbalances the salt in the ocean water.  The urea (and other chemicals) make their tissues nearly as salty as the ocean.  They also excrete salt using a gland in their rectum - a similar gland appears in birds and some reptiles around their eyes, nostril or mouth.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
