On Chrome the &quot;There is no Internet Connection&quot; page has the option to run Windows network diagnostics. Clicking on the option takes you to a loading screen where it says it's checking and troubleshooting all sorts of things, and it's final conclusion is to find the Wi-Fi router and turn it off and on again. This is like a bad joke from the IT Crowd! </p>
<p>What is my computer doing when it says it's troubleshooting things? Is that just a button to press to make users think their computer is an omniscient being with the illusion of control? Does it ever actually, after going through all those loading screens that say &quot;detecting problems&quot;, detect a problem and then solve it? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Network failures are a central cause of grief not only in our daily lives, but also large fields of study, like distributed systems. Because of their impact, they are a very well studied area.</p>
<p>Operating system suppliers have a unique position: being able to gather large amounts of data about what causes network failures in un- or semi-managed small scale networks. These are compiled into checklists, such as this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd163567.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank">MSDN</a> page describing common failure scenarios. Some of these failures can be <a href="http://faculty.education.illinois.edu/j-levin/Network-Problem-Solving/" target="_blank">approached</a> in an automated manner.</p>
<p>An automated troubleshooting system may try diagnosing some of those problems, even though false negatives aren't out of the question. Suggestions like resetting your wireless AP work because it is simpler and more feasible to try to bring a computer in a &quot;known-good&quot; state rather than trying to pinpoint the exact failure state and history that got it there <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4" target="_blank">in the first place</a> (Prof. Armstrong elucidates this problems extremely cleanly at around 15:45, but I suggest you watch the entire 15 minutes before it for a good background).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your operating system, but those troubleshooters <em>do</em> actually do things.  They just don't tell you what they're doing because they average user doesn't know what the laundry list of console commands going on in the background mean, and they don't seem like they ever fix anything because more often than not, a networking problem isn't something that can be fixed by a few console commands on the end user's workstation.</p>
<p>The windows &quot;troubleshoot&quot; basically does some ping tests to the default gateway, does a /flushdns and a /registerdns, refreshes DHCP (if enabled), and disables/re-enables the network adapter.</p>
<p>If your issue is related to one of those things then it actually does a pretty solid job of fixing them.  The problem is 99.9999999999999% of network problems... aren't those :p</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a time when trouble shooting would fix my connectivity problems every time and happened maybe once a month at its peak. After, it would tell me no problems were found and I could resume interneting. I'm a software engineer, and although I've never worked on an OS, I'm all too familiar with various services that get stuck in some sort of not working but not overtly failed state. The trouble shooter, I imagine, goes through the various networking services that are running and sends them a payload that basically reports if it's alive or not. if not, restart it. Like /u/mfukar said, they have a wealth of data re: networking failures, so the methods for fixing individual services, as well as deducing the most probable explanation, have probably gotten more sophisticated and can sort themselves during runtime in some cases. The troubleshooter might also be a place to store temporary, hacky fixes until the root issue can be addressed. These are educated guesses based on my experience building RESTful APIs, which differs greatly from building an OS, but the methods built in to report the health of a given service tend to be iterated upon in weird ways as the result of encountering edge cases that induce partial failures that circumvent self-restarts and the like. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In fairness to the computer, one of the reasons those tests take time is because the computer has to wait for the other end to fail to respond. You have to give the other end a few seconds, because in some special circumstances it may take that long for a <em>working</em> system to respond. A diagnostic that tells you your network <em>isn't</em> working when it <em>is</em>, it's just slow, is even more of a pain than the <em>IT Crowd</em> joke you get now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have used the wifi troubleshooting tool in windows 7 number pus times, and it has actually fixed issues for me quickly. It goes through a number of steps, including checking DNS settings, disabling and re-enabling the Wi-Fi antenna, and various other troubleshooting steps that you could do, but can, but does them quicker. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
