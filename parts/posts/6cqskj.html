		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two factors I think are worth mentionig.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Roche Limit describes the distance from a celestial body at which a satellite will be torn apart by tidal forces. It's approximate and depends somewhat on composition, but it is very roughly 2.5 radii of the main body. <a href="http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/roche_limit.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
</li>
<li>The sphere of influence is the distance at which, in this case, the moon's gravity is less of a factor on an object than the earth's gravity. Any further from the moon than this and the object would no longer orbit the moon, but rather orbit Earth. Our moon's SOI is about 38 lunar radii <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence_(astrodynamics)" target="_blank">source</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So a satellite of the moon needs to orbit at a distance greater than 2.5 lunar radii but less than 38. Closer and it would break up, further and it would drift away. Of course, as others have said, a subsatellite would not stay in this zone, as it's an unstable orbit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure. There are plenty of artificial satellites orbiting our moon. The problem is that these orbits are not stable long-term because of perturbations from the main planet. You won't find a a moon of a moon in nature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in theory, moons can have moons. The region of space around a satellite where a sub-satellite can exist is called the Hill sphere. Outside the Hill sphere, a sub-satellite would be lost from its orbit about the satellite. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For whatever it's worth in the context of this question, there are hundreds of asteroids in our solar system with one <em>or more</em> smaller asteroids in orbit around them.  </p>
<p>One such system, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/asteroid-that-flew-past-earth-today-has-moon" target="_blank">2004 BL86</a>, was discovered to be binary when the pair buzzed by the Earth in 2015.</p>
<p>More than a dozen are known to have 2 moonlets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a sense this type of fractal orbiting is already happening just on a larger scale. The moon revolves around the earth, the earth around the sun, the sun around the center of the Milky Way. It's not necessarily moons going around moons going around moons, but the concept is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
