		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible and quite common for a molecule to be designed for a specific purpose, many modern medicines aren't discovered by accident.</p>
<p>For example a drug can be created to specifically bind to a certain receptor and agonise/antagonise it. Since they already know it will bind to a specific site, the trials will consist of establishing its safety, dose and side effects.</p>
<p>Edit: Have a look into rational drug design for more info (not to be confused with designer drugs). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For your second question, that is how a lot of drugs are developed. There was actually a time when scientists were quite fond exposing insects to random chemicals at high concentrations and looking for evidence of neurotoxicity, such as rapid paralysis.</p>
<p>The most toxic discoveries would then be fed or injected into mice or other lab animals to figure out what the toxic dose was, and how much an animal could consume indefinitely with no obvious side effects. These safe doses would then be given to people just to see what happened.</p>
<p>(Side note, this is how the avermectin family of insecticides and anti-parasitic drugs was developed: It was one of the most potent insect neurotoxins ever discovered, but it baffled scientists in that mammals could survive absurd amounts of it, and humans reported feeling absolutely nothing after taking it. This is what makes it such an incredibly safe drug and pesticide - it utterly destroys insects and worms, but it has almost no effect on humans!)</p>
<p>But ah, to give some examples, methylphenidate was just sort of randomly synthesized and then people took it to see what would happen. Many drugs were used for some other purpose, and patients reported feeling less depressed: Iproniazid was originally intended as a treatment for tuberculosis, diphenhydramine and chlorpromazine were meant for treating allergies, and a variety of beta blockers were meant for heart disease.</p>
<p>This is not how most antidepressants are invented, however. Each time a new antidepressant was discovered either through ethically dubious experimentation or an accidental finding while treating something else, such a discovery sets off a flurry of new invention. Researchers study the new drug and how it works, and then start designing countless variations to see if they are even better.</p>
<p>The drugs I mentioned above, each was the founder of an entire class of antidepressants, most of which were deliberately invented.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're on the right track: It took some happy accidents. Before the word &quot;antidepressant&quot; had ever been said, people had realized that opioids, stimulants, and thyroid hormones could rapidly lift mood. Unfortunately, all of them came with pretty serious issues. (Also, electroconvulsive therapy was and is incredibly effective, but that's another story.) Then, in the early 1950s, two things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first drug called an &quot;antidepressant&quot; was actually isoniazid, an antibiotic that's still part of standard tuberculosis treatment, as it had energizing effects. (Tuberculosis treatment must be taken daily for many months, so there was plenty of time to notice it.) Then, the closely-related compound iproniazid (also being researched for tuberculosis) was found to dramatically boost mood in some patients. It was the first monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI.)</p>
</li>
<li>Chlorpromazine (Thorazine), which was the first antipsychotic, was found by accident while tinkering with antihistamines. Its close relatives like promethazine (Phenergan) were pretty sedating and effective for nausea or allergies, but chlorpromazine went beyond sedation in schizophrenic patients, decreasing hallucinations and delusions. This was pretty big news, and people were soon trying any variation on chlorpromazine they could find on patients with psychosis and mania. One similar drug, imipramine, made manic patient even more manic, so they tried it on the depressed patients for a while. It turned out to be the first tricyclic antidepressant (TCA.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It became clear that most of the drugs with these effects were acting on the same three neurotransmitters to various extents: Norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. MAOIs stopped all three from being broken down, while TCAs stopped serotonin and norepinephrine from being pulled back out of the synapse. This led to the idea that major depression represented a lack of one or more of these neurotransmitters. While later research has given us a much more complicated picture, it remains true that drugs with similar actions tend to beat sugar pills in major depression. Pharmaceutical companies love a safe bet, so all of the FDA-approved antidepressants since have acted on those three targets. (This may change with the increasing evidence for drugs like ketamine, which work entirely differently, but that's yet another story.) With modern research techniques, it's easy to test huge numbers of compounds to see which ones would probably act on the targets we want; this is how the SSRIs were developed.</p>
<p>As an aside, how do we know that antidepressants take time to work? If we look at randomized controlled trials, the placebo group and the antidepressant group both get a lot better over time. After four to six weeks, the antidepressant group has usually pulled ahead by an amount that we'd call clinically significant, though that's kind of a judgment call. It's hard to chalk up any one person's improvement to any particular factor; mostly, we just need to try a drug for a certain amount of time before calling it a failure.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: One was supposed to be an antibiotic, they had a good hunch about the other, and the rest are just copycats.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost all anti-depressant drugs these days are based from existing research - that is to say that they are more likely to be a tweak to an existing anti-depressant than something completely new.</p>
<p>The first stage is that with an understanding of the mechanism that you are looking to activate, someone with a degree in chemistry will look to design a new molecule. For example if you are looking to keep dopamine in a synanptic cleft for longer you might wish to try and deactivate the chemical that oxidises (and therefore removes) it. So you would develop a mono amine oxidase inhibitor - a molecule that will preferentially bind to mono amine oxidase and then deactivate it (usually by changing its shape).</p>
<p>This will then get checked by a medical expert who will assess whether the molecule itself is likely to kill you instantly. If that's all good then it is on to clinical trials using a model. This is where the neuroscientists take over.</p>
<p>Typically the first model will be a mouse or rat. There are various methods, but typically the first stage is to make the mouse depressed. This is quite hard (at least in the UK) as animal welfare is important and so there are laws to ensure that whilst you can depress the animal you are not torturing it.</p>
<p>After the animals are suitably depressed then they will be given the drug at various doses and their behaviour will be monitored (as well as other physiological stats). It's pretty much impossible to 'just notice' that their mood has improved, you need to run them through tests. Typically you are looking for better response times to stimuli.</p>
<p>Once you are done with your trial then the animal will be killed. For a mouse or rat this is typically done with blunt force trauma to the back of the skull. You cannot use chemicals as the next stage is to dissect the model and conduct tests upon the brain (such as neurotransmitter levels present), and the rest of the body for side effects (enlarged kidneys for example). Additionally if something went wrong, such as the animal dying, this needs testing to find out why.</p>
<p>This forms a feedback cycle to the chemists to come up with new molecules to try. From then on it's basically informed trial and error until something comes along that has promise and isn't looking like it will kill anything. It then passes through stages of clinical trials (once approval is granted) and eventually on to testing in humans.</p>
