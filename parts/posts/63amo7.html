		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A whole lot of bad info here.</p>
<p>Short version:  So Congresspeople can get reelected by their constituents.</p>
<p>Longer version:  The military-industrial complex employs a <em>lot</em> of people (citation needed).  Those numbers don't include just those in uniform, or even the civilians who took over the outsourced jobs that used to be rotational duty for service members (mainly in personnel and admin, but also maintenance contractors and subject matter experts).</p>
<p>It also includes those people who <em>make</em> all the equipment the military uses, both on a daily basis as well as for wartime use.  The cuts that the Pentagon proposes would severely impact the plants that manufacture those products.  It came up in the news <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/9/lawmakers-force-pentagon-to-buy-tanks-keep-ships-a/" target="_blank">in</a> <a href="http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/12/18/congress-again-buys-abrams-tanks-the-army-doesnt-want.html" target="_blank">recent</a> <a href="http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/01/28/pentagon-tells-congress-to-stop-buying-equipment-it-doesnt-need.html" target="_blank">years</a> after sequestration became a thing.</p>
<p>There is, technically, a reason to keep some of those plants running besides local economy.  The going theory is that if you ever get rid of, say, the Abrams tank plant, and a war happens, it's going to end up costing more to spool the plant back up, retool all the machinery, and re-teach brand new employees how to make the tank...which will add time and cost to producing the end product, and/ or may mean the first generation or two of new tanks may not be up to par.</p>
<p>This isn't that unreasonable a concept.  On a particular weapons system I worked on, the company stopped producing part of the control system.  A high-end, high fail-rate <em>must have</em> part simply did not exist, except for the same part that was being installed on newer versions of the same ship.  We resorted to stealing the parts from the ships being built, and then when those ended up dying through normal wear-and-tear, we were given two options.</p>
<p>A) Wait 30 months for a brand new part.  This included the time to restart the manufacturing, including training all new workers and remaking the machinery to make the part.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>B) Wait 9 months for the part to be refurbished.</p>
<p>Note that Option C (all of the above) was not listed as a possibility.  I know.  I asked.</p>
<p>Now, that's anecdotal, and certainly doesn't address the fact that thousands of extra tanks exist when they shouldn't, but it's not entirely a bullshit excuse either.</p>
<p>All that said, the bottom line really comes back to local jobs.  Voters reward those who bring jobs to or keep jobs in the area.  It's why the subject of BRACs is such a hot-button issue whenever it comes up, and why Congresspeople will fight tooth and nail to keep the plant in <em>their</em> district open, while not giving two fucks if the next district over loses theirs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit:  To answer more as to why the military would tell Congress point blank why they don't need as much money, sometimes it's not the <em>amount</em> of money so much as it is <em>how</em> that money's being spent.  There's whole herds of senior officers and bean counters, some pretty smart fucking people, who know roughly how much money is available for the military's use, and money's just another resource.  Same as beans, bullets, and bandages.  They have their own needs and wants, and know that if you get rid of money from Column A (outdated tanks or ships that need to be retired), you can then spend that money on Column B (R&amp;D on new weapons or armor, new ships, or maybe even more service members).</p>
<p>There's a very real frustration in that, in the military's eyes, they're being hamstrung over the long term for the benefit of those who hold their budget in their hands, and it's a bipartisan problem.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit 2:  There's a few questions involving the overall expenditure of money to the DoD as well as our global force.  We do spend a LOT of money on our DoD, true.  However, if you look at our spending on our military vs. our GDP (basically, how much of our budget as a percentage goes to military), we're actually in a pretty good spot.  <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?year_high_desc=true" target="_blank">As of 2015</a>, we were 20th in military spending vs. GDP, at 3.3%.  That's behind Russia's 5%, Israel's 5.4%, and Saudi Arabia's 13.5%.  </p>
<p>For spending 3.3% of our GDP on military, what do we get?  </p>
<p>A) Jobs.  These are actually pretty needed, in a very general sense.  There's much to be said for shifting those jobs to higher priorities, but the fact of the matter is that at a local level, if that happens, there are going to be people that lose their jobs, <em>even if</em> other people gain jobs.  I'm not stating this to defend it, just to put the info out there.  This is primarily what your average Congressperson is concerned with, because guess what?  It's what their constituents are concerned with.  Which, in the military's eyes, is actually a win.  Wait, why is this?  </p>
<p>Because when was the last time the entire nation banded together and really was a truly unified country?  When it faced a threat that had hit home soil, and had showed some capacity of bringing the fight here to our shores.  </p>
<p>As soon as Pearl Harbor happened, the patriotic instinct of &quot;we must protect this house!&quot; came into full bloom, and the entire nation bent its will towards doing everything in its power to make sure that no invasion of the US happened, by ensuring its enemies were destroyed far from its shores.  Which leads to...</p>
<p>B) Defense in Depth.  This is really what we're buying with our money.  The people who volunteer to serve, the equipment they train in and on, the tools to take the fight to the enemy, the massive support structure back at home, all of that exists for one purpose:  To keep the fight as far away from us as possible.</p>
<p>I'm going to go Navy on this for just a moment, because hey, that's what I know, but other forces also have similar strategies.</p>
<p>If you're an aircraft carrier, you have multiple layers of defense.  It's not just the force that the ship itself provides, because while that's good, it's just not enough, and there's holes.  Threats exist to which the carrier is not readily equipped, <em>on its own</em>, to deal with very well.  Subs can fire torpedoes.  ASCM (anti-ship cruise missiles) can be launched.  Swarms of attack craft can come on out and blow themselves up next to the ship.  The list goes on.</p>
<p>So what does a carrier do, accept those risks?  Oh hell no.  Instead, what they do is take a whole flotilla of ships with it.  Destroyers and cruisers keep an eye out above and below the surface of the water, ensuring that at the very least, any possible threat is identified and assessed, if not engaged.  A lone friendly sub may also be somewhere out there, likewise protecting the carrier as well as everyone else.  The carrier itself launches Combat Air Patrol to ensure that other nations' helos and fixed wing aircraft are warded off and engaged far away from the ship.</p>
<p>If, <em>somehow</em>, a threat worked its way through all of that to attack the carrier itself, the ship still has its own limited ability to fight it off.  Two different kinds of self-defense missiles as well as an extremely beefed up gatling gun protect the ship from any missiles, and can even be used against both air and surface targets.  Small arms crews can employ crew-served weapons against small craft.</p>
<p>Bottom line, to take out a carrier, you're going to have to be both lucky <em>and</em> good, and come in with a fairly sizeable force.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Note that this is simply one hypothetical, and is vastly simplified.  This is, after all, ELI5.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of that is just to say that the same concept is applied to our nation.  Envision the US as our carrier.  Sure, we have lots of guns at home, and a Coast Guard, but the further away our forces can meet the enemy and force a conflict elsewhere, the better our chances of never seeing an engagement on our own shores is.</p>
<p>Diplomacy and international aid are kind of like our long-range radars, in a way.  We can use those to detect the possible threat and veer ourselves (or the other country, really), out of our line of sight.  But should that fail, and it does for a wide variety of reasons, we have our own military to ensure that potential conflicts stay far away from us.</p>
<p>No other nation in the world projects force like we do, in part because most nations are far more concerned with their own backyard.  Even the old USSR at the height of the Cold War never really gave much of a shit about our land or resources, they just wanted to stop us from meddling in their plans for Asia and Europe.  China?  Wants to dominate SE Asia.  Hell, the Middle East?  Just wants us (and everyone else, really) to leave them alone, except to buy oil.</p>
<p>And this is why the very fact that Congresspeople are more concerned with jobs at the local level than with our ability to fight wars overseas is a win...because it <em>is</em> a comparison between those two, and not local jobs vs. an ability and a <em>need</em> to fight those same wars at home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is in the same vein as politician speak on crime/drugs. Even if we have law enforcement, criminologists, data scientists telling us year after year that the war on drugs has failed and is doing more harm than good, politicians will always run on a tough on crime, tough on drugs policy because the average voter won't be reading research papers on the drug war. Instead they are more susceptible to populist rhetoric about crime and drugs ruining their neighborhood. So as a result, regardless of party affiliation, if the politician is from a large, national party they will be &quot;tough&quot; on drugs and crime because otherwise, it allows their opponent a free means to accuse them of having a weak stance on the law and protecting your streets and families.</p>
<p>This applies to military spending. The average person for the most part is against war but they are not against the military/it's soldiers. If a politician takes an active stance of cutting military spending especially in a period of uncertainty, that politician leaves him/herself open for a free attack on being against the troops and against national security regardless of whether the attacking politician wants to start a war or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I served nearly 10 years in the military, Active Duty starting in 2006. I also was the equipment manager for four separate equipment accounts worth millions of dollars each. That means I ordered stuff, repaired stuff, or sent stuff to be repaired at the proper station, as well as kept accountability on all pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>Let me try to answer your question: Does the military need more money for new/better equipment?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes. The stuff we have is old and crappy. Not all of it, and different bases with different missions might have some pretty badass stuff - but my base didn't. Our stuff was 40+ years old a lot of time, and probably cost more to repair every year than it would to just buy a modern one (but it's hard to buy $50,000 pieces of equipment routinely, usually a squadron can only afford ordering a few things a year - spread over hundreds and hundreds of pieces of equipment).</p>
</li>
<li>We need less than you may think. Why? Because TONS of money is thrown away/wasted every year. I'm not going to say too much, but due to an inspection that was coming up I was given a (unlawful) order to literally throw away about a hundred thousand dollars worth of equipment that was found by a member of my unit in a storage bin which was undocumented and ordered by someone who left the base years and years ago (this was overseas, so people in and out all the time). The individual who told me to do this was a Master Sergeant and I was a Staff Sergeant. I'm not gonna say what happened, but I will say that we did well on the inspection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pretty stupid if you ask me but it's also something that happens a lot. </p>
<p>There are a lot of issues with our military, but it would take a lot of great men to fix them, and that's just a resource that we no longer have much of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't there some helicopter or ship a few years ago that the US military begged Congress not to fund? It didn't work; was expensive to maintain; and nobody felt it was needed. But Congress went ahead and funded it with billions of dollars (that's a 'b') so they could keep people employed making it. Honestly, it would make more sense to just give everyone a few years' salary and shut down the project.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
