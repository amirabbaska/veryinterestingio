		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have dark brown hair but a red beard, after a haircut yesterday I actually looked this up out of curiosity.</p>
<p>I'm no professional but from what I gathered this can happen because there is no single gene that determines our hair color or whether we have straight or curly hair. There are a number of genes that affect our hair and sometimes they can be expressed in different ways.</p>
<p>So in my case brown hair is a dominant trait that is expressed everywhere on my head except my beard. The red in my beard comes from someone in my family with the gene for red hair, and that trait just happened to be expressed in my beard.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The levels of pigmentation, or color building blocks, in your hair follicles ultimately determine your hair color. Each follicle contains a mixture of eumelanin (black or brown) or pheomelanin (red and yellow) pigments. Guys with low levels of brown eumelanin and high levels of yellow pheomelanin, you end up with blonde hair. Think of it as paint. Different ratios, create different colors. Different combinations in each follicle yield different hair colors, which explains those random red hairs and dark patches. Besides natural pigment, stress and malnutrition can change your hair color. But the biggest culprit of changing hair color, however, is the sun. It works the opposite of skin. Instead of creating more melanin, it actually destroys it. Now why is each follicle different? Well the question says why. They just are. They are each unique. That's why you may have patches, some follicles tact to testosterone different tly. So that's why you have different colors, cause each follicle is unique with pigments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't just one gene controlling hair color. There are multiple. Same for skin, eyes and many other physical traits.</p>
<p>My husband had brown and red in his beard, but no red in any other body hair, just brown. </p>
<p>His mother had brown hair, his father had very bright red hair. They had hoped that my husband would have red hair as well. </p>
<p>Obviously some of the red genes were passed on, based on his beard hair. And later completely proved by our oldest, blessed to be a full ginger. :) </p>
<p>I had family members on both sides with red hair in prior generations, but no gingers in. I was cursed to have boring brown hair, but I do have very pale skin with freckles and my brown hair would get reddish streaks in summer. I'm only half daywalker. </p>
<p>And our youngest was born with blond hair that is darkening to brown as he gets older. So there is an interesting gene combo going on there too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
