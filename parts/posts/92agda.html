Another question about nuclear explosions, I once read on Reddit about the experiences of someone who as a kid was watching some nuclear test in Mojave, I think, and he said that at the moment of detonation he saw these speckles of very weird colours. Does this really happen and if yes, why?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those are rocket trails. Just before launch small rockets are launched which leave those plumes of white smoke as they go up. Scientists can watch how the plumes behave in the vicinity of the blast and get a nice visualization of how the air around the fireball is behaving.</p>
<p>It is possible that the specks of white light at the time of the blast were from the interaction of high energy gamma radiation with the retina of the viewers. Radiation interacting with photoreceptors often appears as a small white speck or flash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those are smoke trails from smoke rockets.  Before nuclear tests, they would sometimes fire smoke rockets up into the air near the blast location, which would allow them to monitor the blast's shock wave by watching how the smoke trails moved in response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pertaining to your second question, my grandfather was commissioned for some work on Enewetak atoll tests with the military. He recalled that the officers stood on a navy ship deck some signigicant distance away when it detonated. He held his hand up and could see through his hand like an xray. Maybe the speckles of light are a similar outcome of radiation exposure from the blast?</p>
<p>Edit: He described it as holding his hand up and the light was so intense he could see his bones more or less</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are used to calculate the yield if the bomb. Shoot  a few small rockets in the air to make smoke trails in front of the camera, do a little trigonometry, and you can determine the size of the fireball/blast. This gives you yield.</p>
<p>Interesting history, before the trinity test in July 1945, they carted out 200,000 lbs of TNT and filmed it explode so that they could use to baseline big explosions and later calculate the yeild of the actual nuke using visual techniques.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that there was no crazy math or science used to calculate the size if the bomb, but rather just a test explosion with conventional explosives. That same method was used through the &quot;atmospheric&quot; testing days with the rocket smoke contrails.</p>
<p>When they went to underground testing they had to develope another technique that I cant recall if its classified or not, so I will error on the side of not saying.</p>
<p>Source: I am a nuke weapons engineer.</p>
<p>Edit: just noticed your second question. atmospheric testing done on the mainland was done at the nevada test site (now called NNSS) that is about 1.5 hr drive North of vegas.</p>
<p>Speckles...hmmm, there are some materials (I wont name) that do make some really cool effects when you blow them up (think sparklers), however they only last a moment (high speed camera catches it) and only in conventional explosions. When it goes nuclear, everything is pretty much vaporized in less that 100 micro seconds and vapor doesn't really sparkle. Plus, he would have been mikes and mikes away and nonway would he been able to see that even if it wasn't vaporized. I call BS on his story. </p>
<p>Plus they quit atmospheric testing decades ago, is this your grandpa or something?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
