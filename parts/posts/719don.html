<p>You might want to look into the Monitoring Capabilities of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).  You can read a bit about it here:</p>

<p>Basically, radiochemical analysis can tell you information about the bomb design and the metallurgical refinement techniques of the fissile material (which a lot of people don't know is the majority of the &quot;technology&quot; of a nuclear bomb).  However, whether that can be mapped to a specific nation state, or even a specific manufacturing facility ultimately depends on how much we know about that nation state and its nuclear weapon manufacturing facilities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When producing fissile material for weapons, there are multiple samples taken to determine the enrichment quality. There are also samples and pertinent data collected when inspecting the facilities for safety and efficiency. Because of variations in reactors, the specific facility can often be identified from records. And, in the case of agreements between countries, i.e. START, we have detailed records as well do the other countries of which facilities are capable of producing or do produce these materials for weapons.</p>
<p>For reasons like cost and the fact no one can test these things due to international treaties(I'm not including DPRK in that) the only way we know if weapons work when they are upgraded or recycled is because we can do the math and know the chemical composition of the fissile material due to its byproducts. And every reactor has a byproduct footprint. This footprint can reveal what reactor, what year, what month, and which part of the vessel the material came from. </p>
<p>We spend a massive amount of cash on maintaining the weapon stockpile in testing product chemistry and materials production. Not including maintenance on the delivery systems. And the delivery systems are much more complex than the payload. Once a country or organization learns how to make a bomb and gets the fuel right, it's actually a much (metaphorically)simpler mechanism than the wind up clock. Because for basics there are only two ways to go, (gun/implosion) and the more complex of the two (implosion) is 97% of the work for you to get to the one that makes the more predictable and scalable boom. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: So yeah, most of the time they can tell you not only where, but what part of a reactor the enriched fuel came from because they keep records and because it's the only way to make sure they work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The US Defense Threat Reduction Agency has an R/D program (DISCREET OCULUS) whose purpose is to use data from multiple phenomenologies (e.g. seismic, over-pressure, gamma, optical, radio frequency, radionuclide, etc) to attribute a nuclear detonation to a particular weapon design, and ultimately a particular maker. </p>
<p>See the following public releases.  According to them, systems are actually fielded. And, they've run some massive simulations.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pre-detonation, if you have a ball of nuclear material, you find it's current isotope abundance and then use mathematics and nuclear decay knowledge to figure out the abundance when it was manufactured which would be key in telling you almost exactly where it came from. Post detonation, that is obviously not something that can still be done. </p>
<p>Post detonation you can get clues to determine things like, was it a fission device or a fusion device and clues about the yield. You may be able to tell Uranium vs Plutonium. Maybe someone more expert than me can respond to my post if they see it. I don't think there would be any definitive way to know for sure exactly what facility inside a country manufactured it without other knowledge/intel outside the detonation. So I would highly doubt you could tell exactly where the bomb came from using physics alone.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
