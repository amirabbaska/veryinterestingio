Like I feel like living in a home for 10 years, the buildings structure would be perfectly fine. But a home abandoned for ten years, somehow the building is nearly gonna collapse and paint/wallpaper is chipping/peeling away.   </p>
<p>What am I missing that's happening here? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water.</p>
<p>Once the outside fails enough to let water enter, the water rapidly destroys the structure.  Dust and spiders won't do any real damage, but water will level a building in just a few years.  Rot wood, dissolve drywall, melt plaster.</p>
<p>If the place freezes in the winter, that gives water even more power to freeze in the cracks and break down concrete and masonry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a home is occupied, the occupants are likely going to notice something like, for instance, a leak in the roof, and take steps to repair the leak and clean up any water that leaked in.</p>
<p>In an abandoned building, these minor problems are left to fester, and it allows for what would cause little to no damage over a few days to go on for weeks or months.  Or something like termites could infest the place and go unnoticed.</p>
<p>often, houses that are abandoned are not new, too, and a roof slowly deteriorates over time, so a completely new house would likely be in better condition after 10 years of neglect compared to a house that was 20 years old when it was abandoned.</p>
<p>I would note that homes in urban area are rarely actually abandoned, as they often have some owner who will come along and maintain it or sell it, be it the bank or the previous owner's heirs- and if they don't at least keep the outside presentable, the city might take legal action against them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've heard it said before that an empty house ages 5 years for every year it's empty. And like the other people said, there's little things that break all the time in a house that start to compound when no one fixes them. Also a lived in house usually has heat and AC, so inside it's around the same temperature year round, and there's decent air flow. An empty house will have temperatures vary a lot just over a day, all the wood swells and shrinks, which can start to pull nails out. Damp and musty air also promotes mold growth. The lack of people also allows rodents and such to move in which also do a fair amount of damage to the building. So you can see how even a short period of time when a house is empty can lead to a lot of problems down the road. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of different factors at play. Two main factors, temperature and water. The lack of climate control will mean that materials will expand and contract with seasons. Different materials will expand at different rates, and that will cause gaps to appear. These gaps can cause the chipping of paint and wallpaper. Once the chipping begins, it will only get worse. The gaps and chips allow the big killer, water. Water will rot the wooden frame of a house if given enough time unchecked. The chipping paint and other gaps allows the water to get into places that were never designed to get wet. The outside of a house can withstand a lot of water. Now imagine that in your living room. These factors, along with wild animals and potential vandalism, are the primary reasons why abandoned homes do not last.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All this talk of water being the enemy of a building makes me wonder, why are any buildings built with a flat roof?  Generally every commercial building has a flat roof, wouldn't it make more sense to slant it, even if it was to one side so the water would run off the roof and presumably save the cost of water damage and allow your roof to last longer?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
