<p>Obviously this would be very bad and I would get very sick, but what would <em>actually</em> happen? Would I have to excrete all that dead cellular matter somehow? Would I survive long enough to find that I couldn't digest things now? What systems would fail, and how quickly? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first problems you would have would be in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Your intestines are absolutely filled to the brim with bacteria, since it's the perfect environment for them. It's warm, wet, and always filled with nutrients. Most of those bacteria are good bacteria that are content to just stay there. Those good bacteria help us in a lot of different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>They take up all available space in the intestines, providing a physical barrier against bad bacteria you eat</li>
<li>They excrete antibacterial compounds that inhibit the growth of other bacteria; they are extremely competitive and keep each other in check</li>
<li>Their presence induces the production of antibodies in the intestinal epithelium (the walls of the intestine), which additionally helps against bad bacteria</li>
<li>They metabolize long-chain carbohydrates that we can't break down on our own, which can then be absorbed through the intestine. They're the guys that make beans gassy</li>
<li>They have an association with mental health: recent studies have found correlations between mental issues like depression and gut flora health</li>
<li>They play a role in liver health: declines in intestinal bacteria have been connected to liver cirrhosis (scarring) similar to that seen in chronic alcohol abuse</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the nastiest infections that often results from heavy antibiotic use in the intestine is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile_%28bacteria%29?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Clostridium difficile</a>. It forms spores and can survive heavy antibiotic use. It also thrives in the intestine and causes inflammation and diarrhea, among other conditions. If it doesn't go away with antibiotics, it typically has to be treated with a fecal transplant to restore good intestinal bacteria since it's only able to thrive when there aren't enough good bacteria competing with it. Eliminating everything levels the playing field for all bacteria, good and bad.</p>
<p>Your skin is also important here. Skin is covered in bacteria, much like the intestine. Most of it is bacteria that isn't interested in infecting our bodies; they're happy to sit on our skin and eat the oil and sweat our bodies make. In return, they compete with the bad bacteria that also want to live there. Killing all the bacteria on our skin would allow any new bacteria, especially the bad ones, to grow at alarming rates, and significantly increase the likelihood of infection. </p>
<p>In particular, <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em>, perhaps the most abundant bacteria on the skin, is one of these bacteria.  One recent study described its removal like this: &quot;The removal of S. epidermidis (i.e. through overuse of topical antibiotics) may be detrimental to the host for two reasons. Firstly, removing S. epidermidis eliminates the bacterium’s endogenous antimicrobial peptides, allowing potentially pathogenic organisms to colonize the skin more effectively. Secondly, without bacterial priming of the skin, the host may be less efficient in warding off infection. In this light, S. epidermidis may be thought of as a mutual, thus, adding to the human innate immune system.&quot; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2746716/" target="_blank">Study here</a>. </p>
<p>What this means, basically, is that S. epidermidis, which is more or less harmless, makes its own antbiotics that stop bad bacteria from thriving. Get rid of S. epidermidis, expect more bad bacteria to take over. Bacterial priming is similar to what happens in the intestine, where the presence of generally good bacteria boosts the immune system so it can respond more quickly to bad bacteria.</p>
<p>So, eliminating all bacteria from your body, you would find you would not be able to digest food that has any sort of complex molecules. You would probably, pretty quickly, suffer from infection of your GI tract and potentially your skin, and also potentially suffer liver damage and neurological issues, although we're not sure if a complete destruction of bacteria is actually causative of those problems. And you certainly would excrete the bacteria. The reason your poop smells so bad is because it's loaded with live bacteria, the byproducts of the stuff they've eaten, and tons and tons of bacterial corpses: those fighters who have given their lives so that you can live a healthy life of eating, digesting, farting, and pooping.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can live being &quot;sterile&quot; but it is not too great.  There is a specially bred mouse that is just that...[no bacteria.]( <a href="https://irp.nih.gov/catalyst/v19i4/germ-free-mice" target="_blank">https://irp.nih.gov/catalyst/v19i4/germ-free-mice</a>)</p>
<p>However, you will not get certain nutrients and most likely lose weight. Also, foreign agents are critical for regulating the human immune response.  You can expect all sorts of auto-immune diseases to develop (arthritis, colitis, etc.).  In short, you would not die immediately, but you would significantly shorten your life.</p>
<p>We have evolved with these organisms and should treat them with the respect they deserve.  They are our companions in this thing called life.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is, &quot;avoid space lasers.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add what others have said. Your chances of getting ill from a gastrointestinal disease will increase astronomically.</p>
<p>Your normal flora (harmless bacteria that reside in your digestive tract) prevent the bad bacteria from attaching and forming colonies by occupying surface area, with no place to attach they just head straight into the toilet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You <em>might</em> get sick but once you get out of the space laser and on to your usual life your gut flora will quickly be repopulated by common microbes and eventually settle. There are bacteria in the air, most surfaces and on the food you eat. Assuming your immune system is intact falling sick is unlikely; Bacteria on your skin doesn't even matter.</p>
<p>But to answer your questions, all the dead stuff in your gut will pass out together with your poop, you would still survive since your body still produces, and has been producing since you were born, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_enzyme" target="_blank">digestive enzymes</a>. Maybe you don't digest stuff as efficiently as before but eventually stabilises once your gut flora is reestablished. That means some diarrhea similar to when you take anti-biotics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>im sure someone will chime in with more info, but if I understand correctly this more or less happens when you take antibiotics - only the bacteria in your appendix sticks around. if you have an appendectomy then that's gone too.</p>
<p>Based on that fact I'd say it's not real bad for you despite probably not being wonderful for longevity. as you said, digestion would be affected - but it is also likely that certain bacteria digest things we can't to produce things we need or are beneficial, so we'd loose whatever those compounds are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
