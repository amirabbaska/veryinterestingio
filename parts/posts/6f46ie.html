		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a really good book on the topic of mother/infant evolution called Mother Nature by Sarah Hrdy. As I remember, she's a primatologist as well as an anthropologist so she looks at all primate parental behaviors to draw conclusions about primitive humans. As other have noted, most babies are pretty helpless so humans aren't an exception there. But two points Hrdy made that stood out to me the most.</p>
<p>One is the importance of alloparenting in primates. As they say, it takes a village to raise a child and for primates thats literally true. An entire troop is dedicated to helping the young survive, not just parents. </p>
<p>And two, many assumptions we make about what a human baby does are inaccurate. You're right that extended crying would not be a good survival technique but more primitive cultures tend to have more peaceful babies, partly because they're less colicky (I've heard this is because they dont lie babies down, which leads to acid reflux because the flap in their esophagus isn't fully formed?) and they have many cultural practices to keep babies pacified, like someone always holding the baby, nursing on demand, swaddling etc. </p>
<p>There are some writings from early Appalachia where the white explorers specifically mention how peaceful and quiet the babies of the Native Americans are. One of them even describes how (shockingly!) a baby would cry while on his mothers back and she would expose her breast, slip him under her arm, and continue with her work. I believe it was Anne Newport Royal who wrote about this.</p>
<p>Similar things could be said about babys' reflexes. Obviously they were useful at some time so we can't make assumptions that the babies we see in modern culture reflect how babies have always been.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short summary of human evolution to this day.</p>
<p>Because we out-thought them. Many human babies, as weak and helpless as they are for so many years, definitely did die by tooth and claw. But, on average, their parents were smarter than the things that wanted to eat them.</p>
<p>So they were able to defend them for years with basic logic, planned ahead to have enough food to feed their useless mouths in winter, and grew and prospered.</p>
<p>Over time those brains became even bigger and more useful. Crude clubs were fashioned to equal any tooth or claw, and battles were won. Dirt walls were piled up and men with clubs were posted to keep watch, and no mere animal could approach without detection.</p>
<p>Gradually we learned about our environment, and due to evolution of our vocal chords we were able to form language to pass down tales. Tales that told that if you spit out the fruit seed and pressed it into the earth it would be fruit for your children to eat. And so we had more fruit than any other animal could ever hope for.</p>
<p>We won so many battles and killed so many lions and tigers and bears, oh my, that they eventally evolved to fear us. A bear will not come after a human child unless it is starving to death (which isn't that uncommon). Better to eat poison than to have your entire genetic line hunted to extinction in an orgy of vengeance.</p>
<p>Lacking any animal that could stop us we quickly colonized the entire Earth. In some cases wiping out smarter (at the time) rival homonid species that didn't breed as fast (Neanderthals).</p>
<p>Eventally there was no one to turn on but ourselves. We quickly adapted to war with even bigger brains and specialized bodies. Northern European men have massively enlarged upper bodies, full of muscle, able to swing a sword and carry heavy metal armor (on average).</p>
<p>Now we are adapting to peace. No longer does the mighty arm win the argument. You have to remain calm and talk things through. You don't want trouble with the government. Eventually, over hundreds of years, that will too breed itself into our bones.</p>
<p>And we are losing the ability to operate as a biological organism without technology. Brains are so incredabily useful that women can now give birth to babies with brains two sizes to big for their hips. Surgical c-section has enabled a new era of expansion in brain sizes, with 30% more women since 1950 in America birthing babies with brains too large to survive without knife and antibiotics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many baby animals are just as helpless as a human. Look how many animals just sit around <em>as a defenseless egg</em>?</p>
<p>Babies and children always would have been vulnerable to predation, violence, disease, just like every other animal, but humans live in groups and are capable of making fire, weapons, choosing safe places to make their home (like a cave, hut, etc). </p>
<p>Anatomically modern humans are the absolute top of the food chain, even if some small number of babies were killed by a wild animal, a whole group of humans would have scared the bejeesus out of pretty much everything</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some ways, your view of babies may be skewed as you only see them as they are today.  Babies have adapted to making lots of noise in order to get food, attention, etc.  I watched an episode of I shouldn't be [alive] (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914620/" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914620/</a>) where the family got caught in a blizzard.  The child was 5-months old.  Instead of screaming the kid got very quiet and the parents were terrified to open the duffel bag they were carrying him in.  You find out at the end that the baby went almost into hibernation and young humans are actually able to handle that type of situation better than adults.  I believe his name was Clayton Stapola or something similar.  </p>
<p>Infant babies, even today, prefer to be swaddled and carried around (think of all of the adorable baby pictures on facebook of the kid sleeping while the parent has them in some sort of transport on their body).  I believe it is a natural and common thing that has been used for a very long time.  So the parents, as stated, outsmarted the predators but also kept them close.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Societies. </p>
<p>It literally does take a village to raise a child. Since societies are mandatory to protect our young, we were forced to form the groups that led to human dominance of earth. A small group can work, a large group works much better. </p>
<p>The real question is how could we have survived <em>without</em> useless children to force us to work together? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
