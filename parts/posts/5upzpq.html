		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned before, the colour green is associated with sickness. Many people may also think about Chlorine when they hear &quot;poison&quot; - which was used for its poisonous properties during World War 1, and is a green gas. The substances used as rat poisons ages ago were also green.</p>
<p>Modern poisons aren't necessarily green at all, they are usually colourless (poisons aren't very effective if they look obvious).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yet another hazardous green thing was radium paint, used in luminous clocks and watches. It is the phosphor in the paint that produces the distinctive green glow, but the radium was dangerous to people working with it, in particular painters who would lick the radium brushes.</p>
<p>And uranium glass, although generally not hazardous, also glows green under UV light.</p>
<p>These may account for the popular depiction of radioactive substances as glowing green, and indirectly reinforce the use of that colour for generic 'poison'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that a lot of these things are perpetuated because they are already established conventions. It's not like modern games like Assassin's Creed choose poison to be green because of arsenic or snakes or whatever; they do it because they know that players already associate green with poison.</p>
<p>The convention probably stretches back a few decades at least; just like red = health and blue = magic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe that it is because we associate the color green with sickness. People tend to look green when they are sick, so it is an accurate representation for poison, something that makes you sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
