		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your ears pop because there was unequal pressure between the <del>inner</del> middle ear and the atmospheric pressure. This applies pressure to the eardrum, making it more taught and thus more resistant to vibrations. This limits how effective sound waves can vibrate the ear drum, thus making you less sensitive to sound. Once the pressure is equalized, the ear drum can vibrate more and thus becomes more sensitive to sound waves again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because everything sounded muffled for a while before they pop back to normal. Itâ€™s kinda like when you step out of a matinee and the sun seems 5x brighter because you were used to a dark theatre.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your ear drums cover your ear canals, and when sound waves go into your ears they get pushed in and out. This is kind of like if you covered the end of a straw with a balloon and alternated blowing and sucking on it - it would bulge out or cave in. This movement is what your brain reads out sounds from!</p>
<p>Ears pop because the pressure on either side of your ear drums isn't equal. If you go up in a plane, the pressure outside your head lowers but the pressure inside your head (specifically, in your middle ear) stays the same. Sounds coming up against your ear drums in this case tend to bounce off of it instead of making it move, so you hear it less. This is as if you were always slightly sucking on the straw. The balloon would have less range of motion and mostly be kind of stuck in one position. After popping (which is when a little tube connecting your middle ear to the back of your throat opens for a moment) the pressure on either side of your ear drums is the same and it can wiggle back and forth more again. As a result, things sound louder!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
