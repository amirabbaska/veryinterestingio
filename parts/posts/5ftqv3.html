<p>When your eyes move very quickly (like trying to follow a fan blade), your brain temporarily turns off visual processing so that it doesn't see just a bunch of blurred images. It happens very quickly, so normally the gap in what you are seeing is not noticeable. But when the movement happens while looking at fan blade, your brain stores a quick picture of the blade not moving. This really fast eye movement is called a &quot;saccade&quot;. </p>
<p>A cool example (that I think many 5-year-olds would enjoy) is looking into a mirror, and looking back and forth from one eye to another. You can never see your own eyes actually moving, but somebody else watching can easily see your eyes moving back and forth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two kinds of eye movement.  </p>
<p>One is when you are focusing on and following something, so if the target or you are moving, you are still looking directly on the target.</p>
<p>The other, thats related to your question is when you are changing your target, like when you look from left to right.<br />
In this case, you are not following anything, so the eye have to move the fastest way to the new position. Now in this situation, the interesting thing is that you actually cannot see anything, when your eyes are moving to a new position, you are temporarily blind. This is to make sure that you wont get dizzy or disoriented from the shaking.<br />
And to fill the gap of that blindness, your brain just freezes the last image you saw. And then you can actually see the details, like the fan's blade in the question.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: when eyes move fast, you are blind, brain freezes last image, you dont see the blur</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: There's a little switch on your ceiling fan you're supposed to toggle between winter and summer. It changes the direction the fan spins, blowing down or pulling air up as is appropriate to the season. I had no idea until our HVAC guy mentioned it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually explained like you're five: Your brain likes to fill in extra &quot;frames&quot; of what you see. This is why sometimes when you look at a clock the second hand seems to linger for longer than one second.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the Saccadic Masking, it's also simply a question of focus. When you focus on the object behind the fan, that's what your eyes are paying attention to - the fan blades pass so fast they'll be blurry. But when you move your eyes, panning your vision along with the fan blades, it's like following a fast moving car with your eyes. The scenery in the background, behind the car/fan blade will be blurry, but the moving object stays in focus and hence nicely visible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
