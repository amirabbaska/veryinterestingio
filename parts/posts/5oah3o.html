		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun creates these things called <em>photons</em>. These photons are little packets of light and energy. These are ejected from the sun trillions and trillions of time per second. </p>
<p>When photons hit things, they can give up their energy to them. That's why light can heat things up. Solar panels take this energy and store it. The main mechanism is called the <em>photovoltaic</em> effect. </p>
<p>Solar panels have a crystal panel that the light shines on, and inside there is a lot of circuitry which is connected to a battery or energy storage device. The crystal panel is made up of atoms. </p>
<p>Atoms are composed of their cores, and the electrons which orbit them. The cores, assuming they have at least one proton are positively charged. To even out the charges so the atom is neutral, negatively charged <em>electrons</em> surround them. They &quot;orbit&quot; the atoms at different energy levels. Getting into this area any further ultimately leads to quantum mechanics and things get a little too wishy washy and mathy to do a good ELI5 on it.</p>
<p>If a photon hits the orbit of an electron, the electron could take that energy from the photon and <em>excite</em> and go up an energy level. Now the solar panel has <em>captured</em> the energy from the sun. This happens all over the solar panel.</p>
<p>This is where the <em>photovoltaic</em> effect kicks in. The crystal panel's exposure to light (because of how it can capture energy to excite electrons) causes a <em>voltage</em> change, and can cause an electric current in the circuit. This causes energy to flow into a battery and we can store it for later.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar cells are made up of several photo-voltaic cells. Each photo-voltaic cell is divided into two layers. The two layers of the cell are typically known as P and N. The P layer is designed to allow energy to flow to the N layer but energy from the N layer cannot flow to the P layer. There is a short gap between the two layers which permits energy from flowing in the opposite direction (from N to P).</p>
<p>The vast majority of modern day solar panels are created from silicon which has been chemically altered to absorb electricity more efficiently. Each photo-voltaic cell is made up of silicon. When sunlight strikes the N layer of a photo-voltaic cell it becomes charged but it cannot retain the charge so the electricity is immediately transferred to the P layer of the photo-voltaic cell. The amount of electricity that is transferred at one time is usually around the 0.5 volt mark but there are ways to increase the amount of electricity each photo-voltaic cell produces. The electricity in the P layer is then transferred to the main semi-conductor and the electricity flows to the solar panel's battery.</p>
<p>Solar cells are only capable of converting about 1/16 of energy in sunlight. The reason for that is because the sun's rays rarely shine directly on to the solar panels and most of the rays are reflected or absorbed into the surface of the solar panel. Most calculations state the maximum amount of energy that a solar panel can gather from sunlight is about 30%. However, there are currently no solar panels on the mainstream market which are capable of gathering that much energy from sunlight. </p>
<p>Typical solar panels are around 15% energy efficient. In other words, they can only convert about 15% of the energy in the sun's rays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of electricity as a flow of charged particles (electrons) around a circuit from an area with a whole heap of electrons to somewhere there is a lack of them. In a battery, these come from a chemical reaction; in a generator, magnets force them to start moving.</p>
<p>In a solar panel, bits of light (photons) hit the surface of a metal (silicon, or a specially created mix of materials like silicon), exciting an election from its normal place in the atoms of silicon to somewhere up hill from where we can leach them off and coax them into flowing around a circuit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are also &quot;solar thermal&quot; panels which are just black painted aluminium and copper pipe. They heat your water or floor by pumping heat from the roof. Or a field of mirrors can be solar panels when they focus he sunlight to a point to make steam to turn a power plant turbine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
