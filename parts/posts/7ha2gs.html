		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is not really a direct measure for the average kinetic energy.  It's more that both the average and standard deviation are related to the temperature.  For an ideal gas, this relationship is given by the <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry/Kinetics/Rate_Laws/Gas_Phase_Kinetics/Maxwell-Boltzmann_Distributions" target="_blank">Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution</a>.  As the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy increases, and the width of the distribution increases too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A classical ideal gas at equilibrium obeys the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:</p>
<p>f(E) = 2(kT)^(-3/2)*sqrt[E/π]*exp[-E/kT].</p>
<p>The mean of this distribution is </p>
<p>μ = 3kT/2.</p>
<p>The variance is defined by the average value of (E - μ)^(2) which is just</p>
<p><code>[; \int_{0}^{\infty} f(E) (E-\mu)^{2} dE = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}(kT)^{-3/2}\int_{0}^{\infty} \Big(E - \frac{3kT}{2}\Big)^{2} \sqrt{E} \exp \Big(-E/kT\Big) ;]</code>.</p>
<p>If I calculated it correctly, this whole thing evaluates to 3(kT)^(2)/2. That's the variance of the kinetic energy, so the standard deviation is sqrt(3/2)kT.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All answers are excellent here. I want to add an important point though. It is correct to thing about temperature of a gas a being a definite quantity only in the state of equilibrium, when gas particle energies nicely fit into the ideal gas M-B distribution. This is not the case, for example, when there is radiation involved. Roughly speaking, some gas molecules will absortb photons from the radiation and gain much higher energy, not fitting on the curve any more. This is why a thermometer is lying (or, rather, just shows an arbitrary temperature of the thermometer itself) when sunlit. Air in a sunlit room is quite far from thermal equilibrium with the radiation, just as one example. In such a state, we can speak of kinetic temperature and radiative temperature, and they may be vastly different. The radiation temperature in your room is around the temperature of the Sun's surface, ~6000K, but the kinetic temperature is naturally much smaller.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
