		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain uses the temperature sensing nerves at the back of your throat to judge extreme cold. Those nerves are relatively deep in the body while still exposed to the outside. If they're cold, your environment is likely <em>very</em> cold. Your body raises its internal temperature to compensate. Specifically, it increases your brain temperature. It's a fever, but instead of helping the body kill germs, it's protecting your brain from extreme cold.</p>
<p>Ice cream and smoothies and other frozen treats are very new on a biological time scale. When you eat too much of it too fast, your body responds like it would in extreme cold.</p>
<p>This is why pressing your tongue against the back of your throat helps. Tongues are warm and full of blood, and they help return those nerves to normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
