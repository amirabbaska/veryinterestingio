		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a surprisingly complicated question to answer. Why are moving bicycles stable? What keeps them upright?</p>
<p>The most common (and sort of incorrect) answer is that the wheels are like little gyroscopes. Spinning objects like to stay pointed the same direction, and it requires a big torque to change their axis of rotation, which stabilizes the bike. This is sometimes what we tell students in intro classes, and it's not the full story. </p>
<p>Another reason is the <em>trail</em> of the bike. The contact point between the front tire and the ground is a bit off from the steering axis. When a moving bike starts to tip this causes a force which turn the steering column to keep it upright, so the bike is self-correcting. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the math is governed by a bunch of coupled non-linear differential equations, by the geometry of the bike, and by the parameters of the rider, so there likely isn't any simple intuitive explanation beyond what I've said about a few of the effects above- it's some complicated interplay between a variety of these things. Again, this is an enormously complicated question - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_and_motorcycle_dynamics" target="_blank">just take a look at how long the Wiki article is!</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whilst the gyroscopic and caster effects contribute to the vertical stability of a bike, the main reason for a bike maintaining its vertical stability is &quot;front-loaded steering geometry.&quot;</p>
<p>Essentially, when the bike rolls to one side, the front wheel will turn in that direction first. If the bike rolls to the left, the front wheel turns to the left. The momentum of the bike causes it to try to continue going in the same direction, so the bike rolls to the right in relation to the new direction of the wheel, just like when you slide to the right in a car when you turn left.</p>
<p>The faster the bike, the more momentum it has and so the greater the force it rolls back in the opposite direction to the wheel turn. The force of the the counter-roll is related to the angle of the wheel and the force from the momentum of the bike. If the bike has more momentum, it won't need to turn as much for the force from the change in momentum to counteract the roll. Therefore, the faster the bike is traveling, the less the wheel will turn before counteracting its roll, which is how stable the bike is. So, more forward momentum gives you more stability so long as the front wheel has a sufficient angle to allow the front to turn first.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplest explanaition is that you cannot correct a falling bike when it isn't moving. A moving bike can be corrected in a fall by steering to the direction you're falling to. Steering the bike allows you to reposition the contact point of the tire under the bikes center of mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top answers (and their voters!) have jumped to the scientifically interesting and often-posed question, which is however not the one asked here! The OP asks why it's <em>easier</em> to balance a moving bicycle, not why a moving bicycle balances itself. In other words, a rider is involved.</p>
<p>The answer is simply that, when the bicycle is moving, steering in the direction you start to fall causes your forward momentum to push the bike and rider upright again. This is impossible if you're not moving! Gyroscopic and trail effects might make the bicycle help you, but as any beginning rider knows, it's perfectly possible to fall off a moving bicycle even with these effects.</p>
<p>For a little more detail: imagine that you're heading due North on a bike, and are slightly tilted left. If left unchecked, you'll tilt more and more until you fall off and are quite sad. However, if you steer to the left, the bike points slightly left of North, whilst your momentum is (for now) still due North. This means there is a small component of your momentum which seems to push you to the right. (In reality it is friction pushing the wheels left, whilst momentum keeps the top of the bike and rider heading straight)</p>
<p>Since the wheels aren't able to move left or right - the friction of the tyres with the ground prevents this - this acts to push the top of the bike to the right, correcting the tilt.</p>
<p>Once you learn to ride a bicycle, you have trained your brain to know just how much to move the handlebars in order to keep the bicycle perfectly upright - or how to steer and lean simultaneously to go round a bend at speed. But all of this relies on the fact that you have some forward momentum to bring the bike back to vertical when you steer into a tilt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With regard to why it is easier for a human to ride a bike at a higher speed, this is because there is an integrator in the system.  The rate of change of yaw of the line of contact on the road is the integral of steering angle over distance traveled, but the distance traveled per time is of course speed, so the faster you are going the smaller steering input is required to accomplish a certain change in yaw in a certain time.</p>
<p>Consider someone trying to ride in a straight line.  To travel in a straight line the rider must keep the line of contact of the tires directly under the center of gravity of the bike and rider (assuming no other force than gravity).  Now suppose a crosswind from the left comes up, causing the rider to start to fall to the right.  In order to not fall over, the cyclist must steer to the right to get the line of contact offset to the right so as to now operate in a new equilibrium (one in which the bike/rider combo is leaning to the left against the wind).  The faster the rider is going, the smaller will be the steering input required to compensate for that change in wind.</p>
<p>A similar argument holds for the amount of steering input required for intentional turns.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I think that arguments about trail and rake and gyroscopic forces are secondary to the above fact when the topic is the relative ease of riding a bike at different speeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
