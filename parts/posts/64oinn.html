<p>A lot of that content being uploaded isn't great quality and so it doesn't take up much space. The very high quality videos are compressed to take up as little as possible.</p>
<p>As long as they can add hard drives faster than we can consume it, they stay ahead.</p>
<p>Remember that the server farms are distributed throughout the world. There is probably one near you.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if these server farms, and not just ones owned by Youtube, will be targets in war in the future just as libraries and museums have always been throughout history. </p>

The fact that you can type in some obscure TV episode from 1996 and have it play virtually instantly is the real marvel. For that you need a lot of robust engineering / algorithms to index, find, and present that so efficiently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
