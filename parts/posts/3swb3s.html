<p>I suppose the exact question I have is: Does adrenaline reduce reaction time and if so how, and by how much?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In essence yes, the sympathetic nervous system (&quot;fight or flight&quot;) can speed reaction time to danger through this non-exhaustive list of mechanisms: dilation of the pupil allows for increased sensory awareness; increased blood flow into skeletal muscle allows for faster and more sustained muscular responses; finally the increase of the stress hormone cortisol has an effect in &quot;priming&quot; the brain to be hyper-aware of the surroundings, thus decreasing reaction time when a stimulus does occur. This is actually a really interesting direct connection between psychology and physiology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, adrenaline also causes your brains 'fast process' thinking to take priority.  Just like dan kahneman showed in his work, we have a fast thought process and a slow one. I use my fast process when im working out how to catch something for example. I use my slow one when I solve a maths problem.</p>
<p>The fast process is our primate brain that helps keep us alive, it operates on rules of thumb and best guess. Using this process is quick good for avoiding danger, but we would lose a massive element of our advatange that our intelligence gives us if we operated at a super awareness level. All the decisions we ever made would be quick heuristic solutions.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I wish I could remember the other term I've heard used for it, but basically it causes you to drop a lot of filters in your mind, and things can get pretty distorted - size of objects, time, what actually occurred.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
