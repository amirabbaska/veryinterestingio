		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an example of an exception to the already provided answers - in Poland an abandoned bunker has provided a situation where wood ants are regularly separated from their colony by falling down a vertical pipe under the main colony.   Because it is so common, a semi-functional secondary colony operates underground without much food or light.  The ants dig, clean away dead ant bodies to the large &quot;graveyard&quot; surrounding the colony, and mostly act as they would above ground, but eventually starve.  The colony only keeps going by the regular rain of new workers from above.   The scientists studying them aren't sure if they eat anything, like bat guano or mites living on the dead ants, but as of yet haven't identified a food source.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It stops eating and wastes away and dies.  It will try hard to get back for as long as it can first.  The bee needs the hive.  The hive needs the bee.  Social insects aren't following orders from anyone, they are acting on instincts written at the level of DNA.  The queen (and king, if termites) are just as bound to the system as the workers.  Many ants even have multiple queens per colony for redundancy.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to assume social insects can't think for themselves because of the colony.  In the lab they will learn to solve a problem and then teach the solution to others.  They are just intimately a part of the group.  Don't think of a fascist slave state.  Think of an army unit: when one is smart everyone gets smarter; when one is strong, everyone becomes strong.</p>

<p>(EDIT2: It's important to remember that Hollywood's interpretations of hive behavior and eusociality are very inaccurate.  They depict workers and warriors as male, get behavior wrong, etc..)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Think of the entire hive as a single organism with the queen being the reproductive organ. The queen doesn't give orders, she is just recognized as the highest value asset if the colony is to survive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on the insect or even the species. Many termites, when split, will raise up a new queen. Polygyne ants will have more than one queen anyway and will do just fine. Monogyne ants will continue to live until the colony dies off from no replacement workers being added into the fold. </p>
<p>There is also situations where colonies will merge and workers will start to serve a different queen. </p>
<p>This is a huge area of entomology. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a large misunderstanding here in that the insect is &quot;following orders&quot;.  It's not.  It's following programming.  Big difference here.  </p>
<p>I know for bees (so I assume for most hive insects) they function on very specific &quot;rules&quot;.  So for example, a &quot;scout&quot; bee will fill up with honey (fuel) and fly out (up to 4 miles away) to find a source of nectar and pollen.  Once it's found, it'll bring a small amount back, and then do a little dance to tell the other bees where to find it.  The bees will taste the samples, and if everything meets the criteria, they'll suck up JUST ENOUGH honey for the trip, and head out.  If they get blown off course, or otherwise delayed enough that they run out of &quot;fuel&quot; before getting back, they die.  Sure, it's not good for them, but for the hive as a whole (which is the more important organism) it's better that a few bees die this way while conserving &quot;fuel&quot; than to waste excess fuel by having bees overeat before each trip.  </p>
<p>No commands were given, and the queen had no part in the process.  </p>
<p>If the queen dies, her lemon-grass smelling pheromone starts to wear off, and the bees will go to work creating some new queen cells from the most recently laid eggs.  Other than that, the existence of a queen has little to do with a bee's day-to-day programming.  </p>
