		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The RWR (radar warning receiver) basically can &quot;see&quot; all radar that is being pointed at the aircraft. When the radar &quot;locks&quot; (switches from scan mode to tracking a single target), the RWR can tell and alerts the pilot. This does not work if someone has fired a heat seeking missile at the aircraft, because this missile type is not reliant on radar. However, some modern aircraft have additional sensors that detect the heat from the missile's rocket engine and can notify the pilot if a missile is fired nearby. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey this is absolutely up my ally since I'm a subject matter expert on all this.</p>
<p>What people have said in top-level replies is correct. What people have said after those replies is nonsense.</p>
<p>Let's pretend you're playing a game of hide and seek. The rules are simple - you hide in the woods at night, but you have to wear a big shiny reflective suit. The seeker is given a big powerful flashlight with varying brightness, and a friend called the 'finder' who has a smaller, weaker flashlight. The rules are that the seeker's friend has to be the one to 'find' people, but he has to accompany the seeker himself.</p>
<p>So you stand out in the woods. You then see a flashlight beam through the dark. It's sweeping all over. Sometimes it passes over you. This is your RWR system picking up that something is out there and it's looking. It might not see you yet or it's just noticed you and done nothing else. We have a brevity code of 'nails'. It just means &quot;I see them&quot;. Their radar system (the flashlight) is very bright and makes them very noticeable.</p>
<p>The seeker gets closer to your position and he thinks he sees something. He shines the light in your direction and maybe turns the brightness up. This is called an RWR 'spike'. Because of the increase in power and the fact that that beam is focused in your direction, you're now alerted to the fact that he might be on to you. You can now take countermeasures of your own to throw him off.</p>
<p>But maybe the seeker with the flashlight is smart and knows of tricks to prevent this. Maybe he notices you but just <em>pretends</em> to not notice. He passes the flashlight over in your direction while getting closer, but shines it off in other places too, pretending he's looking for others. But you're clever as well - you can tell that he's passing the flashlight over you too often.</p>
<p>Now the seeker has a problem. He wants to tell the finder where to go to 'find' you, but the finder can't really see what the seeker can see, and the flashlight he has is too weak. Once the finder leaves and begins looking for you, he can't really keep up with what the seeker is able to see with his more powerful flashlight, so the seeker - for the highest chance of directing the finder to the right location, he has to crank the flashlight power up and shine it directly at you. Now the finder can rush in on you. Even if you manage to lose the seeker, the finder gets close enough that his little flashlight is now sufficient enough to let him track you down.</p>
<hr />
<p>This describes how radar and radar warning receiver function, and a active guided missile being fired. In real life, a lock or launch warning is detected by the presence of an extremely high-energy concentration of radar energy painting you. Most medium-ranged missiles don't have radar systems in them sufficient to guide themselves to the target the entire way (the tiny flashlight), so they need help tracking as they move in on the target to grab the kill. In the old days most of these missiles didn't even have their own transmitting systems (flashlight), they would have to rely on the firing aircraft (the seeker's flashlight) to track the hider the entire way. If the hider managed to break line of sight with the seeker, the finder would be lost. Modern missiles now have their own radar transmitting systems, though they still need help crossing the many miles to meet the target. They switch on their own radar systems as they get closer to help find a final guidance solution. </p>
<p>Now there's a huge caveat to this - this is only true of radar-guided systems. There also exist other guidance systems. The first is MCLOS or SACLOS. This isn't used against aircraft anymore (too unreliable, too impossible to hit anything) but was common in the early Cold War when guidance systems were nonexistent. These are Manual or Semi-Autonomous Command Line of Sight. Basically it's someone manually steering the missile into you. These missiles generally emit no signal to indicate the target that they are being attacked. There are also laser-guided systems (again, not really used against aircraft, they're too far away and too fast, but they are used against ground targets). Targets can detect the laser beam hitting them and take action. Lastly, there's infrared or electro-optical guidance. These are &quot;sight&quot; driven missiles. They simply see the target and then chase after it. However, they only work within a few miles because too far away, their sensors aren't powerful enough to see anything.</p>
<p>Like CLOS missiles, these emit no signals to be detected. In other words, if an enemy is behind you in a dogfight (which is where these missiles are intended to be used - the big radar guided systems are only for medium and long ranges, because it's too hard to keep a radar lock on a maneuvering target in close range) you <em>won't</em> get the &quot;missile lock&quot; tone. In Battlefield, the heatseeker missiles warning enemies that they're being targeted is nonsense. It <em>cannot</em> happen.</p>
<p>There are systems now that try to sense the electromagnetic wavelength of a rocket motor firing in an attempt to detect these undetectable missiles, but obviously the missile technology is being designed to try to defeat those systems.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let's go back to our game of hide and seek. Right now the game isn't fair. You basically glow in the dark in your foil suit, and he has a huge spotlight. All he has to do is look for reflections in the night.</p>
<p>Let's change it up a bit. Let's say we give you your own flashlight. We also give you glitter, mirrors, computer-controlled mirrors with flashlights, and black spraypaint.</p>
<p>So you're hiding, and the seeker is coming in. You think he sees you, so you begin to mess with him. Since he's looking for shiny reflections in the night, what you do is set up the computer-controlled mirrors nearby. When he shines the light at you, the computer mirror picks up the flashlight and shines a reflective looking bright spot back at him.  This is one form of electronic warfare jamming (the analogy  is a little hard because using a light to see things is more effective than looking for a radar return signal). Basically, you make the shiny reflection look like it's coming from somewhere nearby.</p>
<p>Another form of electronic warfare jamming is &quot;barrage&quot; jamming. You have a flashlight that's not as powerful as his but it's still pretty strong. You wait for him to get close enough, and then you turn on your spotlight and blast him in the face. He's blinded, he can't see anything, and you can escape. However, he now knows you were in the area.</p>
<p>Then there's the glitter. In real life it's called chaff. The guy is looking for you and you throw the glitter... except that didn't do anything. He can see the glitter and knows you're there. Where the glitter is useful is when the finder is sent out by the seeker and getting close. You whip the glitter in his face and it confuses and distracts him. It's very much a last-ditch move though.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's the black spraypaint. This game isn't very fair because of your foil suit. So you spraypaint it black. Congratulations, you're now in stealth mode.  He can still see you if he gets close enough but he no longer can spot you a mile away from your reflective suit. You can now maneuver in their dark to avoid him.</p>
<hr />
<p>Modern radars now use electronically steerable arrays. These make it more challenging to detect certain types of radar operation, because the fundamental &quot;flashlight of energy&quot; no longer exists. Instead, this is like giving the seeker ten thousand flashlights that he just randomly turns off and on a hundred times per second. It's now much harder to tell if he's looking at you or not because you can't track the beam of energy moving around.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I love having to resubmit posts 40 times because of garbage word filters that make no sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Although with modern active electronically scanned array radars (AESA) they can be a lot less obvious about it.</p>
<p>With mechanical antennas it was sort of like a big searchlight on a gimbal. You can tell when the searchlight stops sweeping the sky and starts pointing right at you.</p>
<p>AESA radars are different, instead of one big antenna they have hundreds or thousands of transmit/receive modules that don't physically move but can direct one or multiple radar beams in different directions almost instantly electronically by varying the signal phase, much faster than a mechanically aimed antenna. This allows you to do some clever tricks to &quot;lock on&quot; to a target without looking like you're locked on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is a box on out aircraft called Bitching Betty because it warns the pilots of different things (mechanical failures, radar locks, etc) and it has a woman's voice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radars have different modes, which include: scanning (looking for anything, which may or may not be present), tracking, and lock-on.</p>
<p>The strength and timing of signal pulses, as well as the frequency with which they pan across an area varies between these different modes. By analyzing the traits of incoming radar signals, the onboard computer can determine what mode the enemy radar is in. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
