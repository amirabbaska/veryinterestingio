<p>If there is a terminal velocity for bubbles... what does it depend on? Just pressure? The volume of air?</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For teeny tiny bubbles of gas and single, very large bubbles of gas, people have worked out 'exact' theoretical relationships between the physical properties of the gas and the liquid, and the terminal rise velocity, and have confirmed them with experiments.</p>
<p>For teeny tiny bubbles, the terminal rise velocity is related to the densities of the liquid and the gas, the viscosity of the liquid, as well as the size of the bubble, and gravity.</p>
<p>For the really large, single bubbles, the terminal rise velocity is related to just gravity and the size of the bubble (a surprising result - it doesn't seem to depend on the properties of either the gas or the liquid).</p>
<p>For in-between sized bubbles it gets a bit more difficult and people have only managed to work out the relationships from doing lots and lots of experiments (rather than getting a theoretical result and confirming it with experiments).</p>
<p>(You also run into problems when you have lots of bubbles near each other - they make each other rise faster)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bubbles speed up as they go up because they expand. Terminal velocity is dependant on air pressure, which is pretty uniform in the atmosphere for a really long distance. While water doubles pressure roughly at 10 meters, then adds a bar/atm every subsequent 10.</p>
<p>So at any given depth there is a terminal velocity dependant on the boyant forces of the bubble and the Archimedes principle, but that speed increases as you lower the water pressure (which happens as it rises in an open system).</p>
<p>EDIT: only doubles pressure for the first 10, then adds every 10 meters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is the speed of sound at that pressure of the liquid surface. Choked flow (maybe this only applies to flow through restricted orifices) limits ideal gas velocities to the speed of sound at the gas conditions.</p>
<p>This occurs when the pressure ratio from either side is roughly 2. The speed of the gas through the orifice becomes fixed at the speed of sound, a higher pressure ratio cuases mass flow to increase by increasing the density of the gas through the orifice but the velocity stays the same.</p>
<p>This makes one hell of a noise, the higher the pressure ratio the higher the noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
