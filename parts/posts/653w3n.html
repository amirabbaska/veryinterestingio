<p>If you run the first lap at 6 km/h and then the second lap at 18 km/h you get an average of 12 km/h. That average is 2v^1 .  How is this not correct?</p>
<p>You can also check people's answers <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Veritasium/comments/64yjwo/4_revolutionary_riddles_what_are_the_answers/" target="_blank">here</a> and the third answer to a Youtube comment <a href="http://imgur.com/a/1KXPl" target="_blank">here</a>. There are also multiple answer videos that say the same thing.  Help me not be confused.</p></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>You can't average velocities in this way. You can only do this if the time is equal for the two velocities. In this case, that's not true, since it's the distance that is equal.</p>
<p>To illustrate, assume that the track is 18 km long. The first lap takes 3 hours to complete at 6 km/h. The second lap takes 1 hour to complete at 18 km/h. The total distance covered is 36 km and this took 4 hours. That means that average speed is 9 km/h, only 50% more than the speed of the first lap.</p>
<p>If you want to have the average speed by the double of the speed of the first lap, the average speed should be 12 km/h over the total distance of 36 km. But that means that the total time spent should be 3 hours, which is already how much time was spent on just the first lap. That's why people are saying you'd need an infinite speed on the second lap in order to achieve the desired average.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like to think the following is the simplest way of explaining this:</p>
<p>The average speed for any trip is (total_distance)/(total_time).</p>
<p>After the first lap, you have an average speed of (lap_distance)/(lap1_time)</p>
<p>By running the second lap, you are doubling the total distance run.</p>
<p>If you want your average to also double, your total time must <strong>remain the same</strong> so that the average is (2&times;lap_distance)/(lap1_time+0).</p>
<p>The only way for the total time to remain the same is for you to run the second lap in 0s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say the track is 100 miles around.  You do the first lap at 100 miles per hour.  It takes you 1 hour to perform the first lap.</p>
<p>You want your second lap to be done as if you ran the whole thing at 200 miles per hour.  Two laps are 200 miles.  It should take 1 hour to go 200 miles at 200 miles per hour.</p>
<p>But you already took your 1 hour on the first lap, therefore you have no time left to complete the second lap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One kind of cheaters way to think about this is to put it this way.</p>
<p>&quot;Once I've run around the track once, if I just stop and <em>say</em> I ran the second lap in <em>no</em> additional time, what would my average speed have been?&quot;</p>
<p>So if you ran a lap around a 1000 meter track in 1 minute, your rate for that 1 lap would be 1000 meters/minute.  If you then <em>said</em> that you had actually run two laps in that time, your rate would be 2000 meters/minute.  This is twice the speed of your first lap!</p>
<p>Hence, if it takes you <em>any</em> time at all to complete that second lap, your average will be less than twice the speed of your first lap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To run the two laps so that average is twice the speed you used to run first lap, you'd have to finish entire two lap course exactly the time it took you to run first lap.</p>
<p>So first lap you spent 20 min say. To make you run twice as fast, that is, lap per 10min, then your total time to run two laps is 20min. But you already spent 20min on the first lap! You have to finish second lap instantly, which means infinite speed.</p>
<p>If you run first lap 6km/h, and second 18km/h, you've spent T_1 for lap 1, and one third of that for lap 2, so total of 4/3 <em> T_1, meaning your average speed is 2 laps / (4/3 </em> T_1 ) = 3/2 of speed for first lap, that is 9km/h. No matter how fast you go, you won't reach 12km/h average though</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
