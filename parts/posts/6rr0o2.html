		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once wrote a sociology paper related to this topic. Music is often used by businesses to invite certain people and exclude others. Certain people feel more comfortable and relaxed when surrounded by unobtrusive classical music, perhaps played inside a high-end bistro. Others feel at home in a shop blaring EDM.</p>
<p>So it falls to the consumer to self-select. If a coffee shop consistently plays '60s folk music, a certain clientele will end up frequenting the place, further cementing the coffee shop's identity. But other potential customers may never return to that same coffee shop because they find that music uninteresting or off-putting. </p>
<p>This form of musical manipulation is used a lot in shopping malls--think of all the stores like Pac Sun that play skater punk or whatever else allegedly caters to their desired customers. Banana Republic does the same with adult contemporary. You can hear the shop before you even see it, and think &quot;This place is for me/is not for me.&quot; If your grandparent were walking right next to you when you passed one of these shops, they'd probably hear the music and immediately recognize that the shop has nothing to offer them, whether in terms of merchandise or social atmosphere. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of answers here and I feel most of them aren't really answering the question well.  Yes, there's the awkward silence part, but music is more than that. </p>
<p>Music is like audible emotions.  It can move your mood in a certain direction.  This is really important for social settings because it joins our moods and makes us feel in unison.  Those that are not willing or able to feel the mood of the music will likely move away from the party; which further separates everyone into those that are emotionally connected and those who are not. </p>
<p>This is probably one of the main reasons music has been useful for humans through our evolution.  It's an extension of our emotional/social selves and helps us to join together, bond, and unify our emotions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Moderate background noise induces distraction which encourages individuals to think at a higher, abstract level, and consequently exhibit higher creativity.”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will add that the reason we like to dance together is because there's a deep subconscious discovery thing that happens. When you and I put on music and we both hear the same thing and move in rhythm to the music together there's a greater sense that you are <em>together.</em> As in we are both human beings experiencing the same thing.  There's an added level of empathy for your fellow dancers. A sense of belonging. That's how church and temple prayers work too. </p>
<p>There's actually tons of science they've done with infants and empathy and bouncing up and down to music vs. bouncing randomly while music is on. It's very interesting stuff. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe simple because when there's only silence, whenever you start talking, you feel like everyone is listening to what you're saying and so you feel some pressure.
When there's music, you feel like what you're about to say isn't going to be the instant focus of everybody in the room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
