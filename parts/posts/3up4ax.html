I cant even take this number seriously, its so hot. But then absolute zero, isn't really that much colder, than an earth winter. I guess my question is, why does life as we know it only exist in such extreme cold? And why is it so easy to get things very hot, let's say in the hadron collider. But we still cant reach the relatively close temp of absolute zero?</p>
<p>Edit: Wow. Okay. Didnt really expect this much interest. Thanks for all the replies! My first semi front page achievement! Ive been cheesing all day. Basically vibrators. Faster the vibrator, the hotter it gets. No vibrators no heat. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because at higher temps chemistry is not possible. Once the heat/energies reach a certain level all the electrons are stripped away. We can't reach absolute zero because of thermal conduction.  There is no such thing as a perfect thermal insulator so there is always some heat getting in and the lower the temp the harder it is to get it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could look at a pot of water.</p>
<p>Think of the water. Ignoring the fridge, it doesn't get much colder than room temperature-- that's about as low as it goes. </p>
<p>If I add some heat, it starts to boil! I don't have to add much for it to be useful for all sorts of awesome recipes-- making soup stock, boiling pasta, making potatoes. You name it, there's food that could use the kind of energy present in a pot of boiling water to do really great stuff!</p>
<p>But I can add a lot MORE energy... almost endlessly. Eventually that water moves on from a rolling boil to just steam blasting everywhere. It's not useful for cooking anymore because it's getting way too messy to force back into a confined space to be used. Worse sill, the more energy I put into it, the messier it gets, and the further away from dinner I am.</p>
<p>So the point is, only so much heat is needed to get past the stagnation of sitting still in order to start doing all the interesting stuff. Too much heat and all the interesting stuff becomes impossible because everything just flies apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is sort of that the temperature scale has an absolute bottom but is close to being open ended at the top. (There might or might not be a theoretical 'absolute hot', but it would be far past any sort of context where talking about temperature makes sense. For practical purposes the scale might as well be open ended.)</p>
<p>In such a scale any sort of value always appears to be close to the bottom because there is always more room above than below.</p>
<p>The scale alone says nothing about what temperatures should be expected. The average temperature of the universe after all is only a few degrees above absolute zero. But that includes all sort of matter. One may look at the average or median surface temperature of planets and moons and come to completely different conclusions.</p>
<p>Life on earth is based on chemical reactions in general and certain chemical reactions in particular. You don't get much chemistry when you heat things up too much. When you heat things up the energies all around you are greater than energies holding molecules together and letting them react with one another.</p>
<p>Chemistry starts happening close to absolute zero, but it stops happening if things get to hot.</p>
<p>Our sort of chemistry happens at the sort of temperature we have on earth right now. The sort where liquid water exists.</p>
<p>Life based on other chemical reactions that happen at much colder or slightly hotter temperatures are theoretical possible. Even life that is not based on chemistry at all and able to exists at completely different temperature ranges is perhaps possible, but we have never really seen any life other than that related to our own and have no idea what might or might not be out there.</p>
<p>Perhaps we are alone. Perhaps life across the universe is usually found around the same temperature range that we are comfortable with. Perhaps we are an extreme outlier and most life exists at much higher or lower temperatures.</p>
<p>We can only guess.</p>
<p>If we look at our own solar system we have two planets mercury and Venus that are hotter than ours and the rest of the moons and planets that at least on their surface are colder than Earth. Based on that alone one might think that we are unusually warm.</p>
<p>The truth is we have no idea what should be considered normal, based on our extremely limited experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In other words, the lowest temperature means they are standing still. But they can always vibrate even faster no matter how fast they are vibrating right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could say life only exists in extreme cold because it's evolved to adapt to the extreme cold that's on our planet and it's the only life we know. </p>
<p>But on the other hand, the temperature life exists as we know of is an ideal temperature for carbon based lifeforms. Think about how carbon based lifeform works. It works by creating chains of amino acids that fold up to form biomolecular machines. 20 amino acids folding in nearly infinitely many combinations can form countless biomolecular machines, each with specific functions.
This structure is stable at the temperature as we know it. If it gets any hotter, the protein denatures. If it gets colder, the reactions are too slow. </p>
<p>Furthermore, as you know, water is a very important for life. It's a nearly universal solvent, it's very viscous and thus provides easy transport, and it helps with reactions. Water has a very narrow temperature range where it's a liquid, between 0-100C. So it happens that life thrives at temperatures between those two ranges. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
