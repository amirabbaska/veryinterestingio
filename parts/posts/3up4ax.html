			<a href="/posts/3up4ax" onclick="return false">Why is everything so cold? Why is absolute zero only -459.67F (-273.15C) but things can be trillions of degrees? In relation wouldn't it mean that life and everything we know as good for us, is ridiculously ridiculously cold?</a>

I cant even take this number seriously, its so hot. But then absolute zero, isn't really that much colder, than an earth winter. I guess my question is, why does life as we know it only exist in such extreme cold? And why is it so easy to get things very hot, let's say in the hadron collider. But we still cant reach the relatively close temp of absolute zero?</p>
<p>Edit: Wow. Okay. Didnt really expect this much interest. Thanks for all the replies! My first semi front page achievement! Ive been cheesing all day. Basically vibrators. Faster the vibrator, the hotter it gets. No vibrators no heat. </p></div></div>
