		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fruit:  </p>
<ul>
<li>1 apple -- 95 calories, 19g sugar, 4.4g fiber, 14% DV vit C  </li>
<li>1 orange -- 45 calories, 9g sugar, 2.3g fiber, 85% DV vit C  </li>
<li>1 cup grapes -- 62 calories, 15g sugar, 0.8g fiber  </li>
<li>1 banana -- 105 calories, 14g sugar, 3.1g fiber, 17% vit C and 20% vit B6  </li>
<li>1 pear -- 102 calories, 17g sugar, 6g fiber  </li>
<li>1 peach -- 59 calories, 13g sugar, 2.3g fiber  </li>
<li>1 <del>cup</del> wedge watermelon -- 85 calories, 17g sugar, 1.1g fiber, 31% vit A, 37% vit C  </li>
<li>1 cup cranberries -- 46 calories, 4g sugar, 4.6g fiber, 22% vit C</li>
</ul>
<p>All fruits have trace amounts of other vitamins not listed.</p>
<p>EDIT: Someone complained that I was being unfair because I went by standard serving size instead of the same amount of everything.  Purely for argument's sake, here are the values for 1.5 cups of fruit, which roughly equivalent to 12 fluid oz (1.5 standard US cups) of liquid.  Note that this is generally more than a person will eat in one sitting, while a can of soda or 1.5 cups of juice is about what someone would reasonably drink in one sitting.</p>
<ul>
<li>1.5 cups apple  -- 86 calories, 16g sugar, 3.9g fiber, 12% DV vit C  </li>
<li>1.5 cups orange -- 128 calories, 26g sugar, 6.4g fiber, 239% DV vit C  </li>
<li>1.5 cups grapes -- 93 calories, 22g sugar, 1.2g fiber  </li>
<li>1.5 cups banana, sliced -- 200 calories, 27g sugar, 5.8g fiber, 32% vit C, 45% vit B6  </li>
<li>1.5 cups pear, cubed -- 138 calories, 24g sugar, 7.5g fiber, 17% vitamin C  </li>
<li>1.5 cups peach -- 92 calories, 20g sugar, 3.4g fiber  </li>
<li>1.5 cups watermelon, diced -- 69 calories, 14g sugar, 0.9g fiber, 25% vit A, 30% vit C  </li>
<li>1.5 cups cranberries -- 69 calories, 6g sugar, 6.9g fiber, 33% vit C</li>
</ul>
<p>Soda (all 12 fl oz):  </p>
<ul>
<li>Can of Coke -- 140 calories, 39g sugar, no fiber, no vitamins  </li>
<li>Can of Sprite -- 140 calories, 38g sugar, no fiber, no vitamins  </li>
<li>Can of Dr Pepper -- 150 calories, 40g sugar, no fiber, no vitamins  </li>
<li>Can of Mtn Dew -- 170 calories, 46g sugar, no fiber, no vitamins</li>
</ul>
<p>Juice (all 12 fl oz):  </p>
<ul>
<li>apple juice -- 155 calories, 33g sugar, 0.7g fiber, small amount of vitamins  </li>
<li>grape juice -- 229 calories, 55g sugar, 3g fiber, 22% vit C and 20% b6  </li>
<li>orange juice -- 154 calories, 28g sugar, 0.8g fiber, 13% vit A and 283% vit C  </li>
<li>cranberry juice -- 157 calories, 42g sugar, 0.4g fiber, 52% vit C</li>
</ul>
<p>Candy:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Snickers bar -- 215 calories, 20g sugar, 11g fat, trace vitamins  </li>
<li>Single 3g piece hard candy -- 12 calories, 1.9g sugar, no fiber, no vitamins  </li>
<li>3 piece (16g) hard butterscotch candy -- 63 calories, 13g sugar, no fiber, no vitamins (EDIT: found a better source)  </li>
<li>Twix bar -- 286 calories, 28g sugar, 14g fat, 0.6g fiber, trace vitamins</li>
</ul>
<p>For argument's sake, here's 50g of candy across the board.  Note that volume-wise, this is much less than the equivalent in juice, soda, or fruit, which are all mostly water.</p>
<p>Candy (per 50g):  </p>
<ul>
<li>Snickers bar -- 244 calories, 24g sugar, 12g fat, no fiber, trace vitamins  </li>
<li>Hard Candy -- 197 calories, 32g sugar, no fiber, no vitamins (note: more carbs but less &quot;sugar&quot; than butterscotch)  </li>
<li>Butterscotch Candy -- 195 calories, 40g sugar, 1.65g fat, no fiber, no vitamins  </li>
<li>Twix bar -- 251 calories, 24g sugar, 12g fat, 0.6g fiber, trace vitamins</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the calories and sugar content in fruit is a lot lower than what's in soda, juice, and candy, and all fruits have both fiber and vitamins.  Soda has no vitamins, and while juice is better in that it has some vitamins and fiber, it's worse in that they usually dump a bunch of extra sugar into it.  Chocolate candy has a lot of fat, no fiber, and very few vitamins, while hard candy or fruit candy is basically pure sugar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well look at it this way: sugar, and foods that turn into sugar like carbs, all break down to the same thing, glucose, or food for your cells.</p>
<p>The problem isn't what they become, it's how long it takes them to get there. Take a fruit for example. You're not eating just straight sugar, you're eating a lot of other components with it, like the fibrous material an orange is made out of. Your body digests it all at once, but the sugar in the fruit is tempered by the rest of the material in the fruit, causing the distribution of sugar in your blood to rise gradually instead of all at once with, say, soda or candy. The gradual increase allows the body to use the sugar as fuel without the blood sugar level rising too high too quickly, something that would trigger the release of insulin into the blood to lower the sugar level of the blood. Insulin is the body turning sugars into fats, storing them for use later instead of right now. So, if you make a habit of eating food filled with sugars, especially processed sugars which are much more potent than natural sugars (hard candy vs apple, which is sweeter?), your body releases insulin much more often, turning more sugars in your blood to fats to compensate and keep your body in balance. Foods higher in sugar are more easily and more quickly converted into fat when they don't have something else (like fiber) to balance out how quickly they're absorbed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at it this way, sugars all have the same problem; they're not good for you in excess. Doesn't matter if they come from fruit or sugar cane, basically a problem in large amounts. You can pick up a apple, and feel satiated, because you're ingesting the sugar from it with a bunch of dietary Fibre. Most adults would eat one or two apples and feel good. As soon as you process it, it's a different story. You grab a glass of juice, which has been extracted, and all of the Fibre removed. It takes, say, 5-7 whole apples to produce that glass of juice. So in effect you're ingesting 500-700% the quantity of sugar because that food choice is processed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Another important thing to recognize is the act of chewing and what signals are produced as a result. The time it takes to eat an apple is significantly longer than the time it takes to eat a mars bar. You have to bite off chunks of apple, and then chew and chew. All this chewing takes time which will leave you with a stronger feeling of fullness afterwards. </p>
<p>One reason why people overeat is because there is a significant delay between food in the stomach and a feeling of fullness. About 20minutes or so. So anything you can do to make the process of eating take longer will help your body register that you have in fact ingested food. That's why an apple which has less calories and less sugar than a mars bar will leave you feeling fuller for longer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sugar is sugar.  &quot;Healthy&quot; sugar is a subjective statement and a marketing tactic.  You benefit from the fiber and vitamins in fruits, but the intake of sugar is what the real factor is.  Too much sugar intake in any food is unhealthy.  Soda is deemed unhealthier because it has concentrated sugar and lots of it.   Ketchup has a huge concentration of sugar, yet people squirt loads of it all over their fries and eggs.  Fruit roll ups and dried fruits still have sugar.  The bottom line is monitor your sugar intake by looking at labels and finding out which fruits have more sugar content vs others.  Fruit juice and Fruit drinks are just as loaded with sugar compared to some energy drinks.  Honey and agave nectar are still broken down into sugars.  There is no healthy sugar.  Your daily intake is what matters and the higher concentrations that you put into your body at one specific time can cause your insulin level to react at a different rate therefore putting you at risk for diabetes.  Feel free to correct any inaccuracies.
Also the factor of rate at which we metabolize sugars is a big part of the formula.  An unhealthy sedentary lifestyle of constant consumption of processed foods including concentrated sugars  in soda, fast foods, and candy puts a person at a higher risk for diabetes and heart disease vs an active lifestyle of a runner consuming simple sugars from fruits and energy drinks who will metabolize those sugars faster and thererfore be at less risk for diabetes and heart disease.
Thats my take on it.  imo</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
