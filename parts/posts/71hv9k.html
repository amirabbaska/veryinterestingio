		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Will try to do justice to the name of the subreddit and keep things simple. </p>
<p>Catalonia has its own language which is called Catalan. It is one of 4 official languages in Spain, the others being Basque (Euskera), Galician, and Castillian (Spanish).  </p>
<p>For about 10 years, Catalonia's government has been lobbying the Spanish government for greater autonomy both economically and culturally (i.e. the right to collect their own taxes, the right to use the Catalan language in any context they please). It is important to remember that most important taxes in Spain are levied by the national (federal) government. This contrasts with the United States, whose citizens pay considerable taxes to local and regional (state) governments. This is why you often hear Catalans claiming that they pay a disproportionate share of federal taxes -- because the whole country pays into a pool and it then gets divied up based on need. Catalonia, as a top earner, does indeed get back less than what it puts in.
However, these statistics have been politicized by both pro- and anti- independence camps and often what you hear is an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Spain's government, run by the &quot;Popular Party&quot;, is traditionalist and conservative. They are pro-Spanish unity and many of its party members have made (intentionally or unintentionally) offensive statements through the years regarding Catalonian language and culture. This is especially sensitive due to Spain's history as a dictatorship and the linguistic and cultural oppression that took place under Francisco Franco. The national government's comments and attitudes have predictably poured fuel on the pro-independence fire, a movement currently enjoying more momentum than ever before due in large part to the national government's intransigence.</p>
<p>In 2010, a constitutional court ruling upheld most of a previously ratified law that granted more autonomy to Catalonia. In 2012, on Catalonia's National Day, between 1 and 2 million people took to the streets to protest Popular Party's recent electoral victory. The party had opposed the aforementioned law and had tried to kill it on appeal. Shortly after these protests, then-regional Catalan government leader Artur Mas called a snap election, whose results would implicitly give or deny his government a mandate to initiate a process that would ultimately result in secession. Although Mas's own party unexpectedly lost 12 seats, overall there were more pro-independence parliamentarians post-election than there previously had been, and momentum continued to build. </p>
<p>Later, in 2015, another regional election produced a precarious coalition of Catalan parties known collectively as Junts Pel SÃ­ -- Together For Yes -- again with an implicit mandate to continue the march towards independence, this time with the promise of a referendum. Spain's 1978 constitution does not contain any explicit clauses on the right to self-determination and the national Spanish government has based (most of) their opposition to the referendum on that.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Civil Guard, a national Spanish police force whose organizational structure largely resembles that of a military, arrested 14 Catalans on suspicion of taking part in the preparation and organization of what the national government considers a rogue, illegal referendum. As you can imagine, many Catalans consider these people political prisoners, while many Spaniards consider them to be illegally in defiance of constitutional law. People then took to the streets to protest their detentions and congregated around a Civil Guard building, essentially trapping them inside and forcing local Catalan police forces to provide them safe passage. This was the first time that the Spanish government took a REAL swing at the pro-independence movement. Things are tense here right now, hope this provides a bit of background as to why. </p>
<p>What can be done to de-escalate? It's not clear that anything could be done at this point, although a complete about-face by the national government would certainly shock people and could potentially jump-start a new, more civil dialogue. Another possibility is that the October 1 referendum clearly lacks a mandate due to lacklustre turnout and/or a clear bias of pro-independence voter participation. Poor turnout is possible not because the measure lacks support, but because the national government seems to have actually succeeded in derailing preparation for the vote by confiscating ballots and engaging in other forms of sabotage. Moreover, and to be fair, the lack of clarity regarding the referendum's constitutionality means that many, if not most voters inclined to vote &quot;No&quot; will stay home -- a half-assed boycott of sorts.  Personally, I believe that after yesterday's escalation the Catalan government is now determined to go through with independence as long as the Yes vote wins, regardless of turnout or perceived illegitimacy of the results.</p>
<p>Edit: grammar and shit yo!</p>
<p>Edit2: It has been pointed out that Basque Country enjoys federally sanctioned financial privileges that no other &quot;autonomous community&quot; in Spain enjoys, and this is absolutely true. This is important, I suppose, insofar as it means there is a precedent for the financial &quot;autonomy&quot; many Catalans have been advocating for years, and since most Spaniards consider Basque privilege to be the result of separatism. However, the history of these two regions could hardly be more different, and Basque Country's special status was hard-won.</p>
<p>Edit3: It has also been correctly pointed out by u/Portarossa that here in Barcelona, at least, more than a handful of people are totally lukewarm about the entire &quot;Catalan Question&quot; as the press here refers to it. While there is plenty of blame to go around about how we got to this seemingly avoidable juncture, both people in favor and against independence are often willing to acknowledge that it is the national government who too many times fumbled the ball while it was in their court. While they claim now that their door has always been open, in 2012 Catalan leader Artur Mas traveled to Madrid expressly to negotiate a &quot;Fiscal Pact&quot; for Catalonia. Behind closed doors, it is likely that Rajoy simply told Mas that his hands were tied by Angela Merkel's austere fist. Moreover, Popular Party indeed benefits electorally when perceived to be promoting Spanish unity and a strong federal state. The point here is that yes: to people on the ground, it seems as though this crisis could have potentially been averted if only Madrid had done more to assuage extremism early on, instead of creating more of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spain used to be lots of independent regions each with their own King or Queen. Each had their own dialect or language, usually descended from Latin. In the case of Catalonia this was Catalan.</p>
<p>In the 15th Century Catalonia became part of Spain after a royal marriage united two kingdoms.</p>
<p>Later in the 20th Century Catalan language and culture was suppressed and forbidden by the dictatorship in Spain.</p>
<p>Since the end of the dictatorship, Catalonia has gained more freedom, and schools in Catalonia are taught exclusively in Catalan. However due to immigration from other parts of Spain and elsewhere, 47% of the population speak Spanish as their native language while 37% speak Catalan as their native language.</p>
<p>Some people have started asking for Catalonia to be an independent country, because they feel that Catalonia has its own separate culture and language, and also because it has a stronger economy than some poorer regions in the south of Spain.</p>
<p>The Catalan regional government has arranged a series of referendums to ask the population if they want Catalonia to be an independent country. The first one was in 2014 and the next one is due on 1st October 2017.</p>
<p>The Madrid government and court have declared these referendums as illegal. This is because they say that the Spanish Constitution doesn't allow any region to hold a vote on independence, and also because the Madrid government has not given permission. When the Catalan politicians continued with the referendums, the central government and police have raided offices of the regional government, and seized ballot papers from a warehouse.</p>
<p>The vote held in 2014 was non-binding, however the Madrid government still called it illegal. However the Catalan government says it will declare independence within 48 hours of a &quot;yes&quot; vote. This may have contributed to rising tensions and a strong reaction from Madrid.</p>
<p>Regarding your last question, about how the situation can de-escalate: it's worth noting that the turnout in 2014 was quite low, and since I said that there are more native Spanish speakers than native Catalan speakers in Catalonia, I don't think it's likely that a true majority of the population would support independence. However Catalan speakers are more likely to vote in the referendums than Spanish speakers, especially given that the referendum is not &quot;official&quot; according to the central government. If the turnout is low again I don't think that the Catalan government would declare independence, so the tension may deflate slightly in that case. However there is a possibility of tensions getting higher with the police making more raids and arrests against the organisers of the vote.</p>

<p>edit: I removed reference to universities as university teaching is in <a href="http://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/sites/llengues/presentacio/index.html" target="_blank">both Catalan and Spanish with Catalan as the primary administrative language</a></p>
</li>
<li>edit 2: Source for my claim about Catalan being forbidden during the dictatorship: &quot;The fascist regime that emerged triumphant from the civil war in 1939 did everything in its power to stamp out the official and private use of Catalan. Harsh penalties were imposed for speaking it.&quot; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/22/catalan-language-survived" target="_blank">Article in the Guardian</a></li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a long time, Catalonia and Spain have lived in the same farm. The relation is not always easy.</p>
<p>Catalonia likes to do things in her own particular way. Catalonia also has felt that Spain has not treated her fairly sometimes. Because of this, Catalonia has already has said a few times &quot;enough is enough, let's make a fence and separate the farm into two parts&quot;. But things always chilled down eventually.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Spain has reacted to Catalonia's oddities in different ways: sometimes being totally cool about it, sometimes facepalming (&quot;Why do you always have to be so difficult, Catalonia!?&quot;), but sometimes being really really awful to her (sometimes even hitting her).</p>
<p>What is going on now with them, you ask? Well, this is my opinion... A few years ago, Catalonia did some stuff called Estatut, but Spain didn't like it, and changed what Catalonia had done. This made Catalonia quite angry, and the idea of leaving came back to Catalonia's mind once more. So far, it's the same old story, but...</p>
<p>Things in the farm were not going well. At all. Actually, it was going pretty awfully and money was becoming a big issue. When there is no money, things become more difficult and people get angry at each other for the tiniest reasons. As you can imagine, Spain and Catalonia were both in a terrible mood by now.</p>
<p>So for a few years, it's been &quot;I am leaving!&quot; &quot;No you're not&quot; &quot;YES I AM&quot; &quot;NO YOU'RE NOT&quot;. Catalonia is maybe not making the smartest choice, after all there are advantages sharing the farm and sometimes she and Spain get along very very well. But Spain is being very nasty about it, not even listening to Catalonia most of the time, and often calling her names and being very rude to her.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Catalonia said that she's going to decide if she's leaving or not, and she is not going to consider at all what Spain has to say. Spain got really pissed, and is now standing with a baseball bat right by Catalonia's door. Everyone, including Catalonia, Spain and the neighbors, are really confused. Everyone, including Catalonia, is wondering if she will really leave. Everyone, including Spain, is wondering if Spain will hit Catalonia.</p>
<p>It really is very sad they can't get along, be it in the same farm or in separate ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was in Barcelona this past October and made the egregious error of wishing a bar full of Catalonians a &quot;feliz dia de espaÃ±a&quot; as I walked in. Every single conversation in the bar immediately stopped and every guy in the bar turned to glare at me. Sensing the awkward shift in mood, I turned to the bartender with the international symbol for  &quot;huh?&quot; - shrugged shoulders, elbows in, palms up.
.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had been frequenting the bar for the past week and had become friendly with the owner, who understood I was just an idiot American, ignorant with regard to the local history who meant no ill will. He stepped in and filled me in on why what I said was not well received. I gradually realized just how bad my faux pas really was. This would be akin to walking into an IRA bar during The Troubles and shouting &quot;God save the Queen!&quot;. I decided I wanted to have more friends than enemies in Catalonia so I bought a drink for the entire bar and apologized to everyone there individually. Fortunately for me, it was a small bar! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They tried to make a referendum on November 9th, 2014, had some problems with the State not allowing it to be legal, so the result was considered unclonclusive.</p>
<p>So the parliament went on to an <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plebiscite" target="_blank">plebiscitary</a> election with new parties, so that they could do a legit vote, one party was big for the Yes to become independent, others didn't play the game, others said maybe, etc.</p>
<p>After winning, but not by much, the Yes party, instead of declaring independence (They couldn't because they didn't feel legitimized enough), promised to hold a real referendum in 18 months.</p>
<p>The 18 months are almost over, and the president and catalan government, settled on a date for the referendum: <a href="http://ref1oct.eu" target="_blank">the October 1st, 2017</a>.</p>
<p>The law allowing that event passed at the beggining of september (and suspended the day after), the president promised to be independent by the 2nd if the Yes wins, or call up an election if the Yes loses.</p>
<p>The spanish government, keeps repeating that the law in Spain doesn't allow any kind of referendum nor questioning in any part of Spain, so they call it an illegal referendum that is not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the September 20th 2017, spanish (not catalan) police entered 40 government buildings, bussinesses, arrested 14 government officials, which haven't been yet released with any charges.</p>
<p>Apparently, the orders came by a spanish judge working in Barcelona (the number 13th) following an investigation (started this February?), the police force (clearly mandated by political chiefs) have their holidays temporarily revoked and sent to sleep in three cruise line ship in Barcelona and Tarragona's port.</p>
<p>More than 2000 police riot units have been sent over to control the crowd and &quot;pacify&quot; catalunya, moreover, it appears that their mission is to stop the referendum at almost all costs, as of now, they have aprehended 10 million voting ballots and a much more material.</p>
<p>Two helicopters have also been recently deployed in Catalunya too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
