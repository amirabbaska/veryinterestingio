<p>In my culture, people who get offended at things are seen as the problem over someone saying something offensive (with the exception of racist/sexist/homophobic tirades - things people can't choose) and we don't have protected free speech.</p>
<p>Yet, from an outsiders perspective when looking in at the USA, it seems like different groups of people only agree with free speech when it is their opinions being voiced and to silence people who disagree with them - but doesn't this go against free speech, the same free speech they are using?</p>
<p>I am honestly want to know why this is and how it came to be.</p>
<p>Edit&gt;</p>
<p>Thank you numerous people for pointing out that the constitution only protects the people from the government regulating their free speech. I did not know that but now I do.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Freedom of speech only means that the government cannot take away your right to express your beliefs. Other people may pressure you into not expressing your beliefs.</p>
<p>When you have people who say offensive things and use freedom of speech to defend themselves, they're wrong because the government can still censor anything without social value or anything inflammatory, <del>or anything hateful,</del> etc.</p>
<p>Now, when people in America only want their opinions heard and not the other side's, we take it as a normal day. It's primarily because the US has been a country of combative ideals since the beginning, so people get really emotional over a lot of things.</p>
<p>Edit: My bad, hate speech is not restricted unless inflammatory. Inflammatory speech is subject to the Brandenburg test, and so may or may not be restricted. &quot;without social value&quot; applies only to <del>offensive</del> expression, and is especially relevant when discussing the Court's opinions on pornographic content.</p>
<p>Edit 2: &quot;without social value&quot; is for <em>obscene</em> expression, generally pornographic in nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, free speech is enshrined in the Constitution. The government cannot privilege any religion or school of thought over another, it cannot restrict the press, and it cannot put people in jail for saying whatever they want (with limits -- you can get in trouble for speech that incites violence, for slander, for fraud/perjury, or for causing danger by, for example, yelling &quot;FIRE!&quot; in a theater just to incite panic, not because there's really a fire). </p>
<p>So basically, legally, you can say or write whatever the heck you want as long as you're not lying under oath, lying for financial gain, or lying to incite a chaotic or dangerous situation. </p>
<p>As for people taking offense, well, America has a very long, complicated, and often ugly history of prejudice against all sorts of people. People are understandably touchy about a lot of things as a result of that history, though I'd agree that sometimes it does get taken a little too far. The time when people would brutally lynch black men for looking sideways at a white woman wasn't too long ago. There are still Japanese-Americans alive today who remember spending World War II in camps in the Mojave Desert (George Takei, for one). We're still trying to deal with a lot of very hateful attitudes and mindsets, and so when people get offended by things and want them eliminated, it's a part of that larger societal shift. It can be a bit heavy-handed sometimes, but I think that it's not necessarily an evil thing. </p>
<p>The other thing is that allowing everyone to have nearly unrestricted freedom of expression means that you get every shade of opinion imaginable, and extreme opinions tend to be the loudest, or, alternatively, the squeakiest wheels get the grease, so when an extreme or just very offensive thing is said, the offended people, unable to use the law to stop hateful things from being said, must use public pressure instead. </p>
<p>Without taking sides in the issue, it's basically self-policing by society, since the law says that you can say and believe whatever you want. </p>
<p>And if you want my actual opinion, I abhor hateful speech and I can get offended by things people say, but I also recognize that they have every right to say them, but on the flip side, I have every right to tell them why I think they're wrong. So it evens out in the end. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have thought about this one for a long time and it boils down to this... imho...</p>
<ol>
<li>Internet culture. To explain, I don't think anyone knew what the internet would be capable of. We all used it, but for the time (early 2000s) there wasn't  lot of communities.</li>
<li>Enter the age of the internet war sometime after 2005. Websites began having social conflicts between users stealing memes. I think the main of this conflict was Reddit, Tumblr, and 4Chan. Reddit was also just going through the Digg migration.</li>
<li>The meme wars escalate with the parallel rising of third generation feminism, social justice warriors, and flooding Facebook with political garbage during the first Obama presidential run.</li>
<li>Once politics got involved in the content wars, everything turned into a culture war fuel by proto versions of SJWs, Black Lives Matter, Alt-Right, etc. The biggest issues that still plague the culture was is hyperbole (over exaggerations).</li>
<li>Media saw this as marketable during the years of Obama's presidency and over time it just got worse. That's why we have seen large media shaken a ton after Trump. &quot;Fake News&quot; has made a huge wrinkle in media for every one because we really don't know who to trust anymore.</li>
<li>Finally, Poe's law, going back to hyperbole. This law essentially defines how people cannot tell parody from extremism which is dangerous. 4Chan parodied social movements a ton but only their worst qualities. Over time, these jokes that are usually going around the net as memes, lose their source. They may get picked up by actual extreme or fringe members of movements, and bam, you get a group of people who accidentally believe bullshit because they think its their &quot;team's&quot; bullshit.</li>
<li>HOW DOES THIS ALL LEAD UP TO LIMITING SPEECH -- The thing about the social movements going on today is they have a good message. End racism, bring about equal rights for all sexes and beliefs, etc. Here is where it gets funny.</li>
<li>The rise of people against free speech -- the social movements mentioned above have the belief that the way we talk about things perpetuates the kinds of changes they want to see in the world. Things have gotten pretty bad where now in New York you can be fined for not referring to someone by their pronouns. People are choosing self censorship to avoid getting in trouble, but it's sometimes like bending over too much for these crybaby extremists. Thing is, again, no one wants to get in trouble. Especially with a group of people who have been known to seek you out just to make you lose your job or something. The American government cannot easily destroy free speech but I do feel there are powers that recognize a way to limit it by influencing our culture and it appears to be working.</li>
<li>The ultimate blame is identity politics. People who believe they are owed something or have a right to something just by merit of their identity. Thing is, we all have an identity that we use to define who we are to be shared with other people. The issue became using this identity to get special treatment. Universities and public schools facilitated identity politics to create rules because they don't want trouble from parents or losing students. Now, identity politics is a real power to be feared by people who live under the policies.</li>
<li>Tribalism by identity politics -- the real great thing about identity politics and I suppose you could say, identity psychology, is right now it's divided people. You pick teams that match your beliefs. Political leanings, race, sex, or sexual direction groups. Pages on facebook, content creators, etc. They have grievances with other groups that they occasionally complain about and these complaints, existing in the group, make <strong>echo chambers</strong>. An environment where an idea get repeated too much and grows in its communal pathos, ethos, and logos. The thing is, they also tend to go unchallenged because of what can be arguably seen as &quot;Over Moderation&quot;. Have an opposing view? BANNED. DELETED. HIDDEN. Then you post &quot;Some people these days. Crazy [descriptor here].&quot; And its championed.
Frightening stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a crazy multifaceted issue that is still developing today.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I imagine an outsider's perspective is going to be very limited to what the media is telling them - on reddit, I frequently see things about 'PC' and everything <em>but</em>, in real life, in my daily routine, with the people I ever speak to, I've never once met someone who'd advocate any legal restrictions on speech which is what I imagine you're implying (because if you just mean &quot;some people are touchy and wish everyone would talk how they want&quot;, well, that's just a childish behavior that's inherent in many humans, no matter what country you consider)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an American, that right to free speech protects my right to tell you something you said was offensive as much as it protects your right to say it. It basically boils down to the old &quot;sticks and stones&quot; argument, with a few exceptions such as extreme and inciteful hate speech and <a href="http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/May-June-2002/scene_rosen_mayjun2002.html" target="_blank">fighting words</a>.</p>
<p>The big thing that most American students learned about (in terms of free speech and the first amendment) is <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/aclu-history-taking-stand-free-speech-skokie?redirect=free-speech/aclu-history-taking-stand-free-speech-skokie" target="_blank">the KKK marching in Skokie Illinois</a>. Obviously, the nature of their expression is noxious and anti-social - but distasteful is not <em>illegal</em>. So they marched, requiring police protection to keep the substantially more numerous anti-KKK crowds from expressing their distaste illegally (physically). The important concept behind all of this is that you can say whatever you want, but I can think whatever I want about it and tell you as much; basically, intelligent, thoughtful people have nothing to fear from a person spreading falsehoods or socially unacceptable theories...</p>
<p>...And given the dearth of intelligent, thoughtful people in the US at this point, maybe the concept is also a little anachronistic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
