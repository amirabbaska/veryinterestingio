Sure enough a few times a year one would close, only to be replaced a couple weeks later by a new one. Recently I've seen the same thing happen to another shop in a different area. Is frozen yogurt that bad of a business that they can't last long? If so, why do people keep starting them up again? Or is it just a really great short-term business model, then they cash out and go?</p></div></div>
