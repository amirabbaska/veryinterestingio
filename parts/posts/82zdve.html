		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lab grown meat is just muscle. By contrast, conventional meat is muscle plus connective tissues, fats, blood, salts, etc. Those other components are really important to the experience of eating meat. Blood supplies nutrients like iron which contributes colour and flavour. Connective tissues get converted to collagen during cooking and make meat gelatinous and rich. Fats lubricate meat when its chewed and also provide important flavours and nutrients.</p>
<p>Lab grown meat can be supplemented with some of these things to compensate for what it lacks. Those could be grown or synthesized in a lab separately. The science still has a long way to go. As I understand, there isn't really a way to scale the cell production yet, they just make lots and lots of small petri-dish sized cell cultures and mash them together to make a burger. That takes a lot petri dishes, waste, and money. As a result, I'd also expect the texture of lab grown meat to be very short. Muscles in animals are long strings of cells that can span the entire muscle. Lab grown meats are made up of much smaller subunits that don't string together in the same way. It'll work for burgers which are restructured meat products but it's going to be a lot harder to simulate a tenderloin.</p>
<p>Lab grown meat would arguably be cleaner than some conventional meat on the market which, like most food, can contain environmental contaminants like dioxins or heavy metals. The lab gives a lot more control than the feedlot. Nutritionally they could be identical. I think the high cost of lab grown meat is probably making digestion studies prohibitive but I would doubt there'd be much of a difference between conventional meat protein and lab grown protein. There could be significant differences in iron digestibility however as the structure of iron in muscle tissue is very important for its digestion. Depending on how lab grown meat iron is structured, there could be different absorption kinetics.</p>
<p>Edit: To add and address some questions below:</p>
<p>1) Lab grown meat would probably be microbiologically sterile. It would however be very easy to contaminate in packaging, prep, and storage. I don't see any reason why you couldn't eat it raw but the technology is still a long way from producing anything more sophisticate than a hamburger. Without a lot of the minor components that are present in true meat, uncooked and unseasoned lab grown meat will likely be quite bland.</p>
<p>2) It is still going to be mostly water by weight, as most things are.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Something else interesting! There is some debate about the kosher status of lab grown meat and <a href="https://ohr.edu/5518" target="_blank">here's</a> a fairly lengthy halachic discussion for the stronghearted. If the initial cell comes from a kosher animal, the meat should be kosher too. Moreover, the opinion seems to be that it would be considered pareve meaning it's neither meat nor dairy. This opens the possibility for a kosher cheeseburger, just with a very large price tag.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Working on meat production as an undergraduate research analysis thing.
Muscular stem cells are used to grow fibers and a company called Memphis meats has made a somewhat cheap (when compared to the first lab to produce one) edible product.
The first product produced was edible but it wasn't tasty and it's texture was all off. A key obstacle to this is that muscular cells have a distinct meshwork and the in-vitro meats were not able to produce this. Also, much of the meat flavor and tenderness comes from reactions that occur after death. A series of enzymes break down the tissues yielding a more flavorful and tender meat than simply adding fat to lab produced meat.
You will get to experience for yourself within the near future as a lab will have a product comparable in price ($30-$50) a pound within 20 years!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grass fed beef is toted as nutritionally superior to soy and grain fed beef. How does lab grown meat fit into that sort of equation? I’m not sure on the specifics of grass-fed beef in terms of nutrient differences but would there be a way to simulate that sort of diet?</p>
<p>Is it really just a matter of pumping in the vitamins and omega fat ratios or whatever? You know how they say a multivitamin isn’t the same as a well balanced diet, or something like Soylent  — would that sort of logic apply in this case? Is it arrogant to assume we’re really replicating the meat in its nutritional entirety?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several people have commented that the lab grown meat would not contain environmental contaminants but it is important to note that not all of these &quot;contaminants&quot; are bad. </p>
<p>There is a clear taste difference based on what food and animal was raised on prior to being slaughtered. So relatively small levels of &quot;contaminants&quot; seem to carry through into the end product and affect the taste.</p>
<p>Farm raised salmon is very different from wild in terms of taste, colour and consistency and I understand a lot of that is based on their diet, but also based on how much the muscles move during their growth.</p>
<p>Lab grown meat would have a &quot;diet&quot; as well (first law of thermodynamics) so it would likely be very difficult to make it taste &quot;identical&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
