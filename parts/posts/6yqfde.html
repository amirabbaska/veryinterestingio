		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, why are your teeth non-white? That's because they have colored organic molecules in them (seems that there are different ways of how they get in there, from natural development of your teeth to smoking, not really important here). Organic molecules colors can be explained in terms of MO theory by saying that it's because they have HOMO-LUMO excitations that lie in the visible spectrum. Those tend to be due to extended p-systems (can't type letter pi from the ipad, sorry), because visible light is quite low-energy, compared to a typical organic chemical bond. So basically, you need a series of conjugated p-bonds. </p>
<p>Now, we want to whiten your teeth. Chemically speaking, we need to break those colored molecules into parts, or otherwise break the conjugated p-system by reacting with it. And we're in luck, p-systems tend to be relatively reactive. Hardly surprising, since relatively low MO excitation energy was a prerequisite! The reagent of choice is hydrogen peroxide. It is delivered by diffusion into/through the enamel (either applied directly, or made in situ from carbamide peroxide). Peroxide dissociates into free radicals, which are highly reactive, and break chromogens in the teeth. Voila, your teeth are somewhat whiter. Sometimes, light is used to induce those reactions (generally speaking, light tends to stimulate reactions that involve free radicals). </p>
<p>This descriptions is rather generic, but keep in mind that this question is not all that well researched yet. You can easily google some papers on the subject for more details. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
