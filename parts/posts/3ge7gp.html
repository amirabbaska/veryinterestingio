Im not talking about the after regret of it since I know about that but what causes our brains to be alright with something when we're horny that we wouldn't normally be alright with? And then after an orgasm go back to thinking &quot;Yeah never mind&quot;</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of your limbic system. It's the more animal part of your brain that controls optimal urges, like hunger, or sex. It's responsible for your fight or flight urges as well. It resides in the back of your head.</p>
<p>Meanwhile your prefrontal cortex, located in your forehead, is more responsible for logic and reasoning, as well as houses your morals, or your decisions about what you are and what you want to be, and behavior that is okay, and other behavior that isn't.</p>
<p>The more &quot;in charge&quot; the limbic system becomes, the less ability your prefrontal cortex has to apply reason. </p>
<p>And as you start down the road of sexual arousal your brain floods with chemicals, like dopamine, which reward your behavior and makes you want more. And it feeds into your more limbic desires. At some point it takes complete control and you may lose all rational thought momentarily.</p>
<p>But after orgasm your body releases tons of chemicals, some of which counteract the dopamine high you were previously on, and prefrontal cortex logic and reasoning are restored. This can lead to the feelings of guilt or shame if you went outside your normal boundaries that your prefrontal cortex decided you wouldn't previously. And it can make you even feel scared that you lost control (depends on the individual, the stronger your prefrontal cortex the stronger these feelings may be).</p>
<p>And it could also be that a momentary loss of control feeds into the feelings of pleasure. For some people, who feel a need to be in constant control, that moment when you feel &quot;it's okay&quot; to lose control let's out some pretty wild stuff. It's why BDSM is a thing. And more extreme stuff too. It's also why you see stories about autoerotic asphyxiation, people like losing control, and add to that the high feelings of oxygen deprivation, and they feed into it so much that they push it a little too far. I mean your prefrontal cortex isn't going to try and kill you. But your limbic system might if it got animal enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically the same as the question posted here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3gcxnf/eli5why_cant_men_easily_continue_with_intercourse/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3gcxnf/eli5why_cant_men_easily_continue_with_intercourse/</a></p>
<p>And it's a little different for males and females, at least where homo-sapiens are involved. But the answer is because you want the best chance at pro-creating, which means the semen must stay in the vagina. And but it's an evolutionary feature. The penis (inside the vagina) is shaped like a piston in a pump. The loss of erection for a male and the dis-interest in continued copulation is intentional; if a male keeps 'thrusting' after ejaculation he will pump all of the semen out of the vagina. Not a good way to have offspring, unless you're the guy who comes in 2nd or 3rd. One male finishes, and on the off-chance the female is still in the mood, available, or whatever, the male starts pumping and the semen from the previous guy gets expelled.</p>
<p>SO! If a guy just keeps hammering away his chances at his sperm making it to the egg are less. Your brain tells you your job is done. Brain: &quot;Good Job, take a break!&quot;
You: &quot;But this seemed like a great time to keep sexing for hours!?&quot;
Brain: &quot;Time to sleep&quot;</p>
<p>There's more to it; in a geological time frame the only real biological reason for sex is for procreation, so after the male ejaculates with one female he is wasting energy.
If you want a GREAT science experiment do this: sex with your wife or girlfriend/boyfriend or whatever, get off, then have A DIFFERENT attractive partner walk in ready to go. Bet you can get it up again in 5 seconds.
It's not that the brains loses interest, it's just that the brain loses interest in the current partner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know right? One minute I'm coked up and nude, contours of my body glistening with goat blood, doing a sort of shimmy-shake crabwalk dance about the room like an erotic, mad little goblin while a thumping bongo rhythm plays and I sing <em>&quot;DAAAAYO, ME SAY DAAYYYO&quot;</em>. </p>
<p>Then my mean bean machine blasts brogurt everywhere as I spin in place (I call it the jizzcopter) and I feel like I'm a werewolf that's just changed back to human wondering what terrible things he's just done. </p>
<p>Semen glows under UV light though, so with a couple UV bulbs the room looks like a planetarium afterward. Silver linings</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/danariely dedicated a chapter in his book &quot;Predictably Irrational&quot; to the influence of arousal on decision making. He used a computer to ask people about their willingness to engage in certain sexual activities (bestiality, incest, date rape, enjoying sex with someone you hate, sex without a condom, etc), and gauged their responses.</p>
<p>Then he did it again when they were fapping, and their answers changed considerably. The chapter was less about the chemical reactions in the brain, and more about the way arousal influences decision making. I'd recommend the book if you have a chance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
