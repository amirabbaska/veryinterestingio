However, these interactions are so rare and weak that they have never been observed, and most of the literature I looked through is basically analyzing astrophysical data to see <em>any</em> evidence of their interaction, and using its non-observation to constrain the cross-section for neutrino interaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neutrinos can interact with each other though as /u/iorgfeflkd said direct neutrino-neutrino interactions (i.e. two neutrinos colliding like protons in the LHC or electrons in the proposed ILC) have obscenely small cross-sections and so are impossible to observe given current technology. </p>
<p>However one current theory is that neutrinos may be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_fermion" target="_blank">Majorana particles</a> which is where a fermion is its own antiparticle, unlike all other currently known fermions which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_fermion" target="_blank">Dirac fermions</a> where the particle and antiparticle are separate. This is measurable in the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_beta_decay" target="_blank">double beta decay</a> where you would have an additional process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_beta_decay#Neutrinoless_double_beta_decay" target="_blank">neutrino-less double beta decay</a> where the two neutrinos interact (annihilate) inside the decaying nucleus and thus all the energy is carried away by the electrons (which are far easier to observe than neutrinos). By measuring the differences in the spectrum of electrons from double beta decay and neutrino-less double beta decay it will be possible to measure the absolute mass of the electron neutrino. This would be possible as you should get two easily distinguishable distributions of electron from the two different types of double beta decay (if your energy resolution is small enough) which will look like <a href="http://www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/eleSpectrum_0vBB_Warwick-e1442867129265.gif" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>Several experiments such as SNO+ and KATRIN are currently trying to measure neutrino-less double beta decay though their sensitivities depend on the mass hierarchy.  </p>
<p>EDIT: check below for corrections to my fuzzy memories of double beta decay experiments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good answers here about direct interactions. Beyond direct interactions, neutrinos can interact based on their flavor, of which there are three types. In large densities, like those emitted from stars, the flavor of a neutrino can impact the flavor of its neighbors through what are called collective effects causing neutrino oscillations. This happens over a longer range than direct interactions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neutrinos are still fermions, which means they have the same exchange interaction as electrons: you can't put two in the same quantum state. For example, in electrons, the interaction prevents electrons from overfilling electron shells in atoms. Practically, such neutrino densities are produced in very limited contexts, such as supernovas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
