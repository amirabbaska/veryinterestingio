<p>&quot;Consider 35 pounds of metal moving at Mach 5.8. Ten shots per minute&quot;</p>
<p>What kind of damage would these do?  Would the kinetic energy cause an explosion?  For that type of projectile what would a current type of TNT/Weapon be in damage potential?  </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have calculated the energies of the projectiles, though for u/SocomTedd: the Mark 7 gun fired explosive shells, whose <em>explosive</em> energies far exceeded the kinetic energy of the projectile (~6000 MJ explosive vs. ~40 MJ kinetic.) The kinetic energy of the projectile, while large, is insignificant compared to the actual payload.</p>
<p>I actually wrote an executive-level summary of railgun physics and their operation for a high-level program manager working for the Navy. (None of this involved classified material.) One potential issue is that railguns tend to use very dense materials for their projectiles, which are liable to penetrate through targets rather than deliver energy to them. This is easily solved by modifying the projectile to <em>scatter many smaller projectiles</em> near the target. </p>
<p>As u/jehan60188 says, 4 MJ/kg is the threshold for railgun superior effectiveness. Once the projectile is fast enough it is more effective to use the kinetic energy of the projectile rather than use (chemical) explosives. As kinetic energy scales essentially without limit with respect to velocity, railguns are inevitably more effective. They are not, <em>yet</em>, more effective, which is what motivates continuing naval research on the subject. </p>
<p>Chemical explosives provide a fundamental limit on the effectiveness of traditional guns, either through explosive or kinetic payloads. (There is a similar limit to the effectiveness of chemical rockets.) Electromagnetic propulsion, on the other hand, suffers from no such limit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The advantage of these isn't so much in the damage they can do. An antiship missile I'm sure can do way more damage. The advantage is that 1) you can store many more rounds, 2) you're not storing explosives, 3) the projectile is harder to track on radar than a burning missile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>15.87 kg at 2000 m/s has a kinetic energy of .5<em>m</em>v*v= 31740000 = 3.174 X 10^7 joules = 31.74  MJ</p>
<p>for reference, TNT has an energy density of ~4 MJ/kg</p>
<p>The real question to ask is what kind of damage this can do.  There's no explosion like with a bomb.  Instead, it's more like a bullet.  I'm not familiar enough with ship construction to do anything besides speculate at this point, which is against the rules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At these speeds, material behaviour is different. Any armour impacted at these speeds is going to behave like a fluid and flow out of the way of he impactor. This creates a problem for opposing ships because you cannot create an armour that can just 'stop' this sort of round. (at least not without completely redesigning the ships and making them weak to conventional damage.)</p>
<p>The rounds will penetrate far into the ships, which at sea is pretty much a nightmare. They don't need to explode since they have enough kinetic energy to create ballistic fragments on impact ( the purpose of explosive shells). Alternatively uranium penetrators could potentially knock through an entire ship.</p>
<p>Another benefits are the ship doesn't store explosives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that is missing from a lot of the other comments are the logistics that railguns enable. I visited General Atomics a few years ago when they were just rolling out the first prototypes of the railgun, and the biggest thing they wanted to brag about was simultaneous-strikes. Using varying firing angles and energy levels, you could fire 6 projectiles that strike the target at the same exact time. </p>
<p>The mechanism works by firing a lower speed projectile at a low angle, then adjusting the angle upwards and increasing fire energy. The resultant effect is that of naval-sized shotgun blast. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
