<p>So, I have lots of questions regarding this, many probably unanswerable.</p>
<p>Could it collide with the moon? How could this affect things like our tides?</p>
<p>How long has it been there? Could this arise in a matter of decades, or has it probably been there for centuries, millennia, or longer?</p>
<p>Could we land our own satellites on it and take advantage of its apparently rather stable orbit?
Would it be affecting our tides or weather at all?</p>
<p>Could we see it with the naked eye, or with any at-home tech, any time soon?</p>
<p>I presume it's unlikely to hit Earth anytime soon, looking at the article. How unlikely?</p>
<p>Could it be mined for minerals?</p>
<p>If anyone educated or experienced in anything related to this has any information, or even any guesswork, related to these questions, or even any more interesting info, I'd love to hear it :) I'm not used to being unable to google something and read pages of information on it, haha!</p>
<p>Feel free to answer just one question, or even provide more info completely unrelated to my questions.</p>
<p>Edit: RIP inbox. My mother always said I ask too many questions for my own good. Who needs Google, anyway?</p></div></div>
