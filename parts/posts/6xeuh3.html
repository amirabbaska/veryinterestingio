		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an anesthesiologist. We monitor body temperature during surgery because anesthesia inhibits your ability to autoregulate temperature. Essentially you are turned into a poikilotherm like a snake, and lose heat to the cold operating room. An inability to contract your muscles prevents you from generating heat. We have a rule of thumb that 1 liter of room temperature intravenous fluids will reduce a patient's body temperature by 0.25 degrees Celsius. We used forced air warming blankets and heated IV fluids to maintain a normal body temperature, which helps the body to metabolize medications predictably and the blood to clot properly. </p>
<p>After reading comments I want to add that the reason I brought up anesthesia here is that only when you remove the body's ability to generate heat can you actually measure a reduction in temperature, unless you infuse the fluid very quickly. When we drink cold fluids, the body generates heat to correct the drop in temperature before an appreciable difference can be measured. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there are some interesting studies out there on this. Many involve rapidly administering cold IV fluids in attempt to show that hypothermia is protective against neurologic injury in situations such as cardiac arrest. </p>
<p>Here is one study: </p>
<p>Ann Emerg Med. 2008 Feb;51(2):153-9. Epub 2007 Nov 28.</p>
<p>They infuse cold and room temperature fluids rapidly in non anesthetized patients and measure a temperature change before compensatory mechanisms (shivering) can restore the body to normal temp. This is better than my rule of thumb as it uses weight-based dosing for IV fluids. Interesting, 30ml/kg of room temp fluid reduced the body core temp by 0.5 Celsius degrees. That would be 3 liters of fluid for a 100kg (220lb) person. Cold fluid reduced the body temp by a full degree Celsius. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Long story in short: There are some heat receptors in stomach helping your body determine sweating and drinking hot beverages may freshen you since you sweat more (and if the place is windy so that your sweat would vaporize, unless you just feel hotter) and drinking cold beverages lessen your sweating after an instant cooling so it depends on the environment. If the place is chilly/windy like in front of a fan, hot drinks better. But most of the time cool beverages are the best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can do a very(!) rough back of the envelope calculation.</p>
<p>Assume a 100kg person (I like round numbers). Assume that they're all water, so we have 100 litres. Assume that they're at body temperature, so about 310 Kelvin.</p>
<p>Now you drink 0.2 liters of ice cold water, 273 Kelvin.</p>
<p>Since both are water, they'll have the same heat capacity and the end temperature will be just a simple weighted average:</p>
<p>T = (100 <em> 310 + 0.2 </em> 273) / (100 + 0.2) = 309.93</p>
<p>so it's almost negligible, like a 0.07 degree drop.</p>
<p>If you wanted to be more accurate, you could use the average specific heat capacity of the human body. I can find it via google, but that would take the fun out of computing it. You'd use a weighted average of the capacity of water (60% of human body is water) and of things like proteins, fat, bones.</p>
<p>It wouldn't <em>drastically</em> alter the equation though, the fact that the drop in temperature would be small will remain. </p>
<p>Like, let's use the factor 0.5:</p>
<p>(50 <em> 310 + 0.2 </em> 273) / (50 + 0.2) = 309.85, so now we're looking at a .15 degree drop. Still negligibly small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC blood temperature is &quot;measured&quot; by the hypothalamus as part of thermal homeostasis.   While a cold drink won't do much to cool the whole body's water content down you do have a good blood supply to the stomach and digestive system. I'd think that the the heat exchange between blood and cold drink in there would drop the blood temperature in the short term and con the brain into thinking the overall body temperature has dropped. </p>
<p>You can get a similar effect by sticking ice or a cold can on your neck near the returning blood supply to the brain. You feel cooler. </p>
<p>Course that's like blowing cold air on the thermostat in your house. Doesn't cool the house down. Just makes the HVAC think it's not needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
