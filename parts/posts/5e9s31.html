They're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index" target="_blank">stock indexes</a>, like the <a href="https://data.oecd.org/price/inflation-cpi.htm" target="_blank">CPI</a>, are more or less, end up being lead indicators of economic growth and inflation (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm" target="_blank">CPI</a>) respectively, while not being the actual numbers.</p>
<p>I assume that this wasn't asking how stocks are speculated, but rather how is that number that is reported with the stock indices calculated.</p>
<p>To answer the last question, though it should be implied by now, the number increases or decreases depending on how the stocks rise or fall that day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a minor point, but the NASDAQ isn't a stock, like OP suggests, it's a market or an index.  The confusion comes from people using it as shorthand.</p>
<p>Like a few other people said, the NASDAQ is a market.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ" target="_blank">Wikipedia article.</a>  Stocks are listed on the NASDAQ market in a bunch of different countries.  It's where &amp; how the actual buying and selling of stock takes place.  This is different than other stock markets, like the New York Stock Exchange, which you've probably heard of, or foreign markets like the London Stock Exchange, or the Japan Exchange Group--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_exchanges#Major_stock_exchanges" target="_blank">there's a bunch here</a>.</p>
<p>But when people say something like &quot;oh, the NASDAQ is up 50 points,&quot; they're referring to the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite" target="_blank">NASDAQ Composite Index</a></strong>.  Different thing, same name.  A stock index is essentially the same as an election poll.  It's just a formula created by financial experts to gauge how a given group of stocks is doing.  Just like a poll, it has a specific set of things it tries to judge &amp; is only as good as the person interpreting the data.</p>
<p>Some other stock indices (aka, not stock markets) you may have heard of are: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average" target="_blank">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index" target="_blank">S&amp;P 500</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225" target="_blank">Nikkei 225</a>.  Those indices all point to different things, and just like a poll of California voters wouldn't tell you what was happening in Michigan, the knowledge you gain from the index is limited to the tool, the method, &amp; the interpretation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The figure doesn't really mean anything on its own, it's an index to measure change over time. When the index started, they decided that the value would be 100. If all the included stocks had risen in value by 10% a month later, the index would have been 110. If they'd all dropped by 10%, the index would have been 90.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I sell oranges in Florida. Another guy sells peaches in Georgia, etc. We fruit sellers check an index every day, a barometer of the fruit business, to see how we are doing collectively at building our businesses and making money (or not). The index was at 1,000 yesterday. Back in grandaddy's day it was just 100. This number by itself means nothing to me, but I'm thrilled because it's up 15 points today (1.5%) which means good things for our businesses overall. </p>
<p>TL;DR: don't get hung up on the number, we in the business care more about where it's been recently and the percentage up and down that it moves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At some day they have taken 50-100-255-any other amount of top companies and calculated the price of this portfolio by one of the methods. Then they said that this price is 100 points. Next day they recalculated the price of portfolio and got another value in points.<br />
In your case it means that NASDAQ index(the portfolio of top stocks on this stock market) costs 500 times more than it was in 1971 when it was calculated first time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
