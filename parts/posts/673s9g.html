		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You will get less done being so sleep deprived than if you would get at least 6 hours. I have seen blood work of 25 year Olds look like 80 year olds with insulin resistance, extremely elevated cortisol, and wacked out endocrine system including thyroid from chronic sleep deprivation. </p>
<p>Great way to die earlier, be more miserable, and destroy your overall performance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is roughly 1/3 the amount of sleep that the average person needs. So you are talking about a massive sleep deficit. This will make your immune system less efficient, will make thinking more difficult do to fatigue, and if done long enough can cause hallucination. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Russell Foster - &quot;Why do we sleep&quot;</p>
<p>Watch that and you'll get an idea what sleep is about.</p>
<p>Please also note three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Naps count. I used to sleep 3-4hrs a night and 3-4 hrs during the day for 3 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brains are different, people need different amounts of sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>People lie. If you're an entrepreneur, it's very effective to lie to your workers and the public about how little you sleep, effectively branding you as a workaholic, thus injecting everyone with the idea of working hard so they can be as rich and famous as you.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few rare people with generic differences that allow them to sleep absurdly less and be fine. That's very rare though. It's best to sleep what feels natural. Otherwise the quality of anything you do will drop and you'll end up less productive than if you'd just get a good night sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few things that happen during sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li>the brain generalizes knowledge from concrete knowledge into abstract knowledge</li>
<li>the brain prunes old memories</li>
<li>the brain recycles waste and heals</li>
<li>the heart gets to beat slower and giving it a chance to recuperate</li>
<li>the muscles are barely working so they get their excess waste removed</li>
</ul>
<p>To &quot;feel sleepy&quot; there's a neurotransmitter. If you stop sleeping normally eventually your brain just gives up feeling tired because it knows this is the norm and nothing can be done. The brain then starts to compensate. It'll have more of itself asleep at any given time to try to give neurons a break and not die. It'll not give you as much energy to try to recuperate your organs, etc. If you push it you are functioning outside of the normal human operating conditions and the body can only operate like that for so long.</p>
<p>At best you will be at ~60% brain power. You will be dumber, learn slower, more tired, and unhealthy... but awake. You're basically going through insomnia... voluntarily.</p>
<p>Edit: As you get older, you need less rest. An adult can function well on 8 hours of sleep, but a child needs that 10-12 hours of sleep. That's why early bed time for kids is so critical, because they really do need it.</p>
<p>The <em>ONLY</em> exception are people with a special generic condition making them need maybe ~3 hours of sleep a night which is the equivalent to a normal person sleeping for 10 hours. These are about 1 in 100,000 or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
