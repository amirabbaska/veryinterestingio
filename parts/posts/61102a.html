		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Degeneracy pressure is supposedly a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle: if you try to push two electrons into the same state, degeneracy pressure pushes back. It's relevant in for example the r^12 term in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential#Explanation" target="_blank">Lennard Jones potential</a> and it supposedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle#Stability_of_matter" target="_blank">explains</a> why solid objects &quot;contact&quot; eachother in every day life. Pauli also explains <a href="https://gravityandlevity.wordpress.com/2015/04/19/where-does-magnetism-come-from/" target="_blank">fucking magnets and how do they work</a>, but I still have no idea what &quot;force&quot; is there to prevent electrons occupying the same state.</p>
<p>So what on earth is going on??</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks everyone for some brilliant responses. It seems to me there are really two parts of this answer:</p>
<p>1) The higher energy states for the particle are simply the only ones &quot;left over&quot; in that same position of two electrons tried to occupy the same space. It's a statistical thing, not an actual force. Comments to this effect have helped me &quot;grok&quot; this at last.</p>
<p>By the way this one gives me new appreciation for why for example matter starts heating up once gravity has brought it closer together in planet formation / stars / etc. Which is quit interesting.</p>
<p>2) The spin-statistics theorem is the more fundamental &quot;reason&quot; the pauli exclusion principle gets observed. So I guess thats my next thing to read up on and try to understand.</p>
<p>context: never studied physics explicitly as a subject, but studied chemistry to a reasonably high level. I like searching for deeper reasons behind why things happen in my subject, and of course it's all down to physics. Like this, it usually turns out to be really interesing.</p>
<p>Thanks all!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not due to <em>any</em> of them. Like you said, it's just the Pauli exclusion principle, which has nothing to do with any of the four fundamental interactions.</p>
<p>You just can't put two identical fermions into the same quantum state, that is not a possibility. And when you have a thermodynamic system of identical fermions, that inability, or <em>lack</em> of available states manifests as a macroscopic pressure.</p>
<p>You mentioned the Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential, and there's also <a href="http://cdn.iopscience.com/images/1749-4699/1/1/015009/Full/csd280936fig1.jpg" target="_blank">effective nucleon-nucleon potentials</a> which have very hard &quot;cores&quot; attributed to Pauli exclusion of the underlying constituent particles. But that doesn't indicate that the Pauli repulsion is due to these forces, that would be thinking about it in the wrong order. In reality Pauli exclusion is what forces the particles not to come too close to each other, and the way we model that in our effective interaction potentials is to put a hard core into it. The L-J potential and the NN potentials I showed are not fundamental interactions, they're effective descriptions of interactions between many-body systems which are too hard to model from first principles. In very simplified terms, these potentials are &quot;made up&quot; by us to describe what we observe (and fit to data or something so they actually work). And what we physically observe is strongly repulsive behavior at small relative coordinates because of Pauli exclusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I think should be cleared up is that typically when people say &quot;fundamental force&quot; or &quot;proper force&quot; they mean (in very technical terms)</p>
<p>&quot;Mediated by a gauge boson&quot; </p>
<p>However in my opinion this is too restrictive. One could argue we already know of a fifth fundamental force which is the result of Higgs exchange. It just happens to be very short-range and mediated by a spin-zero boson. </p>
<p>Similarly I think you can talk about the PEP as a force, it just happens to be a force with really weird properties. It also doesn't have an obvious classical analogue, but in my opinion that is just fine. Nothing wrong with calling it a force. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, others have mentioned that none of the &quot;four fundamental forces&quot; are responsible for the repulsive effect of the Pauli exclusion principle (in fermions).</p>
<p>But I haven't yet seen anyone at least link to the very relevant Wikipedia article on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_interaction" target="_blank">exchange interaction</a>, which is essentially a more canonical name for the &quot;force&quot; caused by Pauli exclusion.</p>
<p>Note that the exchange interaction is not a &quot;force&quot; in the way the other fundamental interactions are forces ... but it is definitely still a sort of &quot;fundamental interaction.&quot;  So you might say that there are five fundamental interactions: four of them can be described as forces in the classical limit while one of them is a purely quantum effect and has no classical analogue (though in certain cases the net effect can resemble a classical force, such as the neutron degeneracy pressure in neutron stars).</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To bring two electrons together, you need energy. At a certain separation, the wavefunctions of the electrons start to significantly overlap. For the electrons to get closer, they'd need to be in different states. Until you push harder (supply more energy), the electrons are at their maximum spatial density. If you do push harder, you will supply enough energy to push one of the electrons to a higher energy state, which will allow the electrons to get closer together. </p>
<p>Think of a carbon atom. It has six electrons. Why aren't they all 1s electrons? Electromagnetism creates the bound states and pulls all the electrons towards the nucleus, but some electrons hang out farther away from the nucleus in 2s and 2p orbitals. The fact that these higher orbitals are occupied in the ground state of the atom is, in effect, degeneracy pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Degeneracy pressure is in my opinion best understood similarly to an entropic force: as a consequence of whatever more fundamental interaction is confining the particles.</p>
<p>If you try to put a bunch of fermions in some sort of potential well, they cannot all go in the ground state, every new fermion will need to go in some excited state, with corresponding higher energies and momentums. You can see this as more of a statistical phenomenon, arising from the confining force. In the case of the &quot;repulsion&quot; between electrons keeping matter stable, that's the electromagnetic force. In case of neutrons in a neutron star, it's gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
