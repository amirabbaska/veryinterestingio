		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it's because we're the ones in control of the sounds we're making. We can perfectly predict all aspects of it: the rhythm, the timing, the volume, the duration, etc. This is also why we can't deliberately tickle ourselves. Our brains are fully expecting it. </p>
<p>When it's someone else doing it, we have no control over any of it. The irritation comes when our expectations are violated. The rhythm is off. The timing is off. The volume is wrong. It stopped too soon or should have stopped already. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I used to chew ice when I was younger and my older brother would go nuts about how much it bothered him. I did not understand until I had kids of my own and one of them loves to chew ice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say, based on my own questioning of this, is that when I'm doing the tapping, I'm also creating other rhythms in my mind or imagining part of a song.  So the tapping is just part of the symphony.</p>
