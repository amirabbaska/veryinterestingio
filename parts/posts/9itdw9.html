		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In places with seasons, trees go through a predictable growth-dormant cycle that produces the distinctive ring pattern.</p>
<p>Since most of these seasonal trees go dormant regardless of what the actual winter temperature was that year (they're timing the day lengths, not responding to unpredictable temperature swings) a ring is produced even if the year's weather was very unusual.</p>
<p>You get big rings for years with optimal growing conditions and weak rings for drought years.</p>
<p>Rings are less pronounced and more difficult to count in trees that prefer more tropical climates, since they may grow all year instead of stopping entirely on a regular cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When someone plants a tree and cuts it down say 30 years later, they can see the rings correspond with the age. What they can also see is that the rings correspond with the local weather. Now if they then cut down a 500 year old tree next to it, they can see that the outer 30 rings on the 500 years old tree correspond to the 30 year one. This is the basis for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology" target="_blank">dendrochronology</a>, or the science of dating stuff by tree rings. Depending on the location we have a complete tree ring based dating yard stick for centuries (if not millenia) back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might be easier to understand if you think of it as a full cycle of seasons and not exactly a 365 day period.  The rings show more what happens during the growing season that makes up the most of the actual ring.  It grows quite a bit.  The cells appear different (darker in most cases) during the 'off season' and lighter during the time of quicker growth.  This is a cycle that is made up of a year growing quickly in the spring/summer and slowing toward Autumn to winter.  Then repeating.  The rings come as the the tree grows outward all around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the summer, a tree grows fast and in the winter, a tree grows slow. Growing fast leaves a light stripe and growing slow leaves a dark stripe, like how a balloon that is full of air seems to be lighter in color than one that is deflated. The pattern of winter and summer growth, or dark and light stripes, is what gives trees their rings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
