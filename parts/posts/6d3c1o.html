		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is generally believed that people having kids is helpful to a society. It creates the next generation of consumers/taxpayers, for example. </p>
<p>Having kids is also generally costly.  The idea of tax benefits for people who have kids is that it represents an offset of the cost to the individual of having the kids, giving them a slightly larger share of the wider societal benefit of having kids that they can't individually capture. </p>
<p>Marriage is similar, though more debatable and less direct.  There are many who argue that marriages, especially stable ones that produce kids, tend to create &quot;stronger&quot; or better ordered societies.  However, at least in the U.S. so far as I know, most of the tax &quot;benefits&quot; of marriage tend to be more about the weirdness of people having combined incomes---more an after effect then a genuine &quot;incentive.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There aren't tax incentive for married people. If there is a wide range in income between the two, or if one is a stay-at-home parent, then the tax bracket would be different for married couple and they might save. So if you had a husband who made $100k while the wife stayed home, then he'd see lower taxes on his income filing as married than before. But if they each made $50k before getting married, they'd see no difference in taxes filing jointly.</p>
<p>As for kids, there are deductions for each member of the household because presumably it costs more to feed, clothe, house more people so the same person supporting 4 people on $100k pays less in taxes than the single person earning $100k.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You really don't get an objective benefit on taxes for being married. You just file differently. Sometimes that benefits families sometimes it doesn't. The government does this because married people sometimes live off the income their partner makes without generating any themselves. That is not a bad thing but it needs to be handled different.</p>
<p>The tax break for kids is because kids cost money but do not generate money however kids are IMMENSELY valuable to society as a whole because they are the future, literally. The tax break is to try and even the playing field and reward the parents for contributing to the future of the country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Child poverty!</p>
<p>There are three solutions:</p>
<p>1) Watch them die.</p>
<p>2) Give them aid.</p>
<p>3) Help their parents.</p>
<p>In the US, tax filers who make less than $3000 in a year receive no tax credit (they cannot care for themselves or their children independently, so they are assumed to use the care of others or the government).  Tax filers who make more than $150,000 also receive no tax credit.  They are assumed to have enough resources to care for any number of children they may have. Those in between get $1000 credit per child.</p>
<p>When you don't have children, giving you a tax credit does nothing to address child poverty.  It has nothing to do with encouraging fertility.  You will not find parents who decided to have children because they could take advantage of $1000/year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the people that are a little PO'd because it seems like BS that you don't have kids, yet your taxes pay for public school and tax deductions for others:</p>
<p>Remember you were once a kid too, so you go to see these benefits. You are paying the system back. Maybe your parents technically go the deduction, but they had more money that was spent on you as as result. Perhaps looking at it from a different perspective will make you less sour about the matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
