		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, Netflix has quantified viewer interest. They've found a way to use the staggering amount of information gathered from their viewers over the years to pinpoint story concepts, genres, plot elements, directing and cinematic styles that have the best chance of success among their viewers. All of the star ratings, viewing habits, customer demographics, reviews, binge-watching habits for TV shows (and so, measurements of which TV shows keep your attention for the longest span of time), ALL of these factors have been meticulously collected and studied, and they've resulting in some of the biggest hits on &quot;TV&quot; such as Orange in the New Black, Stranger Things, House of Cards, etc.</p>
<p>This doesn't so much answer the question of how they figure how much money each TV shows has made them, but it does give you insight on how they meticulously calculate the financial impact of a TV/movie idea before producing it and releasing it as a Netflix original. Their models have been fairly accurate between projected and actual revenue generated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They also realized that having a well-regarded show led to solid continuing revenue through DVD sales (although that has probably slowed down as streaming has been replacing DVD). Around the early seasons of Game of Thrones, some HBO execs said that if they had had any idea how much money they would make off of DVD, they never would have canceled &quot;Rome,&quot; &quot;Deadwood,&quot; or &quot;Carnivale.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You do a lot of different things to gauge the success of your show, like show the pilot episode to an audience and measure their response, do market research and see what kind of shows people are interested in, what sort of dynamics between characters they're interested in etc.</p>
<p>Other than that you simply have to go with your gut feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As they're always adding and removing and rotating content, they'll measure what's currently available or not available on its library (or things like what's recently been added or removed) against its current subscriber level (is it increasing or is it slowing down, or is there a big spike?). They'll be able to gauge data such as that to see what is making people sign up, cancel, stay a member for a short time, or stay for longer periods.</p>
<p>They test so much stuff that you don't realise. Changing little things like the description or thumbnail image of each movie or show across different users to see which are clicked and viewed most.</p>
<p>It's important to note with the subscription model that it's all about keeping customers for as long as possible, as obvious as that sounds. $10 a month for a subscription account doesn't sound like much but it's Â£120 a year. It's exactly why so many companies, such as Microsoft with its Office suite, or Adobe with their editing suites, have switched to the monthly subscription model.</p>
<p>For any company, all new customers take at least a small amount of time, resources or effort to acquire. It might cost Netflix an average of $10 to attract each new subscriber, so they need to get them to sign up for more than the initial month for that to be profitable for them (just basic example numbers). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HBO and Netflix do not have the same models, and that is important to understand. Netflix has direct subscribers who pull data (videos and playlist) directly from their servers. By categorizing all content and tracking viewer time in each content, they can know what kinds of things you like. This is the same as amazon being able to suggest things to you based on how you use the website and what you actually buy.</p>
<p>HBO, on the other hand, primarily has cable subscribers, where HBO is offered as part of larger packages. Thus, there is an interplay between the cable retailers who bundle and market channels into premium packages, and companies like HBO that actually package the viewing content.</p>
<p>That said, HBO, and all TV station, primarily are informed through home surveys, the Neilson ratings. These can be automated or paper, but basically a sample of the public is always being taken and comments on what they like and do not like. HBO also gets some data such as subscription rates and viewer statistics from regional cable companies, but this is nowhere near as detailed or accurate as what Netflix gets.</p>
<p>These days, the easiest way for HBO (and most companies without the advantage of netflix) to learn what people really like is to data mine the internet. They hire specialist to spend time on social media, figuring out what is popular, which of their products are popular, and also manipulating the market by being part of the conversation and/or inserting advertising.</p>
<p>This strategy works well as the target demographic are more tech savvy. HBO isn't advertising to 70 year olds, and now the average 50 year old can facebook. Still, the use of social media is much more limited in older demographics, so for those, more traditional data collection methods are more appropriate. A show aimed at 40 and younger, internet works very well.</p>
<p>HBO doesn't earn money per show, but rather per subscriber. So, a general sense of popularity is accurate enough. HBO also is realizing the power of content generation, which was not where they started. But in generating content, there certainly are risk. When a a show becomes populary, HBO will milk it for all it is worth, generating long running series. This mitigates the risk of creating or showing less popular material. </p>
<p>Predicting popularity is key, because your investment into building a show is heavily front laoded. So you do lots of research and testing and run ideas and scripts and sample performances by steadily larger samples. This is generalyl never public (sometimes seen on dvd extra material). In any case, once it is broadcast, the question becomes, is the show as popular with everyone as it was with our test audiences. If not, then they will just air the first few episodes (which are generally all paid for and with mostly sunk expenses by the time any announcement of an upcoming show is made.) If it seems popular (lots of people tuning into HBO, lots of talk on the internet) then they run with it. This is also why shows tend to jump the shark. It is easy to run with positive news, but very difficult to catch drops in interest and correct or end a series.  Netflix can more precisely measure interest and so do this a bit better, but they also can simply recommend whatever you like at that day, HBO can not know this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
