		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has nothing to do with the morning or evening. It has to do with your sleep. When sleeping the mucosa in the sinuses and the throat dries up. This causes the stretch. Since you have a cold the nerves are all inflammed and highly sensitive to stretch and pain. Hence you feel like death.</p>
<p>Sipping hot or cold things can relieve this feeling, although due to different mechanisms.</p>
<p>Hot substances when they touch the mucosa they trigger the heat receptors. When the brain is interpreting the heat it forgets to think about the pain. This is called gate theory and is used when we have a hot shower to relieve muscle pain.</p>
<p>When cool fluids are ingested, the mucosa is cooled. Cold can decrease the level of inflammation and this gives us relief. Almost like icing a sore muscle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

One of the reasons people feel so poorly early in the morning (and also at night) has to do with post-nasal drip. You produce a lot of mucus in your sinuses and when you lie flat, it runs down the back of your throat and coats it, making it dry and irritated. This is why people find their cough worse in the evening when they lie down and when they wake up in the morning. Rinsing out your sinuses before bed and in the morning can help alleviate this.                                                                           </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
