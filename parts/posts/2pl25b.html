		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NASA's <a href="http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Office of Planetary Protection</a> has the task of ensuring that spacecraft and landers don't contaminate other planets with Earth organisms. </p>
<p>In the specific case of Curiosity (Mars Science Laboratory), the rover had to undergo &quot;Category IV&quot; procedures. From <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/insituexploration/planetaryprotection/" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary strategy for preventing the transportation of Earth organisms to Mars is to be sure that the hardware intended to reach the planet is clean. The Mars Science Laboratory Rover will comply with requirements to carry a total of no more than 300,000 bacterial spores on any surface from which the spores could get into the martian environment. Many of the techniques for cleaning spacecraft surfaces and then checking them for biological cleanliness have been used successfully for many years and work very well.</p>

<p>Edit: Although, I guess it <a href="http://www.space.com/13783-nasa-msl-curiosity-mars-rover-planetary-protection.html" target="_blank">doesn't always work perfectly</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quick and dumb question, sorry for not making this a child post but couldn't find anyone talking about something like this. </p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> life was eventually found in Mars <strong>and</strong> it was found that either our own lifeforms are threatening to them or that even primitive terraforming efforts (like, idk, mining for things we can turn into H2O) are harmful for this lifeforms, <strong>Who can say/do something about it</strong>? I mean, do national and/or private space agencies have bioethicists? And if they do, do they have any kind of meaningful say in any projects?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have a set protocol for rigorous cleaning of any vessel sent into space, I believe. </p>
<p>On a side note, nothing that we know of could live on Mars anyway. The temperature variations, lack of any form of &quot;traditional&quot; (i.e. earthlike) atmosphere, as well as possibly the chemical makeup of the surface make any form of terrestrian life taking hold or even surviving long enough to reproduce highly unlikely. Not to mention they'd have had to survive during the trip in a vaccum... Even the most resilient extremophiles have certain necessary conditions to prosper.</p>
<p>The biggest risk is that life-forms are brought by Curiosity to Mars, and then Curiosity finds said life-forms, leaving scientists to wrongly conclude about the existence, or possible existence of life on Mars. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
