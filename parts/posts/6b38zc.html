<p>EDIT 2 - so it seems like the large consensus is that they actually do get sick quite a lot!  Although with all the preventative measures outlined below, maybe still not as often as I would expect</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question there.
True that many nurses work around sick people, however not all diseases are “catching”. There are communicable, and non-communicable diseases. I could be taking care of a person recovering from a heart attack, someone fresh out of the operating room, or another with liver problems. It does not mean I would catch their diseases or problems. The trickier part is when there are patients who come in with communicable diseases like the flu, have C-Diff (clostridium difficile, very nasty bug), or even tuberculosis. With communicable cases like these, many facilities require PPE (Personal protective equipment), so we are required to wear gloves, gowns, masks depending on the situation. That, and proper handwashing. </p>
<p>As for the long hours, not all of us work that many hours every day of the week.
This is only a generality and does not apply to all nurses:
12 hour shifts = 36 hours = 3 days on, 4 days off (in a 7 day work week),
10 hour shifts = 40 hours = 4 on, 3 off, for example. </p>
<p>Since the field of nursing is highly variable (not all of us work in a hospital), there are many differences in work environments. Places like school nursing, public health, corrections nursing, forensic nursing, hospital nursing (includes but not limited to ER, OR, ICU, PICU, NICU, CVOR, blood bank, wound care)...</p>
<p>TL;DR., The variety of hours, work environments, and common sense protection like handwashing would be general reasons why nurses don’t get sick as often. That, and we’re often taking care of people in the worst times of their life, so there are some of us who get a +1 immunity boost because we’re helping someone. </p>

<p>EDIT: Wow, many thanks for the gold. Was not expecting that. Thank you again, kind stranger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been an RN for 10 years. I have spent all 10, until recently, working in the MSICU. I would get the common cold occasionally, but not often, until I had a child. Once I had a kid in daycare, I get sick frequently. He brings home more little viruses that I cannot avoid. As far as serious diseases and infections, I would guess that most hospital nurses would test positive for MRSA and C-diff. We don't show symptoms because we are generally in good health, but we are colonized with the bacteria from being in frequent contact. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same but different: I am a preschool teacher and my work is a cesspool, despite strict cleaning and sanitizing. My first year I had the stomach flu twice and a cold for all of winter. A coworker got pneumonia AND bronchitis her first year. But after that first year my immune system bucked the hell up. I had a cold for three weeks at the end of winter but that's about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nursing student. The main thing that we learn is how to not spread disease. We have a special way of washing our hands after every patient contact (even if we wore gloves). And with the especially contagious diseases (TB, shingles, etc) we have PPE or personal protective equipment. Which includes gowns, masks, gloves, sometimes hair covers and shoe covers, respiratory masks, etc. And theres different rules for each contagious disease, like how close you can get to them, they may have to wear a mask when leaving their room, they may need a negative air pressure room, or the patient may need isolation. I say our PPE is the main thing that helps us stay well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
