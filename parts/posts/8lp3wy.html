		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because a lot of people lack the muscles in their backs to make the &quot;good posture&quot; their &quot;normal posture&quot;. Trying to force yourself into a certain posture is almost certainly uncomfortable. But if you develop your muscles properly, the posture will come naturally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your postural muscles aren’t very strong, this is likely, but it also has to do with ligaments in the spine.  Slumping over stretches out the ligaments in the spine and over time they deform in order support your spine better.  When you force yourself to have good posture, these connective ligaments are being compressed and that feels uncomfortable.  But if you keep up the good posture, they will reform to a more compact state and standing straight will be easier.  Not to mention your muscles will be stronger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good posture is like good habits: when you have bad habits, trying to train yourself into good habits can be uncomfortable. But once you’ve trained yourself into those good habits, they’re very comfortable, and they’ll serve you far better over time. </p>
<p>Your body gets used to certain positions and postures. I have been struggling to fight a habit of holding my phone low and hanging my head to look at it, and I can assure you it’s tough. But I know for a fact that my head being tilted down so much has impacted my health, and I’m motivated to change it, so I’m ignoring the discomfort. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need the muscles that hold yourself in a good posture to be strong. If you don't practice good posture, they won't get exercised enough and won't be strong. If they're not strong enough, you'll have trouble holding a good posture, so you won't want to do it. It's a vicious cycle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
