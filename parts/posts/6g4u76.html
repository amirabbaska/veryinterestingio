		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question. As someone in the legal field,  I discuss this often with peers. Testifying under oath, subject to a felony charge of perjury, was traditionally a powerful tool in preserving judicial integrity; but that was a time when people were actually prosecuted for perjury. Now, too often people commit perjury and go unpunished. This is a situation where the principle of deterrence would assist in combating lying under oath. </p>
<p>It's important to note that people lying under oath to avoid serious prison time isn't a big problem because people already facing harsh penalties, if convicted, would of course risk a perjury charge. I won't go into an explanation as to why it <em>usually</em> doesn't affect the truth seeking process when a defendant lies under oath, because it's not really relevant to your original question. </p>
<p>Back to my initial point. Witnesses lie all the time under oath, and they probably would do it less frequently if people were prosecuted harshly for this offense. Without getting too political, many attorneys I associate with,  even democrats, feel Bill Clinton's avoidance of perjury charges showed the country that it's not a huge deal. Yes, he wasn't the first, nor the last to do it, but the publicity and coverage of his perjury shed light on the lack of prosecution in perjury charges. </p>
<p>Now, every president has likely committed acts that could have been investigated further and revealed <em>at least</em> probable cause to file charges; however,  Bill Clinton, without question committed perjury.
People argue that 'he only lied about a blowjob', but that's not the issue. This crime is unique in that it doesn't  matter what the crime being charged  (underlying offense) is, or what the potential crime that someone is avoiding by lying on the stand; it's unique because the punishment should be severe regardless of those factors since it undermines the entire judicial process. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: We don't punish people for perjury in the manner we should in order to sufficiently deter lying under oath. People that argue that deterrence doesn't work for things like drug use (since an addict will use when they get released because of their addiction, regardless of the prison time); would be objectively wrong to think deterrence isn't a proper approach to perjury, since people break that law <em>because</em> the risk of punishment is not severe enough--and lying under oath is something that any person (except someone clinical insane) makes a conscientious decision to do. (The statute makes the penalty severe enough,  but it's hardly ever prosecuted to the maximum permitted sentence). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The purpose of testifying under oath is not to prevent lying, it is to have legal grounds to convict you of a crime for lying under oath. </p>
<p>If you want to avoid implicating yourself there is no need to lie under oath, you have the right to take the 5th and just say nothing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is called perjury (lying under oath), and is a crime. It is to prevent people from lying so someone they dislike goes to jail.</p>
<p>It is also why you have the 5th Amendment in the US Constitution, which gives you the right to not self incriminate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't <em>prevent</em> lying during a testimony or legal proceeding, but it does provide grounds on which someone may be punished if it is later discovered that they provided knowingly false, incomplete, or embellished testimony. It is meant to be a deterrent against lying, in that there are serious legal consequences for doing so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
