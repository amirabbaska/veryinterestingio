		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun itself can be a handy reference (and a sextant or backstaff a handy tool).  If you watch the sun every day, measuring the peak of its travel across the sky (noon) then measure the angle down to the horizon, you will find that the angle changes each day.  It will also peak a bit further east/west than the day before too.  Taken together over a year and plotted it is known as an <a href="http://solar-center.stanford.edu/art/analemma.html" target="_blank">analemma</a>.  If you find a repeat of the noon reading, then you've completed one year.</p>
<p>The odd figure 8 shape is due to the axial tilt of the Earth and the elliptical orbit around the sun.  </p>
<p>EDIT: common comments and other facts</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>yes it does resemble a female name an body descriptor related to poop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The intersection of the figure 8 of the analemma is not the vernal/autumnal equinox.  It is an artifact of taking a three diminsional system and projecting it onto a two dimensional model.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The equinoxes are not easy to discern and are rather half way between the highest and lowest extreme.  They are, quite literally, a time of equal night (equa and nox from latin), where the length of the night equals the day.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other planets have analemma, some figure 8 some eliptical, some &quot;tear drop&quot;.  It depends on the axial tilt (Jupiter has very little, Uranus is extreme) and the shape of the orbit </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;highest&quot; point will be the summer solstice, or longest day of the year, which recently occurred in the northern hemisphere.  The &quot;lowest&quot; point will be the winter solstice, which southern hemispherers (hemispherians?) just celebrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attitude of the analemma changes depending on your latitude.  At the north pole it is vertical, and a large portion of the &quot;long&quot; lobe is cut off.  This is because it is above the arctic circle and some parts of the year, the sun never rises.  As the perspective moves south towards the equator, the analemma becomes &quot;lazy&quot; and lays on its side.  Crossing the equator the analemma &quot;flips&quot; so the short lobe is on the &quot;bottom&quot;.  And again as you approach the south pole, it becomes more &quot;vertical&quot; and a portion is cut off.</p>
</li>
<li>Hypothetical analemma:  A planet with no axial tilt will have an even figure 8 shape.  Top = bottom.  A planet with a circular orbit will have the the figure eight &quot;squashed&quot; into an east-west line.  A planet that is tidally locked will have a dot.  Mercury, for example has a day that is nearly 1 year long and a very circular orbit.  It's analemma is basically a dot, but plotted over the course of years, is an east-west line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, it has been noted that seasonal cycle can &quot;measure&quot; a year.  But it is a poor measurement.  Ancient peoples would use the cycles of the moon (12 or sometimes 13 cycles to denote a year).  Some relicts (relict is a word that is very similar to relic, but with less Indian Jones connotations) still exist in modern English related to harvest moon, planting moon, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other stars in the sky. </p>
<p>The winter sky is different than the summer sky. And that's not just because of the tilt.   At one point of the year, at midnight when straight up around the equator is directly away from the sun, it faces towards the core of the galaxy. And 182 days later, it faces in the opposite direction in space, away from the core of the galaxy. </p>
<p>They also move around like how our sun slowly orbits the galactic core... but MAAAAN is that a lot slower in comparison to a year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Zodiac also provides a handy reference - you just have to be up at dawn.</p>
<p>As the Earth moves around the Sun, sunrise moves from one constellation to the next. The dawn makes the stars impossible to see, of course, but if you've been watching, you'll know where it is.</p>
<p>Ancient astronomer/astrologers saw that it completed a circuit in a year, and used 12 constellations to keep track - Aries, Taurus, Pisces, Leo, Virgo, Cancer, Gemini, Scorpio, Capricorn, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Libra. </p>
<p>If you're a Libra, it means that on the day you were born, the Sun rose into Libra. In principle - it's shifted a little bit since they were defined.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ancients watched the skies like we watch TV. You can line up two permanent objects in your back yard on a sight line with a star you recognize and record the exact time. </p>
<p>The star will &quot;move&quot; incrementally from that point at that exact time each night until it finally returns to its &quot;home&quot; location 365 nights later. Try it. It's cool to feel as smart as people thousands of years ago!</p>
<p>The ancients knew a lot more about everything than we usually give them credit for. We are still trying to figure out what they were watching in some of their &quot;observatories&quot; like Stonehenge.</p>
<p>Btw, the small error you record on the 365th night is the reason we have a Leap Year every four years -- to make up for the fact that the observation doesn't come out exactly right each year. It took them quite a few years of watching to figure that part out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what the rules are to posting a link instead of a text answer but this youtube video goes in into all the different ways to measure the length of the year in very simple language and annimations. I've had it in my favourites for ages now.
It also goes into how the earth wobbles and tilts and what affect that has on the Northern star and seaons and why we have ice ages etc. </p>
