<p>Imagine a playground with five groups of kids playing in a playground:</p>
<p>The first group is a bookworm club, and has the luxury of knowing the only language in which the rules of the playground/games/swings/rides are written. They only teach this language to their own kind. If anyone wants to know how a particular game/swing/ride works, they come to them. They also run schools where they teach written language (not the special language) to other kids. These are your Brahmin Kids. </p>
<p>The second group is the playground bullies club, but this group also the protects the playground from other kids who are not regulars, or want to take the playground for themselves. They know martial arts, and they write literature and arts in their local language. They bully everyone except the Brahmin kids, because they hold the power of knowledge. Others, they bully or pamper depending on how much they need them. One of them, is the de-facto ruler of the playground. These are your Kshatriya kids.</p>
<p>The third group is a group of rich kids, they own several of the swings/rides in the playground, they frequently trade with other rich kids who own stuff on other playgrounds. They keep paying up to the bully to ensure their own protection, and the protection of their swings etc. Sometimes the bullies are nice to them, sometimes the bullies take away their stuff, to fund their campaigns to attack other playgrounds. These are your Vaishya Kids.</p>
<p>The fourth group is a group of hardworking kids, whose sole purpose is to ensure everyone in the playground is fed, and everything in the playground works. They are paid measly wages by the traders and/or the bullies. They all share their knowledge of stuff through lore, and are restricted from learning any written language. <em>EDIT</em>: These are the Shudra kids.</p>
<p>The fifth group is detested by everyone else, because their main job is to clean everyone else's shit. Basically, clean the flush-less toilets by hand, take care of dead animals, work in the sewers etc. Since they work in so much filth, no one wants to even come near them, let alone touch them. Since they are forbidden by the bookworms to even talk to them, they have no way of learning anything new. These are your Achhoot (Untouchables) kids. (Come to thinks of it Untouchables has such weirdly different connotations in the west vs. India)</p>
<p>Now, as you see above, there are only two classes really trying to escape poverty. They can't because the knowledge required to enter the higher groups requires that they understand some kind of a written language, or years and years of martial training, or an incredible amount of sudden wealth. All three of these things were impossible to fake, and hence you were always stuck with caste you were born into.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is important to know that the caste system was NOT stronger in the past. New subaltern studies indicate very strongly that the caste system solidified and became excessively rigid during the 150 years of British colonial rule. The caste system originally was defined as a guild system - similar to the one in say Europe from the fall of Rome onwards (or traced back to Diocletian's reforms on guilds).</p>
<p>The varna system had 4 castes broadly, the Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. These 4 groupings were originally not prevented or banned from changing their groupings by accquiring skills belonging to another caste (guild?).</p>
<p>For instance, the writer (to whom the epic can be traced to) of one of India's most famous epics, the Ramayana was a hunter belonging to the Shudra caste.</p>
<p>You have had many kings who were either Vaishya, Brahmin or Shudra castes, we do know that the Nanda dynasty, the Marathas, Cholas for a start were from what would today be considered a 'lower caste', yet sources from their era do not even mention their caste, which should have been a huge issue if one went by how rigid the system today is.</p>
<p>If you take the Arthasasthra, it actually mentions the composition of the king's council and that it needed to have 2 from each major caste (why would a 'lower caste' person be included in the highest tiers of decision making in one of the most powerful empires this earth has seen?)</p>
<p>Take recent times, The Beautiful Tree, a report by Dharmpal on the education system prior to the British take over (using British sources interestingly enough) says unequivocally that the 100's of thousands of village schools around the country educated kids of all castes and also girl children without discrimination.</p>
<p>This is the background to the caste system per se.</p>
<p>To answer your specific question though, discrimination was really not a big concern based on castes till about the mid 16th century when the caste system did slowly start to get solidified (it really accelerated after the British take over), but even here you had very quickly, reform movements like the Bhakti movement emerge to counter these ill effects of the caste system. That said, your caste was tied to a trade, and in real terms, learning an entirely new trade was (and still is, in this modern world) very different. Secondly, the village as a social unit played a big role in the survival and prosperity of individuals, to cut those ties was (and still is) extremely difficult.</p>
<p>edit - left out the 5th caste, these were the untouchables, but this status was reserved only for those who worked the crematoria and those punished by exile from society who were made and called &quot;chandalas&quot;. These were excluded from everything.</p>
<p>Edit 2 - Just to clarify, the British did not invent this system,  they took an existing socioeconomical and cultural  structure, didn't understand it in the least, interpreted it the way their own system ran (priests, knights, traders and serfs with a bunch of slaves in the end) and applied their own rules to this system. The system then responded and became more rigid in response to this stimuli.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine yourself as a lower caste person born into large poor family. Your family is your whole support system. Traveling in earlier times was dangerous and uncommon. Ignorance, superstition and fear was widespread especially among the poor due to lack of education. </p>
<p>So ask yourself this question. Would you take you (and perhaps your whole family if they agreed to your proposition) move  away from a place where they have at least some semblance of security and income to unknown place with no guarantee of safety during the journey or knowledge of your destination?</p>
<p>Some English serfs did do exactly that coming to America during Early Colonial Times with very unfortunate outcome.</p>
<p>Edit: Should have used the term indentured servant instead of serf, from Europe instead of just English. </p>

<p>Additionally, You are psychological prisoner of your birth and circumstances. Very difficult to break out a prisoner mentality. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I am from Nepal and what you just said did happened in my country. I know of such a person.</p>
<p>Despite what others are saying, there is no difference in skin color between lower and higher cast person.</p>
<p>The real case:
A person called A migrated from a distant village into my city of pokhara and said that he was a high caste man. He used to live in our house on rent. He had a wife. There was no way of knowing his caste. But two things gave it:</p>
<p>1) He tried to do bratabandha of his elder son which a common ceremony in which one shaves his head and puts on a sacred thread called janai. It indicates a transition to adulthood. The local priest asked him to put on the thread and A put on the opposite side. (See janai on google). So, the priest knew then on but since it was 1990 and caste system was criminalized, he did nothing. He revealed the caste to everyone and everyone knew his caste</p>
<p>2) When my grandmother was in hospital, she met someone from As village. She asked B about A and his caste was revealed. Since A had already moved to different house and it was the 90s, she did nothing.</p>
<p>Finally, rumor travels fast here. Its like a village. Everybody knew his caste. And his sons later married someone from their own caste.</p>
<p>So, you can see how difficult and risky it is to do something like that. If it was a 100 years before, he could have been executed. Only a kings command could change a low caste person to high in those times</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
