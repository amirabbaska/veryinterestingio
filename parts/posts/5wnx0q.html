		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a forensics class I took, we were learning about the body farms that can be found throughout the USA. An experiment was done involving decomposing rates where flies were taken off a body, placed a drop of paint on their back for marking, and driven a few mile(s) away. The flies were recorded to have made it back to the body before the individual who drove them away did.</p>
<p>Edit: Redditors, please donate your organs and body when you're through with them. Advancing the sciences and medicine requires bodies. Medical schools would love to use you as a cadaver. And afterwards, if you're lucky, your body might be the next &quot;Mr Bones&quot; in Mrs. Smith's 6th grade science class</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the bug.  Some bees have been shown to be able to re-locate their hive after being separated by a reasonable distance.  Over time they learn the area while foraging and can find their way back if they're not moved too far.</p>
<p>Ants trace their location carefully with scent and would be lost if moved.</p>
<p>Most non-social insects don't really have a permanent &quot;home&quot; and would just do bug stuff in their new location. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I learned from my Turf-Inscets professor that ants relocate to their ant piles by using familiar smells, sun and the gravitational pull. Ants are a truly magnificent creature...
Not related to location, but a queen bee can release a pheromone that causes the rest of the bees to bite the hive, tear it open a little and flutter their wings making a draft for the queen bee to cool off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
