		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are faced with danger, the threat of danger, or sometimes, even the idea of danger, your body reacts with what is called the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response, which I'll call the stress response. Stress is a threat to your well-being, so your body perceives this as danger. </p>
<p>Your body prepares itself to protect you. It does this by releasing a hormone, epinephrine, aka adrenaline, into your bloodstream. Adrenaline constricts your veins and arteries, as well as increases your heart rate and breathing rate, so that oxygen rich blood can be delivered. It also diverts bloodflow away from the digestive system since its not terribly important right now (this causes the nausea). This is to prepare you to either fight the danger, or flee from it. Either way you're going to need lots of oxygen delivered quickly to your muscles. </p>
<p>When your body reacts to mental or emotional, rather than physical stress, it still reacts the same way. Quick anecdote - I suffer from anxiety. About a year ago, I was in a bus accident and got thrown across the bus. It was terrifying (mental stress) and I did a pretty wicked faceplant (physical stress). What I noticed was that my physical reaction was almost identical to a panic attack I had a few months earlier. </p>
<p>Basically, your body is preparing you for some kind of physical throwdown when you're stressed. But, there's nothing to fight, especially when it's something like an essay that's half done and due in three hours, so you just have to ride out the adrenaline. So, you get a racing heart, hyperventilation, numbness in the fingers and toes, nausea, inability to stay still. </p>
<p>Source: studying health science and psychology right now</p>
<p>EDIT: yes yes yes I didn't mention cortisol. I'm really good at explaining panic attacks and epinephrine is the main hormone for those. </p>
<p>I'm not an idiot for not mentioning cortisol. I do know what it is, but I wrote this on my phone and didn't want to write anymore.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Tons of people asked if exercise is a good alternative to &quot;riding out the adrenaline&quot; - it absolutely is! Most mental health professionals will recommend this as a personal treatment option for anxiety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another important point is that the Auto-pilot of the brain called the autonomic nervous system has two basic modes.  There is the &quot;fight or flight&quot; called the Sympathetic Nervous System (also freeze is sometimes discussed in therapy circles, edit: based on solid animal research),  and the &quot;rest and digest&quot; system AKA the Parasympathetic Nervous System.   </p>
<p>Most major nerves in the body have wiring for both, and these wires go EVERYWHERE.  Including places where they open and shut blood valves in your skin.  </p>
<p>Good ELI5 picture for the question.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if it has been mentioned and I'm not very good at explaining things.</p>
<p>But when anxiety and depression kicks in, not only do you suffer the &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; response, you also suffer from autoimmune response. Sometimes your body will react by attacking itself (when you throw up, get an upset tummy) and sometimes by presenting itself in acne. </p>
<p>When you get anxious, your body doesn't understand that it is an emotional response to the trigger and will react physically.
You sweat to cool your overreacting body (I don't have a reference to the study but it is also said that it is to flush your system of possible bacterial intrusions as your body is in panic mode) which then irritates the skin causing the acne. My SO and I both have this problem to different extents. Theirs manifests in their back being absolutely covered in spots and scabs and a really bad rash, where as my arms go pimply, I get what I call &quot;stress pimples&quot; on my chest and I get spots on my forehead and temples. But no where near as bad as theirs.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> I study Health Sciences and Psychology, and also suffer from anxiety and depression. Truly fascinating reading about these things in my coursework. But yeah, if any of this deemed wrong, I do apologise, I'm trying to think back to last year's coursework where I read about it. I don't have access to that material at the moment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've never understood why my body does it, its like oh your stressed are you? how would you like to feel like someone is suffocating you too? Good because thats what your getting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
