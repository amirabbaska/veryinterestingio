		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former firefighter/EMT/Paramedic: people would often bug us about idling, but it was a necessity because of the large amount of electric equipment we kept on board that needed to remain charged. If we cut the engine, and ran only electric, we'd drain batteries real fast on charged equipment- AC, monitors, suction pumps, radios, computers, etc. At our station, we would plug the rigs into outlets. Not sure about commercial diesel, but I'm sure they are running additional equipment as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turbocharged diesel engines need some time to cool the turbocharger down, especially if it's been driven at high stress.</p>
<p>The turbocharger spins at much, much higher speeds than the engine, so when you drive for a prolonged amount of time under boost from the turbocharger and you cut the engine power, the blades in the turbo keep spinning, but the oil does not keep on circulating. This makes the temperature in the turbocharger rise, which can overheat the bearings of the turbo, which burns any residual oil. The byproduct of burning oil is thick gunk which can block the bearings and cost a small fortune to fix.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people here try to explain how it is necessary for the engine, but none of it is really applicable anymore for modern engines. The truth is that a lot of drivers do not care and will idle just to keep the AC or heat running if they are sitting for whatever reason. They have no problems wasting fuel since the company pays for it anyway, and a lot of companies are putting a time limit on idling so the truck will automatically shutdown after sitting for a few minutes. It can also be necessary for sleeper berths to keep the accessories running if there is no APU. The only reason it is necessary is to cool down the turbocharger (ONLY for five minutes and if they came fresh from the highway with no city driving to the destination) or to build up air pressure after initial startup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trucks do it to run the heater or a/c in the bunk, that's practice is getting phased out due to stricter  emissions laws. They are using small generators instead of running a 500 hp engine all night. I have heard that the locomotives are really hard to restart so they leave them running.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with the other reasons on here, another also depends on weather. When it gets cold out diesel fuel turns into a gel like consistency. This is not good for engines. Diesels tend to have a warming plug in the fuel tank to warm the diesel up before starting the engine, but if you keep the engine running you keep the fuel warm enough to not let it geletanize </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
