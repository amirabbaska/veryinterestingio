		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DNA is like a book in the reserve section of the library. It’s the full complete section of your entire genetic information that can’t leave the nucleus. </p>
<p>RNA are the photocopies/notes of the book. You can take those anywhere and use them to study, and they are only going to be the pages that you actually need at that moment. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DNA cannot leave the nucleus, RNA can. Both carry genetic information, but since RNA can leave, it copies the information found in DNA. It leaves to go find a ribosome to be able to make proteins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DNA and RNA are very similar. They are words containing information on how to build an animal. DNA is like the instruction manual. It is made in this beautifully bound, tough book. It is really really important, so it sits in this protective case. (DNA is deoxyribose nucleic acid. It is made of four bases adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. RNA contains a uracil instead of a thymine, because it costs less energy to make and if it is present in DNA, the body knows cytosine was broken down and there is an error. RNA is ribose nucleic acid. At the 2' carbon, DNA has no hydroxyl group, but RNA does). </p>
<p>RNA is a messenging service. It is kinda like mail. The DNA is located in the secret HQ of our bodies. It is really important amd cannot be taken out of this HQ. But messages still need to be sent to the factory to produce our machines to make the body work. </p>
<p>RNA differs from DNA by being written on post it notes instead of a book.  The post it notes get sent outside of HQ, where the factory workers read it, and start putting pieces of a machine together. RNA post it notes should not last long, so it is very easy to discard these post it notes. Thats why HQ adds some stuff before the post it notes go out. There is a sticker saying it is from HQ and not fake, and a bunch of little post it notes on the end so the people of the cell know itnot to throw it out. Eventually this post it note will still be thrown out. Which makes sense, because we dont want the building people to make 1000 of a machine when we only need 4. And because there is a lot of gibberish in the post it note, the stupid stuff gets cut out, and the important imformation pasted together.</p>
<p>(Gene expression, or transcription of a set of genes, needs to be transient. Continual expression of an uneeded gene wastes precious resources. Tightly controlled expression at the level of transcription is therefore important. RNA is a relatively inexpensive thing for the cell to make, and it will be degraded at some point. This is why we add the 5' methyl guanosine cap and the 3' poly a tail. It tells the cell that this RNA is not foreign and has a function to perform. The 2'hydroxyl on the ribose increases the chance of self attack, however, adding to the transient breakdown of RNA. We want this though, to regulate translation. Lastly, the mRNA has the introns cut out and the exons spliced together. Introns are important for transcription, but not translation. These uncoding regions are cut out for the exons to be spliced together. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
