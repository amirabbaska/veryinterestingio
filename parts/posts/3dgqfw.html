I would imagine it would need to have a extended shutter speed to allow enough light in to get a usable photo. What I am wondering how this is possible when travelling so fast. </p>
<p>Edit. Basically super sensitive sensor. Like I high ISO, is what I gather. This is from a link provided by /karlshea</p>

<p>2nd Edit. I always assumed there was very little light in space. Leaving me to believe Pluto would be very dark, to the point you could miss it if you flew pass while looking out the window. /r/DrColdReality posted this link. Turns ot Pluto is very bright.</p>

<p>A single long exposure <em>absolutely would</em> show blurring under these conditions. Some probes have camera tracking platforms on them, which keep the camera aimed at one spot for long exposures, but New Horizons doesn't, they have to turn the whole craft if they want to track.</p>
<p>So instead, they stack images. They take a bunch of very short exposures--about 100 msec for Pluto at closest approach--which are too brief to show any significant blurring, then stack them together optically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw somewhere in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3d9luh/were_scientists_on_the_nasa_new_horizons_team/" target="_blank">the NASA IAMA</a> that they take many shorter exposure photographs and combine them, because it doesn't require the probe to be as stable. I can't find the exact link, it's likely in one of the 'load more comments' bits.</p>
<p>It's moving at 14,000 metres/second. A decent consumer digital camera (e.g. a Nikon D7200) can take a 1/8000th of a second exposure. That would mean the probe moves 1.75 metres in one picture.</p>
<p>NASA can likely afford faster, and more light-sensitive sensors than a consumer grade digital camera. The probe can turn, as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
