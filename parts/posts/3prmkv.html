<p>I'm not a doc or anything but I'm guessing the delayed pain is because the initial injury doesn't cause much pain but as the site of injury inflames and swells this causes the pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body releases natural dopamine (same stuff found in heroine) painkillers at the site to prevent you from feeling the pain. However the supply is limited and eventually it needs to stabilize. This is why a lot of injuries feel worse some time later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Med student here. The topvoted answers don't tell the whole truth. There are two reasons as to why pain is delayed/inhibited. </p>
<p>ELI5:</p>
<p>The first is that the inflammatory process takes time. It takes time for pain-inducing chemicals to be produced/released and for these to affect nerves, by activating them.</p>
<p>The second reason is that your body has a store of molecules that can be released in the spinalcord in stressful situations, which actually have a pain-dampening effect. They block pain-signals travelling to the brain, making you unaware of the pain. When the stressful situation is over and the effect of the inhibitory molecules passes, you will be made aware of the pain</p>
<p>NOT ELI5:</p>
<p>Reason 1: Inflammatory mediators need to be released and/or created by inflammatory cells, and need to make their way to nerve endings. Histamine for example, also causes the blood vessels to increase in permeability, effectively making exudate from the blood flow into the tissue. The increased swelling in the tissue also presses on nerves (nociceptors - sensory nerves that carry pain signals), activating them which also leads to pain, once the signal reaches the brain.</p>
<p>As a fight or flight response the following happens:</p>
<p>Reason 2: Basically what happens when you dont feel pain at the actual time of injury is your body releasing inhibitory neurotransmittors (endorphins (endogenous morphines), GABA, noradrenaline etc) in the spinal cord which inhibits pain signals travelling up to the brain, and hence less, if any, pain signals reach the brain, making you unaware of the pain. </p>
<p>Edit: Added another reason for pain inhibition. These two reasons combined explain why we don't feel pain at the exact time of injury.</p>
<p>Edit: Added a basic version (ELI5)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much of the time, it's not the actual injury that hurts, but rather inflammatory mediators that are delayed in accumulating to the site of injury. </p>
<p>Edit: I'm sorry to the five year olds out there on reddit that don't understand what inflammatory mediators are. To clear things up, they are chemicals your body makes in response to the injury that help to speed up healing (they recruit things that stop bleeding, encourage tissue regeneration and protect your body from infection) but as a side effect, also cause pain. This pain is thought to be a beneficial side effect as it prevents you from using the injured body part and possibly causing further damage to an already vulnerable site.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pain is weird. </p>
<p>There's nothing at the injury site itself that <em>hurts</em>. It's all in your brain. Nerves at the site of the injury send signals up about what's going on, and then the brain sorts it out. The brain actually integrates a ton of information very quickly, including memories of past &quot;pain&quot; signals in particular locations and the consequences (severe injury, major illness, nothing particularly bad). It also integrates what you're doing at the time, and in the instant it seems to dampen pain perception so you can make sure you're not in further danger. It also changes over time, and can hurt more later, when you're reliably out of danger, so that you take care of the area and don't use it so it can heal and avoid further injury.</p>
<p>Pain is essentially your brain's <em>opinion</em> about what's going on with your body. It can be seriously out of step with the actual state of damage of a particular area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
