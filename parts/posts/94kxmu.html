		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moore's Law was about transistor's in a circuit becoming smaller so the processor would double in speed every two years (IRL 18 months). But it has also applied to storage and RAM and whatnot. </p>
<p>Scientists are constantly striving to miniaturize and get more efficiency. So far this has been a linear process more or less, we could always make it a bit smaller and faster. There isn't a huge incentive to jump technologies, that's why your breakthroughs don't happen more often. The company always wants a few price tiers going, so it needs to constantly replace the top tier and let the rest move down a spot. </p>
<p>But we always knew there was a physical limit to how small a transistor can be. The solution was adding more cores.</p>
<p>With storage we went from optical lasers like DVD from magnetic tape drives, now the big breakthrough is SSD. Each time a technology hits a limit other technologies become more viable and cost efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moore's law is interesting.</p>
<p>Basically it predicts that we'll keep getting better at making smaller and smaller features on computer chips.</p>
<p>Hard drives have one really critical chip that is produced in a similar way to other chips--the read/write head.  If you can make the features in this smaller then you can read and write smaller magnetic domains in the platters.</p>
<p>So, amongst other advances, hard drives have benefited from Moore's law improving computer chips.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moore's law was actually defeated in 2004 with the creation of the single atom transistor. They made a transistor using a single silver atom embedded in silicon.
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-atom_transistor" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-atom_transistor</a></p>
<p>But ultimately they found that with transistors this small, when you put a lot of them on a microchip their individual electrons start to interfere with each other.  It's now part of the research into quantum computing.</p>
<p>But as far as size, we've gone as small as we can go. Now it's all about the geometry. Rather than arranging them on a single plane you can arrange them in a lattice and take advantage of the larger surface area to include more in a small area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
