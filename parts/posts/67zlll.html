		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people here are using examples such as </p>
<p>0*3 = 0</p>
<p>3 = 0/0</p>
<p>3 = 0 which is false. Therefore 0/0 cannot be equal to 0.</p>
<p>But the problem is that they are contradicting themselves, and here is why:</p>
<p>If we were to go crazy and assume 0/0 = 0,</p>
<p>lets do the similar problem again</p>
<p>3 * 0 = 0</p>
<p>Now, to send 0 to the other side we have divide both sides by 0, so</p>
<p>(3*0)/0 = 0/0</p>
<p>Then, we can rewrite it as,</p>
<p>3*(0/0) = 0/0</p>
<p>Since this is a special case where we are assuming 0/0 =0</p>
<p>it again becomes, 3*0 = 0 which in fact is just 0 = 0</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>3 * 0 = 0</p>
<p>(3*0)/0 = 0/0</p>
<p>3*(0/0) = 0/0</p>
<p>3 * 0 = 0</p>
<p>0 = 0</p>
<p>Therefore this type of reasoning doesn't make sense. Still, thank you all for responding, this is turning out to be a really interesting discussion.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So let's look at an equation like 3 • 5 = 15. Easy. Now watch how we can take that equation and turn it into 3 = 15 ÷ 5. Also easy.</p>
<p>Now let's put zero in the mix. 3 • 0 = 0. Okay. So then it would follow that 3 = 0 ÷ 0. And if we change 3 to 4, we would get 4 • 0 = 0 and 4 = 0 ÷ 0.</p>
<p>Division by 0 is undefined because it isn't equal to any one value. It could be equivalent to anything we like using the above reasoning. This is a problem because the arithmetic operations are actually functions like you learn about in algebra, and functions are only allowed to have one single output for any given input.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that zero isn't just a number, it represents &quot;something&quot;.  Or in this case, zero represents nothing and you can't divide by nothing.  If you tried to divide 1 by 0, that's impossible because you can't divide by something that isn't there.  Same goes for when you try to divide 0 by 0.</p>
<p>Another example.  Let's say you have four apples.  You have to define how you're going to divide up those apples.  You can divide by two, so you'll have two groups, but you can't have no groups at all -- you'll always have at least 1 group with 4 apples in it. </p>
<p>Now, you can divide 0 by 1 because you can divide nothing up however many times you want but you'll still have nothing.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this:</p>
<p>Let's &quot;pretend&quot; that 0/0 is defined and has a numeric value. If we do so, then let us write this:</p>
<p>0*3=0</p>
<p>By algebra, let us divide by zero:</p>
<p>0/0=3</p>
<p>Let's try it again, but this time using 0 instead of 3.</p>
<p>0*0=0</p>
<p>0/0=0</p>
<p>Since we stated above that zero divided by zero is equal to three and it is also equal to zero, then:</p>
<p>3=0</p>
<p>Since 3 is definitely not equal to 0, there is a problem in the math. This is part of the reason why the value is undefined. It appears that we can let zero divided by zero equal anything, which is not arithmetically possible. That is why it is undefined in mathematics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
