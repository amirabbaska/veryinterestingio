		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a very complex question with a very complex answer but by the time you're done with this comment you will understand it as well as anyone. So buckle up, tape your eyelids open, and go brew a bucket of coffee. </p>
<p>To begin you need to have a good idea of how a differential works and what it is. As usual in the car world, the best way to learn is to watch a video from the 1930's (really, it is, I swear). Namely <a href="https://youtu.be/yYAw79386WI" target="_blank">this one</a>. </p>
<p>You're back? Good. That's what we call an open differential. It's the most basic type of differential. When you get stuck in the snow or mud and one wheel spins like mad and one does nothing at all, that's because there's an open differential. </p>
<p>A <strong><em>limited slip differential, or LSD</em></strong>, is a differential that allows the wheels to only turn at a limited range of different rates. If one starts to spin too much faster than the other, the differential sends power to the other wheel. Some LSD's are clutch pack type, where the speed imbalance causes the spinning wheel to be braked against the inside of the differential housing using a clutch pack. You don't really need to know how that works mechanically, but understand the effect is the same as if you were to apply the brake on just that wheel (a thing some cars actually do- brake based torque vectoring, which we'll get into later.) Others are of the &quot;torsen&quot; type, which is short for &quot;torque sensing.&quot; It uses magic, I think, but if you're in a torsen equipped vehicle, and one wheel is spinning uselessly, you should try lightly applying the brakes, as this will cause the torsen differential to send power to the other wheel, using magic. Anyone who's watched my cousin Vinny could have probably skipped the last two paragraphs.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>locking differential</em></strong> is an open differential which has the additional ability to be locked so that both wheels turn at the same rate no matter what (unless you try to use it on dry pavement, then it'll probably break). </p>
<p>A <strong><em>viscious coupling</em></strong> uses a fluid coupling of some sort to distribute power between the wheels. Usually using a computer. Some viscious couplings are made of stacks of plates attached to the input and output shaft alternately, and by squeezing them closer together, the viscosity of a fluid causes power to be transmitted from the input to the output. Others can work like a torque converter in a transmission, where fluid is splashed by one plate onto another, pushing the second plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xm8EHTTNPEg" target="_blank">If you care to learn how torque converters work you can watch this old army video, but it's not really applicable here. Still well worth a watch</a></p>
<p>A <strong><em>wet clutch</em></strong> works a bit like brakes, but backwards. If you've ever driven a manual, you have an idea of how a clutch works, but a wet clutch is full of oil too, so it doesn't wear out and can handle continuous slipping. This may be used when you want to allow a computer to dole out power to each wheel individually as it chooses. </p>
<p>If you watched the video above (you did, right? Right?), you know that the wheels have to turn at different rates on the driven axle, but you might not know they also need to turn at different rates between the front and the rear axle. So if we want to drive the front and rear wheels, we need a differential for the front wheels and a differential for the rear wheels as well as a differential between the front and rear axles. This is where things start to get really complicated and you'll see that 4wd and Awd are just marketing terms developed because it's easier than explaining the myriad of differences to non-enthusiasts. You've made it this far, so keep going. </p>
<p>Let's start with 4 wheel drive. 4 wheel drive generally implies that there is a degree of selectability, and something's getting locked to something. Because of the need for each axle to turn independently, most 4 wheel drive systems are 2 wheel drive almost all the time. When you get stuck, you select 4 wheel drive, and you're out. This is done with the transfer case. Usually the transfer case will allow you to select 4 Hi, 4Lo, N, and 2Hi. 4Hi is for driving at speed in 4 wheel drive on a surface that will allow the wheels to slip, such as snow or gravel. 4Lo is for when you're stuck and you want to not be stuck, or you're crawling along in really rough terrain and you need torque, not speed. N is just neutral, and 2Hi is 2 wheel drive, high range, and is just what you'd normally use putting around town. Putting the car into anything but 2Hi on tarmac is a great way to make my day, because I'm a mechanic, and I like nice things. Because the axles need to turn independently and they can't, you go around a corner, get a nice loud crunch, and get to check if your AAA membership is still valid. Now some vehicles don't use a selectable transfer case like that. Instead the front differential is always driven. What you do is you lock the front wheels to the differential at the hubs, and unlock it when you don't want 4 wheel drive. But this generally requires getting out of the truck and that's not nice. Some cars do this on their own using a computer or mechanical system. </p>
<p>So now you can send power to the front and rear axles. Most of the time this is great. But what if one wheel on each axle is on snow and the other is wedged up against a rock? You're still not going anywhere. Now you need locking differentials. Note that simply having 4 wheel drive doesn't mean you have locking differentials. See? Marketing mumbo jumbo. </p>
<p>So that's 4 wheel drive. What about all wheel drive? Well, the system varies from car to car. Awd is a blanket term that means all of the wheels can be driven at some point or another. Note that in 4 wheel drive, power comes out of the engine, into the transmission, out of a driveshaft, into the transfer case, and then out into a front and rear driveshaft. All wheel drive may do that, or it may send the rear wheels power from the back of the transmission, and the front wheels power from the sides. It's truly a clusterfuck of variability. </p>
<p>The most simple type of all wheel drive is an open differential for the front wheels, an open differential for the rear wheels, and an open differential to spilt the power between each axle. This is marginally more useful than 2 wheel drive, but only just. See, if even 1 wheel has no grip, you're not going anywhere. Unless the car has good brake based torque vectoring (that works, which is a crapshoot as well, as some cars have shitty brake based torque vectoring systems), in which case it brakes just the spinning wheel, forcing the power to flow to the other wheels. In any case, this electronical approach tends not to be quite so good as most mechanical ones, but better than some, so we'll keep going. </p>
<p>The next most simple uses a locking center differential. This means normally the car has 3 open differentials, but when wheelspin is detected, or you push a button, the center differential locks, and now it works like 4 wheel drive with open differentials. This is actually pretty good. However it only really works if you're stopped. It can't safely engage while you're moving (or stuck, but with the wheels spinning).</p>
<p>Part time all wheel drive means normally the rear wheels aren't connected to the engine at all, until they need to be. This is accomplished using a dry clutch (in which case it behaves like a locking center diff), or a wet clutch or viscious coupling. In the latter instances, the computer engages the rear driveshaft through the coupling, causing power to be sent back there. This is how most awd crossovers do it, like the crv. I'll save you some time and tell you it's generally garbage. With a wet clutch/viscous coupling, you've got regular, not brake based torque vectoring. </p>
<p>Finally, you can have a limited slip or torsen limited slip center differential. This, I think, is the best bet for most people. Because of its mechanical nature you're not at the mercy of a computer programmed by someone who lives in the city and doesn't understand why people don't just take the train. It actually works. It's smoother, doesn't require any driver interaction or even driver attention, and it just works. Except torsen which might require you to apply a bit of brake. </p>
<p>So the center differential is covered. Understand that every principle that can be applied to the center differential can also be applied to the front and rear differentials. In a perfect world, all three differentials would have computer controlled clutch packs capable of precisely sending a carefully selected amount of torque to each wheel. This is a thing in some cars. I believe it's the basis of acura's super handling awd (could be wrong, don't quÃ³te me on that) and the Nissan gtr and a select few other cars. In a next to ideal world all 3 differentials would be torsen or lsd type differentials. This is fairly common. In the worst case you'd have 3 open differentials. </p>
<p>In the rear world, all wheel drive systems can be found that are pretty much every variation of this, many with different systems for each axle, but now that you understand what each does and how it works in the real world, you can make pretty informed decisions if you do your research first. Understand that all wheel drive and 4 wheel drive are blanket terms and in order to get anything that's actually useful, you have to understand the actual mechanicals underlying the marketing term. </p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the gold. </p>
<p>Also, none of you are actually 5 years old. I hope. There are boobs on here, so you shouldn't be. If you want an explanation that doesn't explain the difference between 4wd and Awd, read someone else's concise and misleading explanation. The reason I have to go into so much detail is that the differences between &quot;4WD&quot; and &quot;AWD&quot; are highly nuanced. Both are made up terms, and originally awd basically meant &quot;shitty 4wd,&quot; but thats not the case anymore. If I can type this on a blackberry, you can read it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>4WD and AWD roughly do the same thing but in different ways,  the car is proving power to all four of its wheels.  The difference is how that power is divided between them.  An all-wheel-drive car can allow each wheel to turn at a different rate, while a four-wheel-drive car generally has its wheel all turning at the same rate.  This 4WD set up is better for offroad driving, but can cause problems in city driving, where the inside wheels need to turn slower around a corner than the outside wheels do. Because of this, a lot of 4WD cars are designed to be able to switch to rear-wheel drive when the 4WD is not needed.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prettt simply put, AWD has a center differential which allows front and rear axles to rotate at different speeds.  4WD does not have this center diff so at all times 1 front and 1 rear wheel have to rotate at the same speed.</p>
<p>Sometimes its how a manufacturer names it too.  I know for a time at least the Jeep Cherokee could run in a full time 4WD mode which had an open center diff, putting it in part time 4WD mode would just lock that center diff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>While there's a consensus on 4WD, what function it provides and how's it's implemented, AWD is still not nearly as defined. Manufacturers will often implement it differently and the function is very different. Even to the point of implementing a Full-Time-4WD and then calling it AWD.</p>
<p>You'll get 1 answer on 4WD and a dozen different answers for AWD.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different manufacturers and people use the terms differently, but in general:</p>
<p>4WD = off-road cars. The 4WD system can be turned on/off by the driver so the car is only driving two wheels normally, but engages the other two for difficult conditions. When engaged, the front and rear axles are connected mechanically - there's no (or little) provision for different wheel speeds as you would experience when taking a turn in the road.</p>
<p>AWD = normal/sport cars. All four wheels are driven at all times, with a differential in between to allow &quot;slippage&quot; when taking turns. This is better for road use, but not as good for difficult terrain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
