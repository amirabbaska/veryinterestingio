		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certain portions of the human brain are double-tasked. Ever wonder why you look up or down while doing difficult math? Eye movements and problem solving are both happening in the same part of the brain.

<p>It's likely the same thing with sticking your tongue out. the part of your brain that's concentrating also has some other job that just kind of happens randomly while your brain is putting all resources into one task.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Essentially, the tongue and brain are wired pretty tightly together, from a nerve standpoint. It's pretty cool!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read somewhere before (and currently on much break can't look for source) that the nerves that run through our hands and the nerves that run through our mouth connect to the brain in the same spot. So when you are completing a fine motor task with your hands you will often stick your tongue out or bury it in your cheek as a kind of side effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
