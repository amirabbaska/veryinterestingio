		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Visualize a helicopter with two rotor blades, just to make it easier. And let's just ignore the tail rotor and the engine for now. </p>
<p>Focusing only on the rotor and how it controls the movement of the helicopter, there are two controls the pilot uses. One is called the collective, and one is called the cyclic. </p>
<p>The rotor blades on a helicopter are wings. Another term for helicopter is &quot;rotary wing aircraft&quot;, as opposed to &quot;fixed wing aircraft&quot;. The blades spin through the air, and their <em>angle of attack</em> can be adjusted as they spin. You can think of &quot;angle of attack&quot; as simply tilting the blade. If you increase the angle of attack, or tilt the blades down, they push more air down, generating lift. </p>
<p>Back to &quot;collective&quot; and &quot;cyclic&quot;. &quot;Collective&quot; means increasing the angle of attack of both blades simultaneously, and throughout the entire rotation. This can be thought of as simply pushing air down to make the helicopter go up. </p>
<p>&quot;Cyclic&quot; refers to making an adjustment to the angle of attack at a certain point in the blade's cycle. That is, the pilot is able to change the angle of the blade at a certain point, such as the front of the aircraft, or to either side. If you increase the angle of attack of the blade while it is on the right side of the helicopter, the right side will get more lift and the helicopter will tilt toward the left and move that direction. </p>
<p>In reality, all the mechanics and forces involved are quite a bit more complicated, but that's a very basic breakdown of how the rotors themselves operate. The blades can be adjusted collectively, which is how helicopters go up and down, and they can also be adjusted individually at any point in the cycle, which is how helicopters move forward/backward and left/right. </p>
<p>If you want more information, the FAA's helicopter manual is available for free online and goes very in-depth in terms of how helicopters fly. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are really interested in getting deep into the physics of how helicopters work in a fun an easily-understandable way, I would highly recommend a video series from SmarterEveryDay.  Here's a link to the first video of the series. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdEWzqsfeHM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdEWzqsfeHM</a></p>
<p>Also, shoutout to /u/mrpennywhistle himself for creating this awesome series.  </p>
<p>To answer your question, helicopter rotors have something called a <a href="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PlasticSpiffyBushsqueaker-size_restricted.gif" target="_blank">swashplate</a> that adjusts the pitch of each blade as it rotates about it's axis to control vertical position.  It can also adjust the pitch of the entire rotor assembly to control horizontal movement in all 4 directions.  The tail rotor's job is to counteract torque spin to keep the helicopter flying straight but also to allow it to spin about its axis when needed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One method is to change the angle of attack of the individual rotor blades at different points during a single rotation.  It's called cyclic pitch. Increasing the lift during the rear half of the rotation causes a nose-down tilt of the whole helicopter so the lift direction is pointed forwards, causing motion as well mas lift.</p>
<p>Different cyclic pitch adjustments can cause the aircraft to move sideways or backwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A very good question. Amateur radiocontrol heli pilot here. </p>
<p>Modern helicopters use only 4 controls to do everything you can imagine. </p>
<p>Cyclic - This is a control that uses a tiltable disk called a swashplate that can tilt in any combination of forward and back, left and right. This makes you move forward and back, and side to side</p>
<p>Collective - This is a control that changes the angle of all rotor blades at the same time, making it provide more or less lift. It makes you go up and down. </p>
<p>Rudder - This controls the pitch of the blades on the smaller rotor at the rear of the helicopter. This makes the helicopter twist to the left or to the right. </p>
<p>Throttle - This controls how quickly the blades spin. If the blades spin too slowly, they will stall, causing the heli to drop out of the sky. If they spin too fast, it can damage the rotor blades. In forward flight, a helicopters blades can actually break the speed of sound, even in a small model RC heli!!! </p>
<p>The answer to your question lies in the cyclic control and the action of the swash plate. It doesn't actually tilt the shaft itself. If you look at a helicopter from the side as it pitches and rolls, the center shaft of the heli never bends or moves, it's rigid so it doesn't actually tilt. However the swash plate does move. As the rotor blades spin, they are connected to this swash plate and it causes the blade to change it's angle, producing more or less lift. If you tilt the swash plate, then as it spins around, part of that rotation, it will lower the angle of the blade, creating less lift, and on the opposite side of the rotation it increases the angle of the blade, producing more lift. </p>
<p>So when you tilt the stick to the right, it moves the swash plate, tilting it to the right. As the blade spins around (looking down from above, clockwise for most helis, anti clockwise for some european ones) it moves from the 12:00 position, to the 3 o'clock position where the swashplate is low, which reduces the angle of the blade on the right side, producing less lift on that side, causing the heli to drop on the right. As it spins back around to 9 o'clock on the other side, the swash plate is high, increasing blade angle and producing more lift, causing that side of the helicopter to lift. With the left side lifting, and the right side dropping, the heli tilts to the right. </p>
<p>Since the thrust of the helicopter blades is perpendicular to their thrust angle, the result of tilting the blades, causes the thrust to push the helicopter to the right, flying sideways. </p>
<p>The collective control moves the entire swash plate up or down, which changes the angle of the blades throughout their entire rotation, creating more or less lift. As the heli tilts forward to fly forward, it is using some of it's thrust to hover, and some of it to move forward, which means less power to maintain altitude. So the pilot adds some collective to counter act that and maintain their altitude during forward flight. </p>
<p>As they add collective, it slows the blades down because it increases their drag, and so the pilot adds more throttle to compensate. </p>
<p>As the blades drag increases it also increases the rotational torque between the motor, and the blades, causing the helicopter to twist to the left or to the right and so the pilot must also make small corrections to the rudder pedals with their feet. </p>
<p>Hovering or flying a helicopter, is like trying to balance a small ball, on top of a larger ball. If it's dead center, it's stable, but as the ball starts to roll to one side, it picks up speed and very quickly rolls off. Helicopters are inherently unstable. They want to crash. It's only the balancing act of the pilot maneuvering the collective, pitch, throttle, and rudder pedals together at the same time, that allows it to fly in a stable manner. </p>
<p>Sometimes people ask &quot;Why have a collective? Why not just make it go up or down by spinning the rotors faster or slower with the throttle&quot; and the answer is speed. If you are about to smack into something, and you need to quickly gain altitude, it takes a motor time to spin the massive weight and momentum of a larger rotor blade up to a faster speed. But by changing the angle of the blade you can instantly change the amount of lift it generates. </p>
<p>Imagine trying to drive a car when everytime you hit the brakes, there is a 5 second delay before they slow you down.....</p>
<p>Plus by having variable pitch blades, it's possible to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNFM4uoZOLg" target="_blank">do this</a> gravity be damned! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
