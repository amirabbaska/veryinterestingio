		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple factors, roughly in chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stopped paying reparations which caused a huge influx of money into the economy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Borrowed lots of money from banks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devalued currency to drive exports</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nationalized businesses, allowing the state to direct them towards state goals (e.g. weaponry)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confiscated minority property, e.g. that of Jews.</p>
</li>
<li>Confiscated property in occupied territories and forced cheap/slave labor</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, Germany may have been in a deep depression, but it was thoroughly a modern and industrialized economy, and you could view its woes mostly as a finance problem and not a problem of knowledge, skill or equipment.  Solve the finance problem (as the above bullets did) and you unlock the economy's potential.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hitler geared the whole of Germany's industry and production towards becoming an autarky - completely self sufficient in the event of a war. This was started somewhat slowly by Hjalmar Schacht, who was replaced by Goering and his Four Year Plan in 1936. The basic principles revolved around rearmament, reducing unemployment and (thusly) rebuilding a self-sufficient Germany.</p>
<p>As others have mentioned, unemployment was somewhat artificially reduced by removing many women from the workplace (until 1937 when it became apparent that more workers were needed in the industrial sector) l, as well as systematically removing Jews and other &quot;untermenschen&quot; from the workplace (and indeed society) or confiscating their businesses. Work schemes were also put in place such as the DAF which saw the building of schools, hospitals, autobahns (motorways) and other public works which improved the infrastructure of Germany and provided employment. Similarly any men between 18-25 not otherwise employed or in the army had to do 6 months manual labour for the Reich Labour Service (RAD). This paid low wages, and technically replaced unemployment benefit, as this would be refused if you would not work. The wages were actually lower than unemployment benefit, which saved the government some money.</p>
<p>Rearmament was also a major factor. Not only did increasing the armed forces provide more employment for young men in the services, it also massively increased industrial production which at the same time boosted the economy. The government had control over what each factory produced in order to meet demands, but factor owners made a lot of money. In real terms, workers were paid less for longer hours, but trade unions and strikes had be banned so there was little they could do. Besides which many Germans were bolstered by a growing sense of National pride, as well as the Strength through Joy programme which rewarded them with holidays (in Germany, of course), theatre/cinema tickets etc. for working hard. Of course the removal of basic human rights and regular arrests of those who spoke out against the state kept most workers quiet. There was also the very famous scheme where workers paid money in to buy a VW - this money went straight towards the war effort, and not a single person got their car!</p>
<p>Not forgetting of course that as Germany gradually took over territories it could absorb their industrial output. </p>
<p>It is always amazing what you can achieve if you have no care for human rights; what Hitler achieved was terrible, but brilliant in a horrifying way. Perhaps the biggest factor was that so many of the German population bought into it so heavily, as Hitler offered an alternative to the terrible circumstances they has seen after first hyperinflation, and then the Depression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that Hitler suspended Treaty of Versailles payments (and broke nearly every other rule laid out in the Treaty). </p>
<p>Even Hitler’s financial advisors informed him in the late 1930s that he was on the verge of massive economic collapse.  </p>
<p>Had he maintained the peace brokered by appeasement and the Soviet non-aggression pact, he would have seen his own nation thrust into serious financial difficulties which would likely have led to him losing favor with the people. For Hitler, 1939 was a “now or never” situation.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a myth that Hitler &quot;rescued&quot; Germany. </p>
<p>America, particularly American investment banks gave Germany a firm footing. </p>
<p>Sometime in 1923, the Allied powers realised that a weak Germany was a source of problems and the hyper inflation and the sorry state of the German economy needed to be fixed. </p>
<p>In comes Charles Dawes, he proposed two things,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Ruhr (the industrial heartland) be evacuated by the French and handed back to the Germans. This was vital because the Ruhr was the source of much of German steel. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repatriation payments were reduced and restructured. </p>
</li>
<li>Wall Street banks would issue bonds on behalf of Germany (German bonds were worthless at that point in time) and then loan the money to Germany which Germany could then use to repay the allies. </li>
</ul>
<p>Within about 3 years the German economy was on the rebound. American firms were investing a lot of money in Germany and the Germans themselves slowly started their rearmament plans. The plan though started to destabilize the economy and was replaced by (or was supposed to be replaced by) the Young plan. </p>
<p>Then the great depression hit. </p>
<p>Hitler came along and what did he do?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initiated a massive public works program overseen by Hjalmar Schacht. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This had a Keynesian effect and spurred growth. </p>
</li>
<li>The books were cooked, for instance women were in one stroke considered not a part of employment rolls and thus unemployment fell by half. &quot;fell by&quot; as it didn't really fall. </li>
</ul>
<p>&quot; Mandatory labour via the RAD (Reich labour department) for all males aged 18-25 and also mandatory military service. </p>
<ul>
<li>Aggressive rearmament. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now this is where Hitler hit a wall. To fund the infra building and the rearmament he needed money. Money he couldn't print because that would cause hyper inflation and nor could he issue Bonds because the German economy still wasn't that solid. </p>
<p>To get around this,  Schacht came up with a very ingenious ploy. <em>Metallurgische Forschungsgesellschaft</em> or the infamous MeFo bills. The company Metallurgische Forschungsgesellschaft, was a shell company that had only one purpose. </p>
<p>In a nutshell, how the worked was, the arms manufacturers would be paid in these MeFo bills instead of Reichsmarks. That meant that Germany didn't need to print any more notes. These bills were valid for 3 months and could be extended for 6 more. These companies usually waited out the full period and then went to a German private sector bank and handed these over. The Pvt sector bank handed over Reichsmarks and then promptly surrendered that to the Reichsbank (their federal reserve) who would then pay out these to civil contractors and the cycle would repeat. </p>
<p>Just imagine your current govt issuing Monopoly money that had no real valie but using it to transact for official business? That's exactly what Hitler did. At one point in time it was estimated that the value of MeFo bills circulating in Germany was roughly 80% of the total currency value. Now if any country tries to print that many notes, you will have hyper galloping inflation (think Zimbabwe). </p>
<p>A combination of these factors helped the German recovery. </p>
<p>Stalin also helped as he gave favourable terms to Germany and gave away vital resources very cheaply. </p>
<p>Mind you, the economic &quot;miracle&quot; was hardly one. It was a literal Ponzi scheme and needed conquest and resources to sustain it. Without it, there is only so much Monopoly money can do. </p>
<p>If you have any follow up questions, please do ask. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>International industries invested into Germany as a buffer defense against the Soviet Union. Many industrialists were afraid of workers rising up and disrupting operations in other countries. Ford Motor Company, IBM, ITT, JP Morgan Chase all were heavily invested in Germany's success. American lawyer from Sullivan Cromwell, John J. McCloy sat in Hitler's box at the 1936 Olympics. He later pardoned over 70,000 Nazis and served on the Warren Commission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
