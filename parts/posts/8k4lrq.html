		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your pencil lead breaks constantly no matter how you sharpen it, that probably means the lead is already splintered inside the pencil. This is caused by dropping your pencils or other similar impacts, and the only real fix is to buy another pencil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They are supposed to be rather tight to keep the pencil in line with the sharpening bit.  Only use the big hole if you can’t fit in the small one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The holes are usually just to hold the pencil centered in the sharpener. The length of the point is determined by the angle of the sharpener, which for most sharpeners is completely unaffected by the holes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rotating the sharpener around the pencil causes less breakage than turning the pencil. It’s something they teach you to help prevent breaking colored pencils, as they are softer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
