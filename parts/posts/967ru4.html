They don't serve a purpose so much as they are harmless growths of skin pigment containing cells. Luckily, moles are typically self limiting but sometimes they are not, and that's how you end up with melanoma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They aren't &quot;for&quot; anything.  They range from benign (generally regularly shaped and consistant day to day)  to precancerous (irregular both in shape and texture,  i.e. raised sections)  to growing melanomas (irregular and with varying appearance over time).</p>
<p>A major misconception with evolution and genes is that all genes are for a purpose determined by natural selection.  While many traits serve a function others simply aren't immediatly harmfull enough to prevent reproduction, which is all that matters to evolution.  </p>
<p>For example,  why do some people have differant color eyes?  Because that mutation wasn't lethal so there was no selective pressure for or against </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not every trait is “for” something. Some traits came about as a totally random side effect of another trait that was selected for. </p>
<p>For example, we didn’t “evolve” to have less body hair, that trait wasn’t selected for. We just evolved to have less testosterone, and/or other hormones, because that helped us be less aggressive and thrive in communities. Just so happens a side effect of those hormonal changes was having less hair. </p>
<p>Likewise, moles were probably not selected for due to their usefulness. Rather, they are just a side effect of the overall makeup of our skin/pigment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
