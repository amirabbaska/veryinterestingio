		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because since I was old enough to wash dishes, I've probably washed dishes 12000 times (once a day for 35 years, just to make it easy). I've done about 5500 loads of laundry. I've taken the trash out about 4000 times. I've gone to work about 6000 days. For my future? Assuming that at 43, I'm at a half-way point in my life &amp; don't die early, I get to wash dishes at least another 10000 times. Another 5000 loads of laundry. Another 4000 trash days. I'm not going to be able to take a full retirement (too broke, all my life) so I get to work at least another 6000 days.</p>
<p>I've been broke most of my life, so I know how to entertain myself in old-fashioned ways. I embroider, I read, I like to color, I garden. There's a lot to do and see here in Las Vegas - it's not like I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere. I can leave my house &amp; be surrounded by free entertainment in every direction. I'm married, have a dog &amp; two snakes, so I spend time with the hubster and the pets. So I do have things that occupy some of my time. </p>
<p>But it's the rest of the time... all that <em>time</em>. I tried practicing Buddhist mindfulness for a long time to get through my daily chores and work. I've tried to take pleasure in the simple acts of routine that make up each day. Each 24-hour cycle. Each 1440 minutes. Each 86400 seconds. But for some reason, I can't look forward to the next round of dishes. I don't look forward to gathering up the laundry or the trash. It never ever <em>ends</em>. I look forward to dying because it means I will never have to do another load of dishes again. I will never have to go to work again. I will never have to do another load of laundry or bag up another bag of garbage. I will never have to peel another carrot or make inane chit-chat with a hotel guest. I will die and it will be over. Finally. </p>
<p>But people around me seem to get upset when I say &quot;Man, I cannot wait to die! I am looking forward to being dead!&quot; So I drink, smoke weed, and play pointless video games because it helps me escape, and when I fantasize I fantasize about having enough money to have a fucking maid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is the central point of Buddhism actually. </p>
<p>Life is essentially unsatisfactory. You don't get what you want, you get what you don't want. When you get what you want, it isn't all that you had hoped, doesn't last as long as you want, would be even better if you just had that other thing too. </p>
<p>I think it all arises from the very nature of consciousness and the mistaken belief that we are supposed to be happy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an oft quoted and really beautiful paragraph from Shirley Jackson's <em>The Haunting on Hill House,</em> which reads, </p>
<p><em>“No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream.”</em></p>
<p>That makes some sense to me; that no one can stay sane without some reprieve from reality. Jackson cites dreams here but anything -in my opinion- can work. Nicotine, alcohol, opiates, sex, food, a good film, hobbies, meditation, etc. </p>
<p>Without those things, I don't honestly know if I would be more or less sane but I suspect that total abstinence might have done more harm than good; at least for me. </p>
<p>I don't know if it's boredom that scares me or idleness or just the idea of a world without the 'magic' of dream and fantasy. But I alter my head space when I need because, for whatever reason, I just don't feel comfortable in my own skin. The universe and nature seem totally indifferent to my existence and the bleakness of my perception is less horrifying when I know that I can escape it. </p>
<p>But that's only <em>my</em> experience. I can't speak for anyone else. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a strongly reinforced evolutionary survival trait.</p>
<p>Human behavior is balanced by &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot;.  I am using perjoritive political terms, my pardon, but I don't know off hand the proper names.  By &quot;conservative&quot; I mean behavior that is a human tribe/person staying in one area, where sources of water, food, and shelter are well established.  It is safe.  </p>
<p>&quot;Progressive&quot; on the other hand, is the behavior you are describing.  A person/tribe that believes it can find better water, food, or shelter somewhere else.  It is a risk, or gamble.  But it has paid off for humans (in aggregate, over time, your results may vary).  Humans have spread across the planet to all continents save Antarctica (discounting research stations).  </p>
<p>Further, I'd reckon that wishing, even for something fantastical, is the spur of technological innovation as well as religions.  Why pound grain by hand if we could invent something better?  Where do we go when we die?</p>
<p>Lastly, the human brain is remarkably optimistic.  Studies find that people, constantly think the future is going to work out better than our experience predict.  Not like flying cars, talking dogs, or a diet soda that actually taste good.  But rather that the stock they invest in will go up, or they don't need health insurance because they are healthy now.</p>
<p>All this behavior is hardwired into the brain.  We get a little squirt of dopamine when <em>anticipating</em> a happy reward.  <strong>Sometimes, we get more of a squirt anticipating the reward than actually receiving the reward</strong>!  Gambling addicts get their &quot;fix&quot; by <em>almost</em> winning, not by losing (obvious), but not by winning either (wtf!).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've come to hate magical thinking because I think it shows a profound lack of appreciation for how awesome reality and life are, just on their own.</p>
<p>For example, I tried so many times as a kid to move objects with my mind. I was convinced that if I just tried hard enough, I could do it. I desperately wanted to have some kind of power that could reach out and lift that apple out of the bowl and bring it to me.</p>
<p>Eventually, I realized I do have that power. It's called an arm. <em>Just by thinking it</em> I can cause my arm to reach out and grab that apple. The human arm and hand are an engineering marvel, capable of everything from playing piano to painting a masterpiece to hammering in nails. The hand is incredible: strong, articulate, sensitive, and it operates in pure silence. And I've got one, attached to my brain, just waiting for me to give it the slightest impulse. Hell, I've got <em>two</em>. Duh! Why did I obsess over stupid telekinesis??</p>
<p>It's like people praying to an imaginary god up in the sky who created our world and gave us all life, when in fact the Sun is right fucking there in the sky, not imaginary, and literally sustains all of us by bringing warmth and sunlight, which feeds plants, creating all food in the world. Who makes the wind blow? Who made the clouds? Who can make it rain and sustain our crops? What unseen good should we do a dance for or kill a chicken for? None! The fucking <em>sun,</em> idiots, it's <em>right there!</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
