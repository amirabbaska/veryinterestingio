Why does a geometric ratio play such importance that it withstood evolution? </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks reddit for collectively taking my Front Page V-card. What are some applications of the golden ratio not related to biology and nature?<br />
Some people stated that the golden ratio in design it is a good starting point, i've used it for its convergence properties. Any others?</p></div></div>
