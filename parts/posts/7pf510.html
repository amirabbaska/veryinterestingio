		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My name is Sarah McAnulty and I'm a squid biologist at The University of Connecticut! I am currently trying to understand how the Hawaiian bobtail squid's immune system is able to tell the difference between the squid's bioluminescent bacterial partner and other kinds of bacteria. I've worked with cuttlefish camouflage in the past, and worked with octopuses before too! I spend most of time raising squid and working with a confocal microscope, taking videos of the squid's immune cells as they interact with bacteria. On the side I organize a program called Skype a Scientist which matches classrooms and scientists around the world to chat about science! </p>
<p>You can read more about my squid science here: <a href="http://bit.ly/2mj24oC" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2mj24oC</a> </p>
<p>And more about Skype a Scientist here:  www.skypeascientist.com</p>
<p>I've also been on Science Friday twice, once to talk squid and another to talk about Skype a Scientist! You can check out those interviews here: <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/person/sarah-mcanulty/" target="_blank">https://www.sciencefriday.com/person/sarah-mcanulty/</a></p>
<p>I'll be on from 12-2 ET (17-19 UT), ask me anything!</p></div></div>

<p>I'd like us to have a look at the historically important but now extinct orthocone nautilo√Øds. In paleo classes, they are usually presented to us as essentially &quot;Squids with shells&quot;. How valid is this analogy, from the perspective of someone with a strong familiarity and understanding of actual squids, and if that image is not that great where does the comparison break down?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
