		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not really that the spandex is allowing the cotton to become more stretchy, it's that the spandex (until it is stretched) is retaining the tight/original shape of the garment.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking of a garment-with-spandex vs an equally tight garment-without spandex, think instead of a garment-with-spanex against a looser garment-without-spandex.  The looser garment is roughly as loose as the maximum stretch of the 'garment-with-spandex.'  The addition of the spandex keeps the garment/weave tight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can easily stretch most knit cotton clothing. The problem is that it has limited elasticity, so it will mostly stay stretched. The elastic spandex mixed in causes the fabric to return to its original shape. Woven cotton fabrics, for example denim, have much more limited capacity to stretch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hold up your ten fingers and put elastic between 1/2 of them and solid/unstretchable fabric between the other half.  </p>
<p>That configuration allow more movement across all your fingers than if you have unstretchable fabric between all fingers.  </p>
<p>So...it's an every-other-thread consideration. In reality only the spandex threads stretched, they are just interlaced with others.  E.G. in 1/3 spandex every 3rd one stretches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
