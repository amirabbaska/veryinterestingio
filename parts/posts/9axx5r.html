		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey reddit!</p>
<p>I'm Paul Sutter, an astrophysicist and science advisor for the film UFO, starring Gillian Anderson, David Strathairn, Alex Sharp, and Ella Purnell. I am not nearly as beautiful as any of those people, which is why I'm here typing to you about science.</p>
<p>The film is about a college kid who is convinced he's recorded an alien signal. I helped writer/director Ryan Eslinger, plus the cast and crew, make sure the science made sense. And considering such topics as the Drake Equation, the fine-structure constant, 21cm radiation, and linear algebra are all (uncredited) costars in the movie, it was a real blast.</p>
<p>I also briefly appear in one scene. I had lines but they didn't make the final cut, which I'm not bitter about at all.   </p>
<p>Besides my research at The Ohio State University, I'm also the chief scientist at COSI Science Center here in dazzlingly midwestern Columbus, Ohio. I host the &quot;Ask a Spaceman!&quot; podcast and YouTube series, and I'm the author of the forthcoming Your Place in the Universe (which is like Cosmos but sarcastic and not a TV show). I do a bunch of other livestreams, science+art productions, and TV appearances, too. I also consult for movies, I guess.</p>
<p>I'll be on from 2-4pm ET (19-21 UT), so AMA about the science of UFO, the science of the universe, and/or relationship advice. As I tell my students: my door is always open, except when it's closed.</p></div></div>

<p>As we all know you truly do not know what you want to do with your life when your 11. Regardless my 11 year old nephew wants to be a astrophysicist, which I am ecstatic for. He’s smart, a hard worker and creative. What advise would you give your 11 year old self to prepare you for the work you do? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for doing this AMA! You do a lot of outreach, which is really cool. What sort of approaches do you find are most engaging to the public? </p>
<p>Also, what’s the process like for being a scientific advisor on a film? Do you offer a strictly scientific option on and let them run with it, or do you try to thread a needle between fantasy and reality? What is your goal when doing this advising in terms of what you want people to take away from a film?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What is your advice to someone interested in computational Magnetohydrodynamics? (assume familiarity with numerical methods in general)<br />
What are the mayor shortcomings of the Lambda-CDM model?<br />
What is, in your opinion, the most awe inspiring thing about astrophysics?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
