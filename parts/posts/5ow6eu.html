We've designed a free online course, '<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-change-challenges-and-solutions" target="_blank">Climate Change: Challenges and Solutions</a>' to show you some of the science behind Climate Change, present the challenges and identify potential solutions to these global problems. Today we want to open this up to r/askscience, so please ask us anything about Climate Change!</p>
<p>Professor Tim Lenton is actively researching tipping points in the Earth system, especially the Climate system, and identifying early warning signs for them. He is also studying the revolutionary transformations of the Earth System, including the co-evolution of life and the planet. Dr Damien Mansell's principal research interests include the calving processes of tidewater-terminating glaciers, glacier surges, cryosphere instabilities and remote sensing for glaciological applications. His teaching specialises in GIS and remote sensing techniques and understanding the cryosphere.</p>
<p>We'll be on starting at 4pm UK time (11 AM ET)!</p></div></div>
