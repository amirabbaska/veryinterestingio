		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whether or not something gets censored depends on who the medium is geared towards, kind of like a TV rating, only for music.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, artists will release a Clean version and an Explicit version. The Clean version can also be called the Radio Edit (which may or may not also be edited for length). The Radio Edit is meant to be aired on radio and on TV. The censorship means it won't face any/many restrictions on where and when it can be aired (the time of the day, for example).</p>
<p>A random and overzealous example is the Just Dance videogame series, which is targeted at people of all ages, but is favoured by a lot of kids. They're a bit overzealous with their censorship to appease parents. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;<strong><em>Cherry</em></strong> chapstick&quot; in &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; due to the potential double entendre despite the fact that Katy Perry is clearly singing about the taste of an actual chapstick. The whole theme of kissing a girl is left intact, though.</li>
<li>&quot;Bitch&quot; (understandable) and &quot;Vertical <strong><em>stick</em></strong>&quot; in &quot;Bad Romance&quot; due to the double entendre.</li>
<li>The word &quot;God&quot; in the phrase &quot;Oh my God&quot; in &quot;Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)&quot; in the lyrics shown on screen. The word can still be heard, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, certain radio stations don't censor anything ever because their target audiences are college kids and older.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So former community radio program director here, and this is the number one thing I had to deal with.
So, like many have said, the FCC does have some rules governing content, and a lot of them seem like they don't apply here. So, as a quick breakdown, these are the rules that the FCC has for ALL radio stations:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are 2 categories of foul language: indecent and obscene.
-indecent language includes some sexual language (like &quot;giving head&quot;) and excrement words (like shit and piss) that are used as expletives (like, &quot;you are a piece of shit&quot; instead of &quot;i shit on your face&quot;). Indecent language can be aired during &quot;safe harbor hours&quot; which are officially 10pm to 5am, but many stations revise it back to Midnight to 5am.
-Obscene language is excrement words (aforementioned shit and piss) used anatomically, as well as crude words for anatomy (cock, cunt, pussy, asshole) and Fuck. Fuck has recently been moved to indecent language as long as it is not used sexually, but most stations have stuck to the old rules for safety. These words can NEVER be aired.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, there is one more rule for all stations, and it essentially addresses what you are talking about here. It's called &quot;community standards&quot;. It's why if you are driving through a city with a significant African American population, you may here hip hop songs with the N-word uncensored, and if you drive through rural Montana, you will still hear the bleeped version of &quot;A boy named sue&quot;. Community standards cover a lot of ground, and different stations, even in the same town, can have different rules. Some stations bleep &quot;goddamn&quot;, others &quot;Bitch&quot; and some may remove drug references from contemporary songs. It literally comes down to what the management thinks will get them the least number of reports to the FCC.
I'm glad that you brought up &quot;Cocaine&quot; specifically, because this is where the whole system falls apart: &quot;Classic&quot; songs often get a pass from just about everyone, because as a society we tend to institutionalize things with time and power. &quot;Who are you&quot; is a great example because it has two really solid &quot;Fuck&quot;s in it. Same with &quot;Rocks Off&quot;. People don't find old stuff offensive, to the point where they don't hear the swears. Radio stations often have digital libraries of almost ALL the oldies, and they just throw them on willy nilly. Someone also brought up that the labels do a shitty job of censoring stuff, but often time that stuff is passed to the promoters, who have too many releases and too little time to censor, much less mark up, all the swears on an album.
Finally, the FCC is not listening. period. they depend on your average citizen to report violations. Oftentimes the only people reporting these violations are, well, elderly or given to a worldview that promotes moral strictures on all things. This is why, despite likely airing one F-word per day, a College Radio Station has never been fined by the FCC, but they were RIGHT on it when Janet Jackson's nipple came out (sidenote: this is also why TV is way overcautious with censorship- more people watch TV than listen to the radio).</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>tl;dr/ELI5: there are basic swears and things that the FCC deals directly with, but mostly it's left up to &quot;community standards&quot;, which are mostly decided by radio professionals. These professionals are often boomers/boomer-centric, and so classic rock songs get a pass while more modern music (ie. Hip Hop) gets the shaft, and nobody reports a goddamn thing unless millions of people see/hear it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Years ago I sent an email to a radio station asking pretty much this exact question.  There response was basically that the FCC is fucked up.  The radio stations censor out things that they think will generate complaints to the FCC and let slide things that don't generate complaints.  This, as someone else pointed out, is also dependent on the time of day.  Late at night there aren't as many people likely to complain as there are in the middle of the day.  In the middle of the day you are more likely to get parents complaining that their children heard those lyrics where as in the middle of the night it is less likely that their children are listening to the radio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The record companies bleep out the weed references themselves - governments don't do it for them.</p>
<p>They do it because it increases their sales. It lets the 'album' version be better than what you get by recording the radio or listening to youtube, incentivizing you to buy. It also lets them play the radio edit in high schools without fighting the administration or any censorship committees. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, I'm still baffled how The Bloodhound Gang continues to get away with extremely dirty lyrics. How did they get played uncensored?!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
