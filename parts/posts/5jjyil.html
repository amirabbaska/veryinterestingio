		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common answer that was given to me during my training was that working an extended shift allows one to see and understand the evolution of an acute disease process through the patient's initial presentation and progression through therapy.  The more of that illness you are physically present for and participating in, the greater the learning and reinforcement in your mind.</p>
<p>I was never really satisfied with that answer, and it's partially BS - some of it has some credence.  But in reality, the real answers are multifactorial.  I'll list some of the reasons here.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Medicine has a very strong sense of tradition.  It is a hierarchical structure and is deeply committed to the preservation of standards.  I found it to be very much like the military.  The &quot;father&quot; of the American medical training system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stewart_Halsted" target="_blank">William Stewart Halsted</a> was known to work exhaustively and expect the same of his trainees - men like Cushing and Dandy.  Later on, brilliant surgeons such as Michael Debakey continued to promote the necessity of 100% devotion to the patient in the form of grueling work hours and little to no time off.  There are countless war stories of these men and their often brutal treatment of their trainees. I remember one apocryphal story about Debakey taking the new interns to the main hospital lobby doors and telling them they wouldn't go through those doors for the next year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also an ingrained culture of &quot;I trained this way, and you must also in order to be a competent physician&quot;.  If I had a dollar for every time during training that I was told the ACGME work hour restrictions were creating terrible doctors, I'd be able to pay of my student loans before the next millenium.  Since the dawn of time, old crusty docs have been bemoaning how easy the residents of today have it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nobody becomes a physician without at least some sense of altruism, even the most craven among us.  When there are sick patients to be seen, it's really hard to mentally justify &quot;going home to go to sleep&quot; when someone or some family is having the worst day of their life.  It sounds trite, but when someone is sick and needs my help, I have a really hard time assigning a higher priority to my own rest.  (That's probably partially my Catholic guilt).  Human misery is endless and does not rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicine is not a 9-5 job.  People will always get sick at odd hours, and someone will always need to be available to do an emergent thoracotomy at 2am.  You can't work shifts as a trauma surgeon.  There just aren't enough of them, and I doubt there ever will be.  The training is too long and arduous to ever expect to get to a supply of trauma docs (or Ob-Gyns, or Pediatricians) where every little hospital in the US has enough of them to staff rotating shifts like nurses.</p>
</li>
<li>There is an enormous amount of work to be done in today's hospital, and so much of it is clerical.  Services need to be covered with residents, call schedules, back up call schedules, vacations, clinic hours, etc.  Those 24 or more hour shifts allow residents to have some precious days off once in a while.  </li>
</ul>
<p>-Finally, and I know may people will howl at this point, but I do feel working 28 hour shifts made me a better doctor.  I know it did.  Specifically, it taught me to think on my feet, prioritize, and overcome (to a degree) fatigue.  I am not claiming I am immune to fatigue or that I am as effective after hour 26 as I am after hour 4. The ACGME and many others like to make a big deal about work hour restrictions during residency, but what never gets talked about is that for many of us docs, life after residency can be even harder.  And there are ZERO restrictions on the hours attendings work.  In my past job (which I quit) after working all day in the office and rounding in the hospital, I was expected to take phone calls for ED admissions and for moronic patient questions all night long, every 4th night.  I did that for 5 years.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Thank you all so much for the gold!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an internal medicine resident in Canada. </p>
<p>The maximum we work is generally 26 hours but I have had some days as long as 30 hours (which go against our residency contract, but anyway...) We are not necessarily awake the whole time, I would say I am usually able to get at least a short 30min nap, but I have had many many sleepless nights and days. Some services may do weekend call where they are on call for 72 hours straight but not in hospital. That being said, all you need are a couple bad cases or unfortunate things to happen and you could be working nearly straight all weekend. </p>
<p>One of the variables most closely associated with errors is patient hand over, so partly one reason why we work these hours is to reduce the number of times a patients care is handed over. I imagine it like a game of telephone where a phrase is whispered around the circle and by the end of it sounds totally different.</p>
<p>Personally I have not noted making any catastrophic mistakes towards the end of a shift but I do not do procedures as a rule overnight or at end of a call shift unless absolutely necessary. I know I have definitely forgotten information when handing over to the next physician in the morning though just from sheer exhaustion. Also, I know residents who have been in accidents when driving home from the hospital after being awake for 30+ hours. </p>
<p>In terms of &quot;why not increase the number of residents/medical students&quot; question - it's slightly different in Canada due to our healthcare system. Our resident salary is government funded and so the government determines how many residency spots they are willing to fund each year. This is in turn determined by things like patient loads and safety, job prospects (eg. neurosurgery jobs are tough to come by so there are fewer residents each year). So it's not as simple as just opening up more spots, because ultimately the money has to come from somewhere AND this person needs a job at the end of all of this 13 years of post secondary education. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to the continuity of care. My wife is an OB/GYN. When she's on Labor and Delivery, patients could easily be in labor for 20 hours. If she arrived at hour 10 and left at hour 18, that means she picked the case up from another doctor, and handed it off to a third. Having one doctor present for all or at least the majority of a case is important. When she leaves a case in the middle, it's not uncommon for her to have to continue dealing with it via text/phone/email after she's gone, so she may as well still be there.</p>
<p>Additionally, student doctors can only learn while they're there. Every case doesn't come in from 9-5, and sometimes surgeries can run a really long time. If you were to cut work shifts down to 8 hours you'd have to keep them in Residency for far longer to make up the simple amount of &quot;hours in training&quot; they need to be exposed to enough cases to learn how to handle them on their own. They're called &quot;resident physicians&quot; for a reason-- they used to <em>live</em> at the hospital. </p>
<p>One other thing that sticks out, is that Intern (first year of residency) hours were strictly limited to 16 hours the year after my wife finished her intern year, when the limit was 30 hours. What this meant for the new interns, was that they no longer had what were called &quot;golden weekends&quot; once or twice a month. (A weekend where you get both Friday and Saturday off. The rest of us just call that a &quot;weekend&quot;.) Because they were limited to 16 hour call shifts, they wound up working at least one shift every single Saturday or Sunday, so while you may be less tired for each shift, new residents never get a chance to actually be away from work to refresh and relax.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that it's not like being forced to sit in a cubicle for 30 hours straight. They have call rooms where they can take naps (not that they always get the opportunity), and you're also a part of a team. No one is working alone for 30 hours straight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was talking to my mother who is a surgeon in the NHS about this a couple of days ago and it boils down to this.</p>
<p>No, doctors don't want to do these insane hours they'd rather go home to their families especially this time of year. But these days doctors are expected to see at least double the amount of patients than they should because of budget cuts. Combined with a policy to never be able to willingly turn down a patient since it could be months before they could come in again, doctors end up working these insane hours. They know it is unsafe but they have only two other options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They just go home, leaving the patient in the hands of whoever is on shift next which at best causes them to wait several hours for what may amount to 20 minutes of consultation and at worst may cause the patient to be misdiagnosed due to poor communication which can be fatal.</p>
</li>
<li>They go work in the private sector. This is something that here in the UK most experienced doctors are woo-ed by the private sector constantly. In the private sector you get to work half the hours (only 8-10) for over double the pay. The only downside is that you're going to be leaving the NHS which will only struggle more and more as government officials critisize it for not being perfect, slash its budget, then critsize it again until the public is in favor to turn the whole thing into an insurance based system. Which would leave millions unable to pay for healthcare. When I ask around most doctors are unable to make that moral compromise. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cardiac surgeon here. In my field it is primarily because there just aren't enough warm bodies with our (my) training to do all the work that is required.  NPs and PAs can only do so much.  Transplants happen at night, elective cases happen during the day, emergencies happen at any time. You catch sleep when you can, but, when you are on call/post-call, you are either in the OR, in clinic, taking care of ICU patients, or dealing with clerical stuff.  The work literally never ends. It is not uncommon for me to be in the hospital for 60-72hrs straight. 24hr shifts are a blessing. Do I think it's the best way to function?  Definitely not. But until you can convince people to go through 8 years of schooling, 7-10yrs of grueling post-graduate training, all while accumulating interest on massive debt and making the equivalent of minimum wage...nothing will change. Regardless of what the federal government says about work hour regulation. Physicians (for the most part) aren't just going to walk away from a dying patient. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
