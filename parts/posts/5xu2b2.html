		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was taught that it counteracts excess of calcium, and helps the body use potassium better, and a bath would reduce pain from muscle cramping, not just any pain.  However when I went to find a way to explain this clearer I came across this site <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0048475/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0048475/</a>
from the US National library of medicine with a study that concluded:</p>
<p>&quot;Authors' conclusions: It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy‐associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this patient population is needed. We found no randomized controlled trials evaluating magnesium for exercise‐associated muscle cramps or disease state‐associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease).&quot;</p>
<p>TL;DR  I think I was lied to, there is no reliable research saying it does</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Floating in water helps relieve pressure on joints and so/also lets muscles relax.</p>
<p>The denser the water the more, and more easily, you float.</p>
<p>Tubs are kind-of small.</p>
<p>So if you could float vertically in a pool you'd get a lot of relief, but your mouth and nose holes would be beneath the water line. So the optimal floating system would be basically a pool deeper than you are tall with a SCUBA or snorkel deal to let you breathe without struggling to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Most people can't afford that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So adding Epsom Salt to a regular bath tub of water increases the density of the water and so you &quot;float more&quot;. Regular salt would do the same thing but it's much, much more expensive for the same results.</p>
<p>The salt isn't soaking into your skin or anything, it's just making the water into a solution that supports your body weight more effectively in the restricted space and so lets your muscles relax more fully and takes more pressure off your joints.</p>
<p>Now back in the day (say a hundred years ago) the average bathtub was longer and the average person was shorter. So the average person could lie down fully in the average tub. This made Epsom Salt baths particularly effective. It also led to a lot of drowning and such, particularly since laudanum, alcohol, and other sedatives were really popular. So for safety the tubs have been made significantly shorter. Short enough so that the average person can get/keep their head above water by just straightening their legs.</p>
<p>With this infrastructure change the efficacy of an Epsom Salt bath has been greatly reduced, so it's fallen out of favor. You have to isolate the part you need to float. So treating a knee is pretty easy, but treating a shoulder or back requires some contortion that may not be available in a built-in tub, by putting your legs up outside the tub at the far end.</p>
<p>But if you can ever find a nice six-foot cast-iron tub from a hundred or so years ago, I definitely recommend the experience. Just don't fall asleep and let your head go under. It's really unpleasant to inhale that stuff. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part it is all anecdotal.  What really happens is the warm water you soak in increases blood flow to your muscles.  It does this because your capillaries expand when exposed to heat.   That increased blood flow allows the muscles to heal and grow more muscle tissue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have no proof that it does work. There is no known mechanism by which the chemical would penetrate your skin and actually get to the place where the pain originates. Our skin is very good at preventing things from simply leaking in. You could sit in a hot bath all day and you'd actually lose weight from all the sweating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't, directly. You could put whatever you want into the water and it'll do the same thing (as long as it's not something that will cause you any harm). It's more about the relaxing process of the bath and its effect on your perception of the pain. So, pick whatever makes you feel good and go for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
