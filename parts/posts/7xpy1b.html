<p>EDIT: Wow, thank you for all of the great answers; I’m learning a lot. Soon, my poops will be pristine!</p>
<hr />
<p>The answer to “Which type of fiber should I consume?” seems to be, perhaps unsurprisingly, “It depends.” And there are a lot of people getting medical-condition-specific answers, and that’s <em>awesome</em>—in fact, that’s what prompted me to ask this question in the first place. </p>
<p>In the interest of accessibility for anyone who would like to jump into a discussion, I would like to organize the topics of some of the lower comment threads here that have jumped out at me:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soluble fiber attracts water and turns to gel during digestion. This slows digestion. Soluble fiber is found in oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables. It is also found in psyllium, a common fiber supplement. Some types of soluble fiber may help lower risk of heart disease.</p>
<p>Insoluble fiber is found in foods such as wheat bran, vegetables, and whole grains. It adds bulk to the stool and appears to help food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soluble fiber absorbs liquid in the digestive tract to form gel-like substances and is found in fruits (pectin), oats, nuts, and legumes among others.</p>
<p>Insoluble fiber does not absorb liquid and is made of the indigestible materials in foods like fruit skins, certain vegetables, whole grain products and whole grain rice among others.</p>
<p>Fiber is needed by the body to aid your intestines in moving food along and make stool (poo) easier to pass. The fiber binds the stool together and can even absorb cholesterol, preventing some from entering your bloodstream. Low calorie high fiber foods are popular in diets because they bulk up in the stomach after absorbing liquid making you feel full with less food. Many medical conditions can be alleviated with regular fiber consumption such as constipation, hemerrhoids, incontinence, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bonus benefit that I haven't seen anyone say yet. The microbes in your gut feed off of fiber, particularly insoluble fiber, and produce really good nutrients for us from it. These microbial byproducts help feed the cells that line our intestine and keep that barrier healthy and they also help keep the gut immune system in check reducing inflammation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
