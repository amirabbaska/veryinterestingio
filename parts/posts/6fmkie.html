The hope is that these companies will grow into profitable companies. So the value of the company today, is it's current value + its expected value at some point in the future. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>And don't forget value of assets - your house is worth money, but it doesn't generate income. Massive factories full of machines to build electric cars are worth a lot of money even if you didn't use them to build cars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those companies are in growth mode, where they have to spend a ton to build scale... and that costs  a lot of money. More than they currently take in. But long term, the spend will be reduced while revenues climb and they'll be profitable.</p>
<p>In Tesla's case, it's spending a ton of money to build a HUGE battery plant near Reno and doing R&amp;D for development of their Model 3. Once that $35k model hits the market is should be a giant seller for them and they'll sell many times over the number of vehicles they currently sell of their higher end Model S and Model X.</p>
<p>In Uber's case, they are spending money to lobby and litigate for approval to operate, as well as discounting rides and giving new driver bonuses to drivers because their model is based on having a huge pool of both drivers and riders. Once they build up that critical mass (and weaken the existing taxi industry) they can pull back the spend on those expenses while seeing ridership increase.</p>
<p>So the current valuations aren't based on current sales/profits, but on the anticipated profits in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former investment baking analyst. </p>
<p>Profit or earnings is a very misleading figure especially for companies in the growth stage. Typically free cash flows are used instead for valuations. Companies such as Amazon have revenue growths have been in the 20-30% range year over year. That growth requires substantial investment in assets such as warehouses and distribution networks that erode annual profits to practically nothing. Counterintuitively, annual losses for a growing company can be a good thing if money being spent on building the company and they are growing at a rate to justify it. Making a prolifit and have nothing to do with excess cash  can be seen as a negative sign as the company has nowhere to reinvest that money. </p>
<p>The value of a company is not based on current earnings but the present value of all potential future earnings and cumulative probabilities. GM makes money annually, but as a mature company has limited growth prospects and expectations from the market. Tesla is expected to grow at a rate and probability to justify its current valuation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You appear to be looking at things a bit too directly. The &quot;value&quot; of a company is not summed up <em>solely</em> in how much Profit they produce. It's also in how much <em>potential</em> to profit that they have, and what assets they have. Tesla and Uber have some <em>serious</em> Income, and that Income covers their day-to-day expenses. They appear to be &quot;losing&quot; money because they're spending <em>a lot</em> of money on expansion.</p>
<p>As a general rule, it's cheaper to maintain what you have than it is to build something new. However, building something new also lets you access new potential customers. If you're smart in how you expand, you can increase the potential profit <em>dramatically</em>.</p>
<p>Basically: Instead of trying to build up a cash-surplus, Tesla is spending all of its profit, investor money, and <em>maybe</em> some reasonable loans on building new assets. They might be expanding their ability to manufacture cars, running R&amp;D, building Showrooms, or the Quick-Charge Stations that make the Cars more practical (and thus more desirable/profitable).</p>
<p>It's <em>assumed</em> by Investors that Tesla and Uber will eventually slow down their rate of expansion. When that happens, all those Expansion Expenses will disappear... leaving only the Profit that used to be spent on expansion behind. That is when payday comes for the investors that got in while Tesla or Uber was cheap, and then rode out the expansion period. Once the Business is &quot;matured,&quot; their stock will be worth much more and they'll likely get dividends and payouts from the company.</p>
<p>Basically: Tesla and Uber are worth a lot because Investors believe that they will, in a few years (5 to 10) be worth <strong>a lot more</strong>. Those Investors are in it for the long haul... or just to hold onto the stock for a few years and then sell it off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
