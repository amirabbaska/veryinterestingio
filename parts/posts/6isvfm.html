		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey so I've been thinking about this for a while and would like a definitive answer.</p>
<p>If I lived on a torus planet where the cross-section of the torus was the diameter of the earth and the hole in the middle of the torus was around the distance from the earth to the moon. Assuming the torus is not rotating so no artificial gravity. Where would gravity pull me towards? My slightly educated guess would be the center of mass of the torus.</p>
<p>If this is the case then my follow up question would be, if gravity is weaker over distance, could I increase the size of this torus to the point where I would no longer be pulled to the centre?</p>
<p>Edit: I'd like to do a reverse question because a lot of people are saying that I would be pulled towards the surface of the Torus, is there a scenario where the pull to the centre of mass is greater than the pull to the surface?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Such planet would fall apart rather quickly. If there's no rotation, there's nothing preventing the torus collapsing into itself due to gravity.</p>
<p>What do you mean by center? The middle of the whole torus (where's empty) or the middle of the section of the ring?</p>
<p>It reminds me of this interesting video on the matter: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J4iIBKJHLA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J4iIBKJHLA</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There wouldn't always be a force towards the center. There would always be a force towards the plane of the torus. But the radial component would vary on the surface. For example on the inner surface of the torus i.e. the closest point to the center. The force would be close to zero, if not exactly zero, on the far side of the torus, the force would be strong and toward the center, on the top or bottom of the torus the force would have a strong component towards the center plane and weak or zero component towards the center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people are getting this calculation wrong. You have to be careful with your assumptions.</p>
<p>Since you're very small relative to the size of the torus, the surface gravity can be approximated by finding the gravity of a cylindrical mass. </p>
<p>Surface gravity from the chunk right under you will be overwhelmingly stronger than effects from the rest of the torus, which are much further away. </p>
<p>To find the gravity of a cylinder, you must use the Gaussian formulation of gravity. Newton's law only works for spheres or other shapes at a long distance.</p>
<p>I'll skip the derivation, but you can find it <a href="http://www.pgccphy.net/103/gravity.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. The formula for gravity on a cylinder is: g = (2Gλ)/r, where λ is the linear mass density and r is distance. </p>
<p>I'm assuming your torus has the same density as Earth. So the linear mass density is: pi <em> Earth's radius ^ 2 </em> Earth's density. </p>
<p>Plugging in values: λ = 7.033×10^18 g/cm <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=pi+*+\(earth+radius\)%5E2+*+\(earth+density\)" target="_blank">(calculation)</a></p>
<p>We already have G and r, so we just plug in everything else to find surface gravity:</p>
<p>g = 14.73 m/s^2 <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(7.033%C3%9710%5E18+g%2Fcm+*+2+*+G\)+%2F+\(earth+radius\)&amp;rawformassumption=%7B%22MC%22,+%22earth+radius%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%7B%22Planet%22,+%22a+planet%22%7D%7D&amp;rawformassumption=%22UnitClash%22+-%3E+%7B%22G%22,+%7B%22GravitationalConstantWGS84%22%7D%7D" target="_blank">(calculation)</a></p>
<p>So gravity on this torus is a good bit stronger than gravity on Earth. This makes intuitive sense, because there's more mass near you standing on a cylinder than there is with a sphere of the same radius. </p>
<p>This is accurate within a few percent. Gravity from the very distance regions can be neglected. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't sat down to do the maths, and won't have time today, but any point inside a charged spherical shell feels no net electric field (the close bits exert a larger force per chunk of shell, but the further away bits are more numerous, and they cancel out). I'm pretty sure that applies to gravity too [just checked, yes it does <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Mechanics/sphshell2.html" target="_blank">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Mechanics/sphshell2.html</a>].</p>
<p>A torus isn't a shell, but precisely on the inside edge it should have a similar balancing effect. You can float in that plain, within the inner edge. if you stray out of the plane (through the holes, so to speak) there will be a restoring force pushing you back.</p>
<p>[Edit]: I've spotted a flaw in my logic; the gravity decreases proportional to radius squared, while surface area of a sphere increases by that proportion. A circle circumference increases proportional to 2*the radius. So wouldn't scale as quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the aspect ratio of the torus.  If you have a relatively thin torus (Ring thickness &lt;&lt; Ring Diameter) it would behave like /u/eliminate1337 suggests.  It would be like living on a cylinder.  </p>
<p>If you have a relatively fat torus (Ring thickness ~1/2x Ring Diameter) then you would be pulled to the center of mass.  If you were standing on the inner diameter, you would fall &quot;up.&quot;</p>
<p>Someone who was so inlined could calculate the aspect ratio at which the dominant mechanism changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
