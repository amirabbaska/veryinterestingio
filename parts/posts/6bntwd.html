<p>If I shoot one photon to an atom and the photon is absorbed, then, technically speaking, a shadow is cast. Even if the photon is deflected, a shadow is cast. However, a shadow is defined together with the light surrounding it. Our eyes need a few photons to reach our retina in order to see. It's a small number, we can see less than 10 photons already, I believe, but we can't see the shadow cast by one missing photon. And I don't think of any process that can cause a single atom to absorb a large number of photons all at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. A shadow is absence of light, relatively defined in existence contrapositovely to light. There is absence of light behind an atom, and a photon can't travel through an atom to our knowledge, so an atom is always casting a shadow parallel and anti-polar to the photon side of an atom, or photon is present. Otherwise it's just said to be in the dark.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>One of the ways that the structure of a molecule is determine is called x-ray crystallography. In order to look at things on an atomic scale you have to use a wave length short enough so the light wave doesn't just loop right around the atom. If you use very short wave radiation ( x-rays ) the light reflects (technically refracts) off of the  atoms in a molecule leaving a disticnt refraction pattern which can then be used to determine where the atoms are in the crystal. </p>
<p>To me this is the cloest you can get to an &quot;atomic shadow&quot; per se. Now you cant measure a sigle atom using this method but i assume the same properties apply and if you shined x-rays on a single atom it would cast a &quot;pseudo-shadow&quot;. But what do i know maybe thats not accurate at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
