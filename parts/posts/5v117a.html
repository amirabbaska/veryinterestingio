		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're describing the tip of the tongue phenomenon. When we think of a word or thing, we have many cognitions: a visual memory of it, how the word looks when written, the sound it is in your language. When we know something starts with something but can't finish it, we're tapping into a less developed sense of sound and more of a visual or conceptual thing. In other words, we know what it is but can't locate the sounds without more thought. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party but there are a few theories on this. The term you're referring to is called presque vu. </p>
<p>My favorite of the theories that explains is this says this.</p>
<p>When you are searching for a word your brain tries to help you by blocking your access to other words that are similar or related. Some times your brain accidentally shuts the pathways to remembering the correct word. This is why you absolutely KNOW that you know the name of the actor who plays the bald pirate with the friend with 1 eye. Your brain has literally shut you out from &quot;Lee Arenberg&quot; when it may have been trying to keep you from remembering the name of your similarly named highschool physics teacher.</p>
<p>This also helps to explain why presque vu can be contagious. The social context and situation can have lots of people's brains acting similarly, especially when you're all pulling from a similar knowledge base. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens to me frequently. I'll say, &quot;Oh you know that guy... uhh... I can't remember his name. But he starts with a 'Z'.&quot; You can remember part of the word but not the whole word.</p>
<p>This is called the Tip of the Tongue phenomenon.</p>
<p>An occasional tip-of-the-tongue state is normal for people of all ages. TOT becomes more frequent as people age. TOT is only a medical condition when it becomes frequent enough to interfere with learning or daily life. This disorder is called anomic aphasia when acquired by brain damage, usually from a head injury, stroke, or dementia.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This feels like it might be a Psychology question not a Biology one.</p>
<p>Heuristic is a term that refers to a person's &quot;mental shortcuts&quot; when making decisions.
It's how you can see a bear in the woods and know to   get away.
Without heuristics, you would have to observe a big fluffy animal in the woods, and manually sort through your information about everything that fits your observations of what you're seeing.
Without out a shortcut, the bear would be on top of you while you're still trying to decide whether or not that thing with brown fur, four legs, ears, nose and a tail is a dog or not.</p>
<p>Because of a second psychological phenomenon called &quot;the Primacy Effect&quot; we remember the first thing we heard in a list better than the rest.</p>
<p>So now you have the first part of a word, and your brain is trying to make that fast connection based on all the words you've ever heard that start with the same letter. </p>
<p>Tl:dr - the part of the word you can remember is a clue to figure out the rest of the word. Problem is there are a whole lotta words to run through </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
