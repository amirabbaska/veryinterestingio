		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Private collections are actually a pretty big problem for disciplines such as archaeology. As pointed out in this thread, people with large amounts of money will buy these things, and this would be the targeted buyer for these items, as no one else would realistically have the money to buy them. From time to time items are discovered by descendants and gifted/sold to museums to add to their collection, but, for the most part, a lot of useful artifacts that could be used to answer a lot of questions about past human cultures remain in private collections. Anything from ancient clothing and jewelry to actual fossils of proto-homonins could be found in these collections.</p>
<p>Edit: as some people have pointed out, yes, some museums don't display their entire collections, for the public that is. Researchers can still get access to these collections for academic purposes, but getting access to a private collection is a much more difficult process. Also, museums, at least I assume, have much higher quality preservation technologies, and thus can better maintaining the quality of their collections. But I agree, it would be nice if museums could display their collections more</p>
<p>Edit #2: rereading this, I realize that maybe I shouldn't have used the word &quot;problem&quot; to describe private collections. I am coming from an anthropology background, so my bias points me to not being a big fan of people who keep their collections private instead of allowing them to be researched. While there are a lot of issues surrounding research done on private collections, my stance towards it is usually along the lines of &quot;better than nothing&quot;, but other people see it differently. Thanks to everyone for replying, I quite enjoyed the replies.</p>
<p>Edit #3: someone asked me for my credentials, and I realized that that would have been a good idea to post my original post; I am an *anthropology undergrad at the University of Waterloo. I apologize for not having put this earlier</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a reformed collector, you have to understand the collector 'mentality' and how diseased it can become over time. </p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why people collect things. At the best and most wholesome level, its because you're interested in something and collecting it can be a fun way to engage in that passion. Maybe you enjoy playing the vintage video games you had as a kid. Maybe you're interested in coins or stamps or you like reading comics from the mid 1970's. There's a large majority of 'collector sentiment' that's perfectly reasonable, sane and even worthwhile. </p>
<p>So lets say that the next 'level' of collecting (where a ton of people exist) is 'ego collecting' - that is, collecting things because you realize that they're impressive to other people and you have a deep, insecure desire to impress others. A ton of collecting is rooted in this sentiment. Same with the high end wristwatch market and other things. 'Collecting' can also become very competitive, where you collect not because you particularly 'enjoy' your collection anymore but because you're obsessively trying to make it 'the best'. </p>
<p>At the furthest end of the spectrum, you have people with a lot of money, with deep rooted 'collector' obsessions and very skewed values, that are willing to have something stolen so they can own it. These aren't common, but they're common enough that museums with shitty security practices can find themselves vulnerable. </p>
<p>A totally bang-on accurate quote from the movie Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Only the obsessive compulsive or the insecure egotistical feel the need to collect things.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of people in the world who don't care about laws, or the laws of other countries, or the property rights of other people. For example if you stole a piece of art from someone in England that a wealthy member of the royal family in Saudi Arabia wanted they probably don't care at all that it was stolen. African warlord/dictator? You could sell them a stolen baby much less art. Drug cartel leader? They break laws all the time, why would they care about that?</p>
<p>Many really wealthy people can basically ignore many laws in their own countries much less the laws of foreign countries. How is Scotland Yard going to search the palace of a Saudi prince? They aren't and they couldn't arrest the prince even if they wanted to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All these answers are basically correct.</p>
<p>I don't know how sophisticated the market for this stuff is nowadays, but I was in England nearly 20 years ago talking to a woman at a Heritage Trust manor estate.  Turns out she was one of the extended family members whose estate it was.</p>
<p>Long story short, at one point she had made enquiries about purchasing antiques and was given a catalog with pictures and prices of various objects - curios, furniture, etc.</p>
<p>Turns out, some of the pictures were of the estates' own stuff taken in situ.</p>
<p>Basically, if someone got an &quot;order&quot; for a piece (presumably paid p front), thieves would break in and steal the piece to fill the order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although other answers here are correct, I don't think any mention that stolen art and artifacts are often used as a sort of black market currency. Because it has some sort of intrinsic worth it doesn't really devalue the same way other goods might, it's much more compact than the 'equivalent' cash, and it can't be tracked the way that bank transfers can be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
