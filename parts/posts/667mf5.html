		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small towns have their quite modest memorials bearing the names of the men from that town who lost their lives. Often they were originally First World War memorials, and the names of WW2 soldiers were added to them.</p>
<p>The concern is the creation of Nazi shrines, so you won't see big memorials specifically for those who fought for the Nazi cause. You will see memorials dedicated to the victims of the Nazi regime, though, and the soldiers are seen as victims as much as anyone else. The emphasis is less on honouring brave souls who fought and died for their country, but on comemmorating those who died at the hands of a dictatorial regime.</p>

<p>In Germany there are a lot of roads and buildings referring to people that fought wars BEFORE world war one, mostly the 30 years war and the wars against France.</p>
<p>But finding anything honorable for the soldiers that fought in WW2 is very hard. As many others in this topic posted before, you can find small monuments on almost every graveyard in Germany, where the fallen soldiers are being remembered. </p>
<p>BUT overall in Germany there is nothing like Vets day in the US as we are all learn about the war crimes and the holocaust in school. Even 'innocent' generals like Guderian and Rommel are not remembered anywhere at all. If a German openly stated that he is a fan of Erwin Rommel, he would get weird looks from everyone around him (if he doesn't life in a far-right environment at least). This is a major difference between Germany and the US where you can easily say that you are a fan of Eisenhower or Bernard Montogomery.</p>
<p>The only Germans from WW2 that are really honored in our community are the ones who fought against the Third Reich while it still laste, e.g. Stauffenberg, Sophie and Hans Scholl, Georg Elser.</p>
<p>As for the vets in Germany, mostly everyone (including myself) has or had a gradfather who fought in the second world war. But in contrast to US-vets who probably are proud of their years in service, German vets are mostly ashamed of their time (or some are also still brainwashed by Nazi propaganda and will tell you stories about how amazing Nazi Germany was). My grandfather NEVER told me anything about his time in the Wehrmacht. The only things I remember is that he was able to tell me to close the door in French and Russian. But I first got the hint where he learned these languages after his death in 2004.</p>
<p>Some years ago I found a letter he wrote about his time in service, it is in German, but if anyone is interested, it would be a pleasure for me to translate ist.</p>
<p>EDIT: I made a (very rough, sorry!) translation of the letter, which can be found here: <a href="https://goo.gl/pE1K3u" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/pE1K3u</a>.
EDIT2: German original of the letter (with some gaps from where I was not able to read his hand writing): <a href="https://goo.gl/fWSOcJ" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/fWSOcJ</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most big, official memorials in Germany (including the Memorial Day on November 11th) are dedicated to &quot;all victims of war&quot; or something like that. You'll very rarely find anything honoring soldiers explicitly. If you do, it's probably pretty old and has been left there for historical significance (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Victory_Column" target="_blank">Berlin Victory Column</a> that was built in the mid 19th century but upgraded with references to later wars, including WW2 while the war was still going on... and it very nearly got demolished multiple times for that, which would've been a shame because it's really one of the most important landmarks in the city).</p>
<p>In general most German's don't honor soldiers actively, neither past nor current. We don't do &quot;thank you for your service&quot; or special veteran's privileges or anything like that. People probably care privately about their family members, and the armed forces probably hold small services for people that die in e.g. Afghanistan, but there's no great parades or giant flags over a coffin like you would know in America. We don't really see it as anything more than other people doing a dangerous job that they get appropriately compensated for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My bachelor's thesis and some masters level research related to this topic. Some people have hit different aspects of this quite well already. There is little to no outright, direct memorialization (akin to something like the US WWII memorial in Washington D.C.). The few still-living veterans of the war rarely talk about their memories with anyone who didn't also experience them, so this has made research difficult. Even though it can generally be assumed that every man born between roughly between 1900 and 1945 served in some capacity, such men do not publicly &quot;wear&quot; their time in service. The few de facto WWII veterans associations are small, very private, and often can't be recognized as such by their name alone. Memorials specifically for the German soldiers in WWII don't exist, but that doesn't mean the siblings, children, grandchildren, friends, etc. of that troubled generation don't seek to honor and respect them despite the stain they all bore. As was correctly pointed out, WWI and Franco-Prussian War monuments often serve as proxy memorials. As for the victim memorials, it very much depends who you ask as to whether they think the soldiers should/are included in that category; regardless covert memorialization happens their far less frequently. In addition to this general societal discomfort with publicly affiliating with the quagmire of WWII, yes the issue of Neo-Nazi appropriation is also always a concern. The German government generally seeks to give them as little to affiliate with as possible. </p>
<p>Sidenote: I suppose it's not suprising the 'clean Wehrmacht' issue was brought up. The scholarly evidence is overwhelming that the Wehrmacht was complicit, instrumental even, in the crimes of the Nazis <em>as an organization</em> but no it does not mean every individual was an evil, Jew-hating Nazi. Funnily enough German academia and I think society came to terms with the dirty Wehrmacht earlier and easier than a lot of Americans did ( some American military scholars and history buffs often have a peculiar erection for the German Army). The fact that the word cuck was thrown around shows you that this issue inevitably draws in less savory extreme-right sorts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
