		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adenosine does build up, and this does contribute to making you feel tired.  But what determines whether you feel sleepy / go to sleep is much more than just one thing.  If you think about it, this makes sense:  You wouldn't be very good at surviving if your body being tired made you fall asleep no matter what.  There are multiple different things that can push/pull you towards sleep / wakefulness.  Correspondingly, the neural circuitry that controls sleep is <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7zEuyCC1adLPFMgkkyVogVcPDBRE3G76u_p1hc6EBhW9bL3uhYnH8p5YNvyv3A8SiR_r1IQ8da6_jFefPctCCH7BtEsWmA8tWvfoCEDUZyVvqTDaidUA4xt28YkPZee4OtyW-O6gMGvBfEQT" target="_blank">complex</a>.  Broadly speaking, it functions like a see-saw, where many different factors can push down on either end to swing the balance towards sleep or wakefulness.</p>
<p>In the case of insomnia, the problem is that other factors (anxiety) are pushing down on one end of the see-saw and swinging it further towards wakefulness than it should be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One additional factor at work can be the length of the internal circadian rhythm. This is sort of like your body reading out a very long complicated instruction manual which ideally takes 24 hours to read, and then restarting as soon as its read it. This is part of why you tend to get tired at roughly the same local time (hence jet lag), and why you can feel a bit better in the day even if you didn't sleep at night. </p>
<p>In some people with insomnia, this circadian rhythm can take a slightly different period of time (like 23.5 hours or 24.5 hours), and this means you slowly get out of sync with society in general. I probably have an example of this - left to my own devices I tend to &quot;drift&quot; later and later into the day, often until I don't go to bed until sunrise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One day I had an extra shot of coffee at starbucks..well, that might right before bed my heart went &quot;thump!&quot;  Like a huge lump in my throat.</p>
<p>Then it started to race,  I went to the ER after about 15 minutes of that.</p>
<p>They checked my heart rate at 224 bpm.
I was immediately taken back to A room and given adenosine..it felt like my heart stopped for 3 seconds after that injection </p>
<p>Then my heart went back to A normal rhythm. </p>
<p>It was diagnosed as SVT. </p>
<p>Anyway, that's my experience with adenosine </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
