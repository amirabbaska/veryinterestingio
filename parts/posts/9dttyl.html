		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is known that SSRIs block reuptake of serotonin, yes. From what I gather, the part that isn’t known is the exact role serotonin plays in correcting mood disorders. It’s a bit hit &amp; miss ... some people improve with SSRIs and some don’t. Dosage often needs to be tweaked - different people need different doses and it can change over time. SSRIs continue to be prescribed because they work for many people, but it’s still a bit of a mystery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several points important points here:</p>
<p>1) SSRIs are so named because they were designed from the outset to affect serotonin only. Fluoxetine (Prozac) was the first psychiatric medication engineered from day 1 with a specific purpose in mind. Eli Lilly still says this about the drug: &quot;Although the exact mechanism of PROZAC is unknown, it is presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin.&quot; (<a href="http://pi.lilly.com/us/prozac.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://pi.lilly.com/us/prozac.pdf" target="_blank">http://pi.lilly.com/us/prozac.pdf</a></a>)</p>
<p>2) We <em>think</em> that SSRIs &quot;block re uptake of serotonin&quot;, but it's very difficult to be certain that this is <em>exactly</em> what they are doing and <em>all</em> that they are doing, because the brain is complex and we can't exactly slice one open after giving it an SSRI.</p>
<p>3) Even if we knew exactly how SSRIs affected chemicals in the brain, we still wouldn't have a very good understanding of how those chemicals affect people and illnesses like depression, and so I think it would still be fair to say that we don't know how antidepressants &quot;work&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, while it's true that SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin and that this can help alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety, this is only part of the picture. For example, serotonin levels go up soon after an individual takes an SSRI, yet patients are told that effects will only begin to take hold 4-6 weeks after daily administration. Clearly it's not just an increase in serotonin that makes SSRIs work. There are obviously other mechanisms in the brain that are taking place that we haven't recognized</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's some number of steps between inhibiting serotonin reuptake and the desired effect, and we're still working those out. It boils down to not meaningfully understanding what things like &quot;major depression&quot; truly mean. Analogy: We know exactly what aspirin binds to and inhibits. Connecting that to its effects on pain or heart attack prevention takes a deeper understanding of what's involved in those processes.</p>
<p>First off, the name is accurate. SSRIs definitely bind to serotonin transporters (reuptake pumps.) They do this within hours of being taken. They then take weeks to take effect. Something else is happening as a result. </p>
<p>Even that part is a bit iffy. It would be more accurate to say that it takes 4-6 weeks for the SSRI to separate from placebo to a clinically significant extent. Basically, the sugar pill and the drug group both get better on average from day 1, with the drug group improving a bit more over time, and after a few weeks the difference is enough to call &quot;not half bad.&quot;</p>
<p>I've seen a number of claimed explanations for the delay (downregulation of autoreceptors, BDNF, etc.) but it's not a settled point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
