		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemistry is primarily concerned with things at the atomic or molecular level. Nuclear physics is concerned with the nucleus itself. There is a whole branch of chemistry called &quot;nuclear chemistry&quot;, and what they do is essentially identical to what nuclear physicists do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it was Rutherford who said &quot;All science is either physics or stamp collectng.&quot;   I have a masters in nuclear physics and I did my thesis on the nuclear structure of the 186Au (yes, I made gold from more base materials, so I am a successful alchemist).  It is not chemistry in anyway.  We are looking at what makes up the nucleus,  what makes up subatomic particles and exotic particles, how all this interacts with each other.  No, nuclear is properly placed in physics not chemistry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an oversimplified sense chemistry is the science of the electronic environments of atoms and nuclear physics is the science of the atomic nucleus. Chemistry obviously does care about the nature of the nucleus as it dictates what element the atom is however chemical reactions only involve interaction and change of the electronic environment</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<ul>
<li>About 1/3rd physics (thermodynamics and basic quantum mechanics for electrons around atoms, not nuclei)</li>
<li>About 1/3rd synthetic organic chemistry (how to make meth and many other biomolecules)</li>
<li>About 1/3rd just learning about different families of molecules and how they behave (mostly based on the physics we do)</li>
