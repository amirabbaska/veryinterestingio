		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The extra space gets filled out mostly by the peritoneum (a sac with many folds that holds most our visceral organs) and the fascia (similar to the peritoneum but its kind of like a web of fibrous tissue that holds things in place). The Kidneys are behind the peritoneum, meaning that they're not being held by this sac, when you remove a kidney that sac just fills that empty space, there is very little movement since a kidney is not that big. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I lost a kidney 2 years ago and was told. By the surgeon that the capacity of the remaining kidney will increase in mass slightly to take take on the full load. As far as noticing any physical difference in the absence of the removed organ, absolutely no noticeable difference at all. Other than the small 2 inch scar. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
