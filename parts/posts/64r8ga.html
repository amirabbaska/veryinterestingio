		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there's a difference between religion and mythology. But it's not that religions are practiced now and mythologies were practiced then. It's that a mythology is one aspect of a religion.</p>
<p>For example, when we talk about ancient Greek mythology, we're not talking about the whole religion. The whole religion included ritual acts like sacrifices, mystical experiences like oracles, and a ton of other practices and ideas. The mythology is just the meaningful stories that were part of that religion.</p>
<p>Similarly, Christianity has a lot of parts. There are rituals, moral practices, hymns, holidays, and so on. All of those make up the religion. Christianity also has a mythology: the meaningful stories that are part of that religion. The crucifixion and resurrection are part of the mythology of Christianity, but that mythology isn't the whole of Christianity. And, lest I offend anyone, I say that as a Christian and clergy person.</p>
<p>One more example. American patriotism isn't usually classified as a religion. But religion is a fuzzy term that's really hard to define without either ruling out things that are usually thought of as religions or ruling in things that usually aren't. American patriotism has a bunch of practices (the pledge of allegiance, etc.) and literature (the Declaration of Independence, etc.). It also has stories about its folk heroes (George Washington never told a lie, etc.). And those stories help people interpret what it means to be American. So there are competing stories, for example, about what the American Civil War means: Was it about treason in defense of slavery, or about state's rights? Can someone have pride in being on the Confederate side? Etc.</p>
<p>The reason that we treat ancient religions as mythologies is because we usually divorce the stories from their context in the religion. I remember having a bunch of books on Greek and Roman mythology growing up, but none of them addressed temple worship, social structure, or other things that were important to the actual religion. They were just stories... and myth is just the Greek word for story.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Bible, Torah, Talmud, Quran, Gitas, Vedas, Sutras, etc are all mythological holy texts because they are collections of stories about gods and heroes from a  various religions. There fact the religions are practiced means nothing.
There is no reason to be offended, they are what they are.</p>
<p>You can get mad when i point out they are also fictional though. </p>
<p>EDIT - people don't like that last sentence, but take the time to ask yourself. If you are a Christian do you believe Muhammad was a prophet who ascended to heaven? Do you believe that Ganesha's father cut off his head and then replaced it with an elephant? Does a Buddhist believe that man is made from dust and a woman was formed from a rib?</p>
<p>No. They consider them fictional myths. My statement they are fictional is true, depending where you stand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
