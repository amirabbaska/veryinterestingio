		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anaesthetist from Australia here. General anaesthesia for dental work is not uncommon. It just doesn't happen in the dentists office anymore. If you need a GA you will be booked into an operating list in a hospital. GA lists for dental work are usually reserved for difficult wisdom teeth extractions, special needs patients, and occasionally for extremely anxious patients. </p>
<p>General anaesthesia by a trained anaesthetist in an appropriate environment is quite safe. </p>
<p>But having it done in your dentists chair at their office is.......sub optimal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>US Anesthesiologist here. For general adult dentistry it is very uncommon (except for the rare case of a developmentally disabled adult).  Pediatric dentistry especially a full mouth restoration in toddlers is very common in the South. These kids are intubated and put under general anesthesia. GA and moderate sedation is common in oral surgery but oral surgery is more invasive and would necessitate this intervention.  Most people who get their teeth pulled are under conscious sedation with versed and nitrous.  Just remember, if you have any general anesthesia also request an anesthesiologist or CRNA to be present (never an AA or a dentist anesthesiologist).  Dental anesthesia is very difficult for untrained personnel and the dentist CANNOT monitor your anesthesia and do the surgery at the same time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think we need to clarify a few things.  First, the term general anesthesia has a few implications, the biggest of which is a secure airway.  That usually means an endotracheal tube, but can also include a tracheotomy tube or a nasotracheal tube, as is common in oral surgery.  There are many oral and maxillofacial surgeries done under general anesthesia.  As far as basic dental work, the more common routes are local/regional with numbing agents, or MAC (monitored anesthetic care) which is sedation with medications that at appropriate doses won't stop your breathing.  That is what is done in the office, typically with a midazolam drip where the patient is unconscious, but breathing in their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General anesthesia is more expensive and dangerous than a local anesthetic so it is only used in cases where the patient: A) demands it or B) can't be seen without it as is the case with some people with developmental disabilities such as severe autism. These people need to be sedated for their own safety/ that of their hygienist/dentist. As a side note, because it is dangerous and expensive developmentally disabled people are and underserved group in oral healthcare. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally something I can weigh in on! </p>
<p>General anaesthesia generally is not used in smaller dental offices, it is by its very nature a comparatively risky procedure and requires a trained anaesthesiologist to administer and monitor. This makes it expensive as well as risky. Generally speaking local anaesthetic and sedation are preferable. </p>
<p><em>Wait a second, aren't sedation and anaesthesia the same?</em></p>
<p>Nope. Not in the dental office. Sedation is generally used in cases where a patient needs more than one extraction and/or a long complex procedure (such as a molar RCT) and is nervous or fearful of the procedure. Sedation puts the patient in a state where they are calmed and relaxed but still able to understand and respond to verbal commands (e.g <em>&quot;open your mouth&quot;</em>). Sedation is both cheaper and safer than general anaesthesia and can be done in a dental office if there is a suitably trained professional on hand.</p>
<p><em>Okay then so why would I have general anaesthesia if sedation is so much better?</em></p>
<p>It's not. It's a different approach used for a different set of circumstances. General anaesthesia is indicated in cases where extreme amounts of work are needed in a patients mouth including but not limited to: Major oral surgery, multiple extractions that cannot or will not be done over multiple visits, Surgeries where no patient movement can be allowed and restraints are impossible or impractical, serious dental fear or phobia to the extent that a patient will not co-operate with dentists at all (often true for small children) and most rarely people who are allergic to all other types of analgesics that would otherwise be used to relieve pain during the procedure.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> It is used very rarely in smaller private dental offices. General anaesthesia is almost exclusively conducted in a hospital environment so that in the event of a crash they have the appropriate materials nearby to handle the situation.</p>
<p>It is common in maxillofacial surgery departments and in paediatric dental departments where oral surgery is needed for children and/or with patients who suffer from dental phobias. Finally is is uncommon but not unheard of that it is needed for comparatively minor operations on a patient with several allergies preventing other more practical options from being employed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
