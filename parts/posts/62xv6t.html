		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so. I'm trying to apply for a credit card and I'm getting confused with all these different types like fancy rewards program, low fee vs. low rate etc... and the rules to pay things back</p>
<p>I'm a student. I don't spend much.
I just want to apply for one where I delay a payment for a month or whatever, and then before the bill (or the deadline) arrives, pay it back. </p>
<p>I mean is that how a credit card work? Am I just lost in all the variations of a credit card? Help! </p>
<p>Edit: this might be a stupid question but.. if I don't use my credit card for a billing period.. the bank wouldn't charge me for that right..? </p>
<p>Edit: I'm living Australia, but I still appreciate everyone who's posted in terms of US context! Hopefully this will help others out there too </p>
<p>Edit (again!): just wanted to say a BIG thank you for everyone who's given their recommendation and tips re credit card. I'm pretty sure Ill never forget to ONLY use the credit card on expenses I could ALREADY pay for even without a CC! Lol </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best way to think about a credit card is it is a loan. Every time you buy something with your credit card you are taking out a loan with the CC company and that loans and the terms around it have been predetermined at the time you are granted the card.</p>
<p>Your credit limit can be equated to your &quot;pre-approved loan amount&quot;</p>
<p>Now the best way to highlight how a credit card works is just to jump into an example.</p>
<p>You have a credit card with a $1,000 limit where the billing cycle starts on the first of each month. </p>
<p>So, tomorrow (4/2) you go out and you charge a $100 dollar purchase to your card. You have now borrowed $100 of your $1000 limit. You could not go out on Monday and make a $1000 purchase; your card would be declined. You could however spend up to $900 more, but we will assume you don't. In fact, you don't spend anymore money this month.</p>
<p>On 5/1 you will get a bill from your credit card company. It will tell you a bunch of things, like transactions and amounts for the previous month, your available credit (still only $900), your bill due date (5/25 for the sake of this example), and your minimum required payment (lets say $15).</p>
<p>Now you have 3 (but really only 2 reasonable options):</p>
<p>1) the non-viable option; you ignore it and eventually you will start getting past due notices, the card will be cancelled, and the debt will be sold to collections.
2) before 5/25 you choose to pay off the card in full, write a check (or more likely sign up for automatic payments) for $100 and thats it. Your 6/1 bill will show a 0 balance and $1000 available credit limit (assuming you made no purchases in the month of May). You didn't pay any interest, and didn't lose any money.
3) You choose to pay the minimum (or any other non full payment above the minimum). Lets say you pay $20; now lets take a look at your 6/1 bill (still imagining you did not charge anything new to the card). Now the $80 that you didn't pay off during the first month will accrue interest based on the interest rate established when you opened the card. So now your bill will say you owe $83 (just a random guess) or so, and you, again can make a minimum payment of $15. Eventually after 7-8 months of minimum payments you will pay off the entire amount and gain back your full credit limit, but you will also have lost a portion of money to interest payments.</p>
<p>If you spend any time on r/personalfinance you will learn quickly that option 2 is the only option you should consider under normal circumstances; if you can't afford to live by number 2, you can't afford to make the purchase.</p>
<p>Now onto rewards and incentives; don't worry about these. This is your first credit card and you should worry about developing good credit card practices first, then worry about getting the best card for your situation. If you are truly interested; there is a ton of research available online comparing different cards and which are best for certain circumstances, but as a credit newcomer you are unlikely to qualify for any of the more lucrative. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I saw that you are Australian in another comment. I'm pretty savvy with the system here as it is a quite different to the American. Other commenters have covered the credit card basics.</p>
<p>Americans have a credit rating system were creditors report your &quot;reliability&quot; to make payment on credit. This applies also to mobile plans and other bills paid on credit (electricity and water). Our system has limits on what a creditor can report. The ratings system is less important and you can't really &quot;build credit&quot;. The only thing the banks will report is applications for credit and defaults (not paying). Getting declined for credit is bad so avoid over reaching.</p>
<p>Lots of applications in short time = not reliable = low score. After 5 years it drops off the record. Obviously not paying your credit when due will result in bad marks against you.</p>
<p>So why use a credit card when Visa/MC debit cards are issued by every bank for free... rewards and perks!</p>
<p>Banks in Aus are constantly putting out new deals to entice customers to their products. They make money off people forgetting the basics of credit card use and getting greedy or lazy. Stay on the ball and you can get some sweet perks.</p>
<p>At the moment the best deal for a low income earner is the ANZ Frequent Flyer Platinum card. It has no annual fee for the first year and 50,000 Qantas points if you spend $2500 in the first 3 months. If you don't think you'll spend that much there are other cards with lower requirements and less rewards. You'll also receive more points as you put purchases on the card. The minimum income is very low at $35,000 and minimum credit is reasonable at $6,000. There are other perks like travel insurance and purchase insurance. The interest rate is irrelevant because YOU WILL NOT BUY THINGS YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY BACK IMMEDIATELY!!! At the end of the year call up and cancel the card and get a new one at another bank for more points, this way you won't pay the annual fee.</p>
<p>There are other offers around all the time. NAB has one at the moment and so does American Express.</p>
<p>Also if you travel at all pick up the Latitude Financial 28 Degrees card as it has no foreign transactions fees for purchases.</p>
<p>DO NOT BUY THINGS YOU CANNOT AFFORD.</p>
<p>Any questions feel free to ask.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a student who doesnt spend much, You want a card with no annual fee.     </p>
<p>Not trying to advertise them, but the American Express blue cash card is one of my favorites.  (With 1% on everything and 3% cash back on groceries).  </p>
<p>For most credit cards, after the statement is posted, you have a few weeks before it's due.   During that time, no interest is accured if you did not carry a balance from the previous month.     Note that the credit cards will give a &quot;minimum payment due&quot; which does not immediately pay off the balance, but is the minimum amount required to stay in good terms.   Failure to pay 100% of the total balance will result in interest.</p>
<p>If you can spend within your means and do not carry balances, interest rates are largely irrelevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably more an advise than an explanation, but this is what you should do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get the cheapest card available. Probably has a $ 1000 limit which is enough for a student as yourself;</p>
</li>
<li>Interest rate does not matter because you should ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS PAY OFF YOUR CREDIT CARD AT THE END OF THE MONTH! Again, you're a student, you can't afford paying interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I do (student myself as well) too; I have a credit card purely because you can pay with it everywhere. As I have always learned:</p>
<p><strong>You only loan money for your education or a house. For the rest, you save for it or DON'T BUY IT</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you cannot pay something now, wait a month to buy it. </p>
<p>I know that in the U.S. you need a credit history to apply for mortgage, but credit cards aren't free money so be very careful while using them and make sure that you can repay the credit-card before having interest popping in. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
