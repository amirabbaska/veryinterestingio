		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I presume you mean because the engineering required to build them can be directly reused.</p>
<p>This is partially true, and why there are plenty of examples (especially in the earlier parts of the space program) of multiple copies of something being launched.</p>
<p>E: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_probes" target="_blank">Note how many duplicate missions there are on this list</a></p>
<p>However, at this point that doesn't really make too much sense.  That's because launch cost is enormous.  To LEO, depending on your contract, it costs on the order of $10-$50k/lb.  Since there's that whole &quot;rocket equation tyranny&quot; thing, a deep space probe will have to bring a few times its mass in fuel beyond LEO in order to get the rest of the way out of Earth's gravity well.</p>
<p>When you're talking possibly as much as $100k/lb, you want <em>exactly</em> the right instrumentation for exactly what you're trying to do.  So yes, you reuse what you can, but if the mission is better suited by something a little different -- you make something different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an aerospace engineer and used to work as a NASA contractor. It may not be obvious on the surface, but there is actually a TON of reused stuff at an engineering level from mission to mission. This is especially true within each space center. </p>
<p>For example, Mars Curiosity (MSL) and SMAP are both JPL projects and are based on the same software architecture and similar hardware components (at least the spacecraft part of MSL, that is). MSL is obviously a Mars rover, while SMAP was essentially an advanced weather satellite. Not exactly clear on the surface that they share a lot of technology.</p>
<p>Another more obvious example is Mars2020, which will be extremely similar to MSL with different and more advanced instruments.</p>
<p>If you study projects a bit more closely, this sort of thing happens all of the time. Even if it isn't a near copy-paste like MSL to M2020, there is a LOT if legacy software and hardware in most science missions. Things like GNC modules, communication systems, power systems, etc. Only systems unique to that mission, usually, will be completely new engineering (such as the entry, decent, and landing phase of MSL).</p>
<p>TLDR, the software and hardware of science missions are extremely modular and there is a lot of legacy technology used, especially within each space center, even if it's not obvious on the surface. Spacecraft design is a very evolutionary process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume, you are talking about space probes of the kind that goes ot other planets. Then the short answer to this question is a partial yes.<br />
The longer answer requires understanding of how such space probes are developed, the difference between the space craft, platform and payload as well as the different requirements for different missions.<br />
First of all space probes are always developed by the big space agencies, e.g. NASA or ESA. They will announce a proposal for a mission to some planet for example. Then a lot of different researchers from different institutes will start designing instruments that will go on such a mission. The main organization (lets use ESA for this example) then selects the best candidates. Important is here the difference between the platform and the payload. While ESA provides the platform, different institutes or principle investigators are designing instruments or instrument packages that go onto the platform as the payload. The platform includes central processing units, communication, attitude control, propulsion and power management, the payload is only doing the scientific work. This means we have different requirements for the payload and the platform. The payload must fullfill the scientific requirements while the platform must fullfill the operational requirements. The conditions at the different planets are very diverse and different scientific objectives also require different operational requirements. For example the space probe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Explorer" target="_blank">JUICE</a> currently under development by ESA will spend extended time in the heavy radiation environment around Jupiter. Therefore lots of radiation shielding for both Payload and platform are needed. Spacecraft around Mars won't need such a radiation shielding.
How far away from the sun will the spacecraft be. A spacecraft around Mars can comfortably use solar sails to collect energy to power the whole spacecraft. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons" target="_blank">New Horizons</a> that flew to Pluto was too far away and needed its own power source. It used a radioisotope thermal generator instead.<br />
Another important factor to consider is the type of encounter that the spacecraft was supposed to have. Is it just a fly-by as in the case of New Horizons or is it supposed to spend extended time in orbit around its destination. Going into orbit requires extra fuel and propulsion that needs to be considered.<br />
The point with these last examples two is that these are considerations for the platform, not the payload. That means the payload is more or less independent from these considerations. That means that different instruments can be flown with only minor changes on different missions. For example the <a href="http://www2.irf.se/program/sspt/?dbfile=Rosetta_ICA&amp;link[Projects]=Launched_sp_Satellite_sp_projects" target="_blank">Ion Composition Analyzer</a> on the Rosetta mission is almost the same as the Ion Mass Analyzer on the Mars Express mission.<br />
The platform on the other hand needs to be tailored specifically for every single mission to be able to satisfy all the requirements on orbit, power consumption etc. etc. Of course if two missions have similar requirements the designs will be similar. But you need to consider, we don't launch these kinds of missions very often. So after launching one we learn new things from that mission. For the next mission the lessons learned can be applied and the design be improved.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Really what I am trying to say is that these kind of missions are not built all together but in separate modules and some parts of these modules can be reused. But most cannot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I could be wrong but the way you phrased this question leads m to believe that you are making a false assumption. It is not often that a mission in space is a broad exploration. They almost always have a very specific objective. Sending a duplicate probe doesn't really do much good if you send it to a different location. You don't just send to probes and say: &quot;Alright, we will send two probes and wherever they happen to land, that's the area we will study. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
