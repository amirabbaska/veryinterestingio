		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons. To name some:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Time and energy have an uncertainty relation, like position and momentum. The shorter the energy levels life time, the more width in possible energies the state has. The stated energy is just the peak in probability. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doppler shifting from microscopic motion. The atoms, both the emitting and absorbing, may be moving, broadening the spectral lines that are emitted or absorbed. The available states (and associated velocities) of the atoms may be almost functionally continuous, so the Doppler shifting of the energy they can cause is continuous from this continuous velocity they can posses. </p>
</li>
<li>The ideal energy levels that we derive are merely that, ideal. They are based on simple solutions of hydrogen like atoms isolated. They're a hydrogen atom in a vacuum. We ignore the fact the nucleus is actually a nucleus and not just a point of positive charge. We ignore other electrons in other orbits. We ignore other atoms entirely. When we try to involve more of these effects, but still taking large simplifications, we find that things like atoms near by push energy levels off their isolated atom ideals. We end up with more or less continuous bands of energy near these energy levels, like we see in reality.  </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to what others have said, when you have any non-gaseous material there are overlaps on atomic orbitals.  Based on the spin of the electrons you can end up with bonding and anti-bonding pairs that have slightly higher or lower energy levels than just the normal orbital distribution on atom would.</p>
<p>Now consider you have essentially an incomprehensible number of atoms in even a fairly small amount of material.  All of the relatively weak interactions cause further and further possible slight energy level differences until you're left with a basically continuous (I mean they're technically still discrete but on the order of 10^-22 eV differences) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_band_structure" target="_blank">band of energy.</a>  That right there gives you a lot of potential absorption possibilities, up to the vacuum level where a high energy photon could give enough kinetic energy to an electron that it can be knocked out of the material entirely.  It does however depend on the density of states, which is basically how many electrons can have the same energy level, and how many are actually currently occupying any energy level.    </p>
<p>On the other side of things, you might wonder why photon energy can be continuous if the materials emitting them don't have continuous energy levels.  There are all sorts of particle-particle interactions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung" target="_blank">bremsstrahlung</a> that convert some change in energy (kinetic energy in the case of bremsstrahlung) into a photon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, the energy levels of atoms are not infinitely narrow, their width is the inverse of their lifetime. More importantly, the different atoms in a gas will have different doppler shifts, further broadening the transitions. And more importantly still, molecules have so many possible transitions that they can form more or less continuous bands rather than discrete levels. And finally, when molecules get packed together like in a solid or liquid, the local environment of each molecule will shift its energy levels, further smearing the spectrum that you observe when looking at a macroscopic sample.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Electron energy levels are only discreet when they're in a confining potential (like the well of electrostatics potential it sits in near a positively charge nucleus, due to its electrostatic attraction).  A free electron has a continuous spectrum.  This allows for things like Compton scattering.</p>
<p>2) You're ignoring kinetic energy, which even for atoms is continuous.  Specifically you have things like Bremstrahlung (braking radiation) where CONTINUOUS emission occurs when a charge decelerates (or accelerates).  i.e. changes in translational kinetic energy are not quantized.</p>
<p>3) Collisions represent acceleration/ deceleration events.  This is where the light of the continuous black-body radiation, for example, comes from.  It's not the quantum mechanical emission of an electron going to a higher energy level and then falling down, but rather the classical emission of a charged object decelerating when it collides with something (specifically the regular collisions, driven by random thermal motion, that occur as being part of a solid or fluid held at a fixed temperature)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
