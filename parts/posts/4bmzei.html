		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, Antarctic oceanographer here.  There are several ways to interpret your question, so I'm going to break it down and answer each:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens when Antarctic sea ice melts?
If Antarctic sea ice melted, it would not have a significant direct effect on flooding/sea level rise (SLR).  As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4bmzei/is_it_true_that_even_if_antarctica_were_to_melt/d1ankev" target="_blank">\u\crnaruka</a> pointed out, there is a small effect (4-6 cm of SLR), due to the freshwater content of the ice versus the sea, i.e., more volume per mass.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are indirect effects, such as changes in albedo: sea ice reflects sunlight more than the ocean, changing the amount of heat uptake by the ocean, which can change the rate at which ice melts.</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens when Antarctic ice <em>shelves</em> melt?
Ice shelves are floating, and thus would have a similar effect as sea ice - minor additions based on density differences.  However, recent research suggests that ice shelves play a crucial role in &quot;buttressing&quot; the Antarctic ice sheet.  Essentially, if an ice shelf were to melt too much, there would no longer be a &quot;plug&quot; to stop the ice sheet from draining off the continent.  The buttressing effect is not 100% understood, but can depend on the slope of the bedrock under the ice sheet, and the grounding line (the place where the ice sheet leaves land and becomes an ice shelf).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>What happens when Antarctic ice <em>sheets</em> melt?
Ice sheets are ice on land, so melting would directly add to sea level rise.  If the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet melted, it would add appoximately <a href="http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/2013/01/antarcticas-contribution-to-global-sea-level-rise/" target="_blank">60 meters</a> to sea level.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a final note, I'd like to point out that this is very much an active area of research.  Not only determing the amount Antarctic ice contributes to sea level rise, but also how ice sheets, ice shelves, and the ocean interact.  A big push/race now is to fully couple ocean models with ice shelf/sheet models to get a better idea of how ice sheets will impact and be impacted by future climate.  If you've browsed the latest <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/" target="_blank">IPCC report</a>, the contribution by ice sheets to sea level rise is NOT calculated in any of the climate models, but is a large uncertainty added to the projections.</p>

<p>EDIT 3:  Several people have been asking about land rebound (after the weight of the ice is gone).  This is known as glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), and occurs on timescales of thousands to tens of thousands of years.  The earth is still adjusting from the last ice age.  <a href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/glacial-adjustment.html" target="_blank">Here's some info on past GIA</a> that will give you an idea of future GIA for Antarctica.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the other pole you're thinking of. </p>
<p>Ice melting will only contribute to sea level rise if it is land-based ice. Antarctica and Greenland house two HUGE concentrations of land-based ice. If they melted, sea levels would definitely rise. </p>
<p>The North Polar ice cap, on the other hand, isn't on land, it's frozen ocean, floating on top of the water. The oceans are already &quot;bearing the weight&quot; of that ice, so if it melted, it wouldn't impact sea levels at all. (Of course, whatever caused it to melt would probably have other consequences, like melting some of Greenland's iceâ€¦)</p>
<p>To see the effect for yourself, pour some water in a painters tray (the kind for a paint roller.) Only about halfway up. Then put a bunch of ice cubes in the water. The level of the water is like the North Pole - the ice is floating. Mark the level of the water, then wait for the ice to melt. It should be at nearly the same level. </p>
<p>Then try the same thing, but put the ice on the &quot;ramp&quot; part of the tray, above the water line. When the ice melts, the water line will have gone up noticeably. That's like Greenland/Antarctica. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ice on land vs ice in water is already covered by other answers as well or better than I could hope to explain it, but one related point I don't see mentioned: if the temperature of the ocean rises enough to melt the ice, that rise in temperature will <em>in itself</em> cause sea level rise by thermal expansion.</p>
<p>Water occupies more space at higher temperatures than it does at low temperatures. So if you heat the oceans, they expand, and sea levels rise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure you have it the right way round. I thought the Arctic ice (norht pole) melting would have no effect (as it is ice already floating on the water). Think of this like dropping a icecube into a glass of water, the water level rises isntantly, then as the ice melts that water level does not go back to where it was before, (it drops slightly as water is denser than ice but not as much)</p>
<p>If the Antartic ice melts this is ice that is currently sitting on land, flowing into the water. Therfore it will cause sea level to rise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
