		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some are colored, but most are not*. Chloroplasts are a good example of organelles that are colored due to the presence of chlorophyll. Melanosomes are also colored due to the presence of melanin, just to name a couple examples.</p>
<p>*Technically, proteins and DNA absorb light, so you might consider calling them colored. However, most proteins absorb at 280nm (barring the presence of a chelated metal), so they would generally have absorbance outside of the visible spectrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most organelles in human cells will be colored from yellowish/whitish-tan to brown/red. On the scale of a cell they will almost be transparent because they are so thin and their scattering cross section isn't that great, but if you isolate them they definitely will have color (I do membrane isolations <em>a ton</em> in my work). Here are some examples. </p>
<p>Mitochondria - Light reddish/Brownish yellow - high amounts of heme from the respiratory complexes as well as cytochrome c. Enriched they look <a href="http://www.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140831/20140831225251_5311.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a>. (From <a href="http://www.bio-protocol.org/e1226" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>Nucleus - Whitish/yellow - Not a lot of electron transfer happening here, the membranes will look like other membranes and be very lightly colored</p>
<p>Endoplasmic reticulum - Smooth will look pretty reddish/brownish since this is where lipids are synthesized and the machinery is pretty heme rich. Rough I don't know, probably white/tan.</p>
<p>Golgi - Not really sure, likely white/tan.</p>
<p>Peroxisomes- Really brown (see above).</p>
<p>Lysosomes - Not quite sure, not easy to isolate but probably white/tan.</p>
<p>Other things like chloroplasts (green), sarcomeres (red) are pretty easy to identify. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really, they're mostly clear under a microscope. Some are but they're special cases, like chloroplasts. With some larger cells when looking at them under a light microscope without stain it's like looking at a clear blob with more little clear blobs inside of it. Generally we have to use stains to visualize cellular anatomy and different stains target different areas ex: iodine stains starches, crystal violet stains cell walls, DAPI binds to DNA, eosin stains cell membranes...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Practically everything inside the human body is colorless. Vascularization and blood flow gives most things its color, so you don't really get many colors in the human body besides pink, red, and black. One of the only exceptions I can think of is adipose tissue, which is yellow. And everything in our bodies are made of cells, so the cells are more or less colorless as well. Histology slides are almost always stained just so you can see the cells better because it is all basically the same color. Reticular fibers aren't actually purple, hyaline isn't blue, and epithelium isn't pink, etc. It's just stained for a better view under the microscope. Any time you see anatomy that's color coded in a book, it's most likely inaccurate. Veins aren't blue and I was very shocked to learn that the arteries themselves aren't even red. It's just the blood that gives them the red color.</p>
<p>Sources: I've taken several human cadaver labs and am working on a surgical assistant degree. Please feel free to correct anything I may have gotten wrong. I'm still learning!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are if certain stains which target certain organelles are used (in microscopy, for example) however most stains work due to basic chemistry like pH and charge of those components and don't target individual organelles per se. You can use antibodies which target certain proteins that localize to certain cellular compartments and tag those antibodies with dyes or fluorescent compounds to visualize different compartments in different colors. Immunohistochemistry is a very cool technique and can generate some amazing and beautiful microscopic images.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
