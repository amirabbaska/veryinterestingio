		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Transfer of knowledge is a fragile thing. Do you know the address of your great-grandparents? If you wanted to ensure your own great-grandchildren would know your medical history, how do you ensure its survivability and retrievability? Literacy needs to be combined with resilient materials. Tombstones last longer than wooden crosses, but even stone erodes to illegibility. And how to convey the location of the stone to a mobile population (now globally)? Songs tend to last, but even they get fuzzy and changed. Carl Sagan sent out the planet's info on a disk made of gold because it doesn't corrode. But first someone's gotta find it, and then they have to understand the writing &amp; meaning. My favorite thought exercise is the real problem of warning people for the next 10,000 years not to dig up buried radioactive waste. How can you ever ensure the info will survive that long? (Some of us have documents on 3.25&quot; floppies in WordStar that can't be retrieved!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  The entire point of burying the tomb somewhere in the desert was to prevent thieves from raiding it.  They were deliberately concealed to make it harder to tomb looters to find.  This is part of the reason King Tut's tomb was so valuable - it was literally the only tomb that hadn't already been robbed.</p>
<p>Also, something to keep in mind is that the Egyptian civilization lasted around 3100 years (if you measure it from Narmer to Cleopatra VII).  That is a <em>long damn time</em> and the average person of that period was not exactly renowned for their skills in literacy.</p>
<p>A few more points:</p>
<p>(1) Tut reigned around 1300 BC.  That makes him older than the Trojan War, and people are still arguing over whether <em>that</em> was even a real thing.</p>
<p>(2) Tut was not &quot;the most important thing to any Egyptian.&quot;  The only reason we remember him today was because his tomb was recovered intact.  Tut was not an important King.  Compared to other pharaohs, he was practically a footnote.  The average Egyptian peasant probably didn't know, or even <em>care</em>, who he was or where he was buried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea where any of America's founding fathers are buried. Why would Egyptians with limited communications and education know or care where one of their kings was buried?  </p>
<p>The reality is that only a limited number of people knew about an event and a much smaller number of people cared enough to record it.  Moving forward an even smaller number of people stored that info  and very few taught it to future generations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not directly related to Tut's tomb, but there is one word that sums it up...</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>Empires transitioning/collapsing/being sacked/etc. was kind of a huge problem back before the printing press was invented. Books (the #1 method of remembering shit until fairly recently) were painstaking, expensive, and extremely time-consuming to make. And even then, with so many scribes that could be working, you have to consider how a massive majority of the industry revolved around printing one thing and really one thing only: religious texts. So, a lot of things that they needed more copies of may have been put on the wayside while they met demand for churches and other important organizations. The fact that the church had a huge control over literature for a long period didn't help with maintaining consistency either.</p>
<p>So 'alchemy' and chemistry formulas, like the true composition of &quot;Greek Fire&quot;, blueprints and building secrets, medical procedures, agricultural works, etc. etc. that were handmade, hand-copied, hand-bound, and kept mostly all in one place (large scholarly libraries, which were not very common...) would get lost by fire, theft, smashed into the rubble, or deliberately destroyed in order to keep the information out of the belligerents' hands (which is sort of okay if the guy who wrote or provided for it was still alive, which may not always be true). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Think how much things were lost in poland by germans...in the caribbean by the spanish....or dutch...or french...in the kingdom of ghana by other neighboring tribes...in north america after columbus....when empires fall or are taken over, things that are precious to them such as tombs or relics are just pottery and graves...basically eithrr trash ir loot....possibly to be gone forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
