		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because there are many, many cancers. Saying 'a cure for cancer' is about as reasonable as saying 'a cure for physical injury'. There are as many different kinds of cancer as there are ways and places that a person could be cut, bruised, broken or burned.</p>
<p>The research, tests and trials are constantly discovering, testing, and bringing into full production treatments for different cancers. As a result, the outcomes for people are getting better all the time. Some cancers that were a death sentence just a few years ago are now routinely cured, and as we gain deeper insights into the genetic causes, this can only get better. But it will always be an area where more research will be needed, as there will always be less common cancers that need new treatments, or more common cancers that could have better treatments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because cancer is not a disease like smallpox or anything else we've cured so far. It's your cells that turn into cancer cell because of whatever reason so there is nothing to cure from the outside. Oh and there are a lot of types of cancer so that makes it even harder </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's your own cells going haywire and taking over your body. It's like trying to stop an enemy that hides among innocent civilians. Yeah, it's easy to kill them if you have overwhelming firepower, the hard part is doing so without killing all the innocent bystanders. The innocent bystanders, in the case of cancer, being your healthy cells you need to survive. The methods we use to kill cancer, chemotherapy and radiation, also kill your healthy cells. It's hard to find a method which distinguishes between healthy cells and cancerous cells, whereas with something like a bacterial infection, you just flood your body with chemicals (antibiotics) that kill bacteria without affecting your human cells. Because of slight differences between our cells and bacteria cells, there are chemicals that kill bacteria while leaving us alive. There are slight differences between your healthy cells and cancerous cells, such as the cancerous cells being slightly weaker than your healthy cells, so they can be killed with a certain concentration of poison that leaves your healthy cells alive (chemotherapy). If the cancerous cells are all located in one spot that can be operated on, you can simply cut out the blob of cells, or target it with radiation. Unfortunately, there's lots of types of cancer, and sometimes they aren't weak enough to be killed by these methods or they've spread throughout the body and can't be killed without killing all the healthy cells, or originated in an inoperable area where surgery or radiation would kill some vital organ.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because</p>
<ul>
<li>It's parts of your own body killing you by doing a perfectly normal and desired thing <em>too much</em> - so your immune system usually won't' help, and chemicals that destroy cancer cells will generally also destroy healthy cells and kill you.</li>
<li>if you don't get every single cancer cell, it will just gro again, possibly much worse if you did something where the surviving cancer cells got into your bloodstream and spread around your body.</li>
<li>Cancer is really not jsut one disease, it's hundreds, because different kinds of cells behave quite differently when they become cancerous, and even in a single tumor you can often find different strains that are effectively separate diseases.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A cancer cell is like a car that just keeps going and won't stop. So we want to make this car stop, right?</p>
<p>Maybe we fix the brakes, maybe the problem is the brakes aren't working, so let's design a new brake system to install on the car. Except, how do you design one that fits EVERY car (BMW, Toyota, Chevrolet)? You would have to design one for every car.</p>
<p>So we do that, and we fix the brakes, only to discover that the gas pedal is the problem, it's giving the engine full throttle despite the brakes, so we go back to the drawing board, and we come up with a fix for the gas pedal, again, requiring a different one for every car. Only to find out, from travelling so fast, the car is all bent up, and hood is pressing down on the wire to the gas pedal, so our new system isn't working.</p>
<p>The idea of a &quot;universal cure&quot; for cancer is the same as the idea of a universal mechanical part that would fix any car. In the same way that we can brand a car as &quot;BMW&quot;, &quot;Toyota&quot;, &quot;Chevrolet&quot;, and then as &quot;1992 model&quot;, &quot;2007 model&quot;, and then &quot;Sport ZX trim&quot; or &quot;SS V8 model&quot;, we can do that with a cell - &quot;lung cancer&quot;, &quot;neuroendocrine lung cancer&quot;, &quot;ER+ PR- breast cancer&quot;. In the same way that each car would need a special part, each cancer would need a special drug to fix the particular thing that is broken in that cancer cell. Beyond that, each PARTICULAR car has its own story and its own unique pattern of damage, same as a cancer cell, so even the specific part for that specific car model may not actually work in that particular car given its damage. The mutations in every person's cancer, will be different from another person with what is called the same type of cancer.</p>
<p>On top of all that, we don't have 1 broken car, we have 1 billion of them, and the ones that we failed to fix, they reproduce and generate new, differently broken cars.</p>
<p>Some of the exciting stuff they are doing with cancer now it's going to the immune system, the auto mechanic, and telling it to destroy these cars. The cars are telling it &quot;hey, stay away, it's all good&quot;, so we try to mess that up. These are, for example, PD-L1 inhibitors in lung cancer, and they can work miraculously, but they don't always work (since every cancer is different), so people can once again point their finger and say &quot;no cure&quot;</p>
<p>Some cancer research money goes into better understanding the cancer (the blueprint of the car) to understand which parts are malfunctioning. That research, one hopes, will lead to a new type of car part that can fix that problem. We are also doing a lot with this immune system stuff too. But the war on cancer, it's a game where we are slowly whittling, whittling, whittling, collecting parts, building an arsenal. We likely won't ever have &quot;the cure&quot; but rather slowly increasing chances of survival year after year.</p>
<p>Most drugs now, your hair doesn't fall out. Back in the day, the first generations of cancer drugs, your hair falls out because the stuff we were giving just knocks out any cell that reproduces a lot - such as your hair follicle cells. With the car analogy, this is like we put spike strips on every road for any car going over 40 mph. So this knocks out our broken cars well enough, but the normal working cars going 45 mph also hit the strips and get knocked out too. Because these drugs or &quot;replacement parts&quot;, they don't go on just the broken cars, they go on EVERY car - they effect every cell in the body, not just cancer cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
