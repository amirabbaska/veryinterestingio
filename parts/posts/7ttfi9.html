		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This varies contractually.</p>
<p>Pay may be lump sum, hourly, royalty (i.e. Per use), financial target based, or any combination of the above.</p>
<p>The contractual details will vary considerably between actors even in the same show/movie and generally aren't publicly available.</p>
<p>But yes, some actors keep getting paid every time an episode airs.  Not much usually, but $1 per rerun over decades adds up if the show has serious legs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on their contract. Most films &amp; TV shows do pay residuals, where each actor gets a percentage for each airing &amp; DVD Sales.</p>
<p>Others only get paid for the one performance, and never see anything afterwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yay one I can answer. Producer here-a lot of depends on if the actor is union (SAG AFTRA). If so, there are basic residuals that everyone is entitled too. Sometimes they’re small. I know an actress who was a dancer in Tombstone and still gets about $100 a year from it playing on tv. There are also minimums for a day rate (called scale). Again it depends on the size and scope of the project. Scale for most tv is about $800/day +/-</p>
<p>Contracts in the 80s/90s were heavily skewed in the actors favor. They were getting ridiculously amazing residuals for re-runs. </p>
<p>Actors in tv shows today get paid by the week or the episode (usually one in the same as tends to be one week per episode unless it’s GoT. Those rates are negotiated by the agent. Jim Parsons gets $1m/episode for 22 episodes so $22m/season plus some sort of residual deal for when the show runs in syndication in TBS and any future runs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>He still gets checks from it. Nothing big. Like a dollar here, dollar fifty there,  rarely two dollars. </p>
<p>When we were younger he saved up like a massive stack of them and bought us both Nintendo 64s</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
