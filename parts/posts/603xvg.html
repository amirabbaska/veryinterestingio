<p>Even the previously proposed 100 meter aperture OWL telescope would not have been able to see the flag, though it might have been able to resolve the landers and rovers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is from a satellite orbiting the moon... Still not much detail.
It would be possible to get better images, but not a lot better without flying very close to the surface of the moon.</p>
<p>*Edit: It is possible to get better detail, but no device has been built so far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no longer an American flag on the moon. Solar exposure (mainly UV) will have bleached them all white by now. Unfortunately, even the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) doesn't have sufficient Resolution at the orbit it's in to see the flags as anything more than a few pixels, but the shadows are clearly visible [1][2]</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.  It's too far.  When thinking of the solar system, our galaxy, and the universe, our own moon seems  really close - and it is, in comparison to those things.  But space is really, really big, and even the closest things are vast distances away.  </p>
<p>The biggest earth based telescopes can't resolve even the Apollo landers, much less the flags.  Neither can the Hubble.  <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/08/12/moon-hoax-why-not-use-telescopes-to-look-at-the-landers/#.WM095qJOmDI" target="_blank">Here's</a> an article from almost a decade ago, explaining why in detail.  </p>
<p>Since then, NASA has redirected lunar orbiters (much closer) for <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/lunar-reconnaissance-orbiter-looks-at-apollo-12-surveyor-3-landing-sites/" target="_blank">photos</a>, but they still are barely close enough to make out the biggest things at the landing sites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The entire landing site is a few meters across (say 10) at ~380,000 km. Jupiter is 70 000 km at 588 million km.</p>
<p>0.01 / 380 000= 0.0000000263157895</p>
<p>69 911 / 588 000 000= 0.00011889625</p>
<p>By comparison, Jupiter is 10000 times larger in your telescope, and it only looks like a distant blur or, if you are lucky, like a tiny blob with some orbiting blobs.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to see the ENTIRE landing site is 10 000 more demanding. Plus the flag stands up straight, so it is effectively a few centimeters across.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
