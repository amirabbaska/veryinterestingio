		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Norway has quite a significant amount of its land within the Arctic circle - they have abundant snow and ice for much of the year in many parts of the country. Norwegians are more likely to get into winter sports because they've got the weather for it.</p>
<p>Denmark is further south, has a similar latitude to the UK and the climate is pretty similar too. When snow falls in Denmark, it doesn't tend to lie around for very long. It doesn't tend to get <em>really</em> cold there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And so har we’ve had 1 day with more than 1 cm of snow this winter. Very different conditions than our northern neighbours who are practically borne on skis :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dane here.</p>
<p>We're a small, totally flat country (one of highest points is 150m and we call that &quot;Sky Mountain&quot;) whose countryside is almost exclusively used for agriculture. And we rarely get the kinds of snowfalls that are needed for skiing.</p>
<p>In short, we neither have elevation, the physical space or the weather. Our Olympic athletes train in Sweden and Norway.</p>
<p>We also only have 25 regulation sized hockey rinks in the entire country, which makes it a small miracle that we're even moderately okay at Hockey. I believe Canada has 8000.</p>
<p>EDIT: Previously said 5 rinks, instead of 25. Typo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Norway, we ski to work or school during the winter season. In Denmark, they use a bicycle. </p>
<p>This is because Norway is both cold and mountainous, whilst Denmark is flat and Sandi Toksvig. As a Norwegian, I've had heatstrokes in Denmark, and gotten lost because there are no mountains in the horizon to orient by. In Norway, if you want to get to the &quot;Pizza place by the harbor&quot;, you just go downhill. This encourages skiing as a convenient mode of transportation, much as biking is convenient on the flats of Denmark.</p>
<p>Once Norway started having success in the winter Olympics due to the natural inclination towards skiing, a culture grew out of it. It was now a Norwegian <em>thing</em> to encourage, cheer, and take pride in our performance in the winter Olympics. We started giving television coverage to athletes practicing, we started advertising the lifestyle. It became lucrative to be the next Dæhlie or Bjørgen.</p>
<p>And with the country pushing forward the athletes who had already been skiing since childhood, beating airsick lowlanders like our otherwise-rivals Sweden and Denmark became an easily reached point of pride.</p>
<p>EDIT: There's also the fact that there are many winter disciplines you literally cannot train for in Denmark. You cannot do ski jumping or slalom without leaving the country. While you could do Telemarking (Telemark being a Norwegian county) you'd be limited in the Olympics even if you did develop a Danish ski culture.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Since there are memes flowing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acNnq8pwbC4&t=5m50s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acNnq8pwbC4&t=5m50s</a> is somewhat exaggerated, but it's based on local memes which were again based on old traditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Norway we not only have an abundance of snow inland during the winter, we also have a topography that is very much suited for a broad spectrum of winter sports. We have pretty much the opportunity to do whatever snow related that we want. Skiing, downhill, snowboards, ski jumping, and so forth.</p>
<p>Naturally, this stimulates a thriving winter culture. We indeed talk a lot about skiing and winter activities. I personally don't care all that much for skiing anymore, but when I was younger I was out during the winter a lot either playing, skiing, on snowboard, grilling on campfires, staying at mountain cabins, and such. Many of us grow up accustomed to the snow and the culture surrounding it.</p>
<p>Denmark on the other hand is small, without mountains, and don't have the same amount of snow in the winter. The just have a completely different base for snow. Maybe if they moved half their population over to Greenland they could reap their golds ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
