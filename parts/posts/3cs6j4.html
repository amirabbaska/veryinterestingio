Still, biologically it makes sense that if a bird lived long enough, it would be unable to continue producing eggs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other posters have mentioned, they do have a limited number, but they tend to slow down by around 3 years, so it's not common for them to completely run out.  They start laying around 6 months, give or take, and will lay almost an egg a day for the first year after that.  Then they begin to taper off, and after they're about three they can be down to one to two eggs a week, at which point they're no longer economical to keep around for eggs.</p>
<p>I have about 18 that are just under 3 years old, and which are giving me about 8-10 eggs a day total, plus 7 birds a year older than that who give me at most 2 eggs a week between them.  The same batch of birds a year ago were still producing 12-15 eggs a day.</p>
<p>The older 7 are desperately overdue for the stew pot, but I'm working too much right now.  Essentially they're eating at least 1/3 of the feed (that bunch are actually always at the feeder), but are only producing about 3% of the eggs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yes, there are a limited number of eggs a chicken could potentially produce. The reality is that the chicken will die before it even comes close to producing all of its eggs, even in a natural setting. In factory farming, their lifespan is significantly shorter, due to consumers demand of cheap, quality eggs. (Younger birds produce desirable eggs more efficiently)</p>
<p>Chickens are considered lay hens at 19 weeks of age, and in a factory farm setting, lay for approximately 1 year before being replaced by new lay hens. In that one year span, a white Lohmann layer hen will produce roughly 320 eggs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
