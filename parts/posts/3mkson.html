		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was reading this comment threat about the upcoming Martian announcement. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3mjrdt/nasa_to_confirm_active_briny_water_flows_on_mars/cvfq50q" target="_blank">This comment</a> got me wondering.</p>
<p>If you were in a decompression chamber and gradually decompressed (to avoid the bends), could you walk out onto the Martian surface with just an oxygen tank, provided that the surface was experiencing those balmy summer temperatures mentioned in the comment?</p>
<p>I read The Martian recently, and I was thinking this possibility could have changed the whole book.</p>
<p>Edit: Posted my question and went off to work for the night. Thank you so much for your incredibly well considered responses, which are far more considered than my original question was! The crux of most responses involved the pressure/temperature problems with water and other essential biochemicals, so I thought I'd dump <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/725px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">this handy graphic</a> for context.</p></div></div>
