		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a battery test engineer. There are many ways lithium batteries can degrade, but since this is ELI5, I'll stick to one main method. </p>
<p>Batteries have a few main parts: the anode (negative), the cathode (positive), a separator between them, and some stuff in between (usually a liquid) that conducts ions. When you charge a battery, you are cramming a whole bunch of lithium ions into the anode, kind of like absorbing water into a sponge. When you use the battery, these ions flow to the cathode, generating electric current. Over time, by cramming the ions in and out of the anode and cathode, you begin to damage the 'sponge', so it can't hold as many ions any more. So your efficiency goes down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most traditional batteries have an anode and a cathode. The anode and cathode material is pasted or painted on a current collector. Lithium cobalt oxide is a popular cathode material and carbon/graphite is a popular anode material. Lithium ions are the positively charged particles that intercalate (move) from the anode to the cathode during discharge and from the cathode to the anode during charge. Charge has to be maintained, so electrons flow from current collector to current collector to balance the movement of lithium, resulting in electricity/current flow. During this cycling, some of the lithium ions irreversibly react with other species in the battery and are no longer available to move back and forth between the anode and cathode. This is what causes a loss in capacity. These side reactions can vary, but generally involve lithium moving from an ion in the liquid phase to its solid state or the development of dendrites. A secondary method that can cause capacity loss is the breaking of electrical contact between the anode or cathode material and their respective current collectors because there are some stresses associated with the lithium movement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You already know that batteries are a chemical process. It reacts one way to generate electricity which we use to power your devices. When you run electricity into it, it reverses the chemical process so that it can react another day. But nothing ever happens <em>perfectly</em>. Something's gotta give. In our case, the electrodes get slowly eaten away in the process and eventually the performance falls below what we find acceptable for running our devices and we get a brand new one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pinging /u/Mooch315, aka BatteryMooch of /r/electronic_cigarette fame. This question is right up his alley. He is an EE, with extensive knowledge of Lithium Ion batteries, both from designing and manufacturing bespoke electronic devices utilizing Li-Ion batterypacks, as well as from testing Lithium Ion cells used in E-cigs, to insure the safety of the vaping community.</p>
<p>He has forgotten more about Lithium Ion cells, than most ever have learned, yet still knows more about them than most. To boot, he is both a gentleman and a scholar, and thereâ€™s damn few left of them. He can explain things so everybody, including me (and there are a lot of five year olds way smarter than me), can understand it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
