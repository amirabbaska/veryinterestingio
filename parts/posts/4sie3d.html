		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok Mr. Five year old, get ready for a crash course in advance astrophysics.</p>
<p>First you have to know that space isn't a non-existent thing but a thing in itself. We call it space-time. So when something rests on space-time it distorts. Imagine a bed sheet. If i stretch it out and put a bowling ball on it the bed sheet warps under the weight of the ball. This is how space-time works, but it isn't like a bed sheet, its existence is in more than 3 dimensions so  the human mind can't conceive of the true shape of space-time. So the objects will distort space and cause it to have bumps and grooves all over the place. The more massive the object the more massive the bump or depression. A black hole is an object that is soooooooooooooo heavy that the bottom of the dip is infinitely deep, so it takes the relative description of a hole.</p>
<p>Now lets talk about light. Light travels at the universal constant. That constant is how fast two points can &quot;talk&quot; to each other. Light wont slow down or speed up from that constant, it always travels that distance at the same rate. Other things that travel that fast would be gravitational waves, and any other mass-less object. Light also travels along space, so it moves with the bumps and hills in space-time. </p>
<p>Now gravity! So when an object comes close to another object in space. The object approaches it travels in a straight line until it reaches the next objects space-time distortion. So imagine rolling a marble past the bowling ball. The marble always travels straight. When it hits the depression of the bed sheet the marble &quot;turns.&quot; That turning comes from the distortion, the marble is still traveling straight but the bed sheet is turning underneath it causing the marble to turn. The marble will continue to orbit until it leaves the &quot;gravity well&quot; or until it hits the bowling ball. </p>
<p>Ok, now for time travel. Imagine to photons of light traveling towards a massive object. One will pass the gravity well on the side and the other will enter. The light has enough speed to go in and go out with with out too much problem, however it will still travel the same distance as the other light beam. So when the light beam leaves the gravity well it will still be in line with the other light beam. But light doesn't speed up! So in the gravity well time slowed down in order to allow the light to cover the same distance, because the universal constant must be preserved. What is being preserved is causality between the two edges of the gravity well.</p>
<p>So imagine you're running a race. Person A gets to run straight to the finish line. Person B must go down and up a ravine to get to the same point. You both run the same speed and you both get to the same finish line at the same time. We observe this with light all the time, so the only way both light beams get to the same place at the same time, time must travel slower in the ravine so that light can cover more distance with the same speed.</p>
<p>Black holes only magnify this effect because of the massive amount of distortion it puts onto space, so the amount of time dilation is noticeable to humans. Oh and speed messes with time as well. The closer to the speed of light you get, the slower time travels in order to make sure your ass doesn't pass the universal constant. So if you travel really fast along the outer edge of an event horizon time will dilate so much that thousands of years will go by in no time from your perspective.</p>
<p>Edit: OMG GOLD! I would like to thank that random guy, the academy, my wife, my boss who doesn't look to close at my computer screen,</p>
<p><em>music starts</em></p>
<p>And also my best friend Ree-Ree thank you!</p>
<p>Edit #2 several of you smart people have pointed out the flaws of my race example and don't worry I am not going to sit hear and say you're wrong. I see the error of my ways. The runner example is very poorly written and should be disregarded. I was trying to explain the concept of causality and the fixed distance it works in. The unwrap constant is what dictates causality. Mainly it is how fast an two points can transmit information, see each other etc. it is also how fast an observer of those two points can see the transmission between the two points. If you exceed this maximum speed limit the universe starts to break down as the laws start to not make sense, like the law of magnetism. So in order for these laws to function time slows down when the universe is stretched by gravity to maintain that constant. The universe doesn't &quot;will&quot; time to slow down, time slowing down is a property of the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think most of the answers here are addressing your question. Time dilation allows clocks to tick slow but not to reverse, which I assume is what you are asking about.</p>
<p><strong>The short answer:</strong></p>
<p>Inside a rotating black hole, our current theories of gravitation tell us that there is a region where not only does time go in a circle, it actually <em>has</em> to. This is only inside of the black hole, which is impossible to escape, so while it's technically time travel, it's confined to the inside of the black hole.</p>
<p><strong>The longer answer:</strong></p>
<p>The most intuitive way to think about general relativity is to say that gravity is basically &quot;falling space.&quot; Space-time curvature is true as well, but harder to visualize meaningfully. Essentially, the reason you are pulled toward the earth is because space is falling. An object falling toward the earth is not actually accelerating, it's just being dragged along by space as it falls toward the earth.</p>
<p>In a black hole, there is a region that is falling so fast that not even light can escape. This is called the event horizon. You would have to travel faster than the speed of light to escape. In relatively, traveling faster than the speed of light from one point of view is equivalent to traveling backward in time from another point of view.</p>
<p>In a rotating black hole, there is a second horizon called the cauchy horizon. Here space itself is swirling around the center of the black hole so rapidly that it's actually impossible not to travel around it. &quot;Standing still&quot; would require traveling backward in time.</p>
<p>And yet, because space is swirling in a circle around the black hole, you actually find yourself revisiting the same point over and over again. Since in relativity revisiting this point would require going backward in time, what's actually happening is that you're traveling through a circle in time. Each time you revisit the same point around the black hole, you are revisiting the same moment.</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that most physicists think time travel and closed timelike curves like this are actually impossible, and that a complete theory of quantum gravity will rule them out for good.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several hot wheels cars are being raced across the surface of a trampoline. This trampoline is a square, not a circle (so the race is fair). Each hot wheels car is pushed from one side of the trampoline to the other. Every car gets pushed at the same speed. Units aren't important, but I need to give a name to that speed for later, so let's say every hot wheels car is going speed 5.</p>
<p>Now put a bowling ball in the middle of the trampoline.
This illustrates the effect of gravity on space time (particularly time). The cars that are furthest away from the bowling ball will get from one end to the other fastest. The car closest to the middle takes the longest. Looking at the cars, it seems like the ones on the edge are going faster, but you know they are all going speed 5.</p>
<p>If you were a tiny man inside the car near the middle, you would look at your hot wheels speedometer and it would say 5, the whole time. Your friend told you he was also going 5, but he gets there before you. By the time you get to the end, your friend is long gone. To you, it seems like he cheated and pushed his car faster, but he really didn't.</p>
<p>In this case, your speed is like how we perceive time. From your point of view it is constant (&quot;one mississippi, two mississippi,...&quot; always the same). But due to the way the bowling ball changed the trampoline, compared to your friends, it was actually different. Black holes are like super heavy bowling balls on the trampoline of time. If you get near one everybody who is not near one will seem like they sped up, but really you are just taking a longer path.</p>
<p>edit: typos (probably going to notice a few)</p>
<p>edit 2: First Gold. Thank you very much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First it's important to realize that Black Holes aren't really holes, they're just an astronomical amount of stuff all compressed down to a relatively small size. But with all that stuff in such a small area of space comes a lot of gravity. Gravity does not just affect 3-dimensional space such as an object or a person, but also the 4th dimension of time. The more gravity that affects an object, the slower time moves for it (and the faster time moves around it from it's point of view). So black holes can be used for time travel in a sense that you're pressing the fast-forward button on the rest of the universe around you and when you get to the part of the movie you want to watch you can just move away from the black hole and continue.</p>
<p>The drawback here is that it only works as a fast-forward and cannot (to our current knowledge) be used to go backwards. It's not exactly time travel, it's more like stasis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are already currently time-traveling, at a rate of about 1 second per second. For every second that passes &quot;in the rest of the world&quot; (for lack of a better reference frame), you also age by one second.</p>
<p>Near a black hole, your time-traveling speed will increase. First to 2 seconds per second. That means that for every second you experience, the &quot;rest of the world&quot; will experience two seconds. You are now moving at half the speed of the world. Eventually your rate will reach 10 seconds per second, then an hour per second, then a year per second.</p>
<p>Near the event horizon, you could spend a minute there and when you come out, find that the rest of the world has aged by many years, decades, or even millennia. You have now successfully time-traveled into the future.</p>
<p>Gravity makes the time-traveling rate go up. We do not know how to make it go down, or negative. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
