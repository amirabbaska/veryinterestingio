		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly by observing the change in barometric pressure of a passing storm from multiple locations along with witnesses and damage when and if it came ashore. All ships carry a barometer and depending on off it is falling and the direction of the wind you can tell which quadrant you were in and which direction the storm was heading. Also with no radars ships would not have advance warning so there were more instances of ships being caught in and around storms thus more reports of pressures. It was a very imperfect science and lots of people died. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there's an amazing book called Isaac's Storm that is about the Galveston TX hurricane in the 1800s. It tells all about early weather forecasters  and how they plotted and tracked storms.  Great read, the book says that after that hurricane tore through the US and traveled back across the Atlantic, it still had enough force to knock a stone off of Stonehenge!! I've tried to verify the Stonehenge story on Google but have only found vague references but it still sounds cool.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add onto what other folks have said, we can also reconstruct/detect pre-modern storms via coastal sediment cores. Looking at the stratigraphy in certain regions, you can see where there was rapid deposition of coastal sediments due to storm surge. Although the relative uncertainty is high, there has been a large effort to reconstruct North American hurricanes over the past few thousand years to get a better understanding of &quot;baseline&quot;/pre-industrial hurricane conditions in the northern Atlantic Ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it came down to the theory and publications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Fontaine_Maury" target="_blank">Matthew Fontaine Maury</a>.  By the mid-1850s, three-quarters of the world's shipping fleets were sending their bathymetric and weather records to Maury, who in turn was analyzing and sending out his results around the world.  Maury was like the data-server of 1800s weather. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
