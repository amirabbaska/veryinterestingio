<p>Asphalt is one of the most easily and widely recycled construction materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I can't remember what it's called but it's a good cheap alternative to gravel for things like paving your driveway, and it works pretty well since it packs together a little over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a DOT in their maintenance side. Most paving jobs consisted of some kind of removal of asphalt (although not all jobs). Each job had a contract and the contract would state what happened to the asphalt millings. Usually the DOT tried to keep them, but sometimes they were given back to the contractor. The term we used was RAC (recycled asphalt concrete) or RAP (recycled asphalt product)</p>
<p>If we kept the millings, we would use it as material, similar to how we would use cold-mix asphalt or gravel. Sometimes we would spread it on old roads that badly needed repaving (but were never going to be repaved for various reasons) or use it to build up eroded sections of road. Some of the other areas had machines that would reheat the RAC to a temperature that melted the asphalt binder (the sticky black tar) and then they could use it to patch potholes. It was probably the ideal choice for RAC however the machines were expensive.</p>
<p>If the contractor got the RAC, they took it to their yard to use on other jobs. I believe a certain percentage of recycled asphalt can be used when making new asphalt, but there may be stipulations in paving contracts saying whether or not it's allowed. </p>
<p>Some jobs reuse the RAC right on site using this train of machinery. Here's a website that explains it. It's pretty neat. <a href="http://m.millergroup.ca/paving_construction/pavement_recycling/cold_recycling/index.html" target="_blank">http://m.millergroup.ca/paving_construction/pavement_recycling/cold_recycling/index.html</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a US Military Engineer who specializes in pavements, primary for use in airfield surfaces.  When Asphalt is milled it turns into small chunks, typically less than 3/4'.  We use these asphalt millings as aggregate in new construction or as an improvised roadway.  </p>
<p>Laying down millings and then rolling it makes an extremely dense and well compacted roadway that can handle pretty large amounts of weight, given that the base course and the sub-grade are up to par.</p>
<p>But yes Asphalt has many many uses that aren't in a landfill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asphalt plant supervisor from Canada here.</p>
<p>We purchase the asphalt from companies that are repaving the roads. We then have it crushed down to a usable size (1/2&quot;). Then when we are producing new asphalt we put in a small amount of this recycled asphalt product (RAP). We are only allowed to put up to 20% RAP back into our mix, due to concerns that the tar (the glue) has lost some of its original characteristics. </p>
<p>RAP is a valuable commodity in our industry, as putting it in our new mix, allows us to use less new tar. Which is extremely expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
