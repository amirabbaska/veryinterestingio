If the volume of the universe is increasing, then what is outside of it? Where can the edges of the universe go if there is nothing on the other side? Also isn't space just nothing? How can nothing expand? And if there's nothing on the other side of space then how do we differentiate that nothing from the nothing that is our space? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Expanding&quot; here means &quot;distances within the universe get larger as time goes by&quot;. </p>
<p>So if we see a galaxy 1 billion light-years away, one day it will be 2 billion light-years away, not because either of us are &quot;moving&quot;, but because &quot;space itself is expanding&quot;. </p>
<p>In case this seems like arguing over semantics, not that nothing can move faster than the speed of light, but it <em>is</em> possible for things to be so far away from each other that as space expands, distances increase faster than the speed of light. </p>
<p>Imagine ants walking along an elastic band. The fastest form of communication they have is the &quot;ant telegram&quot;, a kind of vibration in the elastic, which travels at 1 m/s. </p>
<p>The elastic band is very long, and you and I are stretching it very quickly - distances double every second.</p>
<p>If there are two ants a centimetre apart, ant A might send a message to ant B. The message takes sabout 0.01 seconds to arrive. </p>
<p>If the ants were half a metre apart, the message would take a <em>bit more</em> than half a second, since the elastic band stretches as the message travels, and the message actually needs to cover more than half a metre of distance. </p>
<p>If the ants were 2 metres apart, they could never send a message to each other - the distance between them is growing faster than the speed of &quot;ant telegrams&quot;, and the message A sends gets further and further away from B, <em>despite the fact that it's travelling towards B</em>. A is not part of B's &quot;observable universe&quot;. </p>
<p>We also are not part of their observable universe. The ants don't know we are the ones stretchign the elastic, in fact they don't know why it's stretching. In fact, their current simplest model is that the elastic band is infinitely long, and there are no ends for strange bipedal humanoids to hold onto and pull. Being infinitely long, the elastic band isn't getting &quot;bigger&quot; (in the sense of occupying more &quot;space&quot;), but it is &quot;expanding&quot; (in the sense that distances between things increase). </p>
<p>Edit: a few people said I didn't really answer the question. So I'll just repeat: &quot;expanding&quot; here means &quot;distances are increasing&quot;, not &quot;occupying more of .. something&quot;</p>
<p>If the universe is infinite, it's size doesn't change as it expands. Even if it's finite, there doesn't have to be anything &quot;off the edge&quot; for it to expand into.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there is an edge to the <strong>observable</strong> universe but theoretically no edge to the <em>actual</em> collection of all matter in the universe.  This happens because we have a limited radius of how far we can look. due to the bothersome slowness of the speed of light, we can only look back in time so far. that literally limits our view to a bubble called the observable universe.  that is in <em>no way a border of sorts</em> to the &quot;actual&quot; universe. but it might as well be a border because causality itself can never pass that distance, due to that distance moving away faster than the speed of light.  so as far as we are concerned, if there <em>was, or, was not</em> any more universe beyond that distance, it would literally make no difference to us. its like an inside-out event horizon of a black hole. we are inside a bubble and the edge of observability is another event horizon</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something can be infinite AND growing in size, and as far as we know that's the case of our universe.</p>
<p>Consider labeling every point in space with a coordinate, (x,y,z).  The statement &quot;the universe is infinite&quot; means that there is no (x,y,z) coordinate you could come up with that isn't in the universe.</p>
<p>Then also imagine our universe has a &quot;rule for distance&quot; BETWEEN two points, (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2).  An example of such a rule, though it is not the only possible rule, is your basic Pythagorus theorem:</p>
<p>distance rule #1 = sqrt(  (x2-x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2 )</p>
<p>Now imagine the rule changed over time, and instead it became</p>
<p>distance rule #2 = 2 x sqrt(  (x2-x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2 ) = 2 x ( distance rule #1 )</p>
<p>In such a case ANY and ALL two points you could think of are now twice as far apart.  Since all points are farther away, the entire space of points is LARGER.</p>
<p>So, as far as we know the universe is infinite and has ALWAYS been infinite and yet it is expanding.  You see now that these are not contradicting statements.  Even after a tiniest fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a second after the Big Bang the universe was infinite, and there was no (x,y,z) coordinate you could dream up that was a point outside the universe.   And for any distance you could dream up, like say a trillion, trillion lightyears distance, you could always find two points that were that far apart in the universe.   It truly was infinite.</p>
<p>However, over time the rule for distance has been changing, it has been scaling up by a factor unimaginatively called &quot;the scale factor&quot;, a(t) (&quot;a&quot;, which is a function of time).  Thus, any TWO points now, (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) that you can dream up now are farther away from each other than they were after the Big Bang.  And thus points that USED to be relatively close are now a lot farther apart and that is something that has happened to all points.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe isn't &quot;contained within&quot; anything, as humans would visualize it. The universe is <em>all that exists</em> so you cannot be &quot;outside&quot; of it, like we think of being outside of a house.</p>
<p>We evolved to deal with things in our immediate three-dimensional world; we literally lack the biological capacity to comprehend the true nature of the universe. </p>
<p>&quot;Outside the universe&quot; is a concept we simply can't grasp. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don’t think of it as a balloon with edges. The universe doesn’t seem to resemble one.</p>
<p>Here’s the starting point that helped me: the Big Bang wasn’t a tiny dot that exploded outwards into empty space. The Big Bang happened <em>everywhere you look</em>. More <em>space</em> happened.</p>
<p>It still is happening, but faster now. The space between points is increasing more and more. That doesn’t mean the universe has edges that are expanding outwards into a vast Something or Nothing. The universe seems to be boundless, homogenous, infinite.</p>
<p>As counterintuitive as it is, think of it as more and more space rather than a larger and larger size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
