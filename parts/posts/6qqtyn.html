		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like a lot of answers here explain the how instead of the why. I'll give the why a shot. </p>
<p>Well, &quot;protecting us&quot; is a story we tell ourselves. Our body doesn't <strong>really</strong> try to protect us, it doesn't have a mind of its own, it doesn't have goals nor make decisions. It's just so happens that the body acts in a certain way, and through natural selection it just so happens that people whose bodies act this way have a higher likelihood of survival. </p>
<p>So we call this &quot;protecting us&quot; because it's a simple and useful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism" target="_blank">anthropomorphism</a>.</p>
<p>It's like the cells of our skulls. They don't individually think &quot;I'm going to be a strong bone cell and hey everyone let's be strong bone cells together and protect the most important organ in our host: the brain.&quot; No. Even if we want to anthropomorphise each cell they'd be like &quot;hey man what do you expect I'm a bone cell, this is the way we are.&quot;</p>
<p>It just so happens that thick skulls protect the brain and creatures who have hard skulls survive better. </p>
<p>TL;DR immune system reactions are automatic reactions without deliberation and purpose. Even though they do have a net positive effect for our wellbeing, sometimes the automation screws up and fucks us up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An allergic reaction is by definition an overreaction, a defensive manoeuvre on your body's behalf against a perceived threat. Allergies are already a malfunction in your immune reaction, so it goes without saying that it's beyond your body &quot;deciding&quot; to overreact.</p>
<p>Such a shock, such as anaphylaxis, is caused by the sudden release of chemical substances, including histamine, from cells in the blood and tissues where they are stored. The release is triggered by the interaction between an allergic antibody called Immunoglobulin E (IgE) and the substance (allergen) causing the anaphylactic reaction. This mechanism is so sensitive that minute quantities of the allergen can cause a reaction. The released chemicals act on blood vessels to cause swelling. In people with asthma, the effect is mainly on the lungs. There may also be a fall in blood pressure.</p>

<p>The human form is bewilderingly fragile in some circumstances. But it's seldom, if ever, biologically suicidal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to add that autoimmune diseases have become dramatically more common in the 20th and 21st centuries than they ever were before. They're not just being diagnosed more--they're genuinely more common. No one is exactly sure why. But it's being investigated. Some thing it's due to the relative cleanliness we live in today, so we're not exposed to lots of dirt so there's less for the immune system to do. Another idea is that we used to be invested with parasites to a much greater degree, and parasites give the immune system more to do. Now, immune systems have much less to do and become overly sensitized. Also, some parasites release substances that weaken the immune system--it makes it easier for the parasites to live that way. So our immune system is actually stronger without parasites, and over-reacts as a result. In Japan, intestinal parasites were almost universal before World War II. After the war, efforts to treat parasites resulted in them being rather rare. And in that context, autoimmune conditions like allergies became vastly more common. so there's an inverse correlation between parasites and allergies in Japan. Correlation does not equal causation, but it presents an intriguing picture that needs further examination. In this context, we can see that humans are living in a situation that is pretty new and we didn't evolve in. So there has been no natural selection to favor people who don't have deadly allergies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, death from allergies are rare and the result of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is the &quot;erroneous&quot; or at least &quot;over&quot;-reaction, if you will, to a perceived threat. </p>
<p>The body wants to fight this (perceived) problem so badly that it opens up your blood vessels as much as it can (to get white blood cells there quickly, for example). </p>
<p>But that's a problem if you do it everywhere in your body. If all of your blood vessels open up simultaneously (causing hives, swelling, throat closure, etc) you can either die from asphyxiation or from very very low blood pressure. </p>
<p>Epinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor and counteracts the extreme vasodilation that happens with anaphylaxis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your body is not killing itself necessarily just trying to kill the substance and doing so has a LOT of collateral damage</p>
