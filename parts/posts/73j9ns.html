		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many large male bears will murder the cubs of other females to make her sexually active sooner and have less competition for their kin. It's hard to classify &quot;fun&quot; because humans will slap a reason on it. Perhaps some animals do but we usually label it territorial, self preservation, mating reasons, or preserving it's gene pool. Chimps are known to bully which sometimes ends in death or murder but it's also a hierarchy thing so to say it's for fun is nearly impossible when it's a part of the social construct.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be far more interesting to see science try to explain what “fun” is. It sounds like fun means lighthearted joy without a purpose but I think fun does serve a purpose. Also: we don’t know that serial killers are having fun. Some are quite tormented and/or delusional. Or, in the case of sociopaths, indifferent. The Columbine killers seemed to be having fun but they were also seriously angry/depressed so maybe it was just for show. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This wasn't same species killing, but may be of interest. The Tsavo Maneaters were a pair of lions that would kill railroad workers without the motivation of hunger. They were known to kill the workers seemingly just to kill them or &quot;for fun&quot;. They were clever and strategic hunters. The movie 'The Ghost in the Darkness' is an excellent watch if you're interested.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals do have 'mental disorders', which can make them relatively more aggressive or less empathic towards others in comparison to other animals of the same species. So they are probably more likely to kill another animal without a cause that we humans find reasonable. But even with humans, there is always an explanation for the behavior of serial killers etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
