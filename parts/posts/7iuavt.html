<p>Since humans hunt for sport besides for food, so there must be some other apex predator so advanced that it doesn't need to hunt for food all the time and can actually hunt for sport.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radiolab had a podcast episode about this (“zoos”).  Big cat predators in zoos are well fed, but they are bored and show low brain activity while in captivity.  </p>
<p>A squirrel got into a cage and a panther spent hours chasing it and hunting it - like housecats, their brains are set up to be stimulated by hunting and chasing, even if full.</p>
<p>In some zoos in China, they have experimented with giving lions live calves to chase and eat.  And it’s popular to have tourists buy a live chicken in the zoo to send down a tube chute so the big cats can chase and eat it. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>House Cats. Seriously. The common, everyday, run-of-the-mill House Cat. They don't kill things because they're hungry, they do it because it's fun. They're more vicious than any Big Cat on Earth. The <em>only</em> reason they're not considered as <em>dangerous</em>, is because they're so small.</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/science/that-cuddly-kitty-of-yours-is-a-killer.html?referer=https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">&quot;<em>The estimated kill rates are two to four times higher than mortality figures previously bandied about, and position the domestic cat as one of the single greatest human-linked threats to wildlife in the nation. More birds and mammals die at the mouths of cats, the report said, than from automobile strikes, pesticides and poisons, collisions with skyscrapers and windmills and other so-called anthropogenic causes.</em>&quot;</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Whether for sport or because their kill drive “stayed on” in relatively close proximity to prey animals after the first kill is unknown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Lions prey on elephant calves, and elephants understand that. Therefore, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7ann2dYn9iYC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=elephants+kill+lion+cubs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l08LB05frh&amp;sig=StRmIAaXVT7FUnXG6pda6ejz2n0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi27b-LloDYAhUOON8KHcndDGI4ChDoATAGegQIARAB#v=onepage&amp;q=elephants%20kill%20lion%20cubs&amp;f=false" target="_blank">elephants will carry out unprovoked (and provoked) attacks on lion cubs</a>. Presumably they understand that killing the cubs reduces future adults which will prey on their own young. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
