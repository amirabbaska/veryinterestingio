		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that salt doesn't do anything to the asphalt itself. But if and when the sodium ions make their way down to concrete base layer of a roadway our concrete deck of a bridge it can weaken it. If it comes in contact with reinforcement steel (rebar) it will create iron oxide (rust). The iron oxide has a larger volume and can cause the surrounding concert to pop off (spalling). Also, the salt spray can rust parts of your vehicle. Source: I'm a structural engineer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asphalt is more prone to expansion and contraction from summer heat and winter snow than concrete. The expansion/contraction cycles make small cracks and pits which make it more porous. Salt turns some of the ice in the winter to water, which seeps into the pores/cracks. When the ground gets below the freezing point of saltwater, the ice expands causing the road to deteriorate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that doesn't appear mentioned is the salt will wash off, and into soils. The driveway wont be affected unless a metal bridge mentioned elsewhere, but in soil it will/can damage/kill plants. So if growing anything nearby...</p>
<p>Likewise, I've lived near oceans, and that persistent sea spray carries some salt, rusts the hell out of unprotected cars. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
