		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These particular pictures look like the snails are working with a mucus layer, so I'd have to be able to see the whole tank to tell you what's happening for sure.</p>
<p>We'd see this a lot in Beta fish tanks. The Betas (a.k.a. &quot;fighting fish&quot;) are native to a flood plain that only really floods seaonally. So they &quot;fight&quot; for the depressions because most of the tiny divots can not support two fish for the dry season.</p>
<p>They also produce a thick slime/mucus that floats to the surface of their fist-sized dollop of water. This mucus layer slows evaporation and so increases the chance that their little blob of water will survive until the next rainy season.</p>
<p>This is why you can keep a beta in a literal cup (eight fluid ounces) of water for months at a time.</p>
<p>The mucus is quite thick and slimy.</p>
<p>The snails are very small, so they can stick to that mucus layer and crawl along it quite easily.</p>
<p>Now other fish have similar mutations for similar reasons so in a still water tank you'll get surface scum where various material joins with the water's &quot;surface tension&quot; to make a surprisingly strong layer of one composition or another.</p>
<p>It's not strong compared to your finger, but it's strong compared to the more-or-less neutrally buoyant snail's means of propulsion.</p>
<p>And even in clean water with virtually no scum the water's surface tension is pretty strong to start with, and the mucus from the snail's foot is going to let it create the needed thickness.</p>
<hr />
<p>Beneath all this is the question of &quot;what is surface tension&quot; in water.</p>
<p>If you look at an water molecule it's one Oxygen and two Hydrogen atoms. This forms a little &quot;V&quot; shape because the Oxygen atom is about eight times larger than the hydrogen. The Oxygen needs to &quot;borrow&quot; an electron from each of the Hydrogens so it gets very minus-ee, and the hydrogen's one electron each spends so much of it's time servicing the Oxygen atom's needs that the two hydrogens get very plus-ee.</p>
<p>Basically if you draw that &quot;V&quot; shape and put two little pluses, one on top of each horn of the &quot;V&quot; and put a big minus under the point at the bottom, you've done a decent job of making a &quot;charge map&quot; of the water molecule.</p>
<p>Now the plus-ee parts of any one &quot;V&quot; are going to be attracted to the minus-ee parts of another V. This is called the &quot;hydrogen bond&quot;. So if you made a bunch of these V, like if you printed a bunch of large &quot;V&quot;s and cut them out, you could make shapes by lining up the pluses and minuses.</p>
<p>It turns out that the water molecule shape is slightly wider spread than most Vs in fonts. In particular if you put six together plus-to-minus it would make a circle with six outward-pointing pluses. (This is why snowflakes are six-pointed if they are flat, more minuses stick to the six outward pointed pluses, and so on.</p>
<p>So in the full thickness of the water the V's are arranged in three dimensions. They are pointed in every conceivable direction.</p>
<p>But at the surface of the water they don't want to point their pluses up into the air. So at the surface they tend to form a &quot;mat&quot; Some of their pluses point down into the water, and the rest are horizontal.</p>
<p>So the surface of the water is a tightly laced arrangement of pluses stuck to minuses. This interlocked mat of molecules is so strong that it can hold up things. Heavy things like bugs (look up &quot;water strider&quot;) and sewing needles (a fun science experiment).</p>
<p>What's strong from above is strong from below.</p>
<p>Some things, like particular mucuses, can make this barrier extra strong and thick. While other things, like soaps (e.g. &quot;surfactants&quot; as in &quot;surface actors&quot; but in academic speak) can weaken and break this tension.</p>
<p>So the snails may be small enough to just use the surface tension...</p>
<p>Or they may be adding to the surface strength with their own snail slime.</p>
<p>Or something else, like a fish or decaying plant matter, may have already added some structural reinforcement to that surface tension.</p>
<p>TL;DR? Scum. Scum is strong. Scum is common. And snails are good at making and using scum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snails are honestly super fucking cool. Basically, they trap air in their shells and use that to float around. They can release a little at a time, or do it all at once. Mystery snails in particular are my favorite because they're known for &quot;parasnailing&quot;. Parasnailing is when they climb something tall within the tank (a plant, decor, or just the glass wall of said tank) and jump off, letting all of the air out of their shells. I had one snail that did basically nothing else with his day - every time I looked over, he was climbing the glass and jumping off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
