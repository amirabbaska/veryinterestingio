		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a lot of people recently talking about a kugleblitz Black hole. One that you could make without any mass.</p>
<p>The idea is that the problem with using mass to make a black hole is that mass doesn't like to be compressed and so if you want to make a black hole using gravity then you will need a lot of mass.</p>
<p>However we know that energy and mass are interchangeable (e=mc2) and some forms of energy don't have the same inhibitions about being compressed that mass does (you can shove multiple photons in the same place no problem). </p>
<p>The theory with the kugleblitz Black hole is that if you were to shove enough energy into the one place theoretically you could get general relativistic effects in that space from all the energy and if you do it right you get a (very very small) Black hole.</p>
<p>I'd imagine that there would be significant practical problems with trying to do this. The amount of energy required is staggering. Focusing that energy would be an nightmare and quantum stuff might mean that if you're going to attempt this you would need to try to make a black hole with an event Horizon big enough to overcome these effects. Bigger event Horizon = more energy required.</p>
<p>But nothing is quite as cool as building your own black hole! </p>
<p>Edit: caution: due to Hawking radiation small Black holes can be extremely hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Likewise if you shrunk a coin to the size of an atom you would also have a black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem here is that the most absolute minimum of mass required to form a black hole would also make it disappear instantly. This is because black holes emmit hawking radiation and slowly &quot;evaporate&quot; one particle at a time. If the black hole would have the absolutely minimal mass, the first particle to get ejected would also drop the mass below the point where a black hole can stay a black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know. We have very little understanding of how general relativity works at small scales. It might be the Planck mass or close to that, or there might be no minimum at all, or it could be something else. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
