		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't. A white flag is a sign of peaceful intention, usually a request for conversation. This may be the offering of terms of surrender or the allowance of wounded to be cleared from the field of battle etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the waving of a cloth has been used as an attention getter for a long time, because it draws the eye and isn't threatening. Next, white is an eye-catching color against most backgrounds. Next, conveniently, undyed cotton and wool are white, two very predominate clothing materials, and most everyone used to wear white undershirts. </p>
<p>So using a white shirt as a flag is a super convenient and widely accessible method of signaling for a talk. This is the same thing as American gangs like the crips and bloods using red and blue handkerchiefs for their gang symbols/colors. Very common items that are cheap and very versatile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;In europe white has long been indicative of purity or innocence (cite a source). This general 'mood' of a color would have made it a good fit for communicating good intentions.&quot;</p>
