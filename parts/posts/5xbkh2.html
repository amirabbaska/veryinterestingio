		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't switch just because a new president arrives. </p>
<p>Air Force One is piloted by Air Force pilots (typically O-6, O-5 or O-4 - very senior guys - it's a high profile gig) and each tour of duty (like the rest in the military) typically lasts 3-5 years, so they will naturally rotate out over time during a presidency and overlap with multiple Presidents depending on timing in their career.</p>
<p>edit: </p>
<p>Here's a great National Geographic Documentary on this and what goes into planning each mission: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKRQyDsKODE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKRQyDsKODE</a></p>
<p>edit2:
/u/since_ever_since mentioned that only full bird (O-6) colonel's could be Aircraft Commander of AF1. The other pilots/navigators could be lower ranks. It is a prestigious gig, so pilots are typically selected for it as a good deal tour of duty</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was 6 or so, I met the Air Force One pilot for George W Bush. The pilot gave me a box of peanut M&amp;Ms with the American seal on it and the president's personal signature on it in sharpie, next to the printed signature. I ripped it open, ate it and threw it away.
Apparently stuff with his actual signature is worth around $300 now. Drat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
